Ucantalas,"This kind of reminds me of a story from back when I was in high school... 

My family had gone out of town to a nearby city for a vacation. And there was... something on my foot. I don't recall exactly, but I *do* remember that the ""home remedy"" I was recommended was to cover it with duct tape. I think it was some kind of boil or wart or something 

So, for the first two days, I just threw a patch of duct tape over it. But it would come off as I was walking around. So, on the third day, I knew we were going to be out doing stuff all day, so before we left the hotel I wrapped my foot in duct tape. 

At first it was fine, no problems. Then I started to feel a little pain in my foot. I ignored it. Then I didn't feel the pain anymore, so I thought that was good. Then I realized I couldn't feel *anything* in my foot. We were in a mall, so I hobbled over to one of the washrooms and went into a stall, before taking off my shoe and sock and looking at my foot.

The whole thing was swollen, it looked kind of like what happens when you wrap rubber bands around a watermelon. The ends of my toes were a deep red, and I knew I was in deep trouble. Being a kid in a mall, I didn't have any kind of knife or blade to cut the duct tape off... so I started to pull.

Now, I don't know about you, but I have hair on the top of my feet. After I pulled the duct tape off, I didn't. It was exquisitely painful. 

I cannot imagine the pain of having to remove it from your entire midsection though. Its like an incredible kind of hell. ",null,2,ccfk4g6,1n4owv,tifu,new,5

The oil also helps reduce friction between your skin and shirt and you will be happy about that one. But best of all...

Since she is so open-maybe you should try to talk to her about it. Her behavior is affecting you- and she may not be aware that her mood is cycling/swinging since it sounds like she's newly diagnosed. If you feel like she is really manic (beyond a reasonable doubt) you may want to contact health services- or a counselor to help you confront her with the situation. Do you know if she has a counselor. These mental issues are no joke- and she can't really help parts of it. This doesn't mean she is any less human- we all have our shit- she's just new to dealing with it-and her talking in incessantly all day is a warning sign that her mood is swinging or unbalanced. ,null,1,cchflat,1ncmdr,tifu,new,11

Tend_to_agree,"I'm not going to offer up advice, nor am I going to pick apart your story.

I am however, going to tell you of my tale, similar to yours, in the hope that you find some comfort from someone who has been where you are right now.

When I was young, 17 to be precise, I had a steady girlfriend. I didn't care that she was a pathological liar, she was my first proper long term relationship. We were together for about 6 months before she fell pregnant.

Backing up a little, she had told me she was barren, I still told her to take the pill and I was always wearing a condom. How little it mattered because she wasn't barren, nor was she on the pill. I'm unsure exactly how she fell pregnant but she did. 

I thought my life was over, I didn't want kids, especially in my teenage years. I contemplated suicide more than a few times, accused my then partner of being unfaithful. There was no way I was ready to be a father.

The relationship fell apart before that could happen. We stayed together for the sake of the child but there was no love there anymore. My daughter was born in May the following year.

This is where it changed, when this little pink, disgusting thing was handed to me, covered in blood and white gooey stuff, wrapped in a blanket.. I will never forget it, I absorbed everything about that moment, the sounds, the smells.. The beautiful, gorgeous, amazing little thing in my arms was staring at me, right in the eyes. I felt something I didn't expect.

Pure, unadulterated happiness. I loved her from the moment I set eyes on her, and its still the same today, 12 years later.

You might feel like things are bad now, but trust me, becoming a father changes you in ways you wouldn't expect. 

You have two lives, one before you become a father, and one after.

Would I change anything that happened? **Hell no.**

EDIT: My daughters mother and I split less than a year after the birth. Things between us were resentful and hate filled for some time, but now we get along. We're quite close friends, although I hate her husband, mainly because he treats my daughter differently from his own kids (waits until I have my daughter stay with me to take his wife and kids on holidays abroad, my little girl has never been abroad with her so called family so I make sure she feels loved when she is here with me, my wife, son and stepson. I treat all my kids the same, the opposite of what *he* does). 

tl;dr: Similar experience, but happy about the outcome. Just because you might be a young father, does **not** mean your life is ruined. IMO, it enriches your life in ways you never thought possible.",null,14,cchsqnb,1ne4qt,tifu,new,52

Yuuichi_Trapspringer,"Not going to read through all the responses before typing this so if this has been said elsewhere, so be it.

If she indeed is pregnant, and she decides to carry the child to term and keep it, insist on a DNA test to determine paternity.   DO NOT TAKE HER WORD FOR IT THAT IT IS YOURS.  Especially when she had been pressuring you to have an open relationship before you dumped her.  She may have already started to have that open relationship before waiting for your permission/denial.  

If it is indeed yours, your life is not ruined.  Yes, it will be harder, But many many teenagers have been in your position in the past.  This may also be a really screwed up attempt of hers to guilt you back into a relationship with her.  There may in fact be no baby at all.  Hopefully if she is pregnant and decides to carry the fetus to term, she will decide to put it up for adoption so it can be cared for by parents who are ready for a child in their life, and not teenagers with no good income.  

When it comes to child support, insist on going through the courts to have the amount set, do not give her extra money expecting it to be deducted or you to be credited for it down the road.  Give her the exact amount the court decrees each time period and understand that any diapers, clothing, etc you give her are GIFTS and you will get no credit for that.  Also understand that if you have an impromptu agreement to give her x dollars each month in child support, and she later goes to the court to seek child support from you, you will more than likely get zero credit for the money you payed and probably will have a large amount of back child support to pay as well.  So Do everything the legal way and cover your ass financially.

---------------

If it comes down to it, remember she is the one that gets to decide if the pregnancy will go full term or not.  If she is indeed pregnant, you need to have a talk with her.  Make sure you tell her that you guys are through, there is no getting back together, and that a child will not make you a couple again.  Then ask her how she wants to handle the situation, do not suggest abortion, do not suggest adoption, unless she brings it up, and no matter what, do not suggest abortion to her.  Talk to her in a way that tells her you really don't want a child, and that for her life to be successful, she really doesn't want a child either.  If she asks you what you think you should do about the baby, suggest putting it up for adoption.  Frame the answer like ""Well, if you chose to put the child up for adoption, you could finish school and go to college easily""  Don't make the conversation about you.  Be supportive of her, but keep the fact that it may not be yours always in the back of your head, but do not confront her until after the paternity test to confirm it is yours is in your hand.  

And if she does keep the baby, it is yours, and you have to pay child support, your life still isn't over.  It won't be as easy, but you can still accomplish your goals while flipping burgers at McD's to pay your child support. ",null,2,cchv590,1ne4qt,tifu,new,10

If she is pregnant, you can make it.

The love of his life who he had started dating (he didn't know about the pregnancy for about 3 months) was banned from seeing him (her family were also from the same church) and members of his family wouldn't talk to him for a while. But he muddled through, found people to talk to and worked things out. The people that had begun to disown him grew greater respect for him than before when they saw how he stood by the girl who had lied to him. He didn't ruin his life but put it on hold when she or the baby needed him. One month ago he married the love of his life, his (now 4yo) son was one of the page boys and things are only improving for him.

dancesformoney,"Oh, come on OP, you're overreacting (it's understandable, though, you're 16 afterall).

First, I doubt any court will find your petty ""crime"" as bad as stealing a stranger's car. You'll just get in a bit of trouble for driving without a permit, but that's not that bad and I'm 100% positive that no jail will be involved.

About your ex-girlfriend, her period is late, and most of us males know how concerning this is, but think about it: she just OD'd on god knows what drug, was kept in a hospital and then in a mental institution for weeks. She's probably a wreck, physically and psychologically, and that may very well be the reason why she's late (also, 8 days isn't *that* late).
Even if you drew the short straw and she is indeed pregnant, there are plenty of solutions and your life isn't ruined. There's abortion, of course, plus you both have parents who can assist you.

I understand how distressed you must be, you're having to deal with a breakup, a possible pregnancy and having a criminal record at the same time, all that on top of being a teenager which is hard enough on its own. But try to think rationally and you'll see that although all of these are bad, none is life-wrecking or definitive, and after you had some time to think about it, you'll figure out what to do.

And trust me, I doubt your parents will think you're the worst kid ever. Even if they get mad, it's likely that they'll be there to support you, whatever happens. You didn't do anything innately wrong, you were just reckless and stupid, and that's a synonym for being 16.

Best of luck, try to stay calm and don't do anything harsh. You don't want to add more stupid deeds to your list right now.",null,1,cci5ny2,1ne4qt,tifu,new,3

BUT ANYWAY, don't beat yourself up over this.  Now, that being said, don't ever do it again...but don't dwell on the past.  Focusing on mistakes just makes you fuck up even more.  Trust me.  

What you need to do now is calm down and step back from the situation for a second.  Take a breather and try to get yourself sorted out.  

You need to approach this situation very carefully.  Think about your life and her life.  You're both very young and will need adult guidance throughout this situation, regardless of how grown up you believe you are.  Hell, even grown-ups need advice from their elders in situations like this.  

So, tell your parents and her parents (if you haven't already).  They'll be your best assets right now.  Or, if you don't trust your parents, confide in an adult that you do trust.  

Okay.  Last word, as an adult woman who has clinical depression and anxiety, my period is *always* irregular.  Don't go jumping to the conclusion that your girlfriend is pregnant yet.  Stress can cause periods to skip completely.  But, just to be safe, have her get a real pregnancy test.  Not the over-the-counter stuff, but actually go to a doctor and get it checked out.

I was sexually active in my teens (and not active enough IMO!) and I would always freak out if my period was 3 days late. Ok? My period was only off by a week, variable. One month 28 days, next one 35, then 32..it was NEVER steady. 

And when I was that age, emotions and hormones were driving my actions. My logic brain had some hold but not too much, really. I can kind of understand the impulse to drive to see her, the emotions and thoughts with the sex, the swirly brain (as someone else called it) you've got. 
THIS IS TEENAGE HORMONES IN A BLENDER. YOU ARE NORMAL FOR THIS TIME IN YOUR LIFE. It does NOT mean you did a smart thing, a ""right"" thing with her. It means that your hormones do a lot of your thinking. THIS HAPPENS TO ALL HUMANS. 

So, hugs from me. I care, and can totally understand this shit.

I was 14! and was scared of being pregnant. Yeah yeah, horny as fuck, shut up. I had a friend take me to Planned Parenthood for a test, because if I bought a test from a grocery store my parents would hear about it (military town). It was negative. 

You are here at this moment with this in front of you: car consequences. Possibility of pregnancy. 
What can you do at this moment? Stand up tall, and say, ""Ok, I really fucked up with the car, I will take my punishment and do it RIGHT"" (this here means self-control = pita in teens = you can still do it). That's done and decided.

You at this moment cannot do anything about the pregnancy. Yes, that sucks donkey balls. You have to wait, maybe 24, 48 hours for the information. Stand up tall, again, and say, ""Ok, self, we have to wait, and we're going to do something else til we know"". Really, that's what to do. Go organize the tupperware. Clean out the fridge. Go mow the lawn, wash the car and detail it (hehe). Keep your hands busy to keep your brain distracted. 
When you find this out, deal then.

When my mom was ready to take me to a hemorrhagic disease specialist, I finally had to own up to her about *why* exactly I was bleeding out my asshole.

I was a young lad of 18 or so.  Kept my head shaved and decided it was time to try taming the jungle of my crotch, so I grabbed the electric clippers and had at it.

At first I was afraid.  I was terrified.  This thing was buzzing in my hands; I didn't want to die.  Seriously, I started out by making low strafe runs on my crotch.  I then realized the main part of it could be shaved like my head, so I did that.  The saggy ballskin, though, got some more strafe runs.  I wasn't satisfied with how long the hairs still were, and how few I was getting in my paranoia, so the blades inched closer and closer...

Suddenly, it was like I got electrocuted.  Part of the folds of my ballsac slipped into the teeth of the trimmer, which cut out a little triangle of skin on my balls and started bleeding everywhere.  I put the thing away and jumped in the shower.

A few months ago it was a normal college Saturday with heavy amount of drinking and smoking with people who were over at my house for the weekend. After it all died down around 330am I was the only one left up and I was sitting watching tv finishing my last beer. I got up to piss and when I came back I felt seriously sleepy and really really drunk and reached for my almost finished beer to down then head up to bed but when I put it down I noticed something wrong. First off it was way too warm. Then it felt way to watery. I look down after a small swallow and some still in my mouth and realize that's not my beer. It's an old beer from much earlier in the night that my roommate who uses chewing tobacco was using as a spitter. I have never vomited so quickly and violently in my life all over myself and living room. It makes me nauseous just typing about it but god damn I know that feel buddy.

So, our friend pops in to ask to bum a beer. We were drinking the last 2 we had, so we told our friend we were all out. Well, she spied one of the cans by the door, and before we could stop her, she chugged the whole thing. Said it was OK, but warm and flat.

guj,"My first real job was at a certain roast-beef sandwich fast food restaurant.  One day after mopping the floors in the lobby, I took a big order and since it was slow I told the customers I would bring their food out to them.  You know, excellent customer service and all.

So with a tray full of delicious fresh french fries and sweet roast beef sandwiches in each hand, I cheerfully walked out to their table.  Cheerful until I hit the section of the lobby that I had just mopped, whereas I promptly slipped and fell directly on my ass.  French fries and roast beef all over the damn restaurant.

I looked like a fool, the poor customers were hungry, and I think one ended up with food in his lap.  And to top it all off, my ass hurt.  I then had the pleasure of remaking the entire order and trying again.  Not even a jamocha shake could drown out my shame.

Didn't get fired, didn't get in trouble, and in fact got promoted not long thereafter.

tl;dr I fell on my ass and threw roast beef on customers and got promoted.

V-Bomber,"OP, as someone who was a 3rd yr RA let me say a few things: 

1) Your first mistake was not going the whole hog. If you're going to bunk off to a party, don't then try to make it legit by asking your colleague to hold your phone. As you know, it gives them dirt on you.

2) If you're going off-campus on duty, whether to a shop or a party, take the phone with you. As long as you take steps to make sure you can hear it ring, you can always bail out of the party and run down the street a bit before picking it up. 

IMO: your best bet now is trying to make it a case of your word against theirs. Tell your boss that the other RA said they'd cover for you and not to worry about the paperwork. If you can't be reinstated, a revenge plan is totally ok. Be sure to post it to /r/ProRevenge or /r/PettyRevenge as appropriate.

This is bogus.  If you got another staff member to cover for you, what's really the problem here?  That you didn't follow the 48 hour rule to switch duty nights (and really, what the hell kind of rule is that and what purpose does it serve?). That doesn't seem like a fire-able offense.

It was a lapse in judgment and you shouldn't have done it, but I don't see how this is a job killer.  This is a ""teachable moment"" as your former boss might have said.

You made a mistake, but you got a raw deal.",null,1,cckoldo,1no4xr,tifu,new,5
bestwhit,"former RA here - I'm really sorry you got ratted out by one of your own, and even further that you didn't even at least enjoy the time at that party while you were there. I've heard of this type of tattling happening a few times when I was in college so you're not alone in that regard. It sucks, especially when it's someone you thought you could trust like that...

but... and I hate to say this, but can you really, honestly say you didn't realize you weren't supposed to go to parties while you're on duty/on call? I think that's basically like ""RA on duty 101"" right there - that you're to remain sober and act as a confronting (not documenting per se, but at least addressing) RA to any policy violations you see during that time as you proceed on your rounds. Going to a party as a guest is absolutely never allowed by the rules when you're on call/duty and of all RA rules about conduct, that seems like a fairly straightforward one.

Honestly OP it sounds a bit like you're trying to cover for your mistake by claiming ignorance about some of the rules, when I can't possibly see how a trained RA would ever think that it's appropriate to leave rounds to go to a party, let alone leave rounds at all and your other RA by themselves to do all the work. What probably really sealed your fate by this other RA was returning probably smelling like weed, which probably felt like having the party rubbed in their face. 

On the (seriously big) bright side though, you don't have to worry about those annoying RA responsibilities now and can live your social life as you wish (seriously this is huge). Also, if people find out that someone busted you like that, even in the RA community, it's looked down upon as a dick move, so definitely karma is coming to them. As well, no one should think any differently of you for being fired - shit happens a lot as RAs and they get fired more often than you realize so it's not a big deal in the grand scheme of things.

**tldr** how on Earth did you not realize that was against the rules; you're probably better off not being an RA anyways especially with people like that",null,5,ccknc4w,1no4xr,tifu,new,7

He said he was jacking it in his room when his mom busted in to show him something or other. There was no time to hide anything--although he claims he swiveled his computer monitor away in time--but he said he had his dick out, pants down, and she saw everything. Since there was no hiding what he was doing, he just told her, ""Mom, I'm masturbating!"" And she said, ""Ok, honey, I'm sorry,"" and left the room. Then he finished. 

Wouldn't be surprised if he finished thinking about her, though. He had a really creepy relationship with his mom. He casually told me once about how he often slept with his mom in her bed. I thought he meant when he was a kid, but he corrected me and said he still did it--his age? 20. The reason he was so unabashed and didn't think twice about mentioning it was because he thought it was normal behavior for sons to sleep with their moms. When I told him it was weird for a 20 year old man to crawl into bed with his mother, he told me I was overreacting and sheltered. Afterall, he never did it when she had a boyfriend over. Once we brought up what we were looking for in a partner, and just to see how he'd react, I said, ""You want someone just like your mom, I can tell."" He shrugged and said, ""Yeah, isn't what Freud said? Every guy secretly wants to fuck his mom? It's normal.""

Hm, well that got side-tracked. I guess memories came flooding back about how creepy this guy's self-proclaimed ""very close"" relationship with his mom was. At the very least, OP, you can read this and be glad you aren't him. Feel better.",null,2,cclemrg,1nq0j1,tifu,new,13

Hugh-Janus,"Having read the word, **'whilst'** twice in her first two lines, it became abundantly clear that OP is UK based. And per her responses, she is a 16 yo college student, whose parents are involved b/c she is a minor. If after reading her post, you still came to the brilliant conclusion that she is an adult American University student, then you should return to YouTube, LiveLeak or 4chan. 


So, now that we have that cleared up; I am genuinely appalled. The reddit assholes who are harassing OP for grammar or spelling slips are worthless cunts, who pride themselves upon hurting a child. I pray that you diapered, closeted, perpetual virgins (not by choice) are not Americans. If so, then as a fellow American, I am utterly ashamed.

Now, moving on to our resolution. I agree with much of the advice rendered here. A matter of fact explanation that the Tumbler site is comprised of user generated content should be sufficient in explaining away any 'explicit' images that were captured. 

I do have one major concern with this college's practices and/or policies. If the school has already taken steps to restricting your on-line access, such that Reddit is blocked, then it has established itself as the entity authorizing or denying access to these websites.

As such, why then, wasn't Tumblr blocked for inappropriate content by the school authorities? There is an abundance of sites solely dedicated to showcasing artistic imagery. If they authorized Tumblr for legitimate school work, then they are responsible for the consequences. The school's censorship is wholly inadequate in protecting/shielding its students, faculty and other members from improper material. 

The college controls the access and is to blame for any perceived breach of its notion of proper internet etiquette.",null,2,ccl2i9u,1nq6h0,tifu,new,8

There was no insult or condescension intended in my statement, merely me stating what I regarded as fact.  I have good working relationship with my co-worker, and she's usually very kind, extremely hard-working, and we have no problems.  But when she's on a tear, she's all sharp edges, and it can be hurtful to be around her.

My comment, then, was my TIFU.  No insult or harm intended to either my co-worker, pregnant women, or women anywhere, but I was unaware that you simply do not ever introduce the topic.

Neipsy,"Between my family and friends I'm notorious for sleep walking/talking. A few years ago there was one very early morning I woke up and started walking to the bathroom. I walked past my dads bedroom and he yelled out to me, 'hey, you alright Neipsy?' I didn't give a response and kept heaidng for the bathroom. I walked in closed the door and got undressed. He comes and knocks on the door and asks again if I'm okay. Yet again he's met with no response so he opens the door and sees my standing by the shower bare ass naked testing the water as I'm getting ready to jump in. By this stage he's realised I'm sleep walking and comes over to turn the shower off. 'Hey Neipsy, let's turn that shower off and go back to bed.' That's when I turned around and punched him in the ribs. Left a bruise the size of a kiwi fruit.

This is all from the perspective of my dad. I remember nothing happening but he had the bruise to prove it.

I shat on her leg when i was alseep.. 

 Lol ok, some more info.. The night it happened, my stomach was a bit fucked up, diarrhea and what not, so it was sleep time and we both went to bed.. Me, being the manly man that i am, was the little spoon that night and was facing away from her when at around 3am, I woke up and could kind of feel something wet behind me.

Now at 3am, half asleep, wet is a really hard to comprehend (at least for me), but for what felt like a few minutes I just laid there, still, wondering how something could possibly be wet. Thats when she woke up aswell, and she could feel it too..

She asked me if I could feel it and thats when she moved the blankets.. Just lifted them a little bit and then smack, she was hit right in the face with a hot waft of poo stink..
That's when the screaming started, she sounded like a bantha in heat, screaming as she jumped out of bed naked (oh yeah, we both slept naked), and ran to the bathroom to clean herself..

I, being the helpful boyfriend I was, proceeded to lay in the bed, shit water still smeared in my bum cheeks, and laugh maniacally for a few minutes while I regained my composure..

After those few hilarious minutes past I went to the bathroom, that's when I lost my shit again, figuratively, she was sitting on the ground in the shower, up against the wall rocking backwards and forwards, clearly my bumjuices had traumatized her..

It sounds like your boss screwed up by leaving the plane there and not telling you it was already taken care of. But, at the same time, you screwed up by not checking the paperwork before beginning the fueling process. Airports and the FAA love paperwork, and sometimes the guy who did something isn't there to tell you he already did that, or maybe the guy forgets to tell you, so you rely on the paperwork to tell you what everyone else already did.

Not sure if you'll lose your job over this, or just get a stern reprimand, possibly accompanied by some further training. I mean, you just started the job not long ago, and don't have a lot of experience. But, at the same time, airports are very anal about their equipment because they have to be.

&gt;

&gt;So here I am. My sister finally had a job after months of searching and I threw it away because I had to be an annoying fucking idiot. It's 1AM and I can't go to sleep because of all the guilt I have. I have no idea how to make it up to her because she tried so hard and nothing I have/can do could match a fucking job.

&gt;She knows I would never do it on purpose, but I can see how devastated she is and it makes my heart break to know I did this.
I'm feeling like shit, she feels worse which is making me feel like even more shit.

&gt;I'm such an idiot.

NextArtemis,"I know your pain, well actually, more of their pain. Story time:

When I was still in middle school, I was required to take a cooking class for a semester. As a final project, we baked cakes. I ended up doing most of the work for my group but we ended up with a rather nice looking cake. 

Then, the teacher decides it's better for us to eat another group's cake instead of the one we worked so hard on, because why not? Keeping an open mind, I think, what's the worst that could happen? 

That was a pretty big mistake. I bite into the regular looking cake and after chewing for a second, realize that the cake was disgusting. The group's cake I was tasting was severely under-baked, more sticky doughyness than cake. Doughy cake isn't that bad right? That wasn't the worst part though. It turns out that group couldn't read directions and used salt instead of sugar... twice. Worst of all, they added in **2 additional cups** of salt. I was ready to throw up after that. 

TL;DR: Salt cake=bad cake

Moral of the story, even though you screwed up cooking, it's not the end of the world, mistakes happen. Sure, I hated eating that cake but I forgave the cooks. They even passed that project. Don't worry about it, you'll pass.",null,5,ccp902h,1o6657,tifu,new,18

From what I've seen only the very first gen smartboards have ""optipro"" surfaces that while are not damaged by dry erase markers, don't like them too much. Even so, had it been such an obvious taboo, it;s likely that very few people had written on this surface with said markers and it is incredibly unlikely that a marker made of non permanent materials would cause any damage. 

the marker is specifically made to not in any way be permanent or cause any damage to writing surfaces. Even so, the surface is completely separate from the digital protection image, and the only thing that matters is the pressure applied to the board or the board itself.

Apparently nobody knew what it was at first, my grandfather, a very religious and serious man is holding it and squeezing it saying Vus is Dus (what is this) in Yiddish. Holy fuck, so embarrasing. Nobody mentioned it after that, but I've saved that voice mail for 3 years now. 

TLDR: dropped a condom with my schools name on it at a hasidic family reunion, and my grandfather found it not knowing what it was except that it was mine.

I have never been so shocked in my life to see her face again.  WHY THE HELL WAS SHE THERE THE NEXT DAY AFTER GETTING SHIT ON? 

I talked to her and apologized like no other.  I might have said sorry over 30 times you have no idea.  I explained what happened and she understood.  She was surprisingly nice about it. Although she said ""it was the worst thing that ever happened to me, even worse than when my brother died"" ..... But this part, I don't how this happened.  After apologizing like a fuckin mad man, I said I needed to make it up to her.  I offered to give her $100 because I just felt so terrible.  She declined.  I said I would never come back here again and I was going to cancel my membership.  I SWEAR ON MY LIFE THIS HAPPENED, I asked her for her number and offered to take her out to the most expensive restaurant in the city. I have no fuckin idea why I asked her this.  I just needed to make it up to her some how.  She gave me possibly the most confused and worried look a human as ever given me in my life. Something like this: http://173.201.234.95/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/confusedman1.bmp 

She asked me if I was mentally stable after I asked her that. And I swear she goes, ""this might be the stupidest yes I've ever given someone, but yes.  Yes I will go out to dinner with you.""

I practically shouted ""WHY?!?"".

She said, ""I don't know you just seem like an average dude, you are handsome, but we did have that incident yesterday.  But I know it wasn't your fault.  My therapist says I should say yes to more things, so this is what I'm doing.""

I got to first base, I got another date, she was awesome, she was very sweet.  This was the happiest first date of my life honestly.  I think me landing poop on this girl's face has made me a better person.  There was no awkward silence or anything of that nature at all.  We were talking as if we were already friends for many many years.  She has a lot of the same interests as me and we found out we live 20 blocks away from each other.  I am in a very good mood right now.  I haven't felt this good about anything in years. I feel like I'm falling for this girl and it's only been one date.  There's something about her, she has this smile thats like no other.  Her smile makes me smile.  She's not just some ordinary, boring girl.  She has stories, and she's not afraid to embarrass herself.  She even brought up that I shit on her.  She told me she's actually gotten peed on before which is also weird as fuck and ironic.  You ever see American Pie where he gets pissed on from the second story of the house?  That's exactly what happened to her.  The date went incredibly well.  I feel like if it wasn't for reddit I would not being going on a second date with her, so I thank you guys.  Right before I dropped her off from home, I swear to god it was like a movie.  ""Ya know I had a really great time, /u/rocksandshit, it was a pleasure to meet you and thanks for taking me out.  Can I see you again please?  And I replied, ""Yes, of course.""  I looked down for a second because I was smiling and blushing, she then ever so gently put her finger underneath my chin and raised my head up and before I know it her lips are touching mine.  It was some magical shit.  I just got off the phone with her and we plan on going out later this week!

I am a very happy man right now.

rispetti_le_donne,"1) DO NOT USE THE HDDs. TURN OFF DEFRAGMENTATION/INDEXING/ANY HDD-ACTIVITY SOFTWARES ON THE NEW HDD'S OS.
    
2) Buy spare drives, install a new OS on a new HDD, use data recovery programs* on the old HDDs (it takes hours, days if you've got more than 50 GB of data).
    
* For camera photos (holidays stuff) I used many programs and settled on Recuva (free) and RescuePro (not free...)(I remember trying the EASEUS one too), got something like more than 95% recovery rate for just-deleted data (n-1), 85% for n-2, 60% for n-3. So make sure to NOT write anything on the HDDs anymore: the data is still here, you need to be walking on eggshells now.    
(nb: it was on flash memory cards though, HDDs might give different results).
    
(!) There might be some more ""professional""/specific software out there, keep searching.
    
3) You'll have to go through thousands of recovered files, most often without their original names. Set up a sorting method (update it as you go, dunno what kind of files you had), and pour hours into it. It's gonna take time, but it needs to be done.
      
4) If you still can't get some specific files back, you'll have to call a data recovery service (quite expensive but not impossible to pay).    
What is really expensive is data recovery on damaged (hardware) HDDs because it requires extremely expensive cleanrooms, spare parts and very precise repairing done by highly qualified employees. Hopefully, that's not your case. Your problem is only software-based data recovery.
    
As soon as you can (right after you've got your first results of data recovery and can estimate how bad the situation is), contact the clients and make sure they're aware of a possible delay (and if you can, what kind of discount/extra work you'll do for them to compensate - you're a business, it's your job to negotiate everything), some might let you prioritize more urgent projects and minimize the business damages. They might get super angry now, it is MUCH better for them to learn it asap so they can postpone their plans as much as they can.

It may feel to her like you were just waiting for a free moment, or trying to slip something past her - especially with Jane having identified her intentions previously as just looking to play with another girl.  

Give it some time and try to have a calm and blameless conversation about miscommunication, intentions, and feelings.  Validate her, but also defend your position, and see if you can't both come around to accepting that it's really not a big deal, once the initial shock of expectation vs reality wears off.

EvanHarper,"&gt; a couple weeks ago the client had logged onto this computer to do something, and then had left his main account logged in

This makes no sense on multiple levels.

I'd like to tell you that you're OK because your client was clearly to blame for *leaving a financial trading account with tens of thousands of dollars in it lying around open*, but from the sounds of it the *both* of you have been acting very ill-advisedly (assuming this story isn't fake,) so your only hope of getting out of this without a lawsuit is to make nice with your client and hope they see it as a ""normal accident."" Good luck, I guess.

Edit: I'm glad it worked out. But take a lesson here: If your client hadn't been chill, then you could have been sued into the ground. Doesn't matter what the merits of the case were; if you didn't take the proper precautions up front, the lawyer fees and stress alone would be deadly, even if it was ultimately ruled in your favor.

Do you even *have* a lawyer? You need one badly. I'm guessing your contract with this client was very poorly drafted or else non-existent. This stuff *will* come back to haunt you, even without $20k fat-finger-fuckups. Sooner or later you'll get a crazy client who will ruin your life because they think you gave their cat a computer virus and sold their shitty VB6 line-of-business application to the CIA.

It was the late forties and they where heading down the highway to drop off a load a paper at a warehouse. when the grandfather says would you like to drive, and of course his fourteen year old grandson gladly obliges. Then he tells the boy that he will lay in the back for a quick 1/2 hour nap. the time passes by quickly and soon the buy is driving into town, and eventually he gets to the factory.

when he gets out and starts unloading the manager of said warehouse asks him where is grandfather was so he tells him he just laid down for a nap while he helped unload the trailer. This was no big deal and so when all was said and done he got back in the truck, from the passenger side and heads back the way they came from. when they were roughly back at the same area they were when his grandfather dozed off he had woken up. now though they were heading in the opposite direction and the sun was setting instead of rising. Of course the man became enraged because in the 1/2 hour he was asleep the boy was able to completely turn the truck around and start going in the wrong direction. when they finally got to the diner they had been at earlier that day and the waitress that worked nights was coming in he had asked her what time it was he she confirmed that it was infact the evening and not the morning.

ShotzInTheDark,"UPDATE 10/23/13 - I HAVE THE RING BACK!

I tried everything; E-mailed pawn shops in a 50 mile radius, filed a police report, went door to door with flyers, checked Ebay daily (33k+ freaking listings, EACH DAY for my generic searches), I scoured Craigslist - my wife put up an ad in Lost and Found, we contacted the Washington Post, a few social networking groups.. hell I even put it on Reddit. Everything, anything we could think of.

Someone found it.. About a block from my building, while they were standing in line for lunch from a hot dog cart. She contacted us, had seen our ""lost"" ad on Craigslist we described the ring, she sent a potato-phone cell phone picture, and we replied with one of our high-res ones. It was the ring! I met her this morning and she handed it to me. She didn't ask for money, but I threw $500 in an envelope with a note of huge thanks. The kicker in the whole thing; when we were on the phone trying ot figure out where to meet we discovered that we work for the same agency .. in the same building.. on the same floor .. for the same boss' boss. 

Remember how I said it was a tiny ring? When this woman found it, she thought it was costume type jewelry, or a little girls ring. She thought she'd probably sell it for a couple bucks. Then she gets it home and her husband cleans it off and says ""uhh, honey, I think this is REAL."" So she started looking to see if someone lost it - put up a ""found"" ad on CL, then saw our lost ad! 

Taking the ring in tonight for inspection to make sure everything's fine with the settings etc. It dropped into a grassy area surrounding a tree on the sidewalk, so I never heard it drop.

Every professor conducts his/her class differently. The syllabus is the Law/Bible/Quran and everything you need to know about the details of the class and most assignments are listed. If its noted in the syllabus, which should always the first thing you see when you enroll in a class, then you have no excuses. 

Similar thing happened to me where I completely failed a class because I missed all 3 homework assignments. Homework was a required part of passing the course, even though they were worth &gt;10% and I got an A on the final. Didn't matter. Read the syllabus.",null,5,cculxfq,1oqc88,tifu,new,24

You can follow the aforementioned advice (and perhaps get a bad reputation as a ""whiner"", even though you are not one) or suck it up and re-take the course. Both actions are not favorable. You almost have to get your professor on film, jerking off or something, if you want to get any real help against them from the administrators.  Anyone who reviews your grades will see that you have one, explainable zero, and you did very well overall. Another choice (the one I would take) would be to finish the course, and submit an appeal to the student/teacher board.

When my husband and I were flying home from visiting my dad a few years ago, my son (then ~9 months old) was in my lap. I was sitting in the aisle seat and nursing him. His head was resting on my arm, which was using the aisle armrest. A muffin-topped flight attendant came by, and when she did, a metal clip on her belt scratched the top of my son's head open. He started screaming, he had this semi-bloody scratch that you could see through his hair, and the woman (who *worked for the freaking airline*) told me that she couldn't help it that she needed to get through.

Lady, you didn't ask me to move and I wasn't watching the aisle. My elbow/his head weren't jutting out in the aisle; they were set on the armrest as a normal person would use it. I can't help that your pear shaped torso made it so that you had to turn slightly sideways to squeeze past me. Ask me, and I'll move. I was livid.

We never got an apology from the heavier attendant, but the other attendant who witnessed the situation came over to apologize, and apparently she told the pilot, because he came out while we were getting off the plane to apologize, too.

You apologized for an accident that wasn't your fault. You did everything you could to make amends for a mistake. If I were that parent, I'd forgive you easily. At least you didn't hit him in the face with your book.",null,25,ccunt6b,1oqlzi,tifu,new,155

Seriously, rush-hour before the weekend brings out the worst in people. I remember one time on the subway, I accidently hit my suitcase against the tip of a woman's pointy shoes when the train abruptly braked. I apologized but she just went ""tssk"" and gave me the stank-eye. So don't feel bad; you are not a bad person! Some people just don't recognize an accident when they see one, or they think the world is working against them. 

Another thing that may make you feel better: babies are not as weak as most people think! Don't take this the wrong way, but babies are quite resilient (especially infant bones).

The door pops open and her dad shouts back, ""Hey!""  She says she's just picking something up.  He just responds ""Ok"" and as he's closing the door, we both clearly hear her mom say ""Who the hell is it?""  Thankfully what she needed was only in the living room.

I had an IUD but it didn't work. I ended up getting pregnant. He flipped and wanted me to abort. I couldn't do it. Decided to have it without his support. Stopped talking for 9 months. As soon ad she was born he fell in love (with her). 2 months after she was born we decided to give it a shot. We fell in love, ourselves, and that was 5 years ago. He is my best friend and we have a lot of fun together.

Long story not so short, I was able to keep working while they submitted the case to corporate. After what was easily the longest 5 days I had ever endured, they called me to the managers office. They had me sit down and asked me to not ask any questions until they finished talking me. They read off an official email from HQ saying that based on the conflict of interest that they advised and supported the action of termination from employment. At this point my heart sank but the manager turned to me and kept talking and said that the ultimate decision was up to the  store. They had reviewed my performance as sales stats for the past few months and couldn't see any evidence that I had been blocking sales and stealing them for my personal side business. My supervisor also stepped up for me and told the store management that I was an excellent service salesman and a great technician and he did not wish to lose me on the team. The store manager agreed and they didn't fire me. They did tell me that there aren't many second chances given and that if I did anything like that again they'd fire me on the spot as they already had the OK from corporate.

The thing is, I really do want to get into human resources. I still apply for HR ads that look more legit and I always Google the company names.

My tip to you is ask a LOT of questions when they call you. Ask them what you would be doing day to day, if this is an office job, if the pay is salaried/hourly, if you're required to travel on the job, who are your customers, if you'll be meeting them face to face or on the phone....

Back when my wife and I were dating, she and I house sat for my Parents. After watching some romcom on TV, things got heated, and we ended up in the bedroom. Still pretty new to our relationship, and being the eager young dipshit that I was, things hadn't progressed to the point yet where she was ""ready"". Panties to the side, I fucked that girl like we were never going to see each other again. Looking back, I'd still put the episode in our top 5 ""best sex"" category. It was awesome. 

When I pulled out, the grand finale turned in to a fucking horror story of me crying like a little girl when I realized that it was **me** and not her that had produced all of this blood.

NiteVixen37,"It's ridiculous how much blood an erect penis can produce isn't it? 
My freshman year of college I was hooking up with this guy in my dorm. We didn't use a condom and he was uncircumcised. 
We were fooling around one night in his bed with the lights out. I wasn't totally warmed up yet and thus wasn't properly lubed up. A little push and shove action and viola, sex began. 
10 minutes later I am on top and remark on how wet I am. I'm a bit surprised because I definitely wasn't feeling as aroused as I should have been for how slippery it was. I look down at his lower stomach and through the dark I notice something dark is all over him. I get off and we flip on the lights to reveal what looked like a murder scene. Both he and I were covered in blood. It soaked his sheets through to the mattress! Wide eyed from shock, we both frantically examined ourselves to find the source of the blood. Neither of us were in pain so it was very confusing. 
We eventually figured out that due to our rough mannered sex and the lack of lubrication at first, it had caused a small tear in his foreskin. Since we didn't notice it and kept having sex, his erect injured dick was like a faucet that had been left on. 
A little terrifying as a little 19 year old.

After cutting off a car and getting into the other lane, we found that all the cars had a little purple ""Funeral"" placard in the window.

These fuckers decided to basically shut down a busy freeway for the procession from the funeral parlor to the grave yard.

Nice girl funeral attendee decided  to stop and ""wave through"" the car that wanted to turn left. Meanwhile, the funeral escort car was speeding along in lane 1 to go block the next major intersection. Escort meets left turn. Airbags and totalled cars ensue.

It has great organization and customization features, and backs up the settings in the cloud for when you upgrade...even in the free version. I recently decided to upgrade to the Premium Version, for one purpose. I'd avoided the premium version until this feature was recently added: the ability to ""unsend"" text messages, or basically a timed delay after hitting send. This allows you to hit a small ""x"" to cancel the sending and continuing editing the text, or a checkmark to instantly send the message. I primarily use this feature to fix typos that I notice after prematurely hitting the send button.

Imploder,"I have this really ugly orange hoodie. My friends all make fun of it, but fuck them. That shit is comfortable. The girl I was dating last winter really hated it. She said it made me look like a hobo (to be fair to her, it was pretty dirty from wearing it day in and day out most of fall/winter last year).

One day I was walking to the convenience store down the street from my house, wearing my hoodie. Beboping along. I lived in kind of a shitty neighborhood at the time. I get to the entrance, and just outside theres this guy leaning up against a pole, looking at his phone. I didn't really pay attention to him until he wordlessly, without even looking up from his phone, holds his arm out. He has a dollar in his hand. I just kept walking. After I passed him he says, ""no take it man. Its cool.""

I didn't know what he was talking about right at first. Then it sort of hit me. I looked a little disheveled (it was my day off. Showering and shaving are optional on days off. Had some gnarly bed head going too). I was a little mad because my gf just the night before had told me how ugly the hoodie I was wearing was and that I really needed to wash it soon. I said ""oh no. Thanks though. I don't need it. It's just this hoodie I think. I'm not homeless."" But I guess it just sounded like I was being modest or something. I think I also sounded a little bit crazy. Why the fuck was I talking about my hoodie to this guy?

""Hey man. Don't worry about it. You don't need to give me the story. I want you to have it."" 

""No. I'm serious. I'm not homeless. I don't need your money. But thank you."" We were both annoying each other at this point. He was just trying to be nice. I was just trying to explain I wasn't homeless. 

""Okay. Whatever."" Strange. And awkward. I didn't tell that story to my gf until it happened a SECOND TIME while wearing that hoodie. That time was a little worse. 

Just got home. Pull up to the curb in front of my house. Get out of my car. A guy walking by on the side walk stops near me. Starts digging through his pockets. And says, ""wait I have something for you.""

I didn't know what the hell he was talking about, but curiosity got the better of me. I didn't think I knew him as far as I could tell. So I'm just kind of standing there thinking, ""what the hell does this total stranger have for *me*?"" 

Finally after a few seconds he produces some change from his pockets and holds it out. Oh god damn it. 

""Dude, you just saw me pull up. This... This is my car. AND THAT'S MY FREAKING HOUSE! I'M NOT HOMELESS!""

Zecin,"I've been mistaken for a beggar as well.  Earlier this summer I was working as a treeplanter in Canada and as a consequence I had been living out in the woods for a good part of the summer.  You get to a length of time spent in the bush where you just start to look homeless.  Even on your days off.  

Anyways, there was one day when we were supposed to switch camps and I had to wait for a ride at the Wal-mart of this small logging town.  I was sitting there in the parking lot for HOURS, waiting for a friend.  Then at some point, this old man drives up in this crappy old car and starts talking to me.  At first it's just casual talk, but then he tries to give me $20 before he drives off.  I tell him ""No, I'm not actually homeless.  I've got money, no worries.""

But he doesn't care.  Thinks I'm lying or something, I dunno.  He keeps trying to give me money.  Eventually he starts yelling at me to just take the money.  Then he just throws $20 out the window and speeds off.

About 5 minutes later another old man drives up and hands me a packet of twizzlers.  I can't turn down candy, so I took 'em.

Not sure why I'm writing this...  I guess the moral is that people get mistaken for beggars more often than you'd think, haha.  ",null,0,cd1fljk,1pbcny,tifu,new,1

I searched all over and could not find it, so I thought there might be an outside chance it was stuck underneath my eyelid. I poked and prodded a few times at work without any luck. Coincidentally, when I got home my Butch T Scorpion (ridiculously hot) pepper plant had its first round of ripe peppers so I decided to cut one up and sample it. Later on and thinking nothing of it, I decided to poke around my eye again to see if the contact was there or not. At first my eye was reacting like there was something in there irritating it, so I got a little excited that I finally found it. Well the sensation of an irritant quickly turned into pain. That's when it hit me - I'm a fucking idiot. My eye was burning so bad I thought I was going to have to go to the hospital. Luckily after flushing it out and dealing with the pain for about 10 minutes, it started to subside. Oh, and guess where I found my contact lens? My pocket.

I'm tight on money, but I figure ""well, landlord won't cash the check until the first, so write it anyways and keep her happy."" Mail it out, and think nothing of it. Until, that is, the day of our anniversary. Fancy dinner planned, comedy club, all that fun stuff that costs money.

We get up and go to a nice brunch, and we agree to split the bill. She pays cash, I put the rest on my card, as I never really carry cash. Get it back with the dreaded words ""sorry, but your card was declined."" Frantically, I check my bank account: 

""lol fuck you Mark, -$500.""

But, just as a CYA procedure, I contacted the bank to see what was up with them sending another card. 

Come to find out, something changed at their end, so they had to send me a new card with their new information. If I had tried to keep using my existing card, it would have been declined, no matter how much money I had in my account. 

I guess the moral of the story is to always take action when your bank sends you a new card. Make sure you activate your new cards, and get rid of your old ones. If you have questions, call the bank. Preferably before you're in an embarrassing situation with a declined card.",null,0,cd230ox,1pfh0r,tifu,new,2

I never thought dat I'd be postin here wit a fucked up poop-related incident yo, but, alas, here I am. Well shiiiit, it all started dis afternoon at lunch. I strutted ta tha ghetto club near mah school ta git some chicken n' you know I be eatin up dat shizzle all muthafuckin day, biatch. I be fly as a gangbangin' falcon, soarin all up in tha sky dawwwwg! Now, I be slightly intolerant ta lactose n' gluten. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. Genius me thought it would be a pimped out scam ta order grilled cheese n' you can put dat on yo' toast. Yo ass can probably guess where dis is goin fo' realz. After consumin dis delicious thang of dirtnap, I was off ta tha last block of tha day, physics. Our thugged-out asses had a unit test dat class dat I had straight-up forgotten about, however, given tha material, I was fairly shizzle dat I would ace it anyways fo' realz. As I took mah seat all dem minutes before tha class started, I heard n' felt a rumblin deep up in mah bowels. I dissed n' dismissed it as not a god damn thang but a funky-ass bust a funky-ass big-ass fart waitin ta be busted out. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! 20 minutes later, I realized mah mistake. I was on some quarter of tha way all up in tha test when I felt tha beginningz of a violent shiznit comin on. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch fo' realz. A test had never felt so long up in mah game. I rushed all up in it, blazin all up in kinematic equations like they was not a god damn thang fo' realz. As I neared tha end of tha test, I was crampin up, n' releasin all dem embarrassin soundz from mah nether regions, earnin me some looks from tha rather bangin biatch up in front of mah dirty ass. For all y'all dat have eva had ta hold up in a shiznit fo' some time when yo ass is desperate ta go, you can sympathize wit mah dirty ass. This was no on tha down-low urgin up in mah bowels ta be turned back by mah sphincter of steel; dis was constant, gut wrenchin pain up in mah lower abdomen. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. I felt like mah stomach would explode any minute. I gots up, strutted ta tha front of tha class, n' axed ta be excused ta git all up in tha bathroom. I then exited tha class, keepin mah composure rather well if I say so mah dirty ass, n' sprinted ta tha thugs room as soon as I was clear of tha class. Let me rap , I aint NEVER experienced a mo' satisfyin shiznit than todizzle. It make me wanna hollar playa! Well shiiiit, it blew up like a muthafucka outta mah rectum up in a funky-ass blaze of tear inducing, stinky glory, n' I sighed up in relief. Dat shiznit was then dat I thought ta check mah faithful undies fo' damage, which was not all dat bad, thankin bout; just a MASSIVE FUCKING SHITSTAIN right down tha middle of mah boxers. Right back up in yo muthafuckin ass. Shiznit. Literally fo' realz. After mah poop, I meekly performed tha waddle of shame back ta mah class. Right back up in yo muthafuckin ass. Surprisingly, no one gave me a second glizzle fo' realz. And that, reddit, is how tha fuck I shat mah baggy-ass pants durin a test.

So what my body seems to do during recovery, is take all the crap that was in my throat, and shit it out, as for some reason I am unable to cough it up. So last Friday/Saturday, I am in full shit mode. Horrible acidic shits ever 2 hours. Saturday is the grand finale. Maybe I ate something bad, I have no clue. 

So I rush to the bathroom, and start doing my business. Ill spare the details, but I thought it was over and started to wipe. Once the TP touched me, round 2 started point blank. It was like someone was shooting acidic chunky milk at my hand with only 2 layers of (thankfully) thick toilet paper. I felt everything, but my hand was unscathed. 

Worst part, is it happened 3 more times in the same dump session. I was crappy for like 10 minutes apparently.

I live thousands of miles away from my family members, since there's way too much drama and stupidity around them for my tolerance levels. Facebook is *plenty* close enough.

I'm 15 years older than you, female, and raised my child without much help from his father.

I didn't attend college, either, but that is *not* a closed door. I can still learn, and don't *have* to have an educational/institutional setting to expand my knowledge.

I also work a dead-end job. Advancement means finding another office job I can fake my way through 40 hours of every week, since my trade skills are forgotten and my body won't hold up to the physical labor type jobs I had in my 20's.

My friends are few, but they are pure platinum. I can go weeks without seeing some of them, and when we get together, sometimes it's only that we're in the same room with good company. More drama-free living.

Do you and the child have any kind of bond? Whather he is ""yours"" or not, you are ""his,"" if he knows and sees you. Think about this on a 5YO level: you ARE important.

There is something positive about today, where you are: is the sun shining, and the weather warm? Can you hear birdsong? Did you catch three *green lights* in a row on your lunch hour?

TevaUSA,"I don't know your girlfriend, but as a girl I would think she'd understand if you were still nervous about where you two stood together at this point. That's pretty natural.

As a person who worries a lot over everything for little to no reason, you need to address your fears (however small you think they are) *now* before they become an issue later. If you know you are insecure, you should wait until she comes home and have a decent conversation about it. I explained to my boyfriend that I get really worried about things some times and I try to deal with them on my own, but they aren't personal to him it's just in my nature. Since then he usually checks in with me to make sure I'm not wigging out about anything. It helps a **lot** not having to worry about now 'showing' your insecurities. Once your S/O knows about them, you can deal with them together; might even help you get a little closer and a lot more confident.

This wasn't much of a fuck-up, regardless, but I hope you use it as a growing experience nonetheless. Good luck. :)",null,1,cd5j7vb,1pro99,tifu,new,3

He texted me and asked me if I mistakenly put ethanol instead of gasoline in his car. I know I'm not that dumb but this is where the story gets weird. The pump I used did not dispense ethanol and further investigations showed that the Sheetz I went to does not even sell ethanol! We don't understand how this could have happened.

The other teacher was the English teacher. I excelled in her class and was expecting a great letter. Her letter was generic and overall unimpressive.

ThatSpuds,"Any time that you depend on someone for something, you put yourself at risk.  The more important the requirement, the more risk.  The only way to mitigate that risk is to communicate how important their requirement is (a letter) and communicate to them what you risk as a result of their failure to follow-through.

Unfortunately, people do not communicate well these days.  I'm big on communication.  I tell people where I'm going to be, for how long, when they should expect me back, how to reach me.  I intend for those that work for me to reciprocate.  As a result, the people who depend on me pretty much know with 100% certainty that I have heard them, understand their request, that I understand the risks of failure and the timeframe by which I will honor their request.

It seems to me that these are the very least that we should ask of the people who we depend on, and should be asked by those who depend on us.

It was traditionally the ""wrong side of the tracks,"" but there were some rich people restoring houses there since it was an historic area so there were a bunch of sketchy people and a bunch of not sketchy people in the area.This guy seemed not too sketchy, and he just wanted to go down the road, so I said okay and we hopped in my car and drove down to the convenience store that was colloquially known as a place where lots of drug deals went down.I started to get nervous but he asked me to hang out for a second and went in. I could have left, but I figured the guy knew where I lived, so if he wanted to fuck me up, he could. So I hung out.

At this point, I was pretty scared, and drove them down the road again until they told me to stop.They had me pull into a driveway and cut my headlights, then just sat there for a minute whispering to each other. Finally, I heard the second person say, ""Just leave him alone, man, he drove us here and didn't ask any questions."" Then they got out of the car and I hauled ass of the driveway and back to my house.I'm convinced that if that second guy hadn't said something, I wouldn't be around to tell this story.

skypointing,"ohh boy, I can sort of relate. well, sex wasn't involved, but still. 

for a solid year I had a colostomy bag (I'd had my colon removed and they created a tiny new one out of a loop of my remaining intestines, so I had the bag while it healed) and I swear, if my relationship can get through that, it can get through anything. 

I have so many awful stories, but in this one, I was lying flat on my back on our bed, talking to him. he was lying the same way, beside me. now, I had this habit where I would rest the flat of my palm on the seal of my bag, making sure it wasn't leaking, etc. I did it unconsciously. 

so he was being a smart-ass and rested his hand along the other side, imitating me. when he went to pull it away, he didn't think about his hand being partially under the edge of the bag, and lifted straight up. and of course, I'd been trying out a 2-piece bag with a locking mechanism, where the base rested on my skin and the bag clicked into it. his pulling upward disengaged the lock, apparently, and suddenly my hand, which still rested half-under my bag, felt very warm and wet. 

I screeched like a banshee and started sobbing immediately while he, conversely, start laughing hysterically, even as he got up to get a pack of baby wipes. 

even after we got everything cleaned up and I'd changed my bag, I was still crying and apologizing, even though he's been the one to cause it. he just kept laughing and joking about it, making me laugh and helping me get over it. 

it was a shitty (ha) experience but i think, weirdly, that it made us closer, and I knew at moment that no one else could love me like that. no one else could accidentally rip off their fiancé's poop bag and then have to clean her and his hand and the bed up, and then laugh about it, and then make her feel better about it. so I don't mind the memory so much.

bleepyface,"Firstly, sorry for your misfortune. However on a serious note, a short bit of advice I'm unsure if you've ever been given as I can personally sympathise with your condition.

I too suffer from a mega distended colon (it's basically the circumference of my torso), and is the worst case my Colorectal Surgical Consultant has ever seen.

Mine too was caused by chronic constipation and bowel laziness since childhood. Mine is so bad my bladder is distorted and in a completely different part of my abdomen to where it should be (on an MRI they thought it was a potentially dangerous fluid mass, which resulted in another two MRI's and two ultrasounds).

My distension is quite obvious if you see me without a shirt on, and my waist size can vary from 32"" to 34"" literally overnight thanks to the bloating that accompanies such a disorder.

If you still get urges when you need to go (which I guess you do judging by your stomach pains, etc.), **stimulant laxatives are the worst thing to take in this situation**. They can eventually stop the bowel from giving you this sensation (rectal peristalsis) rendering you physically dependent on stimulant laxatives just to go to the toilet. In the long run, this could end up with a colostomy.

Non stimulant varieties, such as Macrogol Compound are much better for you as they work only by introducing more water in to the bowel to soften everything, making it easier to pass. This avoids the whole shitting like a rocket engine scenario.

I take two or three sachets daily (morning and before bed) which keeps me on a fairly regular rhythm. I don't suffer from diarrhoea or incontinence in any way, and I maintain full control.

Occasionally I do have to take more to ""purge"" so to speak, particularly if I eat lots of bulky food, but this is rare providing I take the medicine regularly. This process shall remain for the rest of my life now.

Also bear in mind that holding it in (even for a few days) can increase the amount of distension over time, and cause blockages if it solidifies up inside you.

Good luck, and maybe consider speaking to your doctor.",null,3,cdalufd,1q3aaq,tifu,new,6

(Yes, you should respect your classmates and pay attention, but realistically, especially in the real world...if they can't write a speech that draws attention then who cares?)

But anyway...You're looking at this wrong.  This isn't your problem for laughing...this is HER problem for being so nervous as to wait till the last day.  She needs to get over that.  Facing her fear is the solution, not waiting until the very last day, increasing the tension and pressure, and then collapsing because someone laughed at something unrelated.

In this story you're like .5% dick for not paying attention to her.  That's about it.  Maybe you make the extra 10% for a total of 10.5% due to her being a nervous nelly and exacerbating it.  And, as previously stated, you're basically helping her face her fears.  ",null,8,cd96sn7,1q3njh,tifu,new,2

bettyboophead,"I've been with my husband nearly 17 years now. We visited his family this summer, all sitting around the kitchen table drinking wine, getting quite drunk when his mom starts talking about the girl he was with before me all wistfully. Saying she liked that girl and asking him if he's talked to her since then. He was basically like no that bitch bailed on me to paraphrase. Then he was like that was a really long time ago. He then told her he'd been with me 17 years now and wasn't thinking about some stupid bitch (paraphrasing) from high school. His mom got all sad and was like, ""You've been with her 17 years?"" I just started laughing right there at the table while the rest of his family just looked at me.

The funny thing is his mom is always talking shit to me about my weight. I know I've always been ""larger"" but I'm tall and it's always quite well distributed. The girl before me, not that I care about such things, but she was very stout. Sort of shaped like George Costanza or the big white lesbian from ""Orange is the New Black."" The MIL is also short and shaped in a similar manner. The woman in fact is rocking a much larger clothing size while being about three or four inches shorter. So so funny.

All his in-laws also seemed to be believe that I'm incredibly stupid. I'm no physicist or anything but I'm not stupid. At the same dinner it brought on more laughter (on my end) when my husband for some reason brought up I was an honors/AP student in high school. They all looked so confused. Good times!

EDIT: So, I don't think you fucked up. I think you showed unreasonable restraint. I still say nothing in my defense. All I do is laugh, drink their wine, and wait until the visit is over and another half a decade goes by before I have to see them again. They live quite far away.

- Can you help her find some roommates?

- Do you live in or near a large enough city that there may be a french expatriate community, even if it's only a few people? If so, have you tried helping her get in touch with them?
- Have you tried helping her talk to local churches to see what help they might be able to offer?
- If Jessica is a legal US resident, have you tried helping her investigate what sort of resources, if any, the state has to offer -- shelters, job training, and such?
- Have you tried talking with your aunt to see if she knows any compassionate members of the community that could provide Jessica with a place to stay for a nominal rent?
- Has Jessica looked for opportunities as an [au pair](https://www.google.com/search?q=au+pair&amp;ie=UTF-8)?
- If Jessica working on getting a license and a car? Does your city have any public transportation?
- What sort of practical things is Jessica doing to take responsibility for herself and move her life forward?

Moving in with her is probably not a good idea as you say it's too fast, and you should make that clear to her.

The best idea I've heard so far is French tutoring as she's fluent in the language. Tutoring makes big bucks once you find clientele, and although she isn't speaking one of the main languages taught it's still semi-common and will be somewhat sought after.

[Here is a reputable online tutoring site.](http://instaedu.com/become-a-tutor/) If you have problems finding clientele in your area that'll work perfectly as you pick the exact hours you work and clients will seek out you.

As someone else said if she has US citizenship she'll also be entitled to low-income benefits to help her.

Now, if you really put in the effort to try and help her and she either does not accept your help, does not face reality, blames things on you that are obviously not your fault (Including this situation), or doesn't put in as much effort as you to help herself then I think it would be time to cut ties.

BrutalDane,"So I just felt to contribute with my opinion since Redditors here have a ""Oh shit hurdle, get out!!!"" mentality. 

It is a harsh situation for sure, no question about that. What you should do is to consider how you feel about this girl, people say ""2 months is way to soon to invest in anything"", but it is ultimately up to how you feel about her, do you see any future with this girl at all? 

If not, well thats how the story ended. 

I know some Americans(especially parents) have this issue with couples sleeping together under their roof, but seriously you are 21 an adult, she is 24 and also an adult. Who in the right mind would not allow two adults in a relationship sleep in the same bed is beyond me. 

But if the best thing that could happen for this girl right now would be for her to stay with you, it will give her a breather and get a footing to plan the next move, you will also get some kind of feel of how it would be to live with this girl if that is something you would desire looking into the future. 

She trusts you, and coming from France to America I can't imagine she have any network at all being there a year only. 
I agree with the statement that you should not feel pressured at all to move in with her, she is an adult and need to be able to sustain herself. 

With that said, I do not believe you should just bail because of a speed bump, it is a pretty harsh start being shunned from your family, and you should not involve yourself in those problems it is too much strain, but that doesn't stop you from being supportive. 

Anyways. I think you should step one: 
Talk to your aunt about the situation, and possibly agree on some kind of payment for this girl to stay there temporarily, it is important to get this girl to agree to that it is temporary. 

If that doesn't work, hope that the husband would allow her to stay. 
If none of these things work out, I am sure the state have some sort of program to help people with no network who have been shunned from their family, you may want to look into that. 

Second make a plan for what is going to happen, step by step it will make it easier to get an overview of the situation, and take it from there. 

Third, seems like this girl needs to be taught basic budget management, it is a small investment of time from someone who knows how it works, but can make a big difference in the long run and help to improve the situation. 

These are all pretty small things that will not take focus away from your life and school too much, it will have some impact but you seem to have enough control over your own life to handle it. 

Just remember all relationships have some rough patches, some worse than others and all relationships were at one point only 2 months old. 
Just my opinion on the matter.

Hair wet,  rocking body,  wearing a white tank top and white shorts with no bra or panties,  and she was freakin stacked. Her boobs  were HUGE,  but not a hint of sagging, even bra-less.  Her six pack abs stood out in perfect detail,  it was cold and her nipples could have scratched glass.  She'd walked in from the rain and might as well have been naked.  We could see everything in full detail. 


Towards the end of breakfast I was stacking trays and another worker asked if I had seen her while we were bullshittin.  Without thinking I blurt out ""that chick has GLORIOUS tits!!!"" and didn't understand why co-worker turned red in the face and backed away.  Until I turned around and she was right behind  me,  about to dump her food tray.  I stuttered,  I stammered, but couldn't get words to form.

I've never made it a practice, and only did it once, but one day....

A friend needs a ride to his parents house to pick up his car.  It's about an hour trip, so a second friend decides to go to.  This is 1999, we're in a 1994 Geo Prism (Toyota Corolla) not a big car... I'm about 200 lbs at the time and both friends are pushing 260 each.

On the Interstate we're going about 75-80 in a 65.   Fast, but not crazy.  Listening to music, talking, having a good time.

We exit and are going down a middle-sized country road.  This is Western Ohio so it's mostly flat, with some rolling hills.  Still talking and listening to music and pass a County Sheriff, no biggie, I'll just check my spee- WHAT THE FUCK!!  I'm going 85!

Maybe the Sheriff didn't see, so no brakes, i start to coast slower.  Sheriff keeps going, keeps going.  Is almost out of sight.  We're Clear!!

NOPE!

Just before he's out of sight, we see lights flip on, and then he's over a hill.  FUCK!  Ok, 85 in a 55, they're gonna pull my license and stick me in jail!

I immediately turn down the first road that comes up... .it's one of those shitty middle of nowhere country roads that is narrow and rounded... but I need to get some distance!  Drive WAY too fast down it, taking corners too fast... We turn left and I felt the car heel over, my friends are pressed against the passenger side and the tires are making a groaning noise and I feared they were going to rip right off.  We're all turned around and I take the next right... no sign of the Sheriff so far... we must be clear.  Somehow we are on this little road heading one direction and there is another, almost parallel road down and to the right... And here comes that Sheriff, lights on, barreling down that road, heading in the opposite direction of us.  But we've gotta be safe, because we can't tell how our road is connected to that one.

We figure out where we are, get to my friends house without incident.  Hearts finally calming down.

My family was on vacation in Houston, and I awoke one morning to see my dad standing over me drinking his morning coffee out of his brand new NASA mug. As I tried to clear my eyes and brace for impact, I remember my dad gave me this smart ass look like, ""I'm not running out the door to get to work like I usually am when we are at home. I have all the time in the world to stand here and torture you until you get out of bed."" (This is the same man who regularly woke me up on the weekends by spraying me in the face with water from a spray bottle. When I had a waterbed - yay 80's! - he would pump his foot on the edge of the ""mattress"" until I was torn from slumber by a tsunami throwing me onto the floor.)

He took a big swig of his coffee, and smiled a wry smile, no doubt seizing upon some devious scheme in his twisted, marble-sized brain. Immediately his dumb face turned to surprise as his front tooth started buzzing. Quite literally. When I try, I can still see the panic in his saucer-sized eyes that day. Karma had come to collect. He pulled back his trembling lips like a double-jointed prostitute to reveal a large, black, quivering mass blocking out his front tooth.

Somehow a fly had landed in his coffee, was slurped up into his agape mouth, and a wing had managed to wedge itself in between his two front teeth. The fly struggled with all its little might until my dad was able to grab it (in between yelps) and pull it free. 

Believe me, friends, when I tell you I laughed. I laughed the laugh that only those witnessing swift, glorious justice can know. With a deep appreciation for the just desserts my father was now literally pulling from his mouth, I laughed. Retribution had come home to roost. 

I'll never forget that little jig my father danced in that Houston motel room on that warm summer morning as he scrambled madly to dislodge a buzzing housefly from his stupid chompers.

I only ever heard about them from friends, obviously, but it was a bit disconcerting at first. I dunno your girlfriend's story (I doubt she completely does either, if she's loosing access to memories) but mine involved a lot of verbal and emotional abuse, and one day when I finally found some stability and supportive friends, all the pieces of my past and my mind just came rushing back. It took about a week and I went a little crazy. Basically, I *would* lose my mind when my anxiety (or any strong emotion) flared up, so completely I couldn't even feel anxious anymore =P 

Freaking out about the broken pieces only makes it harder to put them back together.

Seriously, though, some people have commented that in a relationship like that, it's worth tolerating the bad if the good is good enough, and there is some truth to that, but I think it's really important to be self-empowered and to not tolerate another person's shitty attitudes -- even if you're dating said person. If she's going to act childish because you won't tell her the surprise, then she doesn't deserve to be dating you. Find someone else who's more mature, and if she starts acting crazy, start considering breaking up with her.

Sir_Dude,"Ah, have a seat young one, I shall tell you a true story of myself, 'my' porn, and my parents.

It all began one fateful summer night at the tender young age of 15. I had not yet discovered masturbation and, with strict parental controls on the family computer, had only seen the nude female form in educational and medical contexts. I was a sheltered young lad, to say the least, but that was about to change for the better.

As I say, It was a quiet afternoon at the Dude residence, my father being out of town on a business trip, when I wandered into my parents' room to collect some laundry. My mother was folding laundry on her bed and I noticed, across the room and lying under a dresser was: The Magazine. The Magazine was upside down, so all I saw was the rear cover; however, something about The Magazine called out to me. I felt my legs moving my body across the room as I picked up the magazine and saw the front cover, I had hit pay dirt. It was a bona fide 'Playboy Magazine.' (It was the April 2003 issue, [Carmella DeCasare](http://www.chitramala.in/img2/2009/09/carmella-decesare300.jpg)(Link semi NSFW), I will never forget...)

My luck did not last as my mother was upon me in nanoseconds, wrenching The Magazine from my apparently unworthy fingers. I had managed to open it and glimpsed, for a short time, the majestic wonders of the nude female form in a sexual context.

She shooed me from the room and told me ""Sir_Dude, you aren't old enough to be looking at things like this."" Her words had no effect, I had become infected with... Porn Madness.

I sat in my room for several minutes, my mind consumed with only one thought: Get. That. Magazine.

I heard the door to her bedroom close and I silently scrambled to the door, knowing she was gullible and trusting enough to leave the room unattended while she went to make dinner. I began searching the room like a silent cat burglar, intent on finding The Magazine. I swept aside the bed-skirt and found not one, but 6 Playboy Magazines. I stared at them in slack jawed fascination and began to flip though them with the grace of a crack addict preparing his next fix.

O. M. F. G. ...**boobies**.

And just as the Porn Madness had brought me to find these 6 sacred texts, it betrayed me as I pored over them, oblivious to my mother's approaching footsteps. She ejected me from the room and gathered the sacred texts in a bag. I followed like a man possessed as she walked downstairs and into the garage. She then locked the bag containing the precious texts in her car. My nose sadly pressed against the glass, I knew I had lost this round, but she was sadly mistaken if she thought I would allow The Magazine to be lost forever.

Later that evening, she took the family dog for a walk and was smart enough to take her car keys with her. Luckily for me, I knew where she kept a spare. I opened the car and liberated The Magazine from its horrendous confines. While Porn Madness had incapacitated me a short time ago, I was now (just an hour later) learning to control it. I took The Magazine to my room. I had a special hiding place where my mother could not find it. What was best, she did not even know I had taken The Magazine as I had left the other 5 in the car. She would assume that if I had accessed them, I would have taken all of them.

Years before, my parents had remodeled the kitchen, which was directly beneath my bedroom. In the process, they had removed the wall through which the clothes chute passed. The opening of the clothes chute remained as it was in my bedroom, but was sealed at the bottom. The shaft was just the right length that I could insert my arm and touch the new floor. It was in this place that I hid The Magazine. This served as a faithful hiding spot for many months.

Some weeks later. I arrived home from school earlier than normal, in the day's mail I found another Playboy Magazine. (According to my parents, one of their friends took out the subscription for my dad as a joke). From this, my collection was born.

Later that year, I received word that a man from the bank was going to be visiting our home for an appraisal. My father explained that I needed to perform a serious cleaning of my room because the banker was going to be inspecting everything that had changed after the kitchen remodeling. At this moment, I knew they would find the sacred Magazines I had hidden in the sealed clothes chute. I decided to relocate them temporarily in the interests of safety.

I chose to hide them between my mattress, knowing that the appraiser would not check there and I could return the sacred texts once he had gone. Unfortunately, I became complacent with the new hiding place and decided the magazines could remain there indefinitely.

This was a beneficial arrangement until one day I returned home from school to find my bed had been placed on the driveway alongside a large amount of plastic sheeting. My parents stood in the kitchen with amused looks on their faces.

""Well Sir_Dude, today we decided to buy a King size bed for our room and we moved our old Queen size bed into your room... and then we took yours outside.""

""Oh. Cool.."" I said knowing what was coming next.

""Sir_Dude, we found the magazines."" said my mother, with a knowing grin on her face.

I retreated to my new Queen sized bed to lament the loss of the sacred texts with one small consolation. I could always steal more when they arrived in the mail.

And so it was that I pilfered more whenever I found them, eventually striking solid gold with the arrival of Playboy's 50th Anniversary Edition.

This went on for years until, at a long last, in the dreary cold winter of 2006, I felt the desire to cast my gaze upon some boobies once more. It had been several weeks since I had handled the sacred texts, having been too busy to extract them from their hiding spot: beneath a drawer on the inside of my dresser.

As I removed the drawer, I realized that I had been defeated once again. The sacred texts had been removed, all that remained was a typewritten page of paper with the following written upon it:


""Sir_Dude,

The theft of mail is a Federal Felony punishable with heavy fines and several years in prison.

Further theft will result in serious consequences.

Love,

Your Mom and Dad.""

hnxt,"Sup OP, I have a friend whom I work with, we're barkeepers. We do that stuff behind the bar all the fucking time in plain sight of everyone, much to the amusement of anybody who's watching. For example, if she rubs my pecs from behind while I'm trying to fix up a cocktail, I'll return the favor by grabbing ass sometime later. The same exact kind of greeting (crotch grab) you've received from your friend and the same exact retort (boob grab) has also happened, more than once.

I don't even know how this shit got started, we never hooked up or anything, but it's our modus operandi whenever we're at work now. The bottom line is this: if somebody expects you to be comfortable with that level of physical contact, you can expect the same from them. Anything else is ludicrous. The fact that she went off on you like that and keeps acting like you tried to fuck her in the ass after putting roofies in her drink is just downright ridiculous.

Don't let this get you down. Rape and sexual assault are very serious, touchy subjects and I can imagine that being put on the spot like you've been can mess with your head and give you quite a guilty conscience; but get this through your head: you did not do anything wrong. At all.

Here's what I'd do if I were in your position. Don't contact her again, and most of all, stop apologizing. You haven't done anything wrong. Apologizing might fortify the idea that you assaulted her in some way, which isn't what happened. If she contacts you again, tell her what an incredible double standard she entertains and that you want her to apologize.

a few months ago, a guy and a girl from my class at professional school had a similar incident. the guy happens to be very much into filthy innuendos as well.

the girl would always pinch the guy in his belly, after a while he has had it and told her ""if you do that again, i'll motorboat you."" she definitely knew what he meant. she probably did NOT think he would pull it off though, but he did. i did not witness the whole thing, but the next day she tells me what he did and seemed rather upset about it - which i could totally understand at the time, given that she did not with one word mention that she had been warned and also that there was a reason why he did it.

zalloy,"I used to see stuff like that happen at the last place I worked. The difference was the boss never pulled you aside to tell you anything. You'd get out of work, and there'd be a voice mail waiting for you from the agency telling you that your assignment was over. 

One lady was there for almost 3 months, and was due to either be let go, or to be taken on as a permanent employee. She got the ""end of assignment"" voice mail. While she was working there, they had nothing but good things to say about her. 

Regardless of what your boss told you, they probably know why you were fired. In fact, you boss (or HR) probably called the agency to let them know you were on your last point and took time off. 

Temp agencies are very touchy about losing time from work, regardless of the reason. They'll fire you at the drop of a hat because they've got a line of people ready to take your spot. 

Talk to them, explain your situation, and ask about getting reassigned to another position. If you get reassigned, then that means that your boss at the company had a problem with you missing time, and that's why you were let go. If they don't reassign you, that means that the temp agency has a problem with you missing time, and you should apply with other agencies.",null,2,cdh484i,1qw25y,tifu,new,7

I was living in my boarding school, and they had just put some new rooms in a building that had been opened a month ago, to use. As it happened, the rooms were directly parallel my window, albeit a floor lower. We're talking a distance of about 30 meters from the building to my window. 

Being very bored in my room, I decided to put on some dance music and well.. dance. It was around 5 pm and already dark. A biology class was having the late lessons. They would not be able to see me, surely, too late in the afternoon. As I was getting into the dancing, I turned on some strobe light video on youtube, because hey, why not. Now, what I should mention is that I have a ritual of taking of my top when I get to my room, freedom right. So Im dancing there, in my bra and pants, going hardcore to the flashing lights and then I see something peculiar. Something is moving in the classroom parallel to me, or rather someone. And that someone is waving right at me. Right along with all of his staring classmates.

I tried my hardest to say nothing rude or disrespectful to my mom, yet she was more and more angry at me every day. If you feel living with your grandmother would be better for you, your grandma, AND YOUR MOM, then I would do that. Your mom is terrified right now. I would try and present her with everything calmly. I would approach her like ""Hi mom. I understand you're going through a rough time right now. And I know that I will never understand everything that is going through your head right now. I understand that we are having issues right now and I feel that it might be better for both of us if I were to live at grandma's right now. This will put less stress on the both of us. I would still love to see you regularly while you're feeling up to it. Can I have your blessing/ permission to pack up some things and live at grandmas for a brief while? Mostly until everything cools off between us? I want us on good terms. I want us to be friends. I feel like we can do that, but I also feel like a cooling off period would not be a detriment to our relationship."" 

Now I don't know your mom, or how she will take this. But the idea behind it is to show her that *you want your relationship to improve.* and that you feel that it might once you have a chance to cool off. Running away isn't going to help. Being apart might. And if you have her permission, then you are in a much better position

After running around the house screaming, I remembered basic chemistry and soaked my junk in orange juice, which was the most acidic thing I had in the house.

SecondTalon,"Pregnancy Conclusion Tips.

1.  If she has not told you that she is pregnant, she is not pregnant.  I don't care if you just saw the perfect imprint of a hand swing by her stomach, she's not pregnant until she tells you she is.

2.  If she has told you that she is pregnant, don't mention it to her family or friends.  Let her family mention it to you and keep track of which family members mentioned it.  Only speak of it around family members you know know.  Otherwise, keep it to yourself.  The friends bit is trickier, but similar rules apply.

3.  If she mentioned being pregnant and a few months go by and she doesn't mention being pregnant (nor do you see any physical changes) or if it's someone you do not see regularly and a year's gone by and there have been no mention of children, don't mention her being pregnant.

noncreepymama,"this will be a very unpopular opinion, but I want to throw it out there. even though you have no sexual desire for these women, they are still offering you emotional support for your grieving that perhaps you should have been seeking from your wife, or like you mentioned, a counselor. your wife may see this as an emotional affair. i.e. ""why didnt you come to me to talk about and deal with your grief?"" 

i am not knocking having female friends, but i would certainly be hurt if I were her. however, if there is proof that its all just been platonic friendship, then i think she would hopefully understand the circumstances that you're in (the grieving period) and that you wouldnt have been so chatty with these ladies had you not been dealing with the loss of your mom. 

i ditto the ""write down the whole thing to explain and let her come to you after she has time to think about it"" and again, be careful with the emotional relationships you have with other people as well. it can occasionally open a door to ""more"".

It has multiple parts 1) lady friends she didn't know about [why the hell not?] and 2) not sharing your grief with her [why the hell not?] so it will take some serious patience on both parts to get through this. You have to talk and talk some more about this with her - talk until she is satisfied - not you -- her. Tell her you want to go to therapy about the grief and that you would like her to go with you a time or two to be involved with you. It may be that other issues pop up during therapy or during your talks with her. Relationships last through being open - secrets are relationship killers - if you doubt you should tell your spouse then it's a problem and needs to be addressed or stay the hell away from it. Ask her if she wants to meet the friends when she is ready - even if it's just look at their FB pages at this point. You need more transparency to get through this.

Sarlax,"Not telling her was a breach of trust on two levels: First, you didn't trust her to maturely handle the fact that you have good female friends. Second, you actively concealed it for a decade.

It's also very suspicious, especially as you posted in the thread that you purge your inbox all the time.

I think there's only one way forward: Offer to introduce her to all of your friends. Tell her you understand that hiding them was inappropriate and that you want to make it right. Be serious about this offer, and talk to her about it *before* ""clearing"" it with your friends. If you want her to trust you, you have to make her emotions the priority in this case.

Further, if you're playing the ""I was depressed"", along with your trust issues with her, you should consider couple's counseling. 

Finally, don't be defensive about any of this. You're the one who hid these relationships.

As an aside, how actively were you hiding all this? It sounds like a lot more than just ""not mentioning"" it. 700 texts in October is about 23 messages a day. I can't imagine you were able to text that much unless you were deliberately concealing it from your wife.

She should trust you above everyone and everything else, and she should believe you when you provide a rational explanation. At the end of the day, you really did NOTHING wrong, and I don't think you should feel sorry about how you chose to grieve and recover from the loss of your mom. If your two female friends helped you feel better again, then your wife, as someone who cares about you and your well-being, should be thanking them.

There's no way she would be so upset if you had been talking with two of your guy friends about your feelings. I think it's much more likely that her feelings are hurt because you opened up about your feelings to someone other than her.

PenultimateTry,"Keep an eye out on  [Find That Bike][1] for it; it amalgamates the most popular sites to sell a bike.

Make sure that you do tell the police. They'll do fuck all unless there's CCTV, but if nobody bothers to report a stolen bike then the official statistics won't represent the scale of the problem.

For the future, [use both a cable lock and a U lock][2]. It won't stop a determined thief but it will stop an opportunistic thief, who probably won't be carrying both bolt cutters and a hydraulic jack. An angle grinder will go through both types in seconds, but is pretty obvious.

Finally, don't be lulled into a false sense of security. Thieves will steal bikes even if they look like shit. I had a nice bike dressed up to look shitty stolen from a busy junction in South Kensington in broad daylight. I replaced that with a nice road bike that was stolen from the front of my house right under my window. I replaced that with a shitty free bike that I stored indoors; I left it out one night after cycling in the rain and it was gone in the morning.

Bike thieves should be hanged from the lampposts.

Anyhoo, it sounds like you were trying to give the guy a bit of friendly advice, and it got blown out of proportion. Letting him know to have a backup plan in case he was fired isn't the same as telling him he's about to be fired. 

And where, out of that conversation, did he get the idea that you were gunning to take over everything? He must like to jump to conclusions. If you've only been there a week, why would you make a claim like that? That was a rhetorical question, as I don't see where you mentioned anything like that. 

Did you explain to your boss how the conversation *actually* went? This kind of thing is very common in the workplace. You're in a position where you are the new guy, and kind of low on the totem pole. This co-worker of yours used your conversation as a means to make you look bad to your boss, since one doesn't usually have a lot of credibility when first starting at a new job. This co-worker feels threatened by your presence, and so they're doing whatever they can to damage your credibility with the boss. 

It's generally a bad idea to talk to co-workers about anything beyond ""Hi, how are you today?"" or ""How about that weather we're having?"" Anything else you say, someone will find a way to use it against you. I've lost a bunch of jobs over stuff like this. 

Your co-workers are just co-workers. They are *not* your friends. The same guy who sits in the next cube over, that you talk with every Monday about football will happily go tell your boss you have nothing better to do than talk sports, even when he initiated the conversation.

on the positive side, you don't have to pay the money all at once, nor do you have the option to (if you had the money in your bank account). the government will take that money out of your paychecks that you get from the national guard. you can go on some government site (i forget and am too lazy to look) to adjust the rate at which the government takes the money out. if i remember correctly, the default is 50 dollars per paycheck.

Have you fixed the bathroom yet? If not:

1. Clear area around toilet of baskets and such

2. Find plunger and plunge toilet. You tube it if you don't know how

3. Flush excess water and toilet paper once the clog is gone (you'll hear it go down). ( If you turned the water off, here's where you turn it back on. Be ready to turn back off in case it didn't work. ) 

4. Dry everything up with paper towels. If you must use regular towels, try to find dark/old ones

5. Wipe everything down with a disinfectant which you can probably find under bathroom or kitchen sink

mcj2,"10 months ago I was in the opposite position (almost exactly; I have been friends with this girl for more than 10 years, I started dating someone, she confessed her love... except we were never physical).  

I can't speak for your girl obviously, but from my perspective this is what I thought about the situation:

I appreciated how difficult it was for her to admit that to me, knowing that it likely wouldn't change anything (at the time, I had been dating the ""new"" girl for about a month).  I understood the desire to put it all out there, and if I were in her position I likely would have done something similar.

However, in my case this girl had about a year that she could have come to me with her feelings (while I was single).  It wouldn't have changed my feelings since to me our relationship is strictly platonic, but it would have been a little more respectful of MY feelings.

She said she needed space when I let her down as gently but clearly as possible, and I obliged.  For awhile, we didn't speak.  A few months later she reached out and we began texting/g-chatting (small talk, mostly) infrequently.  Now our relationship is as close as it likely ever will be to ""how it used to be"".  In fact, I hung out with her and another friend last night (without my gf present) and it felt very comfortable for us both.

Ultimately, I am glad she told me her feelings since I know how much strong (quiet) feelings can eat away at a person.  I do wish she had come to me before I was in another relationship, but I have no ill feelings towards her for it. 

TL:DR, friend confessed love to me, it was awkward for awhile, but comfortable friendship was not ruined.  IMO, you didn't fuck up but you should have said something before you found out she was seeing someone else.

Not only does she deserve space after this bombshell, so do you. The more you hang around her the more difficult it will be to get over those feelings. The sooner you can move on romantically in your life, the sooner your relationship with her will return to normal.",null,1,cdnjgmg,1rhz0q,tifu,new,5
Iron__mind,"The way I see it is you've got the awkward part out of the way, now you've got to try and relax a bit (I am fully aware that will be virtually impossible) and concentrate on not making things more awkward.

Give her a bit of space to get her head round it, keep yourself busy (you can be pretty productive when you're trying to avoid something) and when she's ready to talk try to act like you didn't say it. Don't deny it but just try to be friends like you were before, show her that this is not the end of you being friends and hopefully she will feel at ease.

When it does come up (pretty sure she'll want to talk about it eventually), apologise for blurting it out like that and for putting her under pressure especially as she'd just told you about some other guy. Tell her how hard it was to tell her because you don't want to ruin your friendship, explain how you've recently realised your feelings for her are not purely platonic anymore and ask her how she feels about it.

When you've heard her thoughts, ask her what you can do to not lose her, ask yourself this while you're at it. Try your hardest not to be selfish here, you're gonna get emotional and want to know how you can be more than friends but you need to do everything in your power to ensure you're not going to be less than friends.

Except for the one where you never point your gun at something you don't intend on shooting. And the one where you don't put your finger on the trigger if you don't plan on pulling it. And the one where you don't *ever* pull the trigger until you've cleared the gun. That's 3 rules right there. This is why the one rule that you mentioned, never point a gun, not even a fake one, at a person unless the plan is to shoot them, is extremely important. You got very lucky this time, but *always* assume the gun is loaded, even if you *know* it is not.",null,2,cdogaip,1rk4wj,tifu,new,5
iama_XXL,"Dude, you aren't allowed to fire warning shots either. You and your dad both need a refresher course on gun safety and gun laws. Also, if your instinct is to finger the trigger or even place it inside the guard, you have a bad instinct. It should always be to the side of under the trigger guard. Don't finger it until you have your target sighted and are ready to fire. 

Before someone jumps me on the warning shot, it can be considered reckless endangerment if deadly force wasn't justified. If it was justified, then there is no reason for a warning shot. 

[This mother](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fla-mom-gets-20-years-for-firing-warning-shots/) got 20 years due to firing a warning shot due to minimum sentencing guidelines. And it was to stop an abusive husband who she had a order against. Again, if you feel force is authorized, use it. Otherwise, keep the finger away from the trigger.",null,1,cdo99h6,1rk4wj,tifu,new,5

Never pull the trigger even when you are just going to dry fire it unless you have it pointed in a safe direction. Always act as if it is a live round being fired. So obviously your dad didn't train you that well. My dad didn't train me either so I wound up shooting myself at 15 years old. After that I decided I would avoid any fire arm until I was ready to own one and train with it. I refused to handle any other person's fire arm even with permission until they made sure I knew all the details about it's function. I've never had a problem since then. But I have taken friends out for a shoot and one friend proceeded to violate every rule in the first five seconds I handed a shotgun over to him. Then I painstakingly went over every mistake he made and had him do it all over again. I think he thought I was being a dick about it but I gladly showed him my scar and told him about how close I came to dying and how much pain I went through and the shame of being known as that kid who shot himself. 
I asked him how much money it would take for him to let me shoot him in any part of his body. Then imagine how much effort he would be willing to go through to make sure this never happens to him. Ever. 
Yep, I'm pretty sure he thought I was being a dick. But he wanted to shoot a shotgun bad enough that he was willing to learn all the things it would take to remain safe. ",null,0,cdog75m,1rk4wj,tifu,new,2

Your instincts are bad and you should feel bad.

&gt; Now, I'm an experienced hunter, and I know how to handle a firearm. I grew up taking the rules of gun safety very seriously when out in the field or with guns I never personally handled. 

Clearly you're not.  

&gt; Rule one of firearm safety is ALWAYS ASSUME THE GUN IS LOADED. 
&gt; However, this situation had caused me to lax the rules just slightly because a.) I wasn't planning on loading or messing with these weapons beyond a few seconds out of the cabinet each and b.) my father is one of those guys who made sure I never forgot the rules of gun safety. He always warned me about being stupid with firearms and to never forget to unload a weapon when it was not being used, so I didn't assume the shotgun would have anything in the chamber.

In hindsight I *might* have been able to contact support and get a refund on my preorder even though it was a limited time deal (specifically said you had to buy the card between a certain date)

CapgrasX13,"This moment happens to everyone, it's a totally normal part of the grieving process.  The shock of a loss is always so emotional that it almost seems like a spectacle, but at some point the true implication of the loss really hits you on a spiritual level.  It usually take a year or more for this to happen.  I've even seen it after people lose their dog.

That being said, my biggest bit of advice whenever people are dealing with a death is to try to turn it into a positive somehow.  Meditate on it and try to use it to better yourself.  Maybe there was something your dad was passionate about that he didn't get to do or finish; you could do that in his honor.  Think about the frailty of life and how lucky we all are to have the one we do, and how it's almost foolish to waste a single precious second of it.  There are a plethora of ways to better yourself through tragedy - the best swords are forged in the hottest flames.

Talk to your family about this if you need to.  Or a friend, or complete stranger in a bar, whichever scenario you may be more comfortable with.  (I'm compelled to take an aside to say I'm appalled that the previous two sentences both ended in prepositions...oh well)  Sometimes getting another person's perspective can help you understand moments like this better.

dudesbeingdudes,"I'm gonna assume you're no older than 19. Don't hate her for wanting dick; girls do that. Guys wanna fuck other girls too and you're a fucking liar if you deny it. When you're young you think losing your virginity to someone means you're supposed to be with them forever, but trust me, you need to experience some things. It probably hurts now because you feel like the other guy was better than you and that's why she wants to blow him- he isn't. He'ss just different. We're wired to seek variety in our genes so it's natural to want to test the waters when you're young. 

So enjoy being single homie! And as someone who's been on both sides of this (I was her twice and you once), just chalk it up to her being a fucking kid. You're both just dumb kids that don't know what you want yet, no offense. You'll move on and look back and realize you needed this to happen, but realistically probably not until you've met someone else and inevitably compare the two. You might even overcompensate by going for someone who's the complete opposite of her and tricking yourself into believing she's the one. Then you start having your doubts a couple months down the road but it's already too late; you told her you loved her and you can't go back or you'll look like an idiot so fuck that you need to prove to Amanda you found someone better and Amanda's a bitch! But I digress, and that's a story for another day. You need to make a few mistakes along the way to fine tune what you're really looking for.

So, grieve about it if you need to, but for god's sake don't be the faggot that uses grief to try to get attention from another girl. That shit will only attract the equally emotionally damaged, which you definitely don't want. Unless you want some depraved, crazy, amazing sex. In that case, stick your dick in crazy. You need to have your life threatened a few times (or maybe just your status quo) to realize how much you value it. Anyway, I've been all over the place with this because I think I'm drunker than I think I am. Feel free to ask for clarification because I'm sure I fucked up someone in here.

Once again, enjoy the single life. I'm sure you have the biggest, swinginest dick in all the land OP. The other fish in the sea gon' learn today. Deuces

EDIT: I'd like to add for future reference that ""breaks"" are for pussies. If you can feel the disconnect already, a break isn't going to fix it. Break up like a man and don't become that annoying couple that's always on again off again because your boys will stop giving a shit and won't bother to keep up whether you're with her or not at any given time. Or go on the break. FUck it. I said make mistakes right? Your call. I'll be right behind you ifyouknowwhatimean.jpg all homo",null,4,cdq2wep,1rq3aa,tifu,new,14
smileandmeanit,"I'm not trying to defend her, but sometimes people need to experience other things and other people and a bit of freedom before they can really settle down. 
Given that you both lost your virginity to each other, you've obviously never explored those different possibilities. 
It doesn't feel like it now, when it's raw and fresh, but this is quite possibly the best thing that could have happened to you. You get a somewhat clean break, instead of having it drag on and on until you're both bitter and depressed, and thus the opportunity to go out and really find yourself and find who you are and who you make yourself, without having a right hand lady. 

I'm a huge believer in ""when one door closes, it gives opportunity for another potentially even better door to open"", and I can confidently say that this mantra has proven itself over and over again to me, from both my first relationship to second, and second to current (*and having felt like I could have found ""that guy I wanted to be with forever"" in each of them). All have improved, I've managed to learn things from each and implement to my next.

It hurts now, but you'll be okay. Have faith

tnv91,"This might be a bit late for you to notice, OP, but just a little advice from someone who has felt a fraction of that pain in case you do see it:

1. Get rid. There's no reason for you to stay with her; if you do you'll only be bitter and resent her.

2. More importantly, take some time being single. After a fairly long relationship you really need time to be by yourself again. Sure, it's lonely at first but you will start seeing the benefit soon. When you're in a LTR you don't realise yourself changing as a result of your SO's influence. This isn't to say she's manipulating you but instead you change simply by being around her. And it's so gradual you don't even notice (like your hair growing or another, better example). You become suppressed because you tend to show your SO the side of you that you want them to see. You need time to be yourself again. You became a 'stale' boyfriend for a reason, my man.

3. Like someone else said, cut all ties. I can't stress this enough. The less you see her pop up on your newsfeed and the like, the better. You need to be thinking about you.

4. After a relationship like this you need to be selfish for a while. This doesn't mean taking pregnant ladies' seats on the bus or not feeding your pets. You need to do stuff for YOU. Focus on bettering yourself and moving towards that idealistic image you have of yourself in your head. And if you don't have said image, get one. By taking little steps towards this (be it taking a class, getting fit or eating better) you can take your mind off the pain. This doesn't mean avoiding it (it sounds like you've agonised over it enough, and fair play, she was important to you) but you'll see that improving yourself can be quite therapeutic.

Good luck, you'll be fine. You're not going to look back and laugh at this but you will see it as a turning point. Get out of that rut!

You're shitty relationship ended. Man, that sucks! You're always going to have a deeply set fondness towards her - virginities are a big thing - and that's fine. But don't let this cloud your judgement - she wronged you in an unforgivable way.

Now, I'm not saying you should move on and experience the other fish in the sea. That's bullshit, because you're going to need time to heal. Take some ""me"" time.

Remember the good times, but make sure you learn the lessons from the bad times - it'll make you a better person and a better spouse in future relationships.

Best of luck, dude. Let it go and move on with your life - don't cling to her, but don't grow to despise her.",null,0,cdq6ugi,1rq3aa,tifu,new,1

OriginalityIsDead,"You didn't fuck up dude. You just found out what was beneath the surface, what was always really there. But don't worry, because while today might be tough, might hurt, might put you on the edge of breaking, there's always tomorrow to look forward to. You'll love again, you'll meet new, better people, and some day you might even find someone who will truly cherish you as a partner, and wouldn't think of hurting you in the ways she obviously has. 


Today is the first day of the rest of your life. Appreciate that now is your lowest moment, and it's uphill from here on out as far as relationships go. You now understand heartbreak firsthand. Use that, learn from it, grow with it, and live your life with the knowledge that you've survived this, and can thus survive anything. ",null,1,cdq0izk,1rq3aa,tifu,new,1

alhena,"We have evolved past the need for monogamy and sexual possession.  My boyfriend and I help each other get women, and I have no shortage of males.  Still, who do I live with, who do I cook for, who do I cancel on anyone else in favor of?  My boyfriend.  Yeah, he fucks other girls, but who does he come home to every night?  Not saying this is the solution for you, but you certainly wouldn't feel so destroyed if you had this attitude.  Yes, she desires multiple strange cocks, and that's perfectly ok, normal, healthy, and she deserves no shame for it.  She should just help you get a couple other girl's on your dick, to make it up to you, and then you can go on to have a healthy, open, but committed, relationship.  Or you know, continue to suffer, or find some other girl.  All you can control is your attitude.",null,1,cdq5jio,1rq3aa,tifu,new,1

where the hell do you live that people think they can just walk into your house?

I live in a quiet neighborhood but would flip the fuck out if someone walked to my back door instead of the front, let alone walking into my house.
