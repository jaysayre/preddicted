merry_christmus,"After several complaints about Xbox hardware failures, Santa demands that the four elves in charge of his console division report to his office. They arrive with their little elf hats in their hands. 

""Do you understand how important those consoles were to the children?"" asks Santa. ""Do you?"" He points to the first elf. ""What's the most important thing to you?"" 

""M-my magic hammer,"" says the first elf. ""It was handed down from my great-great-great grandfather. It's how I earn a living. It's irreplaceable."" 

""Bring it here. Let me look at it,"" says Santa. The elf runs off and returns with his hammer, polished in its little velvet case. 

Santa takes it out, turns it in his hands to admire the craftelfship, then snaps it over his knee. He throws the remains in the fire. ""Fuck you,"" he says. ""Get out of my sight."" The elf runs away in tears.

Santa turns to the second elf. ""What's the most important thing to you?""

The second elf shifts nervously. ""Y-your reindeer Rudolph. He saved me from an avalanche when I was a child and we've been best friends ever since.""

""That reminds me. Bring him here. I want to talk to him about a thing."" The elf runs off and returns with Rudolph.

Santa takes a pistol from his desk and shoots Rudoph right between the eyes. The reindeer slumps on the carpet. Santa kicks the poor dead beast in the gut and snaps off his antlers. He levels one velvety antler at the elf. ""Fuck you,"" he says. ""I liked Rudolph. Now get out of my sight."" The second elf runs off in tears.

Santa turns to the third elf. ""What's the most important thing to you? Answer me, now!""

The third elf is in tears already. ""M-my wife, sir. My wife. We've been together seven hundred years. I love her, sir.""

""Bring her here.""

""No!"" screams the elf.

""I just want to meet the lucky lass,"" says Santa. ""Now bring her here.""

The third elf slinks off and returns with a gorgeous rosy-cheeked specimen of female elfhood on his arm. 

Santa unbuckles his belt and drops his red breeches to reveal his fat human dong, huge and erect. Without a word the elf's wife climbs on his desk and excitedly and expertly fellates him. ""There's not an elf woman for five hundred miles that I don't fuck on the reg,"" says Santa. ""They love it. While you work I fuck all of your wives and daughters within an inch of their sanity. Did you really think your elf dick could satisfy her? Is that what she said?"" He finishes and festive spunk blasts from the corners of her ruby-lipped mouth. She milks him and greedily laps up the drops that fall. ""Uuuugh, that's the ticket! Now, fuck you! Get out of my sight!""

The third elf's mind is shattered. He is dragged away by Santa's guards while his wife cleans herself up.

Santa turns to the final elf. ""So. What's the most important thing to you?"" 

The fourth elf mops his brow with a little elf handkerchief. ""I don't know what it might have been yesterday,"" he says. ""But today it's making sure that every Xbox works without so much as a hiccup.""
