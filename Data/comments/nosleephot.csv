JaideDM,I just want to thank you for sharing this and let you know that youre not alone There are other people who see them like you unfortunately Im not one of them I had an Ex who was and some of the most unnerving things Ive experienced were with herShe had what I call Ghosslings attached to her Basically that means a swarm or school of ghosts and they were drawn to her because they knew she could see them At first I thought it was her mothers house that was haunted but no it was her That and some other things led to her developing multiple personalities to deal with the stress so be careful and stay strongYou havent given much information on Michael yet so Im not sure how degraded he is yet but you need to be really careful with him The fact that he still has a name is a good thing actually but youre right about not using it often The more attention you give them the more they will harass youThe worst Id ever seen was the one that stayed in the basement of my Exs mothers house He seemed to need the dank dark space to thrive and according to her he barely resembled anything human anymore I never saw him but the feeling of cold fingers on my neck as he just barely missed me while we ran out of the basement kept me out of there for goodOne thing I noticed in my own experiences Ghosslings avoid religious icons The living room of that house was loaded with LDS Latter Day Saints religious stuff and the ghosts refused to pass through it even the ones that werent harmful I believe it has something to do with the strong religious implications that the dead remain dead and the symbolism of it offends them or keeps them from being around it Id try that but I dont know how actual faith correlates to the items or notAnyway definitely keep us posted and good luck Just know that youre not the only one who has had what you call Otherlings attached to you and draw some solace from that,1,ccztjur,1p6ws0,nosleep,hot,8.0,7

selfesteemupdabutt,I know debunking stories is against the rules but lets face it this subreddit has been in a fast decline lately with nothing but falsified storiesAnd this one this is is the biggest lie in existence just look at her posting history it was made up by a stoned teenager her grammar is atrocious though Ill agree I am not one to talk about bad grammar talks in rranthttpwwwredditcomrranta lot which that alone tells me they have anger issues that the bring up in their stories and if you look youll see other subreddits where she posts storieshttpwwwredditcomrWritingPromptscommentspttwpagoodnewsbadnewsscenariowhereeverythingcdkhqicontext with very similar grammar She also smokes pot not anything wrong with pot however it brings about a creative mindSo in conclusion this story and the husbands are two stories done by a very bored  year old teenager with a daughter mind you so perhaps inspiration for May in these stories Anyways sorry for the long post and again apologize for the breaking of the rules,0,cdln0k3,1p8avq,nosleep,hot,1.0,1

thelurkerx,These things happen all the time though not to this extent  I thought I was crazy when I first started noticing it but I found other people who remembered the same things once I started asking about it  I have several examples of stuff that suddenly changed and very few people seem to realize it  And the more you notice the easier it becomes to spot it  I think that its like a river  Swapping from reality  to  is easy  Maybe you bought a different pair of sunglasses  That might be permanent  Jumping from reality  to  is very difficult and it takes an extreme event and exponential amount of energy  Maybe a house is there that wasnt before or a business that was open is now closed or something  That might be permanent but it might be temporary  When you throw a pebble into a river it makes few ripples and the stream continues on hardly changing at all  Drop a boulder in and it might make swirls and eddies altering the course temporarily  The stream attempts to correct itself following its natural path acclimating as closely as possible to the original flow  When something cataclysmic happens like a major earthquake the stream might be changed permanently  Maybe you get what happens in a situation like the one above  Eventually the natural order tries to reassert itself and things return as closely as they can to normal  In rare circumstances it may be permanent  I once drove by a house which I knew was barn red and it was blue I drove by this house on an almost daily basis and I knew for a fact that it was red  Even though the paint looked like it was peeling and had been in place for some time I stopped backed up and asked the guy in the yard when theyd painted it  He looked at me like I was nuts and said it had been that color for years   I told my roommate about it and he remembered it being red too  We drove back by and it was still blue  Still is as far as I know  I also had this happen on a route I took to work every day  One day there was a large barn size business on the side of the road and I know it hadnt been there the day before  I have friends with similar stories  Most people just shrug it off figure their mind is playing tricks and they forget about it  The freakiest one happened in a rural cemetery  It has a reputation for weirdness anyway and wed witnessed some really strange things there already  Several times we compared notes and wed remember trees and headstones being in different places  One night I swear I saw stones everywhere and as real as they all looked I could walk right through some of them  I couldnt tell which ones were real and which ones werent  My leg got stuck in a hole and my friends kept walking into this fog that had come up and I got the feeling that I had to get their attention or I was never going to see them again  I yelled at the top of my lungs and one of them finally stopped listened turned around and came back  He said he could barely hear me yelling  We wandered around in there one night for an hour and a half even though its relatively small looking for the gate  At one point we looked at the sky and the stars were all wrong  Eventually everything returned to normal and we found our way out but it was strange ,19,cd0m1w6,1p9z8r,nosleep,hot,61.0,42

NicholaRain,I know that this story should be believed as truth and thats fine However Im having trouble where Michael says he gets off work early gets home finds the door ajar and thats when he discovers the screw driver At that moment Michael says he knows that Irene has seen it but how is that possible if he pulled up to the house and immediately went into the man cave area and discovered the screw driver That would take him maybe  minutes In Irenes account of events she got home and saw Michaels car parked outside so that means Michael got home before she did so how would she find the screw driver before Michael without him seeing her when he beelined it down there Anyone else notice this Did I miss something,3,cd1a0w5,1pblkt,nosleep,hot,6.0,3

NotMyCircus,Maybe invest in some sort of nanny cam or some other small camera that you could put either directly in your window or facing your window so he wont see it What scares me the most right now is you have a gaping hole in the side of your house where the tree came through the window which depending on a few things could allow someone easy access into the house without actually having to go through a door or window Do you know ANYONE who could come and stay with you over night Preferably someone who has a weapon and is trained in using it Even if they dont have a weapon it would be better then being alone ,1,cd2hc9n,1pgrak,nosleep,hot,3.0,2

Decembermouse,Do you think he has a way of seeing this postWere I in your shoes Id feel spooked and out of options Something  off  is going on with him People dont just disappear like that You can let him get close and he seems to be ok with you looking at him I dont think you will be able to hurt him but psychology itself is a powerful tool He knows some things you dont  how to find you how to disappear and possibly other things You know things that he doesnt as well you have your own secrets He knows this and it might be why hes interestedNext time you see him meet his gaze and slowly develop a little hint of a smirk Let your eyes move away from him off to the left a bit and let your head turn to the left too like youre anticipating and imagining something only you know about This shows youre confident with him watching you and that you dont need to be staring back at him the whole time and your expression will convey that something has changed Dont make your expression too obvious  just a hint As you shift your gaze back towards him confidently lower your head a little bit and let your posture straighten up a bit Make it look like you are unconsciously shifting to a power pose but dont make it apparent that you are intentionally changing your postureI dont think it will make him go away but its clear there are things that are hidden from his understanding There may be other reasons hes done nothing thats actually harmful but when you subtly convey that you possess some advantage he doesnt know about this will alter his perception of the situation He is less likely to view you as weak or as an easy target,1,cd2obqw,1pi6gj,nosleep,hot,2.0,1

zushiba,gt But is it really all in my headCan I answer this with a post I made regarding someone elses sleep paralysis  meeting with the HaggtShe is real shes not alone They are spectral death soul eaters Sleeping humans attract them like flies to shit They hover around you while you sleep in hopes that youll die and they can eat your soulgtYou can only perceive them when youre close to sleep and your minds eye is allowed to wander free from your body They exist in that realmgtThe tunnel with the light at the end is their throat the light is collected energy of hundreds of thousands of humans that theyve eaten over the centuries slowly digesting over the course of hundreds of thousands of yearsgtThe souls live on in their guts in a perpetual state of blissful dreaming where many think they have died and gone on to meet relatives but that is not the casegtSome of the hags prefer good feelings Gone to heaven others prefer negative feelings Gone to hellgtIf youre lucky and you die while none are around you become a disembodied ghost free to roam about but forever hunted by themgtThe only way to fight them is to learn how to induce a lucid dream state Humans are capable of completely controlling the spectral dream world Its just not easy to do A lucid dreamer is capable of harnessing that reality and using it to do battle with the soul eaters Most lucid dreamers are unaware that they have this power and create a cocoon world where they just jump around and have fun Killing a soul eater grants you the power of all the souls that theyve consumedThese things have been here perhaps longer than Humans have had fire They are represented in every culture Demons SuccubiIncubui  The Old Hag The NightMare Aliens Kanashibari in Japan referring to being bound by metal chains and in the Caribbean its attributed to the souls of unbaptized babies who sit on your chest attempting to steal your life awayNo one can say where exactly they came from Their form is at least related to ours in some way They generally have  arms  legs a head and a torso Could that have existed before us Did they come about because of us Perhaps we simply perceive them as having a somewhat similar form to ours maybe a horrible distortion of the Pareidolia affect Our brains have no real way to understand the creature that were perceiving and so our brain does what it does so well and fills in the gaps assigning vague human features to a creature that is anything but,2,cd3109a,1pifuo,nosleep,hot,4.0,2

Darkdreams,I wish to fully illustrate the fact that I am NOT shitting you in any capacity Everything I have said is completely genuine and based in personal memory both recent and not It occurs to me that I never articulated what the faces looked like Allow me to correct that obvious mistake the faces are definitively inhuman with no more than  exceptions The structure of the head the placement of the eyes none of it fits within the definition of humanity I was happy to not have dreamed last night butI still cannot shake the feeling that they have some dread significance in my life They never blink as they stare at me and every now and again if I lay alone in pitch blackness with my eyes open I catch glimpses of them turning to look at each other randomly Ill fess up and say that I smoke no small amount of pot but its Canada so its everywhere and its pure Anyway a couple years ago I drew up some stuff while I was blitzed out of my mind and I have the strong impression that the idea came from one of the facesIll post the picture here if I can Before anyone asks I only have some idea of the significance of these symbols even though I know that I created them I used to have a complete chart for what symbol meant which concept or stood for which alphabetic letter but it has long since been lost and what little Ive been able to recollect from memory is pitifulI figure that people have heard of the Greys so Ill come out with it do my symbols match up with any other symbols elsewhere httptinypiccomrdegqp,0,cd33w7v,1pitx0,nosleep,hot,2.0,2

NotMyCircus,You should take the sketch of those runes with you when you attended the festival and ask local people if they know the symbols Or ask the local man in charge of the project as soon as you have the chance Maybe just by attending the festival you will see these runes somewhere Im guessing if what the creature says is true and they are intended to keep you safe then youll probably see them more then once I can understand why you might not want to tell people about the entire encounter so just tell them that you came across these symbols that were carved into wood and out of curiosity you copied them down hoping someone could tell you what they mean I definitely agree with pp those runes could be meant to mark you for something other then safety Do some research Good luck and stay safe,0,cd3nz0d,1pkkkg,nosleep,hot,2.0,2

Standardasshole,Great story I really enjoyed it Since the other comment takes it serious ill try not to kill the atmosphere so this is what it is You said that most of the times you saw it in your dreamsnear sleep stance sleep paralysis and such so it might be just you amplifying the tought by overthinking it The brain is a misterious place for example i dont have nighmares anymore ltltthe standard random kindgtgt due to computer games Basically my brain thinks that when something is trying to hurt me i should fight itAlso you mentioned your grandma teaching you tatar prayers and that sounds interesting Could you tell us about your spiritualreligious belief,0,cd3pq13,1plocc,nosleep,hot,1.0,1
Allycat,Spirits and entities will latch onto a person out of no where for the simple fact that the person manipulates energy or magick whether they realize it or not  Lucid dreaming is like taking your inner spirit and exploring the plane of existence that spirits and entities usually livefrequentIts been a few years so this particular spirit has a very good link to you  she also sounds like a strong spirit to start off withThe best thing to do is to learn how to spiritually protect yourself  I recommend talking to your mom further about spiritual protection and house cleansing and you must do it yourself or with anyone willing to help youA Bible itself has very little power because its just an object  Its the faith of the person and their unwavering spiritual belief that produces power thats why your prayer worked good in the dream but wasnt strong enough to completely drive her awayWe can discuss this more if you like  Good luck and brightest blessings for you,0,cd3vlex,1plocc,nosleep,hot,1.0,1
webkitboxshadow,When you encounter your sleep paralysis are you awake or do you just feel awake The reason I ask is when I encounter my nightmares Im usually laying in bed in a dreamwithinadream so I think Im awakeIve had a few night terrors in which Ill scream and either stand backed into the corner on my bed spin in circles with the blanket wrapped around me or dive across the room Ill usually lay down afterwards and wake up immediately after my head hits the pillow because of my scream still echoing in my own earsId say I imagined or dreamt up myself doing these things but in all of those cases I was living with a roommate that confirmed what I believe happened typically by telling me before I even mentioned itThat being said Ive had a few other dreams of me laying in bed very aware of a dark presence in the room Sometimes I talk with this presence commanding them to get out or to leave When I wake up I vaguely remember it but I have no idea if Im awake or asleep,0,cd3wvp0,1plocc,nosleep,hot,1.0,1

PagingDrRed,Have you spoken to the neighbors  Maybe they are having experiences as   well The reason I ask is because if the house shares a basement and was built so long ago I assume it was sub divided into a duplex at some pointI understand you are worried but this doesnt seem malevolent I never believed in ghosts either until I moved into my first place I had similar experiences as you and one day mentioned it to my mom My mom admitted that the realtor disclosed to her that the previous owner had passed in my condo Since I was a first time buyer I didnt understand the legalese that it was written in on the disclosure and my mom told the realtor to not tell me  The reason I mention this is I went from being freaked out to relieved I wasnt losing my mind I was able to get the name of the lady who died and viewed her as part of the house  Maybe you could do the same  Research the house and make friends with the spirit  No joke I once had a horrible horrible migraine and I looked everywhere for my bottle imitrex to no avail I decided to ice pack my head and when I opened the drawer to get a baggie there was one pill  I truely believe she found it and helped me  It never hurts to have lots of friends even spiritual ones,3,cd4z1jr,1pqgrc,nosleep,hot,9.0,6

Empirica,I once lived together with a girl that happened to be cleptomanic and she not only stole some of my stuff sometimes she also rearranged things in my room For example she would mess up my desk eventough she did not take anything from it or pluck out my digital clock I dont want to accuse your roommate or anyone else living in your house There could be another rational  paranormal explanation for these occurances But if actually a real human being is behind your disappearing stuff it probably would not be too unusual for him if he also plucked out the TV and the Playstation for whatever reasonAbout the footsteps on the stairwell I dont really have something like an explanation Are those stairs wooden Because wooden things  furniture sometimes make noises by themselves that go from creaking to thudding That was explained to me as The wood is working Often happens when the temperature changes My desk once produced a thud that was loud enough to wake me from my sleepOf course these noises are mostly very quiet and there is almost never more than one creaking but up to three in a row is also possibleAnyway I hope I could help a little  ,1,cd54j58,1pqgrc,nosleep,hot,2.0,1

mrsstarbuck,Hey OP I know you say that you dont believe in ghosts and Ill admit that these days I sometimes question whether I do or not but when I was a child right up to when I was about  I lived in a house that I believe was for want of a better word haunted And a lot of the things that you describe here also happened to me in my house including things going missing and electrical appliances being disconnected and unplugged Like I remember once my mum buying a new dress and coming home and hanging it in her closet She never ever saw that dress again and even when we eventually moved out and boxed up the entire house it didnt reappear It was just gone And once I remember leaving my bedroom for five minutes to visit the bathroom down the landing I was the only person upstairs at the time and when I got back my record player and speakers had been disconnected and all placed on top of my bed their wires coiled up neatly as if I had been about to pack it away A lot of other things happened too like unexplained noises and once I even saw an apparition although this only happened once in the whole  years that I lived there So although I can understand you not wanting to jump to a paranormal conclusion all I can say is that I never found a human cause to the things I experienced and years later once wed moved out of that house one of the neighbours confessed to my mum that theyd always known that house was funny but they hadnt wanted to say anything while we were living there,0,cd6gh7s,1pqgrc,nosleep,hot,1.0,1

CBT,General tip about the dark  Setting a fire unless you need it for warmth is a terrible mistake  It creates light voids because your eyes cannot adjust properly  Even with a low light at your back you will never be able to see out as well as something else can see in  Also never look directly at your light source  Keep it in your periphery and conserve your night vision as best you can,8,cd587h8,1pqnzu,nosleep,hot,36.0,28

David,It probably is not the house but something in the house Like an old foot locker picked up from a yard sell Around here when they tare down an old house they save and resell things like fancy windows and doors A recycled window or door from a haunted house could be the key I have read that some people think some ghost just get tired of one place and move to another place In any case I think you are OK If after  years nothing bad has happened I see no reason why it should now May sound silly but have you tried talking to it Best to do this while you are home alone so the rest of the family do not think you are crazy ,1,cd5tj9j,1pt0nz,nosleep,hot,8.0,7
PatrickRsGhost,Its not the house itself thats haunted  I dont think the land is that much haunted  Sounds like the events are tied to specific items in the houseIs the dining room set something your mom inherited from your grandfather or grandmother  What about the plates you heard clanking  Did she inherit a china dining set from her mother or her grandmotherA lot of the activity youve described sounds like residual activity to me  Most paranormal sites will describe or liken residual activity to watching a video clip or listening to a sound clip being played over and over  Whenever I read that description I keep seeing the movie Speed when they looped the same five seconds of video over and over to fool the bad guy  Residual activity is more like watching a rerun of a TV show  Usually that rerun is aired on a certain night or right after another rerun was aired right before it such as a TV series playing in syndication  Or you could look at it like a holiday special  The holiday special be it Rudolph the RedNosed Reindeer Garfields Halloween or Be My Valentine Charlie Brown is only played on or close to the holiday in question  Very rarely will you see a Halloween special being played in the middle of Summer except maybe a Halloween episode of a syndicated TV show as Id described beforeWhat youve described sounds like residual energy that had attached itself to the objects  Perhaps the dining room set and the plates were wellloved and used a lot in the past and so what you heard was a replay of them being used at some longago special dinner  The object your sister heard falling might have been some heavy piece of furniture that you have that might had been dropped or fallen at some point in the past usually resulting in some dramatic event like if it fell and killed someone or if a nowdeceased cat knocked it over and caused it to break something else and whoever owned the piece befores emotions are still tied to the objectA lot of paranormal investigators have found that spirits are not only tied to places be it land or a building but to single objects as well  There have been multiple reports over the years some recorded by wellknown paranormal investigators like the Warrens Hans Holzer John Zaffis and many others where the haunting was not centered around a house or land but rather some common object  It could be anything from a piece of jewelry or article of clothing which would be most widely acceptable since theyre kept closer to the person to even something as odd as say a candy bar wrapperIt sounds to me that whoever owned the items that seem to have the most activity surrounding them is checking up on the objects making sure theyre still in good repair  Perhaps your family isnt using them as often as they should and perhaps the spirit is reminding you theyre there and what theyre to be used for,3,cd60ilc,1pt0nz,nosleep,hot,7.0,4

friendsareshit,I agree that the land might be haunted I moved into an apartment  years ago the day they finished building them brand new Ive seen people here native americans mostly in the dead of night Way before my town even existed it was a reservation and many of the people died and were buried here So when a house or building is erected on top of haunted land the spirits can easily come into the building It doesnt sound like the spirits want to harm you It may just be checking the place out seeming as how there wasnt always a house there Kind of like looking through your things it would explain the dishes and the chairs,1,cd5xwah,1pt0nz,nosleep,hot,2.0,1
TheGentlemanGrizzly,My parents built the house I am living in currently before I was born so its really only about  years old However the  foundation of the house is over  years old There have been a few paranormal occurrences eg footsteps following me around paintings falling electronics randomly shutting down even though this house is relatively new and the only dead thing that would be hanging around is an old family pet and some of these events even occurred when she was around I can only attribute these happenings to very old land the house is on However these spirits have never been angry or harmful and it doesnt seem like yours are either Be vigilant but dont be scared ,1,cd67x9a,1pt0nz,nosleep,hot,2.0,1
spiritrider,I too grew up in a haunted house and it was built brand new for us as well The little sounds no biggie You saw a silhouette so you definitely have a resident But it doesnt sound malicious And you are not scared of the sounds or knocks this is good If it was evil you would feel the evil intention However your house may be a portal mine was Im not sure if it was the grounds it was built on or what but at first the entities in my house were friendly As time went on a few very evil things came into our house One of them has followed me all of my life now It no longer tries to hurt or control me but it is drawn to me Id like to know how things go for you,0,cd6txps,1pt0nz,nosleep,hot,1.0,1

johnxreturn,I had a dream of similar proportion It was past midnight the stars shone beautifully and gently You could see the whole galaxy as though there were no lights around us for at least a hundred miles I was hugging my ex on her backyard we could just stare endlessly at the stars I saw a little grey object hovering the moon and felt something was wrong The object turned to the moon and seemingly shot blue beams into it and half of the moon blew away scattering small fragments around its own frail orbit The grey object kept on blowing the pieces one by one until the moon was no more My jaw was hanging open I was flabbergasted I looked up but there was no moon anymore how could that be All of the sudden terror struck and I knew there would be consequences for not having a moon anymore Something to do with the oceanAs the sun broke through the trees my father arrived but my ex was no where to be seen probably fled with her family My father hugged me and told me he couldnt leave me here to die alone Then I looked up and there was a huge tsunami coming probably about a mile tall and it engulfed us all,10,cd5wmza,1pt5uh,nosleep,hot,43.0,33

Arbitrator,my approach to safety is to carry a tactical knife and i also know  martial arts so anyone stupid enough to mess with me will hopefully regret it my best advice is be prepared with a weaponbooby trapping is often illegal so i would refrain from doing that unless you can get some kind of ok from your local police chiefthis person has some kind of fascination of you espeically if he took your clothing where i live there was some guy who was breaking into womens houses and putting their undergarmets on their sheets while they slept and just stared until they woke up and ran out so youre dealing with someone who is not stable this feels a lot like penpal and eventually they should stop the thing about obsession means they may not want to kill you but they may if they feel like they cannot have something from you but i would advise you know how to handle a knife and keep one near you but hidden at all times also never stay somewhere alone always have someone else around if you hear something youre more likely to have eyes on this person with two people and youre more likely to have someone call the police having a cell phone is good to because it means you can call  anywhere so you can leave your house as well,0,cd8jeoq,1pufa7,nosleep,hot,1.0,1

Arbitrator,an updateI saw her as she entered my room this morning and she walked straight through the door so either shes a some kind of halucination brought on by sleep deprivation or shes not corporeal but when she walks its normal but sometimes its almost like she teleports but not so much that she can teleport but i cant react fast enough to see her walk so i left the room to follow the blood trail and she just stayed in my room it ended on the front porch my roommate was slightly confused as he seems unable to see the blood trail i went back upstairs to my room and sat down and looked up at her she was just standing there and then i heard a voice it wasnt someone talking it was like everything else had no sound and it rang in my head silencing any kind of hearing or mental ability the words i heard sounded like they came from a woman who was at least  to  perhaps older i feel old i feel dead where the words i heard when i looked up she disappeared im not sure what this means i feel like they were trying to communicate but i dont even have a name to call them by if i was going to but i dont think its the spirit of a little girl im seeing it seems like someone much older who perhaps has chosen to appear as they were when they were young or maybe they appear in that form for some other reason,0,cd77orv,1pvcfc,nosleep,hot,2.0,2

Allycat,Start off from the basics and learn to feel the energy around you againSit next to something alive like a tree and close your eyes and clear your mind  Picture the alive object in your mind until you start to see a kind of glow or aura around itThe energy you feel should be warm feeling  Practice a lot until you can feel the aura of many things  Try feeling many different auras at once  After you get a good feel for that sit by yourself and start to feel your own auraOpening up your own energy will be a stepping stone its ultimately up to you to use your energy to open up the sense you locked  It might not happen all at once so dont give up and good luckEdit  Your third eye is located in the middle of your forhead  To open this go into deep meditation and locate your third eye  Opening it is like watching a rose bloom and open in front of your eyes,0,cd7gqyx,1pymq6,nosleep,hot,3.0,3

racrenlew,Yeah I think a corpses face would make you stinky Why not find a doc whod perform an actual face transplant You might even find one thatd work pro bono Just dont dig someone up okay That would kind of turn you into Ed Gein httpenmwikipediaorgwikiEdGein Good luck ,2,cd7ms3z,1pzgif,nosleep,hot,4.0,2
tsukinon,Your biggest concern wont be the face rotting off though that will be an issue It will be your own immune system attacking it  The donor face would need to be genetically compatible and even then you would need immunosuppressant drugs  In fact a Chinese man who was the recipient of a facial transplant in  died in  in part because he stopped taking his immunosuppressant drugs  Second a dead donor wouldnt work because the tissue would have already started to die  Finally even if you had an appropriate face its not just a matter of removing it and sewing it on  You would have to remove your own face and then use microscopic needles to connect arteries veins muscle and nerves then suture on the new face  Its a long and complicated procedure that can take up to thirtysix hours and four people have died from complicationsIf youre really invested in this ideayou should do what the others suggested and look into doctors that could perform reconstructive surgery or maybe a transplant  ,2,cd7t6wz,1pzgif,nosleep,hot,4.0,2

Skirtz,My parents said I would do some creepy things when I was a only a few years old this was before I could talk so I guess it doesnt follow the topic exactly but it kinda fits Apparently when I was little I would just stare at nothing My mom would see me in my room staring into space and when shed come back Id still have my eyes fixed on the same spotThat may not be too spooky but what IS spooky is that while spacing out sometimes my eyes would follow something around the room but there would be nothing there and it actually seemed like I was staring AT something Sometimes Id also apparently jump and flinch suddenly and turn my head to look at something as if Id just heard a loud noise that had startled me Except I was deaf for the first three years of my life which is when all this was happening and there wouldnt be any actual soundSo yeah I was too young to remember any of that but according to my parents it happened They always said that it was just me listening and talking to angels,29,cd7vcsk,1pztbc,nosleep,hot,84.0,55

HereToReddit,i really struggle to grasp the concept of this whole parallel universe thing first of all lets just say hypothetically there was life in other galaxies or universes how is it physically possible for one person to see something from that galaxyuniverse i dont understand the logic behind this furthermore what are the chances of you seeing yourself in that portal when there would probably be just as many people in that other world could somebody maybe dumb it down and go explaintomelikeimfive mode i believe there is a chance in ghosts and that paranormal stuff but this is more sciency that should usually follow a scientific logic what intrigues me is the number of people in history and now that have claimed to come by their parallel universe version of them or doppelganger it all is so strange yet fascinating i wonder if ill ever encounter this However for now im skeptical yet i cant look past so many accounts of this happening Edit spelling,0,cd8rpn7,1q1eq4,nosleep,hot,2.0,2

Chales,Never attack anything like this outright they have rules they have to follow as long as you dont play their game and let them into your house they cannot harm you its in their nature They may try to scare you intimidate you but it is all a farce if they could harm you whenever they wanted youd be dead already But you must not strike themYou dont know the exact rules You dont know whether these things are physical or ghosts or whatever If you hit them it might allow them to hurt you Honestly Id avoid making any physical contact with them at all You took measures against them with the salt line which is a start but since they are coming to you away from your house now it is time you get some sort of talisman something that is meaningful to you and tailored to you A cross wont do jack shit for you if it means nothing to you Anything can be a talisman so long as it deeply at the pit of your being means something to you Can you tell us a little bit more about how your dog acts Does it get quiet and scared or does it just not seem to careBe careful and be safe,1,cd9joeo,1q41rf,nosleep,hot,3.0,2

Oak,Now this is some thing that I was thinking of that might help Its to get a camera and film your doors This way if you do see another one you will have some proof to show your husband so he doesnt think your insane I havent read up on the BEK yet but from the little reading I have done doesnt say they dont show up on camera Having a camera film your doors will also help with figuring out why your salt line was wavy,0,cd97yiu,1q41rf,nosleep,hot,1.0,1

WillOTP,Formatted Story  Minor EditsIt was some time after an awesome party It was  and me and my buddies had a great time at my friends house I was ready to crash on the couch for the rest of the night but the wiser decision was probably to go to my actual bed Or so I thought It was pretty lonely me being half an hour away from the city I slipped into some sweatpants and a long tshirt It would have to do I was too tired to do anything otherwise It was a beautiful summer night out here in the quiet woods I liked and appreciated the nature And yet for some odd reason I was restless Unsettled It was an odd feeling Like being watched I brushed off my nervousness and concentrated on getting some sleep I walked to the bathroom which was right across from my bedroom Convenient I turned on the tap to wash my face Anxiously I closed my eyes and filled my cupped hands with water splashing it on my face I opened my eyes to grab a nearby white towel Regaining my senses I entered my room Then I noticed something I hadnt seen before There lying in front of me were a pair of bloody scissors The blood was still wet It was new I tried to come up with a logical explanation for blood being on the scissors Maybe I had cut my ankle on accident while walking out of my room I checked my feet There was no scars or dried blood on anything Nothing that indicated a cut The blood drained out of my face No I didnt remember cutting myself on accident or not I picked the scissors up I threw them away trying to forget Id even found them in the first place hoping Id eventually forget about it I told myself it never happened concentrating on the other tasks at hand I had two dressers one of which had a big window beside it I also owned a big placeable mirror one you couldnt hang up Every night I would switch the mirror to the dresser facing the window so that you could see the window through the mirror just to reflect the beautiful night As I hefted it up I felt a chill crawl up my spine and I could feel it ringing in my head What kept giving me these unsettling feelings As I was about to place the mirror on the dresser I could see through the mirror that a pale white face appeared in the window It wore a creepy wide smile with yellowed worn out teeth as if it ate metal Yet its teeth were sharp and pointed which was strange The corners of its mouth were bloody Its eyes stared at me They were huge gaping eyes as if they were looking not only at me but if they were looking right through me tearing my soul and being I couldnt tell if it was male or female I couldnt even tell if it was HUMAN I wanted to scream but my voice caught in my throat For five seconds I just stared at it It seemed like time stopped It stared back Then the face moved away in a millisecond Thats what got me back into motion I dropped the mirror It shattered into pieces at my feet wincing as a few fragments of glass pierced my bare leg I backed away too scared to make a sound I was breathing quietly but heavily I heard my front door open Frantically I ran to close my door I leaned against it My heart crept into my throat pounding constantly I thought about its face The bloody corners of its mouth as if it had been cut My eyes lingered to where I had thrown the scissors Oh no But how I tried to find an answer It was in my house It cut its mouth into a smile With the scissors Why was it outside now It had obviously been in here recently But then the truth unearthed itself I mouthed the answer IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN HERE I couldnt believe it I tried not to believe it Then the power went out Great The opening of the screen door broke my thoughts It was inside My breathing stopped Its footsteps were loud It walked at a slow pace I inhaled It stopped I sensed it could tell where I was But it walked to the kitchen I could hear it rummaging through the drawers I heard a metal scraping sound It was pulling out a knife Tightly I closed my eyes Tears ran down my cheeks I slid down the door sitting down on the floor I was going to die It swirled around hearing my quiet sobbing It made its way toward my bedroom It stopped at my door I could hear its breathing through the crack It spoke in my ear COME OUT COME OUT AND PLAY WITH ME Its voice was hoarse and sounded tripled as if there was three voices talking at once I froze When I did not answer it spoke again whispering LISTEN TO ME COME OUT YOU CAN HEAR ME I KNOW YOU CAN It sounded wistful as if it were a child wanting a friend I reached in my pocket for my cell phone It wasnt on me No I slumped against my door The voice screamed LET ME IN I KNOW YOURE IN THERE LET ME IN It slid its knife through the crack in the door barely missing my arm My phone was on the other side of my room My mind raced Dare I make a break for it I slid my leg and tried to grab my phone with my toes It slid away I bit my lip I had to grab it I quietly slinked away from the door hoping the psycho wouldnt notice I grabbed around the pitch black room for my phone I felt a flat rectangular shape slide into one of my hands My phone I dialed  Holding the phone up to my ear a womans voice said Sorry we could not locate any reception to your phone Please try again I kept dialing over and over again I had forgotten all about that THING coming into my room Slowly the door opened There it was It laughed hysterically FOUND

puddlesofblood,UPDATE IS NOW IN THE STORYSaturday morning I woke up and saw the box on my desk Mass confusion hit me until I remembered Oh wait the gift I fumbled with it and put it back down I had to run some errands that morning and decided that Id open it that afternoon when I got homeI went out for the whole day My feet were sore when I got back in maybe because I hadnt walked around like that for so long Whatever the case may be I collapsed on my bed and dozed offWhen I woke up it was  PM and my room was completely dark The TV in the living room was blaring about selling me the latest blenders with four blade technologyI lay in bed for a few more minutes then I rolled over my eyes landing on the small box Okay I thought to myself Lets open this puppy up I was mimicking my favorite line from one of my favorite video gamesI grabbed a pair of scissors from the cupholder the blue glow from the TV set in the other room was just enough light for me I was careful to be very gentle with the box just in case something was triggered by touch The scissors glided over the tape and I was in I folded back the cardboard gentle and slowly Before peering inside I held my breath,20,cdb30wx,1qb9ij,nosleep,hot,137.0,117

ShadeeLeeann,You both took your hands off the planchette before closing the circle you opened a door when you started that game Metaphorically your fingers physical contact with the glass were the hold you had to the doors handle That contact grounded and confined a small section of the spiritual realm to only that glass planchette When you let go you lost your grip on said door and the choice of who  or what  passes through the threshold You left an entryway for spirits to come and go as they please In your home no less Now they dont even need an invitation to invade your and your familys life You already gave it to them That was a foolish thing to do By what youve described of him trust me when I say the entity you summoned is not your friend I sincerely hope you find a way to close it very soon ,3,cdbsn80,1qddby,nosleep,hot,39.0,36

CallMeYourGod,Youve got to destroy that board There is a pretty specific set of steps to follow as wellCut the board into  piecesBurn each piece separately sprinkling salt into the fire as you doTake the ashes from each piece and put them into glass jars filled with salt water Tie a red ribbon around the mouth of each jarTake the planchette and submerge it in another saltwater jar tying it off with red ribbon just like the others DO NOT BREAK ITTake each jar and bury it in a separate location far from where you liveAfter that perform a home cleansing by burning sage in every room while loudly and firmly revoking the invitation of any spirits into your homeIf all that doesnt work get a priest,3,cdcahhc,1qddby,nosleep,hot,4.0,1
Womaninblack,Always close the session after you are done using a ouija board or any time you call upon an entity of an other realm to communicate with You can do so my saying some variation of this session is closed Failure to do so will open a doorway where entities can travel freely through and attatch themselves to you It appears this one wasnt malicious but be careful in the future You might not be as lucky,1,cdcci9s,1qddby,nosleep,hot,2.0,1
musicboy,I had played with a Ouija board myself back when I was in high school Honestly my first encounters were good Whatever this spirit was it claimed to be my grandmother I had some of my friends play while I was in the room but not a part of the circle and had them ask questions about her that only I knew the answer to and they were true Well eventually as we kept playing it was no longer this kind spirit we had been talking to It was someone who referred to itself as D It no longer had any interest in answering any of our questions and it only was interested in making threats I didnt dispose of it right away I kept it in my closet but never played with it Tapping noises kept happening in my closet so I put it outside in the trunk of my car to keep it out of my house Well then the tapping moved from my closet to the window right outside my bedroom I was scared but shortly after I was involved in a car accident which completely totaled my car but not the other two cars involved and the Ouija board was still in the trunk Since the accident I no longer have the board and the paranormal incidents have stopped I dont know whether their are good spirits you can encounter with the Ouija board or if they are just manipulative but it is something I no longer feel comfortable messing with Also sorry about the bad writing ,0,cdg7jwg,1qddby,nosleep,hot,1.0,1

Explodingtaoster,So Im gonna get down votes for this I know it just irks me a little when people blatantly jab at a perfectly good piece of writing Thats the thing about the dad hes been driven mad by the years of unlucky events which started when his son was born So following the logic behind an insane mind kill the source of the unlucky events and it all gets better And of course nobody looks down on the guy with  murders nobody knows its him it specifically says the authorities cant track the murders But it was very obvious that the father tried to kill his eleven year old son so of course people will be ashamed of it I mean Im all for constructive criticism but complaining about points that are perfectly justifiable makes me mad and ashamed honestly Personally I found this very well done and if youre willing to call the writer out on things that make no sense to be called out on make something better yourself ,5,cdd0dm4,1qgzgd,nosleep,hot,10.0,5

Coho,I know Im not a paranoid schizophrenic To use this specific term means youve probably looked up the symptoms Wouldnt you want to rule that out as a possibility and discuss these events with a therapist before approaching your neighbors about it I know I would  just to explore all my options and try to avoid the more terrifying possibility The human mind has been rigorously studied by doctors and has an enormous list of methods that can be used to further its health Ghosts and paranormal entities usually dont have answers Only more problems Not a doubt  just a suggestion to explore all other options before jumping into a potentially dangerous situation,1,cdd0fa7,1qh9i9,nosleep,hot,7.0,6
NotMyCircus,Please read this whole comment Nope Dont do it Dont go ask your neighbors I suffered from a form of psychosis for a short period of time where nearly everything you have talked about happened to me I heard voices discussing everything I was doing in my home I started to think it was the neighbors or something and the voices told me to go ahead and just knock on their door That theyd tell me what was going on Out of fear of looking insane I didnt Once I noticed that they followed me to any home I went to ie my moms apartment my dads house my place I knew it had to be me There was no way that someone could be watching me in every single place and that I could hear them I went to the doctor sought help they started prescription meds and the voices went away I stopped taking the meds shortly after and Ive never heard them since My psychosis was only temporary In my case the voices sounded exactly like those of my closest friends I was convinced they were playing a prank on me messing with me That they had somehow rented the place next to mine or were hiding somewhere in my place Sorry this was so long It really freaked me out reading this It is EXACTLY what I went through If you want to talk more about my experience feel free to message meEdited for spelling,2,cddbpxs,1qh9i9,nosleep,hot,7.0,5

DustWarden,How long have you lived there  do you know your neighbors  You could just introduce yourself and tell them you think youve been hearing their conversations through the walls  dont say anything about thinking theyve been watching you  and see how they react  If they really did ask you to come over presumably they have something to say to you  If they act innocent you can always just say you were concerned for their privacy and wanted them to know then go home and assume youre nuts  Or if youre sure youre not crazy at least youll know whos over there   ,0,cdd2bes,1qh9i9,nosleep,hot,1.0,1

Tito,Okay this is something very interesting as i have had the same experience as you had  heavy weight was on my back and I felt something holding my hands down I gasped for breath while the air was slowly being pressed out of my lungs This is very similar to what i experiencedis it possible that you heard a ring In your ear or some sort of wierd noise appart from what it said  EDITFolk belief in Newfoundland South Carolina and Georgia describe the negative figure of the hag who leaves her physical body at night and sits on the chest of her victim The victim usually wakes with a feeling of terror has difficulty breathing because of a perceived heavy invisible weight on his or her chest and is unable to move ie experiences sleep paralysis This nightmare experience is described as being hagridden in the Gullah lore The Old Hag was a nightmare spirit in British and also Anglophone North American folklore Its am but im starting to find out things Sleep paralysis does it have to do with something paranormal or is it somethign else  ,0,cdds4ze,1qhi2v,nosleep,hot,2.0,2
VisuallySilent,gt a heavy weight was on my back and I felt something holding my hands down I gasped for breath while the air was slowly being pressed out of my lungsI thought I was going to pass out I knew this wasnt Bella and I couldnt scream for help A squeak escaped my mouth when I felt a breath of air near my right ear brushing my hair to the side Shaking from panic and the pain I heard a deep hoarse voice whisper in my ear Youre mineThis to me sounds EXACTLY like sleep paralysis A friend of mine had an almost identical experience,1,cddmwl8,1qhi2v,nosleep,hot,2.0,1

DemonsNMySleep,Giving the dog away might not help it in the end Animals may have shorter memory spans but it might take years to get her out of the habits shes developed while in your care if she were to go to another owner and even then she might just simply be traumatized by the incident Its sort of silly to say but if given a choice and given what I know about dogs and how fiercely loyal they are she probably wouldnt want you to give her away Plus shes your only advantage here,2,cddux67,1qhi2v,nosleep,hot,3.0,1
Korthie,Sleep paralysis is a very scary thing and is more powerful than you realize I know of someone who over and over had a demon that would show up in their case and talk to them I cant remember it all specifically but they talked about it when I was trying to find answers for my case saw a very intimidating and large male step out of my bathroom put his finger up in a shhh motion held up a knife in his other hand and slipped back into the bathroom Ive had it other times too but they were all giant spiders on my ceilingThough I dont have an answer for how your dog got outsideBut I agree that it probably isnt in your dogs best interest to give her away If she wont go around anyone else it doesnt seem ideal to give her away,0,cdeiul8,1qhi2v,nosleep,hot,1.0,1

casewall,The weight thing blows my mind Ive heard so many people mention that to me Its gotten to the point where whenever someone suggests that theyve been experiencing it Im immediately able to confidently respond with Oh thats a demon What interests me the most is that when you were talking about the pressure I couldnt stop thinking about Psalm  which is Yet You are holy O You who are enthroned upon the praises of Israel Psalms  NASB The translation of this is pretty literal as its saying that God Himself SITS on our praises As in when He is praised He wants to dwell there be around or join the party if you will Then I started to think about the opposite If I believe that verse to be a truth about God would it be totally ridiculous for me to imagine that the enemy andor those who represent his domain does the exact same thing with fear Its believed that when people are praising God they are intentionally inviting Him in and because Hes the gentleman that He is He comes seizes the opportunity to show Himself Demons are not gentlemen and they dont require an invitation which is a scary thought But if one is delivered I can imagine that theyd seize that opportunity in a similar fashion to what youve experiencedVery happy to hear that the torment has ended Regardless of what you believe or know it sounds like someone wanted you to keep the character and soul that you were born with,4,cdeui95,1qm84c,nosleep,hot,8.0,4
garyojis,Im glad to hear youre fine I can tell you though that you have opened up a doorway Even though you havent had any other attacks these things can still find you and harm you One of the only ways to be rid of them is to be baptized Even then with the passages you read there is no telling if that will help I not only worry for you but your soul as well,3,cdekqgz,1qm84c,nosleep,hot,8.0,5
Kodakaidojo,For some reason I kept reading the title of your story as My experience with demonic forest I kept sitting here thinking when are they going to get to the part in the forest  Im going to go right ahead and blame that on stress lolWhatever it was that was happening Im glad its over for you and that things have gotten back to normal Stay safe,5,cdeir70,1qm84c,nosleep,hot,8.0,3

jenna,This was such a creepy story Ive had similar experiences with dark forces I had a very religious upbringing and was always told it was the work of the Devil As I got older I began to question my faith and the existence of God I often wonder what exactly it was Ive encountered throughout my life I cant say for sure whether God exists either But I know beyond the shadow of a doubt there is something out there It has malevolent intentions ,2,cdey9hh,1qm84c,nosleep,hot,3.0,1
hirimaru,Well not all demons are angels that are fallen only a few in the bible were ever recorded as fallen Angels became Demons The first few demons were human souls that were turned into demons by making them twisted and sadistic Lucifer isnt really a demon per say hes an fallen Archangel that doesnt like humanity So Demons are really spirits of humans gone evil from Lucifer making them more powerful or by another demon,3,cdev3zu,1qm84c,nosleep,hot,3.0,0

wobblerlorri,I dont think theres really any such thing as demonic forces in the way Christianity means it The very word demon descends from the Greek word daimon which means a guiding spiritIts my considered opinion after decades of study that there exists a sort of entity that for lack of a better term can be called elementals There are benign elementals nonaligned elementals andmalignant elementals I believe they feed off attention from humans and can grow to be either very very helpful or very very dangerous depending on the energy and attention you put into themSounds to me like you drew the notice of some nonaligned or malignant elementals and all the energy you put into them came back to you in a very negative way Glad you were able to counter it with positive action and energy ,6,cdeqa9y,1qm84c,nosleep,hot,4.0,-2

JMFargo,EDIT TO ADD OP fixed the walloftext post but Ill leave this here since I went through the trouble to do thisI was trying to forget forget how happy I was how much I enjoyed that time with him But seeing the event in the newspaper made the memory rush back to me like a swarm of bees The headline read Jack Townsmen found dead killer remains unknown I couldnt believe he was gone Even now I do the same as I did when I first found out he was dead I kept dying it to myself over and over again Whenever I think back on the event the tears always come rushing to my eyes I loved that moment craving for it to last forever But he ended up dying ending our beautiful moment Why Why did he have to die Jennifer ran to me and pushed me half way off the seat as she sat on the other half it was towards the end of class during freetime My thoughts were interrupted when she saw what I was reading and asked Oh my god Im sorry Liz Are you okay What kind of question is that Im reading a story about my boyfriend found dead along with an unidentified killer out there You dont try to comfort me you dont even look sad all you do is ask if Im okay Stuff like this always pisses me off about people Jack always used to do that with me Its okay though I should stay calm Me and Jennifer will have fun wont we DING DING DING Oh thank god saved by the bell from talking to her Guess that term really does apply in life Saved by the bell Funny Walking home now I try and relive the memory of that beautiful moment But like always with precious moments its never the same feeling Again I should stay calm I have all the memories in the pictures I took Looking at his face his eyes The memory brings such peace to my mind The smiles I had in these pictures god that really was the happiest moment of my life All because of my sweet boyfriend Jack Grabbing the bloody knife in my hands its all running back to me now How clueless and blind he was how he always sugar coated everything and never really cared The exact thing that literally drives me insane with people The pleasure the happiness I got from finally taking that knife and stabbing it inside his stomach How wide his eyes got The blood gushing from his wounds and mouth I kept on stabbing him letting all that built up anger release How hard I laughed in that moment how I felt that piece of paradise everyone always dreams about And like always no one ever suspects the innocent loving girlfriend who lost her boyfriend I miss that moment with Jack almost as if I want to do it again But who would my next victim be if I were to choose to do it again This question has constantly been bugging me for the whole day now Trying to think of someone looking at someones face in school that just gave me the feeling that they should be next Come on think whos someone thats similar to Ja Wait a minute Jennifer Yes her perfect My best friend Jennifer who I obviously love so dearly I must call her find a way to meet up with her Picking up the phone I called Jennifer Hey Jennifer Want to come over later I asked Oh yeah sure Liz sounds great Perfect so much easier when your victim comes to you Now then a plan Oh thats easy well lead her to my closet Show her the bloody knife show her the pictures and then well have the most beautiful best friend moment in all of history Of course it wont be as pleasurable as with Jack but itll still be nice looking at her The shock so easily shown from her face and eyes Asking me why over and over again Then just finally seeing her choke on her words as the blood finally gushes from her mouth Itll be quite enjoyable I just have to find a way to lure her to my closet I could just shut off the power Yes thats exactly what Ill do Ill just shut off the power and scream her to come and help me Itll be so easy due to the fact of how gullible she is DING Oh There goes the doorbell Lets not keep sweet Jennifer waiting after all It is going to be the most amazing best friend moment in history wont it,1,cdekklr,1qnj81,nosleep,hot,2.0,1

FizzlexMutt,To anyone who doesnt understand the story did you listen to the lyrics of the songs or just read the titles It seems pretty clear or at least heavily implied especially if you listen to the entirety of each song that the music was a message from an ex of Nancys who had done time in prison and got out to find that she had moved on to a relationship with the OP It also seems that hes pretty unhappy with this The only thing that might hint at it being something supernatural in origin is the fact that everything is dated to the s or around thereI find the last line in the final song to be especially chillingBest of luck to the OP in the future If its not something bound to the resort hopefully hes not smart enough to have gotten your information from the license plate number and car type and track you down,9,cdf18yd,1qnn1m,nosleep,hot,22.0,13

hirschey,This reminds me of a story about an experience that my mom had when I was little She was very close with her grandfather who lived about two and a half hours away at the beach My parents would bring me there a few times a month to see him because he had a soft spot for me When he was in his late eighties he wasnt doing well and ended up being admitted to the hospital Everyone pretty much knew that he only had a few days left and it was only a matter of time before he passed away It was the summer of  I was a year and a half and my mom had just gotten pregnant with my sister Her grandfather was the first person my parents told because they new it would make him happy during his last few days He was so excited and he said that he hoped she would turn out just like me I feel horrible for not remembering him but I was very little at the time I have a very vague and most likely constructed memory of sitting on his lap in my house and repeatedly spitting out a green pacifier I doubt it actually happened but I like believing that I can remember even a tiny piece of himAnyway my parents and I had just visited Pop for the weekend and my mom decided that we should go back home Sunday evening so she could work the next day She really struggled with that decision because she wanted to be there with him at the end whenever it would come That night while she was sleeping at home in what later became my childhood bedroom my mom woke up at around  am and she thought she saw her grandfather sitting at the foot of the bed looking at her comfortingly She said that by his expression he seemed to be telling her that everything would be okay Then he disappeared and my mom went back to bed thinking the whole thing was some weird dream The next day her stepgrandmother Pops third and significantly younger wife called and told my mom that her grandfather had died at around  am that night My mom believes that he really did come to say goodbye and she has never forgiven herself for not staying with him at the hospital that night Im not religious and because I love science I dont really believe in the supernatural but the hopeless romantic in me wants to believe that Pop really did stop by that night,1,cdfiqvs,1qonsw,nosleep,hot,11.0,10
corrosivefemale,My grandmother once thought I was possessed because I was having a fit she took away my favorite doll and because Im left handed so she threw holy water on me I freaked out because it was so damn cold but she took it as a sign of the devil so she put me in an ice cold bath literally with ice and locked me in the bathroom for what I think was an hourThat was the last time my mom left us with her alone ,2,cdfkcml,1qonsw,nosleep,hot,10.0,8

Lulu,I just had my first sleep paralysis experience today while I was at work I work as a Nurses Aide for a family and often take naps on the job as theres nothing else to do while the lady I take care of is also sleeping and normally I dont fall into a deep sleepNeedless to say it scared the crap out of me and I didnt know what had happened at first I thought some demon had taken ahold of me until I looked into it It happened a few times but at first I didnt see anything and snapped out of it quick The last time I thought I woke up but couldnt move and my eyes would barely open and I saw a black figure across the room near the lady I take care of I tried reaching for my phone to make it play a noise to snap myself out of this but I of course couldnt move The next thing I knew the black figure was next to me whispering no pictures Then I felt like I pushed the figure away and was able to open my eyes and moveIve never heard of sleep paralysis before today and having it happen to me for the first time then see thisI dont want to go to bed now,0,cdg9pao,1qs3hz,nosleep,hot,7.0,7

agarci,i had the same paralysis as well except i also got them when im face down face up i feel there is someone or something just beyond the corner of my eye and when Im facedown that someone or something is on my back holding me down the way ive dealt with it is i start getting angry and pissed eventually that fucker goes away its been a while maybe yrs since my last episode i eventually grew the courage to look behind the door once the impending doom began to overtake me once i looked beyond the door and saw nothing i felt a feeling of emptiness as opposed to relief for some weird reason ,0,cdfxbc7,1qs3hz,nosleep,hot,2.0,2
Ethanacho,Ive experienced sleep paralysis twice The first tune was back in school  years ago I was seconds from falling asleep and rolled to one side and SNAP My body froze up and I started seeing beings flying around the room It wasnt scary at all just strange I eventually sm later shook myself awake and that was that The second time however was a much different experience Approximately two years after the first experience I was staying at my parents house for a few nights I was trying to pass out on the futon and half asleep I rolled to one side Suddenly my body became frozen like before but I felt very strange like an impending doom was near I looked at the couch parallel to the futon and on the back of it was a toad its eyes glowing red The toad sort of flopped down onto the cushions of the couch and continued staring Then out of the corner of my eye I say a black cat enter the room Its eyes again red It walked towards me oh so slowly and I knew my time had come I tried screaming for help but the only sound I could make was a faint moan Finally I was able to snap out of it and proceeded to avoid sleep at all costsThis has never happened since thank Allah,1,cdg3if9,1qs3hz,nosleep,hot,3.0,2
MLaw,You had me after the nd paragraph It only happens to me when I lie on my back as well which is so frustrating because I am so comfortable lying on my backThe worst is when I actually manage to shake myself out of it believe I am actually awake and then roll over to find some sort of fucked up figure standing in the corner of my room The past  SOs I have had have both witnessed me waking up in a violent scream trying to jump out of my own bed in terror,0,cdg78i4,1qs3hz,nosleep,hot,2.0,2

FreedomNinja,I used to get it really bad in my high school years My little trick was actually the opposite of everyone else I had to focus on not moving and calming down The worst thing about mine is I would continue to get them every time i fell back asleep until I found out outside noise would stop them Ive slept with a TV on for the past  years ,0,cdgabwq,1qs3hz,nosleep,hot,2.0,2
squirrely,Ive dealt with it too since I was about  Ive had strange things happens Like it happen while I was in a dream and then wake up and be parAlyzed again It doesnt even faze me anymore It might if it happened again soon because its been about two years I can even put myself into it Like when Im going to sleep but not while Im waking up What I mean is right before I hit the point where Im completely asleep I can wake myself up and be paralyzed and be aware thats what Im doing Oh and hey maybe this helps The way I get out of it is I just fall back to sleep Same way with how I induce it I get to a point where I know Im good and wake myself up You might not even have to get this feeling Just try to go back to sleep and your body will wake you up after the shock of it But I know going to sleep again probably isnt the easiest Its not big deal for me cuz Im not scared but like I said I wouldnt want it to happen again Thats why Im not reading the rest of your story until the morning Haha,0,cdgaki1,1qs3hz,nosleep,hot,2.0,2
HereToReddit,sleep paralysis is actually the most terrifying thing to happen to me Its happened twice The first time i had no idea what was going on so i legitimately thought i was getting taken over by a demon that was suffocating me and was preparing myself to die at that moment the second time was after i had already looked into it and found out abotu this sleep paralysis it still didnt stop me from hallucinating the scariest sht though the second time i had hallucinated a terrifying face right up against mine couldnt move or scream to get rid of it it was just lying there with its eyes boring into mine scariest sht ever kept repeating to myself its just sleep paralysis over and over again i can totally relate to you dude btw how do you lucid dream,0,cdgbq7s,1qs3hz,nosleep,hot,2.0,2
ZedG,I had sleep paralysis more often than most people i eventually got control of it and later gave lucid dreaming a shot bc as you probably know even knowing its sleep paralysis only helps so far i figured why not try and see if i could change sleep paralysis into astral projection Any way the first time i managed lucid dreaming i woke up the second time the dream changed as i kept trying it was as if the sub conscious was actively trying to stop me in doing so it it got progressively aggressive dont get me wrong it was fun when i pulled it off but it always ended rough eventually i had a dream where it got so worse that i slipped into sleep paralysis and instead of waking up from it like you would usually do i kept changing dreams like you think youre out of it only to realize a while later that youre still in a dream walk out of the room and youre back in it i even tried imagining holding my breath and falling but the dreams kept switching point being ive totally been in your shoes just remember this When you stare into the abyss the abyss stares back into you it stopped when i stopped trying lucid dreamingEdit do you maintain a journal for the dreams,0,cdgd51m,1qs3hz,nosleep,hot,2.0,2
volxc,I have sleep paralysis fairly often but have never experienced the demons or monsters that most people described Most of the time I am just panicked because I cant move On the few occasions when I thought there was someone in the room coming to get me it has always been a regular person that I imagine is either trying to rob me or pull a prank on me,0,cdgi568,1qs3hz,nosleep,hot,2.0,2

AcquiredMinerals,I used to practice lucid dreaming a lot I found that while trying to do a wake induced lucid dream attaining a super realistic lucid state  by meditation and slipping into its seamlessly from consciousness I would fail and end up in a paralytic sleep state The same old hallucinations would occur but you can actually control them just as you control the elements of your lucid dream You are still dreaming and still in control  if you practice enough Ive turned ghouls that were sitting on my chest into hot babes straddling ne before And sometimes you can slip into the full subconscious dream from the sleep paralysis stage  too It just feels scary at first However I quit lucid dreaming This was after one morning when Id woken up froma lucid dream at my friends house  I heard what I thought was his mother sighing  in the parallel room Neither of my other two frienss heard it Again I hear the sigh  You guys heard it that time right A unanimous no from them Then a third time I hear it Okay you guys HAD to have heard that one One says no  the other says yeah After she left and I was alone with the first friend he said Dude I think she just said yes cause you asked three times  thats what shes like I didnt hear shitI immediately stopped lucid dreaming When reality starts to blur you dont fuck with that shit ,0,cdjyy3w,1qs3hz,nosleep,hot,2.0,2

renernavilez,Hey op The sleep paralysis you have is similar to mine in regards to the laying on my back and not moving part I do however feel a terrible pressure on my chest Anyway once only once I was experiencing this laying on my side facing the wall that was probably a foot and a half away from me At first all I heard was silence Then a man at least it sounded like a man started whispering directly into my ear I was so scared while this was happening that I didnt really hear anything he had to say The only thing I remember is that he wanted me to do something I tried my best to wake up or scream no so someone could hear me and save me Well I managed to wake myself up because my asleep body was saying the no s so loud that it woke me I wanted to know if anything like this has happened to you Its only happened once where they  talked to me directly It has been a while since its happened though Ugh fuck sleep paralysis ,1,cdg5iog,1qs3hz,nosleep,hot,2.0,1

iCyFrosTy,Ive had that fucker too last night It started with sleep paralysis I realised I couldnt move so I just shook it off After a few minutes of just standing there looking at the door I realised there was a gray tint behind the window I eventually woke up and gotback to sleep Only matter is this time instead of waking up after sleep paralysis I somehow managed to astral project I saw myself just start floating above my body seeing it down Few minutes later I wake up screaming and the only image in my head is the fuckers face through the door When I went to sleep door was closed when I woke up it was open I couldnt actually sleep for the rest of the night,0,cdgfv3f,1qs3hz,nosleep,hot,1.0,1
YesDragonsWereReal,Wow man Never had sleep paralysis myself but I know about that lucid type stuff a bit Ive had these nightmares that are combined with lucidity Like itll be your typical nightmare with some fucker except you have to realize that you dont have to run from him I kind of just dream up some weapon from an anime I really like and fight him and beat the shit out of him anime style I just find it cool and have woken up with a smile on my face because of this a number of times I hope this helps you somehow and that the realization that its your dream and you can control it works for you too,0,cdgi8wv,1qs3hz,nosleep,hot,1.0,1
peachesdevine,I had a similar experience with sleep paralysis for me it happens when im on my stomach it feels like theres someone on my back holding me down with their weight and squeezing my throat so i cant breath I always feel like its a women a witch or something holding me Usually like you said i can shake it but this time I was lucid dreaming and paralyzed all at once I kept dreaming that I was driving to church every time I went to take a corner a car would slam into me I would wake up in paralysis the next thing I knew I was driving back to church same exact thing I knew i was dreaming but I couldnt change the scenario it was exactly the same This happened in rounds for hours i tried to tell myself to wake up but i couldnt It was completely terrifying,0,cdgr6lu,1qs3hz,nosleep,hot,1.0,1

gidgetwhite,I completely agree with you about there being a connection between lucid dreaming and sleep paralysis I also experience sounds in my paralysis like you Sometimes I  hear the door to my apartment open or someone moving around outside my room when I know no one is out there It is so real What is really creepy about my paralysis is that nothing seems out of the ordinary I can see my room and exactly where my clothes are strewn about with perfect clarity Even though in reality my eyes are closed and Im not actually seeing these things If you were to ask me any other waking time to recall my room with detail I couldnt do it Yet in my sleep paralysis its as if Im looking right at these thingsAlso I never really SEE anything just feel that sense of terror or impending doom as you so perfectly put it  I cant move yet my eyes are wide open and Im staring around my room just knowing that there is a presence somewhere Seriously sleep paralysis is so fucked up Why on earth does everyones mind trick them in to thinking there is an evil presence in their room in that stage between sleep and waking There really needs to be more research put in to this,0,cdijhc2,1qs3hz,nosleep,hot,1.0,1

LordChubby,i think we have a hellhound here D dont worry they can be scary but are actually puppies to the ones they protect i have  of these spirits and they show themselves as shadow dogs in real life and dreams be grateful because these spirits are very picky about what human to protect  you might be special in a spiritual sense and the girl you see in dreams is probably someone from a past life trying to return to you and your hellhound is jealous xD TRY talking to it light a candle and think about him ask him to talk does he look like this but in a smoky kinda way because one of mine look like that and the other one looks like those heavy duty guard dogs those big fat ones they have names so ask your for its name mine are called evil and the other one says eyeZEL the picture looks like evil httpsimgetsystaticcomilxNagpjpg,0,cdghguu,1qscvx,nosleep,hot,1.0,1

kasger,This sounds a lot like sleep paralysisIve experience the first part of what you described a dozen of timesLying in bed not able to move but able to watchWhen your body has been lying completely still for a period of time your brain will start testing you to check if youre awake Typically youll get an itch or something similar that should make you moveIf you ignore these tests your brain can get tricked into thinking you are asleepThis is a common way to enter lucid dreaming but from my experiences its hard to do and always ends up pretty scaryWhen your brain thinks you are sleeping it will lock your body to prevent most movement during sleep After that the dreaming or processing of the days experiences will startThis is where real life and your imagination will get mixed together all while you are awakeFrom what Ive read people often hear whispers sometimes from dead relatives in this state Ive heard someone whisper my own name once Its also very common to hallucinate or completely enter the dream world which it sounds like is what happened to youIf you cant avoid this you can possibly learn to control and manipulate your dream so instead of it continuing as a nightmare it could be an awesome lucid dream instead Check rLucidDreaminghttpwwwredditcomrLucidDreaming for more info on that and good luck ,1,cdisx3k,1r1tik,nosleep,hot,4.0,3
RabbidRabbit,Assuming this is paranormal and NOT sleep paralysis then I would say there are only two known types of entities that are physically able to touch you Those are demons and poltergeists These two types go by different names in different parts of the world but they are what they are Demons as you probably already know are evil and want nothing more than to make you suffer Their intentions of course are not readily known They could be causing you distress to feed off your fear and other negative emotions They could just be after your soul One way or another demons haunt either because they want something FROM you or they simply want YOUPoltergeists on the other hand are quite different and are more unpredictable which can make them more dangerous as we dont know enough about them to know what they want if anything at all Poltergeists are believed to be either nonhuman nonreligious demonangel spirits or they are beings from a parallel dimension I believe it is the formerWhat these entities want is unclear but they have known to be harmless in most cases Typically they are mischief makers that may turn lights on and off or hide your car keys in the fridge Some are more malevolent and could kill you by means of straight up throwing a knife in your back as you pass through the kitchen or maybe make the banister youre leaning on on the fourth floor balcony give way so that you fall to your demiseSome have been said to protect and while others are said to mess with you in more diabolical ways Such may be the case with you This entity whatever it is has the power to touch you reach into your subconscious and manipulate your dreams at will Given the extent of its ability I would say its less likely to be a demon though not impossible I say this because it seems that with what it can already do with you it should be able to possess you by now if that were its goalBut this is all speculation of course and this information is only based on personal experience experiences of others stories videos etc That being said some form of research most be done You need to video tape yourself at night and share your findings for feedback Try placing a digital recorder near your bed while you sleep to hear what you may You could even attempt an EVP session to communicate with it I would suggest having someone else perform the EVP as its you it is interested in Also dont bother with ouija boards At this point I dont think you could bring in something worse than that but you dont wan to chance pissing it off or giving it more power either Always remember too much acknowledgement of the whateveritis may give it more power Just keep calm and go about your daily activities as if all is normal and go to bed with an idea of a nice dream in mind Focus on that positive happy dream perhaps you can make it happen I know I have done this and even controlled my dream as I slept With patience and practice so can youPlease update as much as you can as I am quite interested in seeing how this unfolds for you Ill offer you as much assistance as I can Good luck ,1,cdiq0sy,1r1tik,nosleep,hot,3.0,2

YuiG,Send her a letter back Facebook her tweet her call her text her  or in other words CONTACT HER ASAP  It would help to call her family or anyone close to her too If this IS her she may have either become a part of something most likely something bad That or shes trying to tell you something Did you ever play a game with her that was anything similar to this but obviously not EXACTLY this It may all be a metaphor for something Analyse it and have a friend help you if possible Good luck  EDIT As usecretlyapotato said get that stuff off to a professional When you go there I assume you probably will but yknow probably not the best idea BRING SOMEONE ELSE The letter never said to come alone so it may be OK,1,cdkwkz6,1r8n66,nosleep,hot,17.0,16

NotMyCircus,If I received a letter like that I wouldnt even be considering doing what it asks Cant say I wouldnt be curious though First Id get hold of Tiffany If I couldnt reach her Id try to reach close family members or friends Since youve both been friends for so long I doubt her family would find it odd that you might contact them if you couldnt find her on your own If you cant reach her or maybe even if you canId do some research on the property itself and see if I could find anything out about the history of it How many previous owners has the house had Find out who lived there whyd they leave If you can find out some names maybe try to contact previous owners and talk to them directly  Why has it been abandoned If I started to entertain the idea of actually going to the house I would probably check it out first Sit outside of it in my car somewhere where you wouldnt be too noticeable If you cant watch from your car then park it somewhere close by and out of sight but still keep yourself out of sight See if anyones coming and going from the property see if you notice anything weird going on there If you feel comfortable entering the place after watching it for a bit then go ahead and check it out but if it were me Id bring someone with that I trust Make sure your phones charged up and any other type of safeguards you want are in place Id check out the house Id probably check out everything Take pictures grab the items she listed in the letter The vile the note and leave Get it all checked out by someone who knows something about this type of stuff There is no way Id actually be doing what the letter asked Everything about that letter screams bad news But like I said I would be very curious and would want some answers Just be safe about how you get those answers,0,cdlaesp,1r8n66,nosleep,hot,3.0,3

Jakkben,Im about to say everything thats on my mind about this soThats terrifying It makes no sense Is there no return address Is there any other way of contacting the REAL tiffany Or is there a way to contact this girl or personBetter yet how the hell could they possibly know where you live your name your friends name AND a place you both went when youre younger Maybe try researching the house if there were any murders there anything like that that could insist something that would need to be burned down From the sound of it its a ritual Even worse a blood ritual usually that can infer a summoning of something Or last resort go there but only if youre as careful as the person says and see if theres anything on the vial Or just take the vial and take it to the hospital or somewhere you can get it tested find out what it is but thats dangerous taking something from there because lets just say IF its good reasoning behind doing what the letter says there could be a malevolent spirit or thing there that could follow you back Or even worse Yeah everything in this is bad or worse It could be a trap Say this person does know you both very well like a stalker and wants to harm you kidnap you or kill you In a way it all depends on how close you and tiffany were in a wayHowever dont act too fast on anything butUpdate us with whatever more information you may have or receive,0,cdl20vw,1r8n66,nosleep,hot,1.0,1

anything supernatural but I havent written off the existence of such phenomena That being said a shadow in the night isnt enough to make me start thinking of ghosties and ghoulies and long legged beasties and things that go bump in the night So when I started working nights in the hospital things seemed to go pretty wellId have my admissions Id take care of the current patients without issue Then one night I got an admission Ill call this patient Jerry Now Jerry as it turns out has a very long history of coming to this hospital to the point where admitting him is almost a rite of passage for any wouldbephysician that trains at this facility He has a whole boat load of medical issues kidney problems diabetes high blood pressure He also has a history of schizophrenia and on top of that he has some good old fashion dementia Before meeting Jerry I was told hes actually a really fun guy hes always enthusiastic and seemingly happy to be here So when I went in to see him and found him very sullen I was a little anxious The admission was done the orders were placed and I didnt think more of it He had been admitted for chest pain so I knew I would be going back to draw additional blood work later that night It was around  in the morning when I went back to see Jerry I was hoping that I could just do it real fast before he fully woke up When I went in there Jerry wasnt in his bed Jerry was now sitting in a corner of the room with his sheet his gown and pillows all wrapped around him in some sort of makeshift armor I quickly walked over to Jerry and saw that he was crying not crying but rather whimpering as if he didnt have the stamina to make it a full cry I tried putting on a brave face and said Jerry whats going on For an old guy Jerry was quicker than I thought and stronger than I would have believed He grabbed my wrist and pulled me towards him They wont leave me alone they wont let me sleep they wont let me eat He continued on in this line of things the phantom they wouldnt let him do I assumed it was the staff taking care of him at his nursing home As upsetting as it was to see Jerry like this I still needed the blood and this wasnt the first time Id dealt with a confused older patient I helped Jerry back to his bed Then I explained to him how I needed to draw blood to make sure that he was OK Strangely enough or maybe not so strangely enough this made Jerry feel better maybe it was something he knew from his long history of being a patient it was something familiar I tied the tourniquet in place then I cleaned his arm found my vein and went for it Im not the greatest phlebotomist so its always a relief and a bit of an ego boost when I see the blood traveling through the tubing I was filling up my vial it was about half way full when Jerry started screaming LEAVE ME ALONE LEAVE ME ALONE He began to jerk violently somehow the needle stayed in place but then to my disbelief the blood in the vial started backing up the tube as if some force in Jerrys body was pulling it back I was so shocked I tried to pull the needle right out of his arm but the needle didnt budge In shock I pulled harder my efforts still could not budge the needle In response I quickly pulled the vial of blood out from the opposite end of the tubing The vial which had been collecting blood had gone from being  full to maybe being about  full After I pulled the bottle out from the other end of the tubing the needle dropped from Jerrys arm leaving in its wake what I could already tell would be a one nasty sonofabitch bruise Again owing to his deceptive quickness and strength Jerry grabbed me and pulled me close again and in a voice that wreaked of desperation and fear he asked me Can you see them I pulled my arm free and I ran out of that room I walked back to the nursing station one of the nurses asked what had happened because of the screaming I played it off as being a result of my own mediocre at best blood drawing skill With the blood now drawn I would be able to get some sleep I made my way to the oncall room which happens to be in one of the older parts of the hospital I climbed into one of the beds and closed my eyes All I could see with my eyes shut was the look in Jerrys eyes when he pulled me close and asked me if I could see them I resolved that this was a case of some funky weird vacuum trick in the tubing and a senile sick old man The only trouble is since then the shadows Ive seen in dark rooms seem darker the lights unable to pierce them The noises from the old pipes have shifted from random tings and pings to rhythmic tappings Im not really sure what to make of it In the past few days the shadows have gotten darker the tapping louder and now I cant shake a feeling that Im being

arglebarg,TRADOC is the US Armys Training and Doctrine Command whereas the Air Forces version of the same is Air Education and Training Command AETC  Both are in charge of things from basic training all the way to how to teach someone how to fix nuclear missiles or properly assault a fixed position  Just FYIEdit  Heres FM httpswwwfasorgirpdoddirarmyfmpdf which is just a field manual many many manuals are called that which just means its reference material really explaining some basic nonclassified concepts behind electronic warfare  The version on the hard drives probably much older though  Granted FM numbers get changed rearranged etc and the FM  of today isnt necessarily the one of yesteryear,0,cdlhmjg,1ragny,nosleep,hot,12.0,12

LucklessLemings,Lurker here  If you follow the UFO conspiracy theories MJ stands for the group called Majestic  which took over from Project Blue Book for investigating or rather covering up supposed UFO phenomenon  When I researched FM  TRADOC I found a handy powerpoint outlining what it is  Its a field manual outlining terms and things to consider in Electronic Warfare  The manual is available to look at here  httparmypubsarmymildoctrineDRpubsdrapdfFMpdf  As all publicly available field manuals are it contains very little info on how to wage Electronic Warfare but just outlines terms and things to consider  However some interesting things to consider  The powerpoint I found was written by two people simply called COL Dixon and williamdarley which are microsoft usernames  There are no links to communicate  The powerpoint was made in  edited in  and looks like an intro  Considering how this field is much newer than MJ and the purpose of the powerpoint it seems like FM  could have been written in  but Im not sure  The version available online was released November of   So it has been in operation since at least   One interesting thing is that FM  is mostly an Army manual although there is an entire chapter dedicated to working with different agencies and friendly nations  I havent found anything specifically outlining hard drive security although you can bet if it says Erase and Destroy and it was sent to be destroyed its probably been erased  Now that doesnt mean all is lost  Many less experienced people would simply wave a magnet over it which is an imperfect way of wiping data  Most likely they would use a program which erases and writes over the disk several times erasing it pretty well  Still if it has not been physically damaged there could still be a chance to recover the data  If they were uber secure about data they might have a program which alerts a server if its being tampered with by anything with internet access  So if you have someone checking it out take out the internet card  Id recommend taking a look at Wikipedia since even the existence of MJ is debated  From what I understand though if it did exist it closed down decades ago  What would most likely be on there is scanned and conslidated old information  What is strange is that it would be in a desk meaning it was being used somehow rather than in a storage bin or server  I havent found any news about air force bases being turned into a nature preserve  But Ive only been looking for half an hour  Im gonna find you out  ,3,cdlnhwb,1ragny,nosleep,hot,3.0,0

URKhaleesi,I have been to seminars every once and a while From what it sounds like she may have been started on a new medication to help with depression or anxiety Some of the medications such as Zyprexa have terrible side affects at first I was a complete zombie Like falling asleep standing up lol Its only like that until you build it up then your body starts getting used to itI wouldnt get paranoid I am sure she is having a hard time with coping She married the love of her life and now she wants a baby and can never have one with him Its a very big life decision that she is faced with right now These seminars require a lot of feeling and talking She is likely exhausted from built up emotions Put yourself in her shoes and think about what she is going through She can either stay with you and be happy but always have the yearning to know what it would have been like to be a mother or she can leave you and go through the process of finding someone else on equal footing as you which may be impossible to her and have a childall the while thinking what if I do all of this and then find out I am not cut out to be a mom Or what if I leave him never find someone else and then Im alone and Im not a momComing from a womanthis is a huge life decision It sounds like she is emotionally exhausted Check all around for any knew meds that she may be hiding Or just talk with her Tell her that you understand and that your just not ready to discuss kids Yall have a whole life a head of you take it as it comes and enjoy it,2,cdmj1ia,1reivz,nosleep,hot,20.0,18

winternumbness,So you said your wife told you she was going to this thing right But did you ever have any contact at all with her therapist to confirm that this was actually happening Idk to me it seems like in her despiration she mightve gone somewhere else Try to get in contact with the therapist and if she confirms that they both went to the seminar then ask if your wifes on any type of medication or something because shes been acting oddly ,1,cdmmsj6,1reivz,nosleep,hot,2.0,1

mylittlerose,Perhaps the exhaustion finally got to her Or in the spirit of nosleep the demons But really call me crazy or immature sorry Im only  but imma just throw this out there why not compromise Yes a baby is a lot of work but what if you had just one Once it grows older you can continue all that youve done before As a family Maybe Im being naïve but have you even considered it A marriage consists of compromise right Not my way or the highway thinking pOr maybe your wife could start a daycare business Or another profession related to children Either way I hope things get better ,0,cdmtsk3,1reivz,nosleep,hot,1.0,1

SleepingBeauty,It might be worthwhile for you to do some reading up on covert hypnosis She very well could have been hypnotized and not even know it  httpenmwikipediaorgwikiCoverthypnosisAs far as the past life regression goes there are techniques that involve being hypnotized and some that do not Usually hypnosis is only done one on one for past life regression not in a group setting The other way is basically just like a guided meditation where you relax to a point where your mind is clear and then slowly recall vivid memories from your past going backward to the beginning of your life Past life regression happens after you recall your earliest memories from this life then keep going and recalling memories from someone elses or your past life You can find guided meditations for past life regression on YouTube Hope this helps ,1,cdnfebv,1rhbuc,nosleep,hot,5.0,4
NaturalGlow,Ok so I spoke with my boyfriend about this to get his opinion Even though she says she didnt get hypnotized she very well may have been She seems highly suggestible It doesnt necessarily mean someone was swinging a clock in front of her eyes There are different types of hypnosis one she may not have recognized as such That being said it was his suggestion that you get medical help immediately The things she is doing and saying are very unusual and she probably needs to be evaluated,1,cdnifp6,1rhbuc,nosleep,hot,4.0,3

Remissranger,I know you dont personally believe in supernatural occurences but I believe your wife may be possessed in some way even I you dont believe me you should at least check I would suggest trying things such as burning sage around her while she sleeps or possible putting one or two drops of holy water if attainable in her morning coffee or drink if she reacts negatively to either of these things that I would very much reccommend seeking assurance from somebody more knowledgable in this matter,1,cdnir30,1rhbuc,nosleep,hot,3.0,2

menubalk,Well I dont know how mirrors influence dreams but I know to never look into a mirror when lucid dreamingLucid dreaming is the state in which you can control your dreaming Think as your dreams as a semisandbox You can only partially influence the world you are in but you can completely manipulate that world fly findthink up guns etc Look up how to trigger it Its tiresome but funHowever since the part in your brain that controls logic is shut down during sleep a few things consistently dont work as intended These are so called reality checks You can perform these on a bihourly basis in real life You will subconsciously then also perform them in your dreams When you notice something is not right you become aware you are dreaming Do note that some reality checks might work as intended yet you can still be dreaming This is why it is wise to perform multiple to be sureAlso the shockjoy of this fact alone wakes you up however you can prevent waking from a lucid dream by spinning around very fast This forces your mind to think about balancing thus canceling out your waking up signalWithout further ad reality checks Digital numbers are all garbled Your average nightclock might suddenly display something like this httpgooglrUVPRC Light switches dont work Remember no logic Due to this light switches dont trigger changes in luminance They might trigger other stuff Your body is only semisolid This means that you can for example with enough force push your finger through the palm of your hand This is a very easy reality check to work into your daily routine Creepy check number one your hands will often have more than five fingers on each hand And usually they arent even matched up in number Creepy check number two mirrors show a distorteddisturbed version of yourself It sounds interesting but it is jarring to watch sometimes enough to wake you up You can breathe through a closed noseTldr Mirrors in dreams  scary,7,cdo12tn,1rjwb3,nosleep,hot,24.0,17

Laurashrti,A few things about mirrors that are considered old wives tales Dont let two mirrors face each other because it can stop the flow of energy in the house Dont put a mirror in your bedroom because it allows bad spirits into your dreams and they can steal your soul If your soul wanders during the night a mirror can capture it Another possible reason to keep it out of the bedroom Mirrors can be gateways from spirits both good and badJust a few things to consider but take them with a grain of salt The gateway thing would concern me Having two gateways facing each other would possibly allow for heavy traffic if you believe in that sort of thing From wwwconstantlyworkingwithspiritcomhttpwwwconstantlyworkingwithspiritcompagehtml ,0,cdoeljc,1rjwb3,nosleep,hot,3.0,3

Creepyslenderpasta,I have  things one it may have been a guardian angel telling you to move the mirror which would lead into about  hours worth of discussion and  this has nothing to do with this  subject except lucid dreaming if you turn on and off light switches when you are awake A couple of times to make it almost a routine you will more than likely do it in a dream realize it doesnt work and if your mind doesnt automatically rationalize about stuff you will realize its a dream which in that case you can do whatever you wantEDIT Oh ya um at my school on the th grade floor there are  mirrors facing each other and when I go to the bathroom in there the only sink that works So Far is the one under the mirror,1,cdomxf8,1rjwb3,nosleep,hot,2.0,1

isacuomo,Hey there The same happened to me a lot when I was younger it got better with the timeI cant remember when it started but I remember having a really hard time sleeping because of the voices It was like trying to take a nap in the middle of a party Most of the voices where just rambling I couldnt even understand what they were saying When I was about  the voices started to call me Some were unrecognizable but others were from friends and family they kept calling my name and I started sleeping with some of those nature sounds things to muffle the soundIts nothing scary or anything it just gets in my way when Im trying to sleep PNow Im  and I still hear the voices but I got better at it Now I can block it and distinguish what they are saying Usually its just lonely people looking for someone to chat with Ive had some weird experiences though Once I woke up to someone moaning in pain right in my ear and when I woke scared as hell the moaning turned into some crasy laughter Sometimes I hear whistling and my dog hears it tooI mean its ok to hear stuff If you want you can go get help on developing this skill or you can just let it be Its up to you,0,cdowvxb,1rlyww,nosleep,hot,1.0,1

ApaLova,As far as I have heard staring into a mirror in a dream is a bad thing What couldve happened is that part of your brain stops working while dreaming which leaves a distorted image of you once you look in the mirror Since the ghost wanted to talk about death you had the thought stuck in your mind about death and your brain emitted screaming in return In return of your paranormal encounter and your nightmare you things that its from the ghost in which gives your brain the fuel for dark thoughtsI for one do not believe in paranormal activity but I do know that your mind and hypnosis is a powerful thing thing Just make yourself believe that the ghost isnt doing anything to you and might turn back to normal,0,cdoxsou,1rmeqd,nosleep,hot,2.0,2

ephique,Since people are in eager need of having some questions answered I am going to fill them in for you Vote this up so it gets on topWhen did the sister die  Shortly after the last time she interacted with JonathanWhy was the father acting as if he had seen the sister when he assumed she was in Jonathans room  He was playing along pretending like she was alive in order to give Jonathan the idea that she wasnt dead Alternatively he could have seen the ghost of the sister much like Jonathan did with his mother Its up to the readerHow did the mother die  Jonathan first saw her when she was a rotten corpse he never knew The father still stated she died of a liverfailure during interviews If she did or not no one knowsWhy was the father acting like a british doctor of some sort He was suffering from schizophrenia Most important though the story actually has all the hints and details in order to figure this out and some of you did I failed as a writer to make some stuff clearer Its always hard knowing how other people will interpret your story This is the first story that Ive written that is longer than a thousand wordsI want to thank everyone who read it who gave me tips and who upvoted it Ive enjoyed these  days of reddit posts of my story I really enjoyed reading what people were speculating about the ending someone mentioned that he would have something behind the fridge that was my favorite one Thank you Edit Ive noticed one of the moderators has removed  comments all of which were just positive critique on the story Why not remove the negative ones if NoSleep has a No critique policy I believe a moderator should be impartial when it comes to something like this upon deleting fellow peoples comments,14,cdp9nkt,1ro3vw,nosleep,hot,91.0,77

thewarrior,Hey man I have been reading and looking forward to the next installments every night for  days now so I thought I should comment I thought on the whole it was really good especially the first  parts I thought the first one was amazing and I genuinely found it to be creepy I however did feel the ending did not bring it to much justice  I would probably keep the same style throughout next time and take extra care in making sure all of the questions raised are addressed That being said I did really like it in general and seeing that you are not a native English speaker I actually thought it read really well with just the occasional grammatical mistake here and there Anyway thankyou for this awesome story and I really look foward to the next thing you have to write,1,cdp90g9,1ro3vw,nosleep,hot,1.0,0

AssassinCorgi,With the exception to the voices at the same time I have experienced as a kid the whole room expanding like you have It always felt very surreal ,4,cdpkkw8,1rplro,nosleep,hot,68.0,64
koutavi,I experienced something very similar as a child where late at night the room would shrink and close in around me or seem to dramatically expand Sometimes my body parts most often my hands would shrink or grow and feel too light or heavy as well Id hear music or whispers frequently on the rare occasion it would turn into the roar of a crowd The walls of my room were woodpaneled and the knots and whorls would sometimes turn into faces I believed there were people were trapped in my walls for most of my childhood I heard them after all But if my grandmother came in for any reason it would all stopSometimes it still happens and my doctor believes that both the shrinkingexpanding and the musicwhispers are a neurological phenomenon related to my migraines He calls it AliceinWonderlandSyndrome Aura or lilliputian hallucinations that cause the feeling of the room warping and that sometimes children experience this but grow out of itI still hate that room though,5,cdpn6m5,1rplro,nosleep,hot,29.0,24
Bulldog,I had a similar thing happen  The room would feel really big and I would hear voices  The voices werent really screaming but a few people talking at once in an angry tone  I could never hear words but the voices would get louder and louder and I would feel physically stressed  The weird thing is when I would have these episodes I would always think of thesehttpusrfcomwmarualestebanarualestebanarualestebanhayballsinwhiteplasticcoverwrapbalesstackedoutdoorforfeedinganimalsinfarmsjpg for some reason,1,cdpnjb6,1rplro,nosleep,hot,7.0,6

Quatr,I would have something similar to what your describing happen to me often when I had a fever It is hard to describe It happened more in my head like a dream Everything in my mind would clear like I was standing alone in a matrixlike white empty room I remember at the center if the vast empty space there was what I perceived as a bombI could feel the bomb was about to go off but never would Like the constant stress would build and build until I was overwhelmed with it pulsing and compressing the bomb and its space But the bomb would fight back growing rapidly The two forces would fight in the large white room expanding and contrasting violently inside my head until I awoke ears ringing head throbbing and quietly crying It was always the same Then never happened again,0,cdpntfa,1rplro,nosleep,hot,4.0,4
zackisazombie,Ive had this exact thing happen to me when I was a little kid I only recently figured out that they were probably panic attacks I still get the room growing bigger thing and I believe it is a form of dissociation The voices are actually the blood roaring in your ears ,0,cdppbwi,1rplro,nosleep,hot,4.0,4
witchofchaos,Sounds similar to something Ive experienced  When I was a kid usually when falling asleep but occasionally when playing everything around me would seem to distort stretching out or squishing kind of like it was made of rubber and being pulled on  Sometimes thered be a spinning or wobbling sensation too and and it would make me feel a little sickI found it more fascinating than scary though and would often watch my hands or my toys and feel them holding still and staying the same as I see them change and move in front of me  Usually it would go away awhile after I focused on it intently  I grew out of it around the time I started kindergartenI also heard voices whenever it was dark and quiet  I still do as an adult  They always seem just out of reach to focus on  I still need to have some light and sound in my room to be able to sleep,0,cdppfd6,1rplro,nosleep,hot,3.0,3
manudouble,Even at  I still get this sometimes  It normally happens when Im sick or something else is going on that keeps me from sleeping well  The room starts expanding and I feel so small but I at this point I can typically snap myself out of it ,1,cdppobw,1rplro,nosleep,hot,5.0,4
Pooner,When I was young I would experience a similar thing where I felt very small and the room was expanding but no voices Apparently my mother told me when I had these experiences I would be saying Its so big Its so big I assume I was referring to the room,0,cdpn936,1rplro,nosleep,hot,2.0,2
Sedentary,Ive only heard heavy breathing but heard my name called from the closet It started very faintly and i sort of awoke then my name was called again slightly louder I was thinking I may be imagining it and it came again and again each time louder until it was loud enough that i jumped out of bed turned on the light and proceeded to run to my parents room,0,cdpos72,1rplro,nosleep,hot,3.0,3
ATyp,Holy shit Ive experienced exactly this Usually when I get the flu yearly Ill be laying there feeling like death and then sit up to get some water or something and then this will happen Also I have out of body experiences like this too Pretty cool never has been scary really ,0,cdpp7ug,1rplro,nosleep,hot,2.0,2
Leenlopez,Ive experienced something like that even the room expanding it always happened when I was alone and not only during my childhood maybe the last time it happened to me was  years ago Its very weird and hard to explain but yeah the loud whispers that I couldnt make out what was being said made me feel like I was going insane,0,cdpqecg,1rplro,nosleep,hot,2.0,2
HairStylistAndrea,Ive had this my whole life Sometimes it feels like I cant move but I can if I try The voices I hear too and theyre so loud I always thought that if I could just hear the words theyre saying Ide be able to understand what was happening It scared the shit out of me as a kid and now Im so curious about it I remember the room expanding and contracting almost like your looking through a magnifying glass and it would go up and down my body as well My limbs would feel really huge and then really small The room would get extremely dark and then return to normal when the voices would finally quiet down My mom would just brush it off and say my eyes are playing tricks on me but I always thought there was more to it  than that ,0,cdptp0e,1rplro,nosleep,hot,2.0,2
LillaNissen,I once woke up and couldnt move I could see the roof in my room and the wall next to me but I couldnt move any part of the body I didnt really know what to do so I just waited to see ig I would really wake up then I think I got tired of waiting and fell asleep again and woke up as normal later Dont know the name of this english not my native language blablabla,0,cdpwon1,1rplro,nosleep,hot,3.0,3

Captainwhackschlong,I had almost the same experience All I could see was black though I was asleep when it happened I would always be inside a D cube The  voice would whisper but it was so loud like a screaming whisper it was terrifying It still happens occasionally still The whispers are the worst part,0,cdpp1e3,1rplro,nosleep,hot,2.0,2
cnfvsed,This has happened to me Im  now and I still get the screaming voices However theyre not just when Im in bed about to fall asleep they happen during the daytime as well ,0,cdpp3uc,1rplro,nosleep,hot,1.0,1
grrn,I had the voicessame thing Numerous persons sometimes whispering and sometimes yelling The room stayed the same size But I remember something else I remember being semi awake and I would float face down up to the ceiling I would float around my house and if my parents were up I could see them they couldnt see me and if I tried to talk or scream nothing came out I couldnt get their attention couldnt float lower It was something similar to reverse gravity like swimming will keep you at the top of the water This was a similar feeling ,1,cdpp675,1rplro,nosleep,hot,2.0,1
oakles,I had something similar but Im not entirely sure if I remember there being voices When I was little Id occasionally wake up in the middle of the night and see someone standing in the doorway usually my mom or dad and they would just be staring at me When Id call out to them I wouldnt get a response and they would just keep staring After like  minutes they would just fade away and be gone it was really weird now that I look back on it,0,cdpp9kg,1rplro,nosleep,hot,1.0,1
HarleiQuinn,I used to hear voices screaming in my head However it only happened when I was sick or when I was in that part of the brain between sleep and awake I had it happen so many times it was terrifying,0,cdpq2zd,1rplro,nosleep,hot,1.0,1
Troghen,Yeah Im not sure if this is at all similar but I remember on a few occasions having something like that happen with the shrinkingwithout the voices but I also remember something I can best describe as pins not needle pins but like the inside of a lock pins and this is a vague descriptionits really hard to describe all lined up possibly floating slightly above the ground and all of the sudden they would just drop sometimes they also expanded and shrunk before or while falling and make a really loud crashing noise and it scared the hell out of me I remember it happened a lot when I was sick or if I woke up in the middle of the night,0,cdpqo4v,1rplro,nosleep,hot,1.0,1

leialoup,I had it when I was a child but static and not voices Now I sometimes get the static still and my hearing will go and literally focus just on the static It disappears after about  seconds to a minuteOne thing I do also have is a weird sense of hearing When there are lots of people in a room I can hear everything and everyone to a point where its unbearable I cant be in a crowded restaurant and I hate shopping centres I hear everyones conversations Its so strange,0,cdpuo0z,1rplro,nosleep,hot,2.0,2
Claireski,I have experienced voices I first noticed it in my late teensearly twenties amp still get it now Just as Im trying to fall asleep I can hear taking but cant make out words like you describe I find they get louder amp louder amp suddenly I jolt awake As soon as my eyes open they stop Sometimes it sounds like theyre talking in a different language Occasionally Ill just ride it out amp keep my eyes closed eventually Ill see faces but its nobody I recognise Someone once told me it could be caused by some kind of epilepsy how true that is I dont know Ive never paid enough mind to it to bring it up at the doctors,0,cdpux02,1rplro,nosleep,hot,2.0,2

jillischillok,While reading this I sort of started to remember some distant memory of me being haunted by something amp turning on the light would be the only way to stop it I dont remember what it was exactly I do remember sleeping in my parents bed tho amp there was a bust of Jesus that would be in my sight as I was sleeping amp I recall that as I was wasting time before falling asleep that that bust of Jesuss eyes would look as if it was moving I guess it didnt really freak me out too much because it was Jesus amp I interpreted it as a good thing,0,cdpvs8t,1rplro,nosleep,hot,1.0,1

Nicolestormborn,I used to experience something very similar to this when I was about  However I would hear music like s jazz music instead of voices The first few times it happened I would run out into my living to ask my mom to turn down whatever it was she was listening to but as soon as I left my room the music would stop Needless to say I still cant listen to jazz music without feeling creeped out,0,cdpzfvb,1rplro,nosleep,hot,1.0,1
pizzamann,Sounds like an OEB experienceWhere all your surroundings seem surreal in a sense and everything looks different yet the same Its kinda like lucid dreaming only youre not really dreaming but its kinda hard to explain lol after a while though if you practice you can actually willing have oeb experiencesive done a few but the last time I did oneugh never again for a while anyways haha,0,cdpzq6l,1rplro,nosleep,hot,1.0,1
Alison,This happened to me too Only a small difference I couldnt hear voices but I saw people I never recognized the people and they were talking but I couldnt hear what they were saying Or I would hear it in extreme slow motion My parents always said they were night terrors But I never actually fell asleep before it started,0,cdq0bhw,1rplro,nosleep,hot,1.0,1
GhostOfDawn,I used to have many nightmares and I always heard strange noises when I was younger I would always keep a light on because I felt a lot safer that way A few nights I heard strange sounds coming from my living room it sounded like high pitched gibberish sounded like two beings were communicating Those nights terrified me This went on for a week or two,0,cdq0st9,1rplro,nosleep,hot,1.0,1
epulella,Minus the voices Ive been experiencing this occasionally all my lifeThe room seems to become larger objects in it appear smaller and everything seems to go faster than normal movements speech etcIm glad someone brought up the Alice in Wonderland Syndrome as Ive always wondered heh what this was and if I was the only one experiencing itYour experience sounds quite terrifying though I couldnt deal with the voices,0,cdq100j,1rplro,nosleep,hot,1.0,1
Eatsleepfag,Wow The same thing actually happened to me as a kid Every time I fell slightly asleep I would hear the voices They started as whispers and grew louder I could never understand what they were saying either As soon as I opened my eyes they would stop and I would like jump up and turn on the lights And the room stretching would always occur before I closed my eyes Later I concluded that it wouldnt happen when I left something on like the radio or the lights And Still to this day I sleep with something on ,0,cdq1ap5,1rplro,nosleep,hot,2.0,2
Whiteblonde,I didnt hear any voices but ya the whole room expanding for a brief moment yes for that matter even outside in open amp it still happens sometimes May be its our eyes adjusting to conditions thats what i thought of it until now,0,cdq1ufa,1rplro,nosleep,hot,1.0,1
kHvie,I dont know if this is true or nosleeptrue but something really similar used to happen to me all the time I would be just about to fall asleep when I would hear whispering never recognizable words though just sounds I only ever experienced one voice but it would get louder and louder over  minutes  and eternity as a  year old until the voice reached a deafening volume It was like a human roar that echoed in my hear for a solid  minutes and then suddenly Id be waking up in the morning or after a nap and everything would be fine,0,cdq1xgt,1rplro,nosleep,hot,1.0,1
cimplosive,I do sometimes get that wired disorienting feeling from laying down perhaps too quickly  Like when you close your eyes you lose your balance and you think your about to fall No voices for me though,0,cdq2if3,1rplro,nosleep,hot,1.0,1
stillborn,Im almost  and I still get this usually just before I get sick No voices but things seem disproportionate Thats not even the right term but its the best one I can think of Things seem small and far away but theyre proportionate with everything else Just far away My hands seems far away the walls seem far away everything seems like its far away but not disproportionate to each other Kind of like how things in the mirror seem to change size when you get closerfarther from the mirror but they really dont Ive had people suggest its AIWS but none of the symptoms match My body parts are proportionate Im not hearing things Im not having migraines etc It just feels like everything is SUPER far away ,0,cdq2k1i,1rplro,nosleep,hot,1.0,1
haleywho,This happened to me a few different times when I was younger actually I  used to get really sick when I was little and wake up in the hospital so my child mind connected sleeping with that and I always got really nervous to fall asleep And thats when this started to happen I would experience the change in area size It felt like I was being pushed and pulled in my room while not moving at all Things becoming large and then me feeling small Then I heard the voices A very cluttered collection of voices and it would get so loud and my mom would have to come and help me fall asleep I hated it so much Reading this I felt like I knew what you were talking about ,0,cdq2oco,1rplro,nosleep,hot,1.0,1
glbracer,Yeah this happened to me all the time from when I was around four to six maybe up until seven Sometimes it would be growing smaller sometimes larger I didnt hear voices or whispers but this loud music it would grow louder as time went on I reacted pretty much the same way Ive always wondered if this has ever happened to anyone else It stopped when I moved out of the house,0,cdq2qkl,1rplro,nosleep,hot,1.0,1

kahakiman,Oh god reading this has really freaked me out Aside from the voices this exact thing happened to me as I was a kid I think the doctors Ive been to called it Alice In Wonderland Syndrome I remember the room an my body and everything warping and changing and causing migraines and nausea I remember that I would end up so nauseous that I would often vomit and afterwards I would have to watch tv because every time I closed my eyes it would get worse  ,0,cdq3zu0,1rplro,nosleep,hot,1.0,1
theaviatroy,This is what happens to me which I learned as they became frequent from ages   Whenever I fall asleep where I will accidentally put weight on an arm like sleeping with an arm behind you back  the larger space of my environment happens I would cry because sleep paralysis is also involved but like I said it only happens whenever an arm of mine is being weighed down by my asleep body Thank you for sharing,0,cdq4eyn,1rplro,nosleep,hot,1.0,1

bleeblahblow,My experiences  yrs oldwere both awake and asleep Voices would crescendo into a roar and Id feel like taffy getting worked over My flesh would seem to expand with the space around me while my bones would condense A majority of the time I would wake and be so nauseous that dinner would leave me It was an oppressive feeling but hollowing It may have been a way for my mind to cope with things or it couldve been something else entirely swear Ive seen ghosts or something similar Either way Id wait and ride it out If I got sick the run into a lit bathroom and sounds of it would get drowned out and not come back It happened sporadically,0,cdq5ux8,1rplro,nosleep,hot,1.0,1
Tinuva,Yeah this is nothing new to me Its been happening since i was five or so as well Eighteen years later and it still happens at least two or three times a week It starts with a complete lack of control of my body Im assuming some version of sleep paralysis then the expansion of space in my room it can often feel like Im lying in the middle of a football field Then its a weightlessness or the feeling of my limbs weighing a thousand times heavier Then the incessant whispering growing louder and louder with every passing minute until it becomes a roar I can never full hear what the voices say Probably should go see a psychiatrist about it one of these days ,0,cdq6gmp,1rplro,nosleep,hot,1.0,1
