The jokes on them though! There is no drama in my family. We sit and have dinner together nearly every night and can have a debate without anyone getting offended. We're close knit and can talk about anything. We trust each other explicitly and my parents marriage is going strong after 20 years.

By far the best story though is when my aunt/convoluted cousin married a Muslim Arab. The bride's (that is, my) family told everyone he was ""French Italian"". When his parents (even more fundamental than hers) refused to come to the wedding, my family forged a letter in French from them expressing their good wishes and apologies for not making it. Everyone knew it was bullshit, but still they felt it was necessary. Truly bizarre.

wirsinddiejaeger,"I marched sousaphone in high school, and every year at homecoming, since we don't march and the music is incredibly lame, the sousaphones spin in time with the music. (like we're in a line, there's four of us, we each take four counts to turn all the way around, then the next one starts, then the next, then the last, then it goes back to the front). My freshman and sophomore year (and supposedly every year before that) my drum major and band teacher tell us we're not allowed to spin (""it distracts the audience from the ceremony!"") and give us each a week of band detention for it when we do. junior year I take over the section, and we get a new drum major. They forget to tell us not to spin, we do it, they say nothing afterwards. Senior year same thing happens. At the band banquet at the end of my senior year, when we get awards and talk about band and stuff, my teachers gets up there and gives a speech about me and my fantastic leadership skills and specifically mentions that I ended the horrible tradition of sousa spins. My section and are are sitting in the back giggling our asses off. Drum major makes a speech, makes the same comment. The next year, when I'm gone, they get caught again and my band teacher doubles the detention because he's furious that they ""dared to bring that back"". Noe one ever told him, and I don't think anyone ever will.

walfredo_primavera,"It feels like you've suddenly woken up in a different world. The news at first is surreal. You don't really believe it totally. All your memories, all your happy times are still there but they aren't. In a way it's like a piece of the puzzle is missing and all you want is to have it back so everything can be whole again but when you realize that it won't you can't breathe. You drown, you miss them, you suffocate in the knowing that it's over and they're gone. It actually makes you kind of angry because you want them so badly to just one more time, to be there for you but they won't come back. You begin to regret the times you *didn't* spend with them even as you look fondly on the times you did. At the funeral, it all becomes surreal again, like a procession of time passed and people coming up to you to offer you condolence but by then you're so depleted and you just want it to be over. Sometimes part of you is still in there thinking that maybe once the funeral is over they'll come back and you can do all the same things again but you can't. It hurts. It hurts really really bad. A few days go by, then a few weeks and not to sound cheesy but after a few weeks you find some comfort in some little thing. When my grandpa passed away it was in looking up at the stars for awhile. Or a sunny day. Just something that makes you just a bit happier and then the puzzle comes back together and you feel alright.

And somehow, deep down, you don't want it to. You wan't to feel the same sadness forever, because the alternative is so much worse. The alternative is that you're beginning to forget, to let go, and you feel as if you no longer regret their passing.

barrelofhumans,"I play in bars every weekend. What I see that keeps people hanging around better than anything is if it's in a county where smoking is permitted in their bars a good smoke filtering system works better than anything. Even smokers can't stand poorly ventilated bars. 

Places that don't have fully functioning kitchens offering free snacks keep people round. 

This isn't really science but a system to deal with problems quickly. We played a bar one night where several fights broke out. The really bad part was that they were some of the same people fighting on separate occasions. Our singer had enough when a bar stool came flying by and hit one of our subs... She turned off the PA and we left promptly. We weren't safe and neither were the customers. 

Again this isn't scientific but really you can see the differences in the staff at different bars. The bars that do the best are the one's with competent bartenders who smile and interact.  

If it's a place where bands play a proper stage and dance floor are extremely important. People dancing equals people staying and drinking. 

A popular bar in my area has an old school bus and will shuttle anyone anywhere in the county for free if they dont feel they can drive. People drink and have no worries about drinking too much.

I'm a Filipina, born and raised. However, I moved to the States around 9 years ago, for my mother lived(s?) here. My mom picked my sister and myself from my grandmother's house in the Philippines and flew to the States. I met him in baggage claim. I remember how the feeling - it was surreal. I didn't have a father figure prior to my step-dad, so it was bizarre to think, ""Oh, I have a dad now."" Though that didn't stop me from running to him and hugging him when I saw him! 

He's a very lovely man. He's one of my biggest role models/best friends, but he's really old fashioned. I don't call him by his first name or as my ""step-dad."" He's my dad - through blood or not. :)",null,0,cdp7i5e,1ro9s4,AskReddit,top_day,2

Razerazeraze23,"I took my own step-dad as my real dad when he told me how he straightened me out, and tought me a couple important things that made me decide my career, when he was drunk.

I had resented him even though he and my mom were together for 5 years, as long as my biological father was together with my mom, and had 4 kid together. He hadn't done it anymore prior to this event, but in their first couple years, he would hit my mom. He straightened out, but I always resented him for that. He never hit me or my sister, except for one occasion, (where I deserved it), and he didn't even touch me, more so shove me. All this was done when he and my mother would drink. Now they don't anymore, as drama unfolds between either them, or their friends. But on this occasion they were drinking, and I heard my baby sister crying, so I went upstairs, (I live in the basement.), and made her her bottle. I was in a bad mood, so I back-talked, saying things like ""oh quit drinking, nobody's watching her."" Keep in mind, I didn't know my sister that was watching her was in the bathroom. I went in the room where I tried to put her to bed, and my mom was angry at me. My step-dad usually tries to make peace, even when drunk, so he told her to calm down, and that he would talk to me. He went in the room with me and closed the door. I knew he was gonna go on a long speech, as he does when I get in trouble when they drank. He started talking about how my moms just mad that I spend all my time downstairs hiding from everything and not doing anything to help around the house, (which I felt was right, seeing as I did spend all my time on my computer), and that she was only saying that because she was sad about news she had recieved earlier that day. The news was that an almost-two year old girl on our reserve, (I'm native), had choked on something on the floor. That girl had died in the hospital. He talked about how we needed to clean up the living room floor really good, because my sisters were only 4, 2, and 1. He then asked me how I would feel if my 1 year old sister choked on something on the floor. I started crying, and he apologized for making me feel that way, because he was just trying to be a father. He then went on about how I may not accept him as my father, but he was my dad. He was there for me when my dad wasn't, and even made me his ""heir"", (he does have another son, with his ex). He talked about how he got me off smoking weed, (I did it when I was a really spoiled and insensitive kid), and that he knew how to do a LOT of things, but whenever I would ask things like ""how do i take apart this"" or ""how do i do this"" and he would say he didn't know how, it was just to get me to learn how to do that stuff on my own. After him saying this I went downstairs and cried some more and watched Netflix. I dwelled on what he said, and I began appreciating him for doing that, because whenever he said that I would be like ""Jeez he's an idiot"", and google it and then I would get more into it and learn how to do it. If he hadn't done that, right now I would still be pondering a career and not know my way. He's also really funny and caring. ",null,0,cdp7x0l,1ro9s4,AskReddit,top_day,1

We were all confused looking around for our missing bars. Amidst our confusion one of the quieter kids in the class, David, dumps his envelope sneakily into his backpack. Loosing his grip as he walks to put I back on the rack, the backpack falls to the floor, 31 candy bars spill out onto the carpet. All of the rage of 30 young children was unleaded.

Diptura,"I used to steal books from teachers starting back in middle school.

 My family hadn't any books nor were they the type to just buy me some so I just stole some from my English teachers starting around 6th grade but probably kept stealing till 11th grade now that I think about it. The first I ever stole was my favorite book back then (second favorite now) ""Who is Bugs Potter?"".

 I had always wanted to read but I could only rent books from the library or read them in class. It felt so good actually having books that were mine. I really did love reading, back in elementary school I spent recess in the library helping Ms Spaulding reshelve the books, and I could read as much as I wanted at that time too. I read all the Encyclopedia Brown and I reread the 2000 edition of Guinness world records (you know the one with the silver cover) plenty of times in between new books because it had boobies. 

6th: All the Gordon Korman books I could get my hands on (Beware the Fish, The War with Mr. Wizzle, etc) around 6-8 of them.

7th: I stole about twenty Boxcar Children books and Tangerine.

8th&amp;9th: Eragon series, Artemis Fowl series, Alex Rider series.

10th: all the Inkheart series (saw the movie, made me upset), The Book Thief, A Wrinkle in Time, Percy Jackson and The Lighting Thief series.

11th: Catch-22, Lord of the Flies, The Prince, Night.

By 12th grade I got a job and was buying up the continuation of my series.

When I graduated from college I went back to my teachers and told them what I had done. A few suspected it (apparently I wasn't smooth as I thought a child) but allowed it anyway and a couple were outright surprised at my behavior. Funny surprised not like angry surprised. ""Oh Diptura I would never have guessed it was you taking all my books haha"". 
 
Well I haven't the money now (being a poor teacher myself) but someday I want to give some money for new books to everyone so more kids like me can read these books that I selfishly took. I also try to encourage my students to ask and not just take because I'm sure most teachers would gladly let you borrow some.

One of the best pieces of advice came before any of us started stealing anything. We were just hanging out at a super market with a buddies Dad and decided to wonder off.

stupideep,"When you think of something you like (a person, money, a hobby, et cetera), your brain produces ""feel good"" chemicals.  Even at a low level, these chemicals become ""easy access"" for people.  So, whether someone knows it or not, they will begin thinking about certain things a lot to get those ""feel good"" chemicals flowing in their system.  This actually works, too, but after time goes by, if someone does not actually do/acquire their envisioned item/person/activity, they will start to feel regret for not having done any action to actually gain their item/person/activity -- and this will lead to conflicting thoughts in ones head and, thus, dissonance.  So, daydreaming can be fine and even healthy, but too much of it can cause issues.  It's very easy, quick, and pleasing to think about being rich or having something in your life, but you need to counterbalance those thoughts with actual efforts to achieve said result.",null,0,cdp7r1x,1rob0a,AskReddit,top_day,3

Nikki4321,"For our 10th anniversary, my ex convinced me we were going to Alaska to the Andalusian Islands. I packed a suitcase full of cold weather clothes. I went to the airport in a coat and hat in March, so it was still cold here. Got to Atlanta, was run all around the airport to confuse me, he started an argument about my core beliefs, got on Alaskan airlines in California, with people that clearly didn't know how to dress for Alaska, and after we were on the plane, he told me we were going to a resort on the island of Kauai   for 7 days. He actually bought the same luggage, replaced all of my clothes while I was gone, bought me some new outfits. Sidenote, he said I wouldn't need snow pants in Alaska in March. I insisted I did. I said, dude, if I don't need snow pants I would give him a blumkin. The most disgusting thing in the world to me. 

When I found out I was going to Hawaii, my first thought was, oh shit, I don't need snowpants! 

 This sounds so romantic, and it was for me.The kicker? A couple months after we got back, he was so clueless about me, after 10 yrs, that he said he hadn't thought about how nice that would have been for me and how much I would enjoy it ( we never had a honeymoon) He said he only did everything he did, to play an elaborate practical joke on me.

JackStalk,"I'm a professional DJ. I find it really rewarding and love it a lot. It fits my life perfectly. I was always into music (used to play drums) and realized that I could make a lot more money if I played music myself as opposed to splitting it with three extra members of a band. I believe I have a really wide taste of music and I enjoy playing most genres from the 1950s-Present. There is so much amazing music out there. I'm actually spending this Thanksgiving in my basement studio going through my endless library of tracks and making new playlists. I wouldn't trade my job for anything, I just love music and helping people discover new things. The only advice I can give you is that you should find something you love so much that you'd do it for free, and then get someone to pay you to do it. That's what I've done and I've never looked back.

mattgamer247,"My girlfriend went away to college, and she decided to stay with me, even though originally she wanted to break up with me before she went off to college. Well, long story short, she broke up with me yesterday. She says she still loves me, shes just not in love with me. I'm still in love with her. She says she goes through phases, that she can't focus on school and a relationship. Right now she's in the ""not wanting a relationship"" stage. She said in a few months, maybe she'll want to be in one. She knows that eventually she'll want to get back together with me, she just can't deal with a relationship at this moment. She said she stayed with me because she didn't want to hurt me. And she hoped we could make it. She says she tried, but she's just done. I..... kiinda lost control yesterday when she told me this. I yelled. I cried. I hit my bed. I asked her what happened, that she said she loved me, that she said we would make it.
I've helped her through a lot of things. Her depression. Her PTSD. According to her, I made her feel loved and cared about when no one else did. And now it's all gone. Now I'm depressed, and she's depressed because she sees how much it hurts me. Everything ended up worse than it began. She's suicidal again. According to her and her friend, I'm getting to the point where I would be suicidal too, although I keep telling them that I'm not depressed (idk if theyre right or not).
I'm sad. I'm hurt. I'm angry. I want to break something. I want to burst into tears. I want to sit there and have a breakdown, and have someone be able to deal with it and tell me that I matter and that someone cares about me. I want her. I want her to help me. She always told me that no matter what, we would still be friends and she would be there for me. And now she's not. And because I wouldn't listen, because I didn't give her space when she needed it, she might end up dead. She probably will. I still want to help her, I still want to be there for her. I just don't know what to do.
I don't have that many friends. I have one friend that I keep in contact with that I see often enough to make a difference. But he hasn't noticed anything is wrong. And he wouldn't be able to help even if he did. He doesn't know how to help. He's visibly uncomfortable, but all he can say is ""I don't know"".
She is my first love, and my first relationship. I need her to help me. Because I don't know what I'm going to do without her. She's the most important thing in my life. Fuck college. Fuck work. Fuck the rest of my friends, I want her.
She said that I ask too many questions, and I do. I don't know when to stop asking questions. I just want the answers to things. And more often than not, the answer is ""I don't know."" Which doesn't help me. So I push. And I push. And I push. Until she's angry and mad and upset. That's one of the reasons it's gotten this far. I also overthink things. For her, it's just ""Here's the answer, now can we stop talking about it?"" She doesn't like to talk about things. I do. I need to learn to accept her answers. She says that the harder I push, the longer it would be before she would be ready to be in a relationship with me again.
I hope we can figure something out. That was what I would be thankful for this Thanksgiving. A chance. Even if we just go on a break and act like friends, I don't know what I would do if she was no longer in my life. Everyone says that I would get over it, that it would be ok. I don't think it would be. Going without talking to her makes me feel like I'm being ripped in half. What am I supposed to do when the most important thing in my life is no longer there? How am I supposed to cope? And I don't want to cope. I want to make things work. I want to care for her, and for her to care for me back. I know it's fucked up, and I should accept what she's saying. And I will. But I don't know if I would be ok in the end. How am I supposed to fill up the days when I'm not talking to her? Play video games? Talk to someone else? Do homework? None of those things matter to me. I can't do any of them because all I think about is her.
I still have hope that something can be worked out. Because I don't know what to do if they don't. I hope at the very least we can still remain friends, but then I wouldn't get to talk to her as much. I NEED to talk to her. My life feels pointless without it. There's nothing I've been as passionate about before her. Ask anyone, before she came along I was just drifting through life. I finally found something to care about, something that is important to me. Something I can put my whole heart into.
I wish I could stop thinking. I wish I could reach the ""not give a shit"" stage of depression. I wish my heart could be ripped out of my chest and no emotion remain. I really wish they would stop playing all these stupid fucking love songs on the radio. I wish I could do SOMETHING to save our relationship. Because I don't know if I can accept it being over. And that scares me. What if I'm a freaking creepy stalker? What if turn into one of those people that calls nonstop until she answers, and she's just answering to pity me? What if I show up at her college? I KNOW these things would be crazy. I know it's not ok to do those things. But I could also see myself doing those things, no matter how much I might know it's wrong. It's no longer about what's right and wrong, it's about how I feel and that I want someone to make it better. I want someone to care about me. And I want that person to be her.
What's worse? To not have any support at all, or to be told that you do have support and then when you need it, it's not there?
I understand how she's feeling. At least, as much as I can. I don't blame her. I know she doesn't want me to be like this. I know she still cares. I know that I still care about her. I know that there might be some time in the future that we could make it work. I know that if I continue to act this way, bad shit will happen. She'll become more depressed, she might commit suicide because of it. I don't know what might happen to me. I do know that if I continue to act this way, my chances of anything working become smaller and smaller. But I can't stop. I can't make it go away, no matter how hard I try.
You ever feel like there's literally too much emotion to handle? Like it's burning you up, like you're going to explode if you don't get some sort of release?
I need to keep up hope. I need to keep hoping that we can figure out something. Whether it's hope or denial, I need to keep it there. Because I don't know what will happen if I don't. I would break, I know that. I would break and then I might do something I'd regret, because it would be to myself and it would end up upsetting her.
Maybe I'm crazy. Maybe I'm fucked up in the head. Maybe I need a therapist. I shouldn't have to depend on her to make me feel better. I don't know. But I need to reign this in. I need to make myself feel better. I need to not become insane. I need to work and fix my own craziness, that I didn't even know I had. It HAS to go away. Because I don't want to hurt her anymore. She's too important for that. Her happiness is so much more important than my own. She doesn't deserve another crazy person in her life. I need to make it go away....
I keep going between acceptance and fucked up. One minute the good side is telling me to let her go, and hopefully remain friends, and even if we don't, know that she's happy. The other part is screaming, crying, raging, roaring hurt that begs for some way to let it continue. I hope the good side wins. It probably will.
I'll see how she feels over Christmas break. That's two weeks from now. The crazy will be gone by then. I'm not going to let it out. Even if I freak the fuck out later, I can't let it affect her.
Once again, I'm repeating myself. Like always. I just need to accept things and move on. When I talk to her again on Saturday, I'll see if she wants to figure something out. And NO MATTER WHAT, I'm not going to ask too many questions. I'll sit there, and listen, and accept what she's saying.
Maybe things will work out. Maybe they won't. I hope they do. I hope she won't be depressed anymore, that no matter what the outcome, she'll have something that makes her happy. Even if it's not me. I don't give a fuck how I feel. All I care about is her.
And I know that no one but the OP is even going to see this. Hell, the OP might not even want to read a giant block of text like this. How is it that one can be surrounded by friends, and yet no one can see your suffering? And even worse, those that do, don't even care enough to stop it.",null,2,cdpb4wz,1robxu,AskReddit,top_day,3

The world is quickly becoming a post scarcity world, which means that you're probably going to be unemployed. We're not going to need factory workers anymore. We're not going to need drivers anymore. We're not going to need secretaries anymore. 

The truth is that the world needs about 5% of the population to do research and engineering. We need probably 10% of the population to do maintenance work, such as infrastructure replacement, IT, etcetera. Maybe another 20% will do service work. And another 5% to be doctors and shit. And the rest of you will need to find ways to entertain yourself while receiving a reasonable baseline salary to keep some semblance of the economy going. These are all really really generous percentages by the way, since the reality is probably going to be something like we need 300,000 engineers period. 

If you want to make money in a world where most of the population doesn't need to work, you're going to have to find a way for people to express themselves. And that's through arts and stuff. As stupid as it sounds, pinterest and etsy is your life in the future.

smilingasIsay,"So, this is about the first time I received head, you might call it a coming of age tale.  Now, let me take you back to 14 year old me in the summer after grade 9, I had already called me mom for a ride home and recently smoked a joint so I wasn't looking to be social but I was standing in on of those circles of people that people tend to get in to at large outdoor parties and this girl bumps in to the circle next to me and say, ""hey.""  And I respond, ""hey"" She immediately asks, ""are you single?"" To which I respond, ""yeah"" And she says ""So, you're just a hot single guy at this party? Wanna go behind the barn over there?""  ... ""Yeah""  Now I was thinking on the way, that was way too easy, I should find a way to have her do something to me so I don't have to touch her (cause like....thaaaat's how I'd catch something).  We get behind the barn and she looks at me very seductively and says, ""so what're you looking to happen here tonight?"" To which I reply in porn script like fashion ""I'm looking for you to get down on your knees"" And she does it! Now, this is ten years later and I can confidently say, still the best blow job I've had, she knew her way around a dick.  But I started thinking, my mom could be in the driveway already waiting for me, I gotta hurry this along, so I start tensing my muscles and thinking of every possible thing I can to finish faster and just as I'm about there four girls walk around the corner of the barn and go ""wow!"" The girl tries to pull waay from my dick, I blow the load all over her face, down the front of her shirt and stroke the last bits out while the girls who caught the finale run away.  I then stand up, zip up, look down at the girl now sitting back, and say ""well....see yah"" and she goes ""...see yah"" and I left.  Don't know her name, don't know how she made it out of that party given the barn was at the back of the party, or if she had a change of clothes.

Flash forward, we're in my buddy's parents bed fooling around. I knew I wasn't going to have sex because it was a fairly new relationship and she wasn't totally ready yet. That's cool, I'll just give her head and call it a night.

Didn't go quite that well. 

As I said, I was pretty drunk, so I was fumbling around on top of her for a but, then I get her pants off and get to work. After what felt like 10 minutes but was realistically more like 2 or 3, I roll out of bed, stumble my way into the bathroom, and begin praying to the porcelain gods. 

I started to feel bad because I thought she would think I was throwing up because she had a dirty snatch or something, so naturally, I get up to explain that it isn't her fault. I got to about ""don't worry, it's not because..."" turned back to the bathroom, and continued my worship.

Allons-yDarling,"Disclaimer that I am not technically a proper teacher, but I am a daycare provider and assistant preschool teacher. I work with kids aged 2-5 on a regular basis, and sometimes up to age 10. This was a parent of one of our four years olds, who has two older sisters that we sometimes have after school. This was within my first three months of working, and it was almost 6 pm, when we close. The mom came to pick her three kids up and she walked in the room and simply said to me, ""Can I talk to you for a minute?"" I said sure and stepped into the hallway with her. Her daughters started to follow us out and she said abruptly, ""Go and wait inside the classroom."" I'm thinking that she wants to ask me something about her kids' behavior, so I wait.

She starts in with, ""I really don't appreciate you yelling at the kids every time I come in here. I already yell at my kids at home, I don't pay you to yell at them here. I've already had problems with how the new workers are treating the kids and I'm considering pulling my kids from daycare here. I've been taking my kids here for ten years and I have never heard a teacher yell at them like you do."" I'm just standing there a bit stunned, and I manage to mumble, ""Okay, I'm sorry."" I don't remember what she said after that, but once she got her kids I went back in the classroom and started to cry. Thank goodness there was only one kid and one other worker there. I know, it shouldn't have made me cry, but I was still new, I was a 19 year old college student, and I was honestly the most mild-mannered and sweetest teacher working there at that point. I'm not trying to paint myself in a flattering light, it's just I seriously didn't yell. If I did raise my voice, it was to tell the kids we had five minutes before going inside, or I saw a kid doing something dangerous on the other side of the room. And her favorite worker (who babysat for her kids on the weekends) yelled at the kids way more than I did.

But, of course, it doesn't end there. A few months later, at the beginning of the school year, I'm out on the playground with the kids and some coworkers and one of our little boys starts hitting. This isn't the son of the mom in question, he's another three year old in my classroom. So I tell him to stop and he's going to sit in time out. He doesn't listen, so I go over and when he won't let me take his hand and lead him to the bench, I pick him up and carry him over to set him down. Standard procedure for when our three-year-olds don't want to listen. Well, apparently, the mom in question was sitting in her car waiting for her daughters to get off the bus and watching the playground. I let the boy who was in trouble get up after talking to me about hitting, and then I have to take some girls into the bathroom. While I was inside, the bus comes and then the mom comes over to pick up her son. She asks one of my coworkers, ""Was that Miss [blank] who put that boy on the bench?"" They said yes, and she continued with, ""She just slammed that boy down on the bench, that's not okay. I am going to report her to your director."" And off she went. I get back, my coworkers tell me what she said, and I'm upset. I've been avoiding working with her son for months because he was telling me he didn't like me and I didn't want to get in any more confrontations with her, and her son was finally being friendly to me again. But, of course, I don't know what to do about the mom because I'm still young and new-ish, so I try to ignore it.

Less than a week later, I come into work and her son is going to the bathroom, so he says to me, ""Miss [blank], my mommy says she's watching you because she doesn't trust you."" And I pause, say ""Okay...."" and go into my classroom. I tell my coworker what the kid said, and she says, ""Huh, that's weird, he told me his mom was watching you earlier but I thought that was just because you live near each other."" Which, yes, I do live near them and we walk our dog past their house, but that would still be in creepy territory. I'm concerned and creeped out, because clearly this lady doesn't like me even though I'm good at my job, so I finally talk to the assistant director, as our director was sick. She tells me that if anything else happens, I have to document it because that would make three incidents and they would have to call a conference, since the kid can't talk to me that way.

Of course, nothing else happened, but I'm still uncomfortable around the mom. The kids are fine now, but I'm still terrified of doing something ""wrong"" and the mom sees. But now, she's perfectly pleasant to me so I have no idea what the hell is wrong with her. I'm good at my job and I know that most of the parents like me, so all the incidents with her have just seemed so bizarre and upset me.

tldr; Mom has some vendetta against me, makes me cry, and makes me paranoid that she's watching and/or her kids are reporting to her, only to have it all come to nothing and now she's nice to me. ",null,0,cdp9a5z,1rocv7,AskReddit,top_day,1

It's set in the near future where the internet is explorable in full 3D, and some people have minor surgical operations to get full sensation by plugging in. Things go wrong when people start disappearing online. Their bodies remain, but their personalities vanish into the system and no-one can explain why or how. Some catch glimpses of a deeper web with worlds that are apparently real, but which no-one seems to know anything about. 

What this 'Otherland' is and where peoples loved ones have gone seem to be linked, but people are dying, and worse, just trying to find out what's going on. ",null,0,cdpbe7o,1roczg,AskReddit,top_day,1

Infinite_Ambiguity,"I always tip without exception. And I always tip at least 20% of the total bill (including tax) and then round up to the nearest whole dollar. And, for very good service, I'll give over 20% and sometimes as much as 100%.  

I also given inner tips to people I think might get shafted by other customers for whatever superficial reason might seem apparent on the theory that I'm making up for superficial people who didn't tip or didn't tip adequately for the apparent superficial reason. 

Please give adequate tips. These people are providing an essential service and their base-wage is very low. 

Edit -- I also always go over 20% if I occupy the table for more than a reasonable time period.  For example, if I stay twice as long as you'd expect someone to stay under the circumstance (because I'm meeting with someone or reading or on iPad or whatever), then I give at least twice the minimum tip. This adjustment might not apply if there are always many free tables in the server's coverage area, but, if there's any doubt, I make this adjustment upward.  I'm not sure everyone understands that the table is a revenue-generating asset for the server and the business. If I occupy it two or three times longer than I should, then I should at least tip two or three times higher to make sure the server isn't getting deprived of revenue on my account.

It's not that hard of a job and a few people not tipping are not going to impoverish you.

Gaberader1,You have to make it clear to her how wrong what she's doing is. She must stop this so you have to tell her that if she doesn't stop trying to take control and hitting your dog then she can't be around him.,null,1,cdp8zme,1roeyc,AskReddit,top_day,2
jaredbear123,"Well dogs won't always associate the punishment with what they have done.  That said.  Yelling is the wrong approach.  Some breeds and personality dogs will mistake it for you joining in.  Also the honey voice that we use for reward is a bad way to calm the dog.  It truly depends on the breed, the amount of training the dog already has, and how much time you are willing to commit to training your dog not to bark.  Some dogs it is so ingrained into them that you can't prevent the barking itself, but you can interrupt continuous barking.  It doesn't have to be with treats or toys, but maybe the slamming of a door, or cupboard.  It would distract my dog just long enough that she forgot she was barking at something.  Another thing that takes longer is training your dog speak and quiet.  To do this make them bark, this is often easiest by barking at them or ringing a doorbell/knocking on the door and when they bark, associating it with the word speak.  But a few seconds after that, once it won't be associated with barking, but before it can be associated with walking away, sitting or another action, teach them quiet.  

Tell your mom hitting and yelling encourages a domination competition with your dog.  Eventually it will come to a head and it won't be pretty for your dog in the end.  A dog that is hit all the time won't be happy, and it might eventually bite and snap.  ",null,1,cdp91be,1roeyc,AskReddit,top_day,2
Puddock,"Sounds like he's your mothers dog, not your dog. She will get very defensive if you bring this up, so you need to do it in one of two ways; either quietly ""Hey, I saw this film on dog training and I think we should try x with him, what do you think?"" x is your way, but since you are offering it up to her she can take it and make it her way without ever feeling that she was shown up - or, if it get seriously out of hand, you will have to confront her and have an argument. She will get defensive and nasty, but you'll just have to push through and hopefully she'll come around.

Think of him as your mothers dog. Then think about how you would react if somebody told you your way of training was wrong with your dog. I know it's difficult, but I bet she doesn't think she's hurting him and she thinks she's doing everything correctly, so she will flip bits when you tell her otherwise, especially if you think she's abusive and she thinks she's not.

_Kai_1871,"Ah Cesar, he writes and broadcasts a compelling story, but his methods are questioned in the veterinary community. Honestly, I want my dog to bark if the door is being opened. Since this is a problem I would suggest practicing positive reinforcement by having him sit near the door and giving him the command sit while someone tries to open it. If you are there voicing the command he should hopefully quietly sit and then you give him a treat- rinse and repeat so he associates that when the door is opening, and he is seating, he gets a treat.

vest816,"The hashtag fad.

FUN TRIVIA TIME!

The hashtag is not new. It was used decades ago in the old usenet days as a manner to bookmark topics and follow discussions in chatroom logs. So if I had a hardware problem with installing an OS, I would ask a chatroom the question followed by #OSInstall

It made a ton of sense. I could go back to the chat log, and do a 'Find' for #OSInstall to find all answers to the question while sorting through any other inquiries in the chat.

However, the combination of easily accessible social media sites and dumb people resulted in the hashtag no longer being a bookmark of conversation, but just a general whatever thing. Advertising has latched onto this, and now putting hashtags in front of words is some zippy adspeak that shows how trendy and hip our retailers are with customers.

Anybody with a lick of oldschool tech sense knows this is stupid. The hashtag in conversations makes a ton of sense, I don't want to see the hashtag itself go away. I do, however, want the hashtag *fad* to eat shit and fall of the planet. It doesn't make an advertisement look hip, edgy, or on the pulse. It's the complete opposite.

I ran away from school in kindergarten. It was a private Christian school, so it was laid out like a church, big open lobby no desks or offices up front and class rooms down side hallways. I got tired of being there, and my dad lived just a couple streets over, so I told my teacher I had to go to the bathroom, walked out into the hall and got my backpack (still not sure why they had is keep them outside) and literally walked right out of the door and across the parking lot. On my journey, someone pulled their car over on the shoulder, got out and started talking to me. I just kept walking because I knew the 'never talk to strangers' rule, I finally told her where I was going and she insisted on walking with me. We got onto my dads road and she suggested we go to the fire station across the street. My uncle was a firefighter, I knew they were safe so I agreed. While she talked to one fireman, another took me to show me their super cool fire truck. Next thing I know I'm on the road back to school. Best part? The school didn't know I was gone until I showed up in the firetruck.  My parents were livid and pulled me out of the school not too long after (though for other reasons). I don't really remember getting in trouble but I did have to write a thank you letter to the woman who walked with me. Turns out she worked at a daycare called safe and sound.

Secondly, go talk to your professors. They are the only ones who can tell you what you can do to pass. Don't go in trying to convince them to give you a break - they won't do it. Go in with the attitude that you know you've screwed up and genuinely want to fix things if it's not too late. Don't get upset with them if you are beyond passing. Just accept it and move on with what you can do.

Finally, if you do end up failing the semester, it shouldn't be the end of the world. You are on your final semester, you can retake the classes and just graduate a semester or two later than you plan. I'm graduating several years behind schedule so I can tell you that being a little behind isn't the worst thing that can happen.

My last assignment was meant to be a group project with the option of working on it alone. I emailed the prof to let her know that I wanted to work alone because if I fail this project, it's my own damn fault for doing so horribly the rest of the semester. Ended up doing about average on the project and I studied my ass off for the final. I didn't have a very solid foundation for the exam but I got a B on my final and a 50% for the course. Only way that would have been possible is if I aced the exam but I guess she wanted me to pass.

I made a lot of terrible, impulsive decisions to try to alleviate the pain I felt daily. Sometimes, this included promiscuous sex with someone who was not my significant other. I always regretted it and felt guilt afterward, which would continue the vicious cycle of emptiness.

I'm proud to say though that since I have been diagnosed several years ago and have developed and understanding of my mental illness I have not cheated. Knowing and understanding my diagnosis has been the key to living a better, cheat free life. ",null,0,cdp9hae,1rog9s,AskReddit,top_day,3

She didn't deserve anything like that, was one of the most dedicated people on the entire planet. I don't think I'll ever find (nor do I deserve to find) another person anything like her.

What's truly awful about it, is that she forgave me after finding out I had been hiding another relationship on the side... then forgave me when she found out I had been dating someone when we started dating (although that quickly ended, I never had told her about it.. Omission is still lying)... Then after almost two months, I blew it and lied about something inconsequential.. Hadn't fucked anyone, or even come close to it...

killerxpenguinz,"I live in upstate New York. After a long summer, transitioning back to fall is beautiful. The autumn air is delectable. Perfect weather for cute sweaters and fashionable heeled boots. And then It creeps on you slowly, these chilly mornings that end in warm days and die out to cool nights. Then one morning there's condensation on your windshield, the ghost of a melted frost. A few mornings later there's a dusting, quickly melting under the morning Sun. The ground starts to feel harder. You start wearing gloves because the steering wheel is too cold for your numb fingers. There's frost every day, and the sun isn't melting it away. Your defrost is. The grass starts slowly yellowing and receding.  One morning,you start noticing the white puffs you're breathing into tHE air. You start waking up cold. It's not just cold in the morning, but all day. With a biting wind. the wind starts blowing drifts of frost off trees and roofs. Small flakes fall lazily from the sky, landing on the ground to immediately melt. The first snows are exciting. One day it snows and it sticks. It gets thicker and thicker and its not melting. 

There's different types of snow. The dust snow, useless and powdery. It's shimmery and slippery. There's ""packing snow"" the perfect combination of moisture and snow. Great for clumping into snowballs in record time. It's the type of snow you use to make snowmen, you push a ball into some of it and roll it around and all the snow under it just sticks until you have a massive ball. And slush. Slush is too much moisture mixed with snow. It seeps in your shoes and makes your toes wet and numb. And it's wicked slippery and turns into a mud/snow/sludge mess.

I hate snow, because I never invest in proper snow gear which leaves me a shuddering, wet, cold mess. All season the snow melts, re freezes into ice, then snows again over the hidden ice traps. I live in a small town on a curve going up a hill so every year there's 8 feet of snow on my mailbox from the plow trucks shoving the snow in front of my driveway.

The snow weighs down tree branches, which crack and fall so a lot of the times roads are closed. Power goes out a few Times as well. Wet snow is really heavy. 

Snow is only pretty when it's fresh, or when it's untouched and has frozen over a bit and makes that awesome crunch sound when you step on it. I like making mazes for my dogs in the yard when the snow gets deep with shovels. 
 
I'm weak sauce and poor, so I have to shovel 2 cars out of my wide, gravel-ly driveway by myself since my mom is disabled and my dad is essentially blind. This is a terrible task, especially with the 8 feet of snow stacked on my mailbox. 

All in all, I think snow is terrible and inconvenient. It has to be moved and stacked somewhere else when it's in the way, and then the piles you made melt and then it freezes and turns to ice. On many occasions I've slipped into a puddle of slush and had to go back inside wet and numb to change.

So yea. Snow. Honestly I forgot the question like 3 seconds sentences in. I'm on mobile using the reddit app. Waayyyy too lazy to check. Hopefully whatever I said is relevant.

When it's below -25C, jeans become stiff.
Below -20C, jeans are not enough for an extended period of time.
It's not snowing that often but when it does, you better have your shovel handy (metal one is better).
I absolutely hate to shovel out my car in the morning when it's still dark and then you sit in it and everything is frozen and you have to drive with gloves.
In the city, you have to shovel your way out of your parking spot and then shovel your way in another parking spot.
Always have jumper cables with you.
At -20C and below, your boogers freeze when you breathe in and they thaw when you breathe out, fun stuff.
The most enjoyable part is there are absolutely no annoying insects anywhere.
When it's really cold, snow becomes crispy and makes this very satisfying high pitch sound when you walk on it.
Below -10C, you would preferably want as little exposed skin as possible.
Finally, when spring comes again, 0C feels warm and you can go outside in a t-shirt no problem.

We kicked him out of our group.  The next day, he is pissed off at the world that he has no friends.  Out of frustration, he tries beating up this short asian kid who was new to the school.  Turns out this kid was a black belt in karate, and my former friend got flying-ninja kicked by this kid.  My asshole ex-friend was suspended for instigating the fight, but surprisingly, the kid who defended himself did not get in any trouble.  Everyone was glad to see the kid not get in any trouble, and me and my buddies laughed for 5 minutes straight upon hearing about what happened.

MyUziWeighsAton,"Some of my most fond memories ever are of my grandfather, He would take me out on hikes to new places. some local, some far away. The guy was very smart, so as we walked I asked all sorta of questions, names of different plants and animals. Or just questions of things that popped in my mind. We always packed a small lunch and water so when we got to a midway point we could stop and eat, usually at a spot with a good view. ever since this I have loved learning everything there is to know about things, he is why I am the way i am.
Now I have a little brother (7) I myself am 20. he is hyper as sin and will not pay attention to anything for longer than 3 seconds. But i take him on walks to the mountain near by, pack a simple lunch that cost like $5. we walk and he asks me what type of plants we find, i tell them the name, what they do, fun facts about them. I teach him about bugs and rocks. Sometimes i'll get papers from school and every time he writes about me taking him on walks and teaching him.

weanut,"I'm not a parent but growing up, from what I can gather, I was in a similar situation to that which your son is now. My parents divorced when I was around 3 years old and my mother got custody. From as far back as I can remember I don't think my mum was ever really too interested in getting involved and would leave me to my own devices as much as possible. However, I would see my Dad once a week on a Wednesday and I would very much look forward to that. 

From what I can remember my Dad never really had planned activities as such. Similarly to yourself he was working on a very low budget and we rarely could afford to go to the cinema etc. Though what I specifically remember about those Wednesdays is that I would always get my Dad's full attention throughout the visit. He would never cancel a week and even when he made me do school work he'd sit with me and help as much as he could. Basically what I'm saying is don't worry about the activities as such, as long as you give him your full attention I'm sure he'll love spending time with you as much as I did with my Dad. 

However, seeing as you asked for advice I'll do my best to offer some of a more practical nature. My Dad later got remarried and as a result I now have a 7 year old sister who comes to stay with me and I look after her on regular occasions. When she comes round we play lots of games and also look to improve her school work. I usually ask what she's doing in school at the moment and if possible relate a game of some sort to that. Recently she has been struggling with her mental maths so we've been playing games around that. Things like number bonds where I'll say a number and she has to give me 3 numbers you can add together to make that number etc. Or we play 'shop' and she'll be the shop keeper and I'll buy items and she has to give me the right amount of change etc. There are organised activities such as Geocaching which /u/TWFM suggested and they're pretty fun also. I'd say whatever you decide to do I'm sure your Son will use his imagination make it even more fun than you could ever plan and you can work the educational aspect in around that. 

All in all just make sure you're there for him and give him your full attention whenever you can, he'll remember that later in life before any activities you arranged and respect you for it massively. I moved out a while ago now and my mum and I don't really speak anymore but I never go more than a week without phoning my Dad. Good luck finding a job and I hope you have a great time with your son.

seanj384,"For reference, I had a few ideas of my own that I thought might work:

-I'm an aspiring writer, so I thought I could use what I know about the craft to create an original short story with him.  We'd go over the Five Elements of Story and create characters, a setting, a conflict, the plot, and a resolution together and then write it all up.

-I thought about learning a bit about local flora with him: we'd go around our neighborhood gathering leaves from trees and bushes, taking pictures of flowers in people's gardens (for all that remained of these things for the year!), bring them home and look them up on the internet and read about them.

I was also in girl scouts and we did projects (I remember a fun one was a pin hole camera).  There are plenty of age appropriate projects for kids that use items laying around the house.

Home Depot offers a free kid's workshop, craft project - first Saturday of the month. Even if you don't hit it that day - I always gave parents the kits that were left over. For you, I would give you several, just look for a nice person. Paintgirls are good bets;-)

A lot of museums and the like - still waive entrance fees automatically if asked, especially if kids are involved. It's becoming less common, but worth looking into. 

Ask a friendly librarian, they often know how to work this and which museums adhere to that policy. Also, community centers, just walk in and ask. Anyone in a non-profit open to the public - generally will want to hook you up. Whether they have a program to fit or not, they might know someone who knows something. 

And parks and libraries, kick it old-school like that. Just a vote to remember how much that matters to kids, how it's also about your time and knowing that you care. ",null,0,cdpbss0,1rogvc,AskReddit,top_day,1

TheSickBoy,"I used to have lots of issues sleeping. My best advice is, when laying in bed, not to think about stressful stuff... instead try to imagine your, well, imagination as a library of potential dreams. Sift through various interesting ideas or dreams you'd like to have, then start 'daydreaming' about them. If you've got the technique down, you'll be asleep within minutes without realizing it.

Now keep in mind this doesn't guarantee you'll dream about what you 'selected' from your library. In fact, you probably won't. But it's a great way to calm down, get into dream-mode, and accidentally fall asleep in the process.

I purposely axe anything that is stressful, real-life-related, or a potential nightmare. Most of the time that can be difficult (intrusive thoughts and all that), but if you're imagining your thoughts as a library it's much easier to toss uninviting ones out. This tends to follow the general idea of ""mindfulness"" (also incredibly useful to research if you have issues with obsessing about unpleasant stuff, even when not trying to sleep), and something I have to do every day anyways for therapy for unrelated issues.

We declared to stop in the next city and take it to a repair shop, after about an hour of waiting the mechanic tells us that his brakes were shot/fully clamped on to the wheel hence friction causing the smoke, saying that if we ever needed to brake sharply to avoid something that we would have been boned.

Vongkultrup,"Baked pasta.

Italian cheese, rigatoni pasta, Italian sausage (I like spicy), spaghetti sauce (I like Newman's Own Sockerooni), Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, Zucchini, yellow Squash, mushrooms (baby bella is my favorite), if you like meat add your favorite ground (I personally like beef and pork), Fennel seeds, Onions, carrots, and garlic.


First, take the sausage out of the casing and cook in a fairly large pot with the ground meat. Wait for some of the fat to render out and meat to brown. While you are waiting get some water in a big pot salted on the stove. Add in all onion, carrot, mushrooms, and garlic. let that cook for a bit. Then add in the sauce. Add your seasonings to make it taste how you like it. I personally am big on the fennel and Italian seasoning. While all that is combining get your pasta going. Cook it a little less than aldente. Now get a biiiig dish and mix in your pasta, sauce, and a little cheese. Now get your zucchini and yellow squash in thin rounds and mix that in. Cover with cheese and bake.

deathrayy,"I don't consider myself as having been an alcoholic, but I got to the point in my late teens/early 20s where anytime I went out or was at a party I would drink to the point of heavy intoxication. I didn't see the point in just ""having a few"". It seemed like a waste of money if I wasn't going to get completely wasted. I began to avoid social situations where there wouldn't be alcohol. I'd skip lunches and outings with friends because they seemed boring, and instead I'd just go to the parties and clubs because what was the point making an effort if I couldn't get drunk?

The way I saw it was I was only drinking about once or twice a week so it wasn't a problem. It's not like I got drunk every day. I wasn't turning up drunk to work and it wasn't ""ruining my life"". 

Eventually I just kind of got sick of it. I was always the drunk one at the party, I had that reputation, and I almost always made an ass of myself and did something I regretted the next day. I was so fixated on getting as drunk as possible even though I always felt like shit about it afterward. So I made a conscious effort to cut down. I limited myself by only bringing a 6 pack of light beer to a party, rather than a full bottle of spirits. I'd only take $50 cash to a night out rather than $200. 

Now I don't drink as much and I don't miss it at all. I still occasionally get really drunk with my friends, but I don't feel the need to be completely obliterated every time I go out. I've learned to moderate my drinking and I've realised I can have just as much fun (and much fewer regrets) by just drinking a little.

I guess my point is you should reflect on your drinking habits and work out how you truly feel about yourself. You might not fit the criteria of an ""alcoholic"", and it might not be negatively impacting your daily life, but if you feel like you're drinking more than you need to and you feel like you can't always control yourself and stop drinking when you're out then it might be time to cut down.",null,0,cdpgsho,1roi47,AskReddit,top_day,1

chellekacz,"When I was 18 my wallet was stolen. I reported it to the police immediately and called to put a stop on my bank activity and credit cards. 

A day after it happened I was telling my coworkers about it. One of them suddenly realized she was in line behind a girl at a department store who was trying to pay for something with a bad check. The girl told the woman at the checkout that she would have to go get her dad's credit card and she would be back. The woman put the items on hold for the girl and the girl gave my name as the name to hold them under. My coworker didn't think anything of it other than someone had the same name as me (my maiden name was fairly common as is my first name). Once she heard my story she realized that was the girl who had my wallet. 

The following day I went to the mall to get a new wallet and on my way out I saw an elderly woman on the floor with a police officer standing by her and a stretcher coming in. I wondered what happened but I didn't want to go up to a random group and ask so I left. 

That night I got a call from the state police office. They told me they had my wallet. I was so relieved and I asked if they had my check book too and the officer acted confused. I told him my wallet had been stolen and I reported it a few days ago. He had no record of it and he asked me to come in and pick it up. I said sure, that I'd drive out and get it the next day. 

The next day I drive out to the state police to pick up the wallet. The officer told me that after doing some digging he found that I had reported the theft to the city police which is why he didn't have it on record. He then proceeded to tell me that my wallet was found in the mall parking lot. He said that a girl was caught attempting to shoplift and she ran from the police, knocked down an elderly woman, and ditched her wallet in the parking lot. Only it was MY wallet. I flipped out and told him that I was at the mall and saw the elderly woman and if I had been going down that hallway any sooner the thief would have run into me! He then said he asked me to pick the wallet up in person so they could see if I was the girl on the surveillance video who shoplifted and ditched the wallet. He concluded I was obviously me and not her and he let me go with my wallet - which looked like it had been completely ravaged. I felt so weird having it that I emptied it and threw it away.

FlyingGrype,"Man, nobody is capable of answering this question seriously.

I'm a slow drinker and I make a point of monitoring how I feel so that I *don't* drink too much. Have a drink, wait half an hour after you finish it so that your body has time to absorb the alcohol, see how you feel. If you want to be more drunk, have another (and drink some water to avoid being hung over the next day). If you feel good where you are, don't have another. 

If you're pushing it farther than what feels pleasant, you've had too much to drink. There's no point in taking the bullet train through Happyland, as I've heard it said, where you just zip right on through from sober to pleasantly tipsy to feeling sick to falling on the floor. If you're finding that you act in ways that you regret or can't control, or if you're unable to control the physical symptoms of drunkenness (staggering into things, falling over, peeing yourself), you've had too much. 

But you should be able to stop yourself *before* you get to this point, by paying attention to how you feel while you're drinking, and putting some time in between drinks. You can't predict from one party to the next how many drinks will get you to the good place or how many are too many, because of other factors like whether you're already tired, whether you're dehydrated, how much you've eaten, etc. ",null,0,cdpee8u,1roizk,AskReddit,top_day,1

SHOW_ME_YOUR_HOOHA,"I used to work tech support for Dell for over 8 years. A large chunk of that was spent on 3rd shift. One night I got a call from a customer who had just gotten his system and it wouldn't boot into Windows. It happens sometimes, seems to be a problem with the factory image load. Restoring the factory image would fix it and it only took about 10-15 minutes. So anyways, I was going to take him through the process. Along the way I heard him talking to a couple of other people in the room. A few moments later I heard what sounded like the couple getting it on in the background. This was confirmed when I could hear the bed squeaking and the girl's moans of pleasure. I did my best to maintain my composure while enjoying the show. The girl sounded like she came twice. It was made more awkward by the fact that there really isn't much to do or discuss for the duration of the restore. I told my supervisor/level 2 (actual managers didn't work 3rd shift) as soon as it was over and joked that it was probably randomly chosen to be recorded for an audit.

As a kid and teen, I rejected any kind of relationships (and still do) because of the abuse. People assumed I was/am bipolar when in fact I was just embarrassed and lived in fear of being dead. I have been depressed but never suicidal (there is a difference). I never opened to anyone about it as there was no one I could trust, or the system protects children more so. In 2010, he took a job in another state and died recently because of diabetes' complications. I could not be any more liberated because of it. 

Now, in my life, I am almost finishing college with the desire to have a career in politics or government relations, have a strong support system, ran a marathon, and slowly moving on in my life a day at a time.

Putting yourself through school by yourself may be difficult, and there may be enormous sacrifice, but if your parents don't like it, the worst they can do is refuse to foot the bill.

FeetInTheWater,"I went to my sister's wedding with my girlfriend (now my wife of 18 years).  They gave me the keys to the church and asked if I could lock it up. I went in with my girlfriend. We sat in the pews and talked. I walked up to the pulpit and gave a speech about sinners. 

Even though it was day, clouds had gathered outside and it had grown dark in the church. 

She walked up the center aisle and looked so hot in her short skirt.  I walked down the stairs to her and somehow found myself kneeling on the floor, pants unbound and she was lowering herself onto me. Rain and lightening crashed outside. Between the sweat and the wetness between us, it almost felt like it was raining inside. Up until this point we had used condoms or pulled out, but when she felt me begin to pull away she held me tighter and said, ""No, I want you to cum in me"". And I did.

To this day, it was the most purely erotic in my life...

And in case you were wondering, yes, she did get pregnant. If there is a God, I never saw it as a punishment (we have an awesome son); I always saw it as the obvious culmination of that event.  So much love, lust, passion and energy...how could it not result in the ultimate expression of sex.

TheAppleFreak,"[Polyhymnia - Scout McMilan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_lcnNnTsDc)

I'm a fan of epic orchestral music (Two Steps From Hell, X-Ray Dog, E.S. Posthumous, etc), and I'm an even bigger fan of music that manages to blend epic orchestral with more modern, electronic influences (Instrumental Core's later works are extremely good; [Dance At The Moonlight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztsyK6o10QQ) is a particular favorite of mine), and Polyhymnia had a very interesting dynamic at the beginning and end of the piece. The middle of the song, which is almost pure dubstep, doesn't resonate with me as much as when there are actual strings involved; while it gains momentum, it doesn't gain the right type of momentum. 

Another song that I feel fit to mention is [El Dorado](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiB98Wbsdlo) by Two Steps From Hell. Now, don't get me wrong: I love this song. It's just the song seems to have a split identity; it starts out as this extremely atypical violin piece that is unlike anything I've heard from TSFH before, but then fades into the same sort of epic orchestral that they always do. It's not bad by any means, but I really, really would have liked to see something more done with the introduction. Bergeson seems to like the latter part of the track a lot better, for in his production music album ""Burn,"" he completely stripped out the introduction.

JulieCakes,"I took a cruise by myself! Best thing I ever did!! I left port in New Orleans, first destination was Montego Bay, Jamaica; then Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands; and last stop was Cozumel, Mexico.

You meet such an assortment of people and the food is delicious! From gambling, silent auctions, comedy shows, and musicals, there is never a dull moment. Plus, depending on your budget- you can go on some pretty amazing excursions or opt out of the more expensive ones and spend that extra on a different cruise for various destinations.

Around the holidays/school breaks is the best time to go if hoping to meet other singles, but there will still be plenty of families too.


The problem I ran into was I had to pay for two people, despite travelling alone. But perhaps other cruise lines (I was on Carnival) or other ships/destinations would have offered singles rooms.",null,0,cdpfm3n,1ronay,AskReddit,top_day,1

ElderTheElder,"Nail down your copy *before* you have me design the fucking flyer/ banner ad/ poster/ whatever. Believe it or not, deciding that you ""just need to add"" an extra sentence or two to an otherwise finished piece can cause significant layout changes (this is usually more the case with smaller pieces and limited space). In a similar vein, it's fair that it's *my* job is to deal with the visual solutions, but understand that copy and images take up physical space in your piece. I can't tell you how often people will ask me to design like a small 200x200px web banner and for some reason think I should be able to add multiple photos, sentences of copy, dates, addresses, etc. and get mad when I ask them to cull the necessary information to the bare essentials.

Also, nail down your final size before you call me (or at least let me help you with suggestions, and *stick to whatever we decide on together*). I have one client who will routinely ask me to design, say, an 8.5""x11"" flyer and then, *when he's standing in the printer's office* give me an emergency call that he wants to save a few bucks and now I have to ""just squeeze two of them to a page"" or do a completely out-of-ratio resize RIGHT NOW.

She said that two days ago she saw some men come in, and I made their sammich for them, and she said she noticed them giving me a weird look.  Her exact words were, ""They were looking at you wondering why a gay guy was making their sandwhich.""  She then went on to say that if I didn't stop acting so gay she would have to let me go.  

Georgia, at the time (and I think still to this day) has no anti-discrimination laws when it comes to discrimination based on sexual orientation.

swarvy_swang,"Worst?

My friend P and I were in cross country, and before one of our daily practice jogs we decided cocaine would be a great running aid.

Eventually, that devolved into us sniffing coke and not much else. He was on the phone with our doodman and said we were looking for some ""yay."" Apparently to the dealer, yayo was coke, and yay was rock. He didn't bother to verify.

So I'm chopping it up, and it's not flaky, I had yet to get some good fishscale in my life (that yellow-tinged rawraw), but  didn't think much of the debris flying off.

We do our ceremonial bowl of weed with ""yay"" sprinkled on top. I get it and roast that fucker.

Now I'm high. And I'm not coming down. Felt like continuously blasting through a case of nitrous. No ceiling in sight.

I tell him something's not right, and that I'm going to get a glass of water. Next thing I know the tops of trees are all I see. I had fallen and was laying on the ground. Eventually I find myself laying in his bed looking at his pet lizard coming to terms with the fact that I am now dead.

I walked my bike home that day. The comedown  was the worst. Like the mental depletion of benzo and amphetamine withdrawal combined and condensed.

Yeah that sucked. Unfortunately it was my first time accidentally smoking rock, but not the last time I touched the stuff.

OnlyMySofaPullsOut,"When I was in college, I was in a fraternity, and we did a metric fuckton of drugs pretty much all day, every day. One friday night before a party, I saw the joyous sight of a solid 2 zips of coke splayed out on our glass coffee table. So, me being an 8 ball a day user on my worst day at that time, decided to chop out a fat gram+ finger thick line and get all up and fucked before we started drinking.

I could feel my throat water in anticipation. I rolled up a Jackson and had at it.

I remember it being much ""sticker"" and chalkier than coke....and it felt like the antithesis of cocaine. And I could just feel shit sequentially booting down.....my pupils let in a supernova full of light and then started to slowly dim.....

Right then my buddy Kevin walked into the room. I managed to muster, ""What the fuck is this shit man?"" As he looked at me with a mix of shock and horror. 

""That's flip! Fuck!"" That was pretty much the last thing I remember as my windows on the world dissolved to pinholes and faded to black. (Flip being slang for china white heroin cut with 50% crystaline fentanyl. aka 50/50, the same any way you flip it, and it's easy as fuck to flip.)

I woke up kind of in a hyper-sweating mess about 20 minutes later after 4mL of Naloxone was pumped into me, and every epi-pen in the house was emptied into my system. Didn't feel right for about two days after.

The narcan had to be passed around, as several brothers in the room began to pass out from the ambient fentanyl dust in the air. Apparently this was set to be cut up &amp; portioned out in a vacuum in the chem lab after hours. We basically had to wet down what was on the table and vent every window in the room to keep everyone from going limp. 

Greatly truncated my drug consumption after that point. You could call it a much needed moment of clarity. Probably a good idea I have stopped all hard dabbling, since only about 15 guys out of the 60 that were in my fraternity are still alive (I graduated in '04.......)

eyeforgot,"I've had a few bad ones.

Shrooms:  Decided to dose when I found a clear stream.  Got lost in the woods at night while tripping and being chased by gremlins and goblins.

LSD: Took a crap while tripping and throught I had shit my heart out as it was beating in the toilet.  Took 2-3 years debating on whether or not to shove the heart back up my ass but before I did I finally realized that if it was my heart then I would already be dead.  My beating heart then morphed back into a turd and I learned from that to ALWAYS take a dump before dosing.

Ketamine:  Drove about 2 hours while in the k-hole.  I remember having an overhead perspective of driving home, like in a video game.  Don't know how the hell I didn't wreck or die on my way back.  That ended me driving on anything.

LSD x2: Broke my toe and smashed my face up while tripping.  Acid amplifies pain so damn much.

Shrooms x2:  Brother got the shrooms and made the tea.  I took first dose (well first 5 doses as I drank a really potent batch).  About 30 mins later my brother finds a few death caps in the bags and I go into a severe death trip.  Trip that waves come crashing in I get buried in sand and dig myself out (lived near the beach).  I was stuck in a pseudo hell with my brother for umpteen years.  Finally left and went to a friends house as my brother was being an asshole.  Came back to the house the next day and my brother was gone and the stove burners were left on high.  Was surprised the apt didn't catch on fire.  This one was the one that caused me to say fuck drugs and stay sober.

These were all in my early to mid 20's and i'm in my late 30's now and haven't touched anything other than alcohol since.  I still will not drive drunk as I learned my lesson.

The dose was supposedly about 14 milligrams as we understood (turns out this is the upper limit) we decided to blow several lines that size over The span of an hour or two.  Proceeded to stand in a circle screaming at the top of our lungs 3 separate conversations that were literally nothing alike AT ALL and completely incoherent all at the same time/talking over each other.

She told me she had got clean and I went down to visit. We had always done drugs together, that was nothing new, but I had never done any hard drugs like heroin or crack. One day she just looked at me and asked if I wanted to try crack. I said sure. 20 minutes later the dealer was at the door and we all went into my bedroom ( I was staying for a long visit, they gave me an extra room). I tried it and loved it instantly. It was such a different feeling, I can't explain it. The dealer left and I wanted more. The guy I was seeing had left some money in my dresser, I stole it and we bought more crack. Later that night my friends girlfriend came home and she knew. She got pissed at us. Not because we did it, because we did it without her. She got us in the car and told us we were going to the dealers house. We got there and I was scared, but they seemed like this was normal. We start smoking immediately. For the next 9 hours we sat in this guys house and smoked crack. I have never been so high in my life. For those who have done it, you will know what I mean when I say my ears started ringing. I have never had a high that felt that good in my life. Now, it's been 9 hours and I am out of my mind from drugs. I see my friends girlfriend walk away with the dealer, she comes back and looks at me. Then tells me that she told him I would fuck him because he gave us drugs. I was just in shock. I then realized that she knew the entire time that I was going to have to do this. That she brought me over there to fuck the dealer for free drugs. This was an almost 7 foot tall, 350 pound black man. He tells us to come on and we all walk back to the bedroom. My friends start taking their clothes off and that's when I realized this was not the first time they have done this for free drugs. He makes me get naked. My friends are laying on the bed, going at it. I am scared, nervous, and I don't understand. I am too high. He comes out of the bathroom naked and proceeds to use me in every way imaginable. I just remember being on my back and looking behind me. I looked in my friends eyes and they were emotionless. He eventually finishes and throws more crack at us. We get dressed and smoke for another hour. He passes out and I ask if we can finally leave. 

Besides the death of my uncle, this is one of the most traumatizing experiences that I have been through. I have refused to try hard drugs ever again after walking out of that door that night. That was 6 years ago and we have never spoken of it, but I can still smell that house and see that look in my friends eyes.",null,0,cdpk7dq,1roooi,AskReddit,top_day,1

oneymck,"Amsterdam 2013, Two of my friends and I, decided to purchase a few boxes of truffles to enjoy a lovely day in Vondelpark. We ended up buying boxes of different types of truffles, Mexicana, Atlantis, all to split evenly. Anyway, after eating 15g of the truffles washing it down with sprite( which had turned brown due to the backwash of truffles). All three of us sat for the first 20 mins, had been smoking since that morning and had had nothing to eat. After 20 mins of sitting, We all decided to go back into Dam centre ( something I wasn't too keen on, why? because it's busy as shit, and I didn't want to be tripping and avoiding cyclists every 2 seconds). As soon as we started to walk, a pain started occuring in my gums, a stingy sizzling pain that made it feel like the pours in my mouth were bubbling, also feeling as if my mouth was being pulled down from the inside. As well as this, my stomach was sore and I thought that this was going to be one of those ""eat's truffles, vomits, waste of money"" story. After another 25 mins of walking we got on a tram to find a cheap Turkish kebab place, this is when everything went downhill. There were no seats on the tram so I was left standing, I felt uncomfortable on the tram and felt as if I needed to get off, although I couldn't move my body and I felt nauseous. The next thing I see, is a big bright shinning sun and a clear blue sky until one of my friends comes into my POV and starts shaking me, I then realised, I had fainted and was lying face up on the tram floor shaking. I got up off the tram shaking and drinking water having no idea of where we were and also having no idea of the visuals I just saw. I don't think it can get any worse than giving the dutch another excuse to hate those tourists that come over and give drugs a bad name, however fuck me, truffles are shit. I spent the next hour in a restaurant starring at a bowl of spaghetti I had ordered having no idea how I was going to eat it.  ",null,0,cdpknew,1roooi,AskReddit,top_day,2

I snapped back to reality and realized I had just been watching a static menu screen of Weeds the entire time. 

I also remember one time when I was picking up with a couple of friends and I was still tripping from a full pack of Unisom. I was standing waiting for the dealer to arrive and I could see my best friend and the dealer talking to each other. They were talking to each other for what felt like 20 minutes and they got on top of the roof of the car but they were just talking the entire time.

bluepineapples,"To preface, I still smoke weed. However, I stopped for quite a long time because of a few experiences I had that shook me. 

It wasn't anything too exciting, but it was far from ordinary. Normally when I smoke, I relax, open my mind up and have a lot of fun conversations (even if they're a little silly in the end). But one evening, I smoked up with my normal circle of four friends and it wasn't at all the same feeling. The only way I can describe it was...empty. 

I don't know how to describe to you this feeling of emptiness. It’s like not knowing who you are. Instead, you only know what you are supposed to do and you do only that. You might know little things, like your name and birthday, but everything else is gone. You won’t know what is supposed to make you happy or sad. Everything becomes a confusing experience that you won’t know how to react to or if you’re even supposed to react. You won’t know what you want to do or what you like, so in the end you probably won’t do anything at all. 

 It’s like never really waking up in the morning. Instead, that moment when you open your eyes but you don’t yet have a reason to get up stays forever. You haven’t yet accepted your surroundings. You don’t know if you just woke up in the middle of a jungle with a broken leg or if you are in a queen sized bed with unwashed sheets. You don’t know yet. You haven’t thought at all yet. You don’t know what you’re going to do today. You've just opened your eyes.

It’s sort of like watching a movie. Sometimes you are involved in the plot and the characters. You might fall in love with a few of them; empathize with a few of them. You might genuinely laugh and genuinely cry and genuinely smile. And yet, in the end you still realize that you’re just watching a movie and you have no part in what is happening. You’re still just sitting there disconnected and apart from it all, eating popcorn and gazing into the screen like an idiot with nothing better to do. 

It’s like when you have a conversation with someone but the talking has stopped. You realize that things are about to get uncomfortable if you don’t start talking again. You are afraid of the potential silence, but you haven’t reached a point where taking action is a sure idea. Instead, you stare, afraid but unsure; waiting until you can be sure. That is what empty feels like. 

I wouldn't talk to any of my friends, I just watched the world pass me in a very melancholy way. The worst part was that there was just nothing I could really do about it. Even when I sobered up, the lingering feeling of apathy was still there for quite some time. It happened multiple times to the point where I stopped smoking all together because it was just not worth it.

I don't know if that really fits your idea of ""worst"" but there it is. I smoke now, and I do just fine and have great times. The fear that those might come back is there though, somewhere in the back of my head.

raditaz,"The worst experience I had with drugs was when I gave them to someone else.

A few weeks ago I was coming down off of an acid trip, I mentioned it to one of my friends and she asked me if I could pick some up for her. Of course being a good friend I agreed, picked her up two hits (same number I took), and gave them to her while explaining the basics of psychedelics - you should be in a good mindset, if your thinking turns sour then start concentrating on something else, it's just a drug it'll wear off, etc.... I also offered her a place to stay in case her roommate would freak out about her taking acid, since my roommate was gone for the weekend.

So she takes the two hits and we head up to my room (I live in a dorm). At first everything's going normally, I put on some trance music, dim the lights, and she's laying in bed raving about how awesome it is once it kicked in. Pretty standard. Strangely though she started to not answer me when I talked to her, just curled up in a ball, staring at me with wide eyes and this creepy smile. I excused myself for 5 minutes to go vape some bud with a friend (I was still coming down and this pushed me back up a little, I wanted to relate to how she was feeling), and when I got back she was still in the same state. I kept asking her what kind of music she wanted to listen to, if she wanted to go outside, etc, and every once in awhile she'd just say she wants to lay there. Alright, whatever she's feeling. That went on for about the first 3 hours of the trip.

Then things started to turn to shit. She started talking. Very loudly. She was actually yelling at me how hard she was tripping, how I fucked her up forever, how I've damaged her, but she was kind of laughing about it so I wasn't really sure how to take it..... But the whole time I was stressing the fact, please, PLEASE be quiet in here, if people know you're tripping it won't be good. I was shushing her and she would just laugh and keep yelling about how I've got her tripping balls.  

About this time I started to realize how profoundly stupid it was to give someone acid for their first time in a dorm. I had just taken acid for the first time in my friends apartment and I had an amazing time, I took the same amount she did and I was socializing and listening to music and just having a blast. So after this I figured I could give the same amount to her and she'd be fine too. There wasn't any room for scary visuals or anything because all that happened was some warping around and things looked like they were painted with watercolors. My state of mind, while completely different and surprising to me, could still be handled. If someone had asked me to be quiet I would've totally understood what they were saying, so I was really fucking confused as to why she was acting like this.

In the middle of my pleading with her to quiet down, I looked her in the eye and she SHRIEKS this bloodcurdling scream. Honestly I was helpless, I didn't know what to do but to keep stressing how quiet she needs to be right now. This bitch is going to fucking get the cops called. She started yelling louder, YOUVE GOT ME TRIPPING BALLS! YOUVE DAMAGED ME! Etc etc, she actually started accusing me of hurting her and hitting her at the top of her voice, accompanied by occasional screams and whimpers. She actually made it sound like I was trying to rape her, which wasn't really a good way to avoid negative attention. People were starting to peek their heads out their doors, my friend from next door stopped by just to see what the fuck was going on. I was trying to console her but she was flipping the fuck out. I tried a few times taking her out of the room to get outside and away from people, but whenever we got to the elevator she wouldn't get in, like she'd sit down and I couldn't drag her up into the elevator or push her in or anything. I'm freaking out now, I'm stuck with her and if someone called the police or something we'd both be fucked. 

So of course, as we got back to my room, my RA was waiting outside, wanting to know what the hell was going on. I told him that she was just freaking out, but then I glanced at her, hesitated, and I'm like yeah she's on drugs. She took acid. Look, I said, it's going to be over soon, we don't need to call the cops or anything. There's no need for that. He helpfully let me know that the standard procedure was to call the police in situations like these. He gave me a choice of either get her to shut up, or get her out of here. Throughout all of this she's saying unhelpful shit like ""YOUVE GOT ME TRIPPING BALLS"", she's not scared or anything, she's just kind being a loud annoyance and I couldn't see her quieting down anytime in the near future. So I said to my RA, look man, could you bring her back to her room then? You don't need to call the cops, the peak is about over, she just needs somewhere to ride it out for half an hour or so. He agrees, calls the RA on duty, explains what's up, and that dude takes her down to the elevators and that's the last that I saw of her that night.

But the night wasn't over. My friend who checked in earlier bursts into my room about 10 minutes later and says dude look out the window. Of course, out the window, there are half a dozen cop cars and ambulances. What the hell, who called the police. 15 minutes later, there were three of them knocking on my door wanting answers. They let me know that her roommate gave them my name, saying she chilled at my room a lot. Fantastic. 

They clearly knew she took acid, so I gave them the whole story minus me giving it to her, saying I gave her a place to stay, she started flipping out and screaming, and an RA took her away. Two of them were like okay, okay, and the other one was like yeahhhh.... This isn't adding up.... You mind if I take a look at your phone? I gulped, my phone? My phone had her asking me to pick her up some acid, and texts between me and my friend who I got it from. They could probably bust all of us. But if I said no they'd get pissed off and they probably had enough evidence or whatever to seize it from me. I let them see just the texts between me and her, and the cop was like, yeah that's what I thought. You know we could probably bust you for providing drugs to her, but to be honest... I don't really feel like doing that. I let him search around my room a bit but obviously there was nothing to find. They eventually gave me an ultimatum, that either they could turn me over to student services and the school would deal with me, or I could bust my friend who was also a student. I told them yeah, I'm not comfortable with that, and they said well ok then I think we're done here. They left and... I never heard any word from the school.

It was a pretty sobering experience... Never had it been more obvious to me that drugs affect everyone differently. Lesson learned.

TL;DR - got acid for a friend, she flipped the fuck out, cops were called, they said they'd let the school deal with me, got lucky and we didn't get kicked out.",null,0,cdppzjf,1roooi,AskReddit,top_day,1
thelesone,"I'm a light weight. I smoke some stuff, and drank some beer. I remember vividly that at first it kind of did nothing and I wondered what the big deal was with pot and beer?

But the next thing I remembered I woke up next to my girlfriend in our bed, but the thing is when we had been smokin, it was at a friends house. Here's where it gets good. 

I got really drunk and high at the same time and started laughing a lot apparently (this is what I was told) and then I complained that I had to pee, but couldn't really get up so my girlfriend and her friend lead me to the toilet and they had to pull my pants down and sit me on the toilet, I did manage to wipe myself though I guess... After that I guess my girlfriend decided it was time to take me home, not wanting me to do something I would regret or have me out when I was not really aware of what I was doing. 

So it took her and her friend to walk me the whole block home. After we got home, my girlfriend decided I needed a shower. She got me to sit on the toilet and handed me some water and advil but I couldn't drink the water....So she got me undressed and turned around for a minute to turn the shower on, when I ran outside completely naked screaming. She turned around and tried to chase me, but stopped at the door where I stood on her porch completely naked and saying I wanted to go visit her parents who live next door. She coaxed me back inside, though not before some college kid apparently saw me. 

Once I was inside she got in the shower with me and washed me up, including my hair, got me out, dried me off, and carried me up the stairs and tucked me in. She then studied for a test.

lsdpoo,"A couple of days ago I took two doses of 25C-NBOMe (I think around 200-300 micro-grams) with a few friends. I had to take a shit when it was beginning to take effect and ended up peaking while dropping a deuce. It was definitely an amazing experience. Shitting while on a hallucinogen is very difficult, but your bowels will experience true nirvana. The bad part of this trip was the come down. I had tripped on 25i the week before and the come down wasn't really that unpleasant, but on twice dosage of 25c (We did twice the amount that would be equal to the first dosage of 25i. Say 300 micro-grams of 25i= 100 micrograms of 25c. We did 200 micrograms of 25c.) shit got crazy. I became incredibly paranoid about everything and everyone around me. I managed to control myself and not blow a fucking gasket in front of anybody, but when I made it home I started to develop a migraine. Well you could call it a migraine, I'd prefer to call it  something repeatedly shanking my temples and forehead. It lasted until I finally passed out hours later. In that time my thought process changed from snorting a line of Ketamine to kill the pain (didn't have any, so no dice on that), calling one of my friends to try to mooch one of their safety pills of them (it was in the early hours of the morning, they were probably awake, but I didn't really want to mooch a Xanax off my friends as my paranoia also made me terrified to ask anything of anyone), to calling my aunt (who lives like a thousand miles away), to calling my friend down the hall (who probably wasn't there), to calling the police, to calling the fire department (because they help people), to calling an ambulance (which made the most sense at this point), to finally making some soup and not eating it because the microwave was annoying the fuck out of me. Overall it was a very fun time, but the comedown was my worst experience with drugs so far.

The same thing can actually happen to Google in the future, except it might take longer because they are constantly trying to come up with products and services people like (Drive, Google Fiber), as opposed to trying to spruce up your homepage, like Yahoo did. They also get rid of the things people hate.",null,0,cdpbzwy,1roov8,AskReddit,top_day,4
OnThePlusSide,"First, get rid of the tabloid shit on their frontpage.  Yahoo has so much garbage and what attracted people initially to Google (when it first became the #1 engine) was its simplicity.  If you look at a timeline of their front pages, you'll see that Google will try something, and then go back on it, over and over, while yahoo just keeps adding shit to clutter the screen.

Next, behind the scenes, Google simply makes a better search engine.  You are more likely to find what you need by googling it that by using Yahoo or Bing or Ask Fucking Jeeves.  They have better search algorithms and they're fast as shit.

Google right now is making some bad decisions in other areas, like with the G+ integration and all that, and Yahoo can capitalize on Google's missteps.  Like how when the XBox 1 made the colossal mistakes with its new ""always on"" features and other BS, Sony came out and simply said ""hey, here's an alternative that isn't stupid as beans.""  Yahoo needs to remind people that there are other search engines.  Hell, Bing is now known for being a great porn search engine, because Google screwed the pooch on that count.

Google had great marketing and great simplicity and great algorithms for a long while, and it'll be tough to outdo them when they're the best in town.  On the plus side, Google has recently made some serious missteps that rivals can monopolize on, and they need to take advantage of those missteps quickly before the chance vanishes.  Like how right now people are freaking over Youtube and saying ""well, we have to stick with them even though we don't like it because there are no competitors.""  But that's because you haven't seen an ad for dailymotion, which could become the next Youtube with a little elbow grease and marketing.

Facebook caught on and overpowered myspace because it was seen as a simplified, cleaner version, had great marketing, and Myspace started fucking itself.  The cards are in place for a search engine competitor to exploit Google's fuckups and take the reins.  They just have to see them and seize them.",null,0,cdpc2wr,1roov8,AskReddit,top_day,3

BendoverOR,"Think of it this way: 

Starship Troopers, the book, is a deep alleghory about propaganda, patriotism, the cruelty and inanity of war, and a lampooning of Federalism. It asked stark questions about the nature of warfare, morality, humanity, and compassion. It showed the horrors of totalitarism and Big Brother, how easily a people could allow themselves to be brainwashed, and the ungodly injustice that would follow if it happened. Most people who read it don't catch that its satire.

Starship Troopers, the movie, was about tits, guns, bugs, and Casper Van Dien getting laid at every *possible* opportunity. Bear in mind that the director never finished reading the book (he got bored and depressed after two chapters), and most of the writing team *didn't even know the book existed*. All of the deep thinking is shoved in your face and played for laughs.

houtex727,"Books make more use of imagination than a movie or video game.

Video games and movies present the whole thing to you on a silver platter.  Or a screen, anyway.  There's no figuring out in your head how this scene is supposed to look like.

Also, books can present better subtle subthemes than a movie.  You can really be using your brain when reading a good book, in some cases, 'watching' all the sub-plots in the book.  Some are just tangents to nowhere, and some are really important.  You can't always get these in a movie.

Video games, for the most part, don't really tell a story, they're just there to play and entertain.  Sure, a game such as the Halo series or the Mass Effect series can tell a tale, and the play can help you advance in that tale, but it still isn't the same as reading the story on paper/tablet/screen.

Now, as far as the 'get smarter' thing, that can be done, but more with non-fictional(ized) books such as science, history, or biographies.  However, certain books that are fiction are *important* to read because of the social commentaries, both modern and historical, that they show in their story.  

Books like Animal Farm, 1984, Lord of the Flies, Farenheit 451, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.... They teach of social problems, while still telling a fictional story.

Could you watch a movie?  Sure.  But reading the book is better by so many ways.  It is a *very* rare occasion that the book sucks and the movie(s) is/are better.",null,0,cdpc5xm,1rop9p,AskReddit,top_day,3

In high school I was always above average I never got special attention but my grades were always on the upper end and I always wanted the attention that the other ""smarter"" kids got. So I decided that I would become an under dog and become the greatest rocket scientist in the world. My plans started to die early. 

The death of my plans began when I was accepted into the school of my choice but not my program. Of course I scoffed at this warning determined I was meant to be an underdog. By the end of the first month I made new friends who had similar majors as me. We ended up taking classes together and they made me think that if you have to study for a test you were declared ""dumb"". My ego reared its ugly head and I became determined not to be called dumb so I stopped studying for tests. By the end of the first semester I was doing very poorly in classes while my friends were flying in A's. At that point I decided that I was to dumb to be what I wanted and gave up. The pain that I went through because of that was horrible and I almost had an emotional break. 

I finished up my year at the school and transferred out to become a teacher. The worst of the emotional pain didn't settle in until the summer when I realized that I let my dream slip away because of my ego.

Little did I know. Two weeks later I visit the doctor for stitches removal. He says it's still unhealed. I had to come back a week later. A week later there is this nurse who says she will remove the stitches. She says ""Oh my God, you are quite late, the stitches are overgrown, don't worry, you may feel a little sting."" Than she started taking out the stitches (there were 4 or 5 of them). MOTHER. FUCKING. ALMIGHTY. CTHULHU.

It was the only time in my life I shouted FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK in front of a person I don't know. I'm a polite person.

They were ""hot"" not ""cute"" (yes there is a difference haha) but more importantly we had like nothing in common and I didn't see it going anywhere.

So I am still a virgin. I am not religious so I don't care about waiting until marriage, but I do care about waiting for the right girl. I want to feel something special. I want to be in love with this person. Even if I don't marry the girl and we have a falling out where we never even talk to one another again then that's fine. As long as it meant something at the time.

Basically, I want it to be with someone I care about and have loving feelings towards. They don't have to be the person I end up with, but I want them to potentially be that person.

He told me that sometimes, people just don't get along and sometimes it's for the better. It wasn't my fault. I didn't understand him then, but I definitely understand 13 years later.

Remind your friend that his parents love him and his siblings, even if they don't love each other. They are still his parents, getting a divorce did not change that. It just changed when he will spend time with them. You learn to love your parents more when you only get to see them certain days of the week.

Spend a lot of time with him to distract him. Play video games, go to the movies, do whatever. Don't talk about it unless he brings it up. Even then, let him lead the conversation.

FlyingGrype,"I think I was seventeen when my parents divorced, and I was glad it happened. I knew they had been miserable together for some time, I had the sense that my mother was trying harder than my father was to make it work but they weren't in love anymore, and I hoped they would split up because they'd be happier and as a result we kids would be happier. And we were. Not instantly, of course, there was some trauma, I remember crying when I found out, but more from relief. 

You don't say how old you are or how old your friend is, and that will count for something. My parents' divorce was probably easier on me than it was on my younger siblings (who were 14 and 11 at the time) because I was closer to being independent than they were, and farther away from any of the family friends and neighbours who would have been judgemental or awkward towards us. 

A divorce isn't like a death, where there's no way to make things ""normal"" again. If both his parents love him and will continue to see him and take care of him, then probably the best thing you can do is to just keep treating him like normal. Some things in his life will be in upheaval if he's young enough (e.g. whether he'll be living in both parents' houses) but the things that are still normal and don't have to change can be his refuge from the stress.

kidvjh,"I am sorry for your loss. My father passed away a few years ago. Our family does not have a lot of money, so I can't answer about 401k and retirement plans, but I will tell you what I can.

You will need several copies of the death certificate which the funeral home can easily provide you. Upon his passing, all possessions and accounts fall into an estate from which outstanding debts are to be paid by whoever was made executor of his estate, as should be stated in the will. If you have a copy of the will, you can proceed from there, if not, a trip to the county courthouse will be in order as this is where the will would have been registered (at least that is how it is in Texas). It's up to the executor to settle any bills in the deceased's name using the moneys left by your father. If there is a family home in which you, your mother, or any other survivors currently live, the house does not pass into estate, meaning it shouldn't be used to settle other debts and nobody should be able to force them out, provided any taxes and morgages are up to date.

The executor of the estate is responsible for contacting anyone your father had financial ties with, including placing a public notice of death in the newspaper to inform any potentially unknown peoples with a claim to the estate. Since you are listed as an authorized person on his accounts, the procedure is much simpler if you are/work with, the executor of the estate. The death certificates must be presented as evidence of passing and will automatically trigger that company's protocol for this event (yes all companies have one). They will inform you what needs to be done, who to pay or receive payment from, how to close any accounts, etc.  Any remaining estate is destributed amound the family/friends in accordence to the will. Any person can contest the will and can even take matters to court, but if the will was not made under duress and was made by a competent lawyer, the will most likely will stand.

As far as taxes, after the death tax, assuming the estate us large enough to require one, any money is the property of whoever it is bequeathed to and would be taxed as any money would be, ie. depending on how you use it. If you live in a state with right of survivor laws, then money and property automatically pass to any joint owner (your mom, if both names were one the deed, bank accounts and the like) without first passing through estate, meaning it is not subject to taxes. It is most certainly a good idea to get in contact with a CPA for specific tax information is it varies by state/county and by year. My information is from Texas about 5 years ago.

Again, I am sorry for your loss, I hope this helps make an always terrible situation a bit more navigable.",null,0,cdpdc8e,1rorjx,AskReddit,top_day,2

A few months ago.  Had a vivid dream of a young girl, reminiscent of the girl in the FEAR games, leaning in close to my ear and whispering ""Wake up"".

YargainBargain,"Ok this is a long one, and the setting isn't necessarily realistic but the dream always happens in a very real and gritty way.

So the dream starts where I'm in a grocery store, usually with my mom, and we're looking for some food for the week.  Last time it was Whole Foods.  As we're going down the isles of the store, there's a commotion about some people going crazy and people dying.  Panic breaks out and I'm separated from my mom only to be met with basically the equivalent of zombies.  Slow moving, half eaten or decayed humans who are extremely aggressive.  I end up making my way out of the store and down some ways until I meet up with various people, usually a group of around five or so people.  We make it out to the city and through a tunnel nearby that leads out to a beachfront.  

The five of us are armed with whatever we could find when we started getting attacked.  No fancy weapons or anything like that.  one guy has a golf club, one of the women has a lead pipe.  We're walking along the beachfront past some old abandoned factories.  The windows are cracked while some are missing or glazed over, but there's the feeling of being watched.  Looking up at the windows there are dozens of the dead staring out at us and watching us make our way past the factory.  They don't do anything, just stand there staring at us with dead and rotting flesh.  

As we move past the factory, someone inevitably screams because there are dozens of the dead running and stumbling towards us.  We're greatly outnumbered, but try and hold our own against these ex people.  Some woman gets attacked and feasted on while I'm running past her and there's nothing I can do.  I start to head towards the water thinking that at least one side will be free, but there are bodies dragging themselves out of the sea trying to attack me.  After a while it gets easier to lure them and kill them by grouping them so they're all trailing behind you instead of coming from all sides.  

Instead of finishing the job or getting overtaken, I always wake up at this point.  Maybe it's because I know I won't survive that, who knows.   I've had this dream several times over the past decade.",null,1,cdpdcau,1rorw9,AskReddit,top_day,1

She lived a few hours away thought and rarely saw each other, so yeah... Well, she got bored of me and I ""healed"" by spending a lot of time talking to some trans guy who was physically a chick and I ended up being attached to her as a way to not be attached to the ex. Well, after like a year, that abruptly stopped and I started fooling around with a local chick for 5 months. It ended just as it was gonna get seriously serious, and then I was fucking burnt out and depressed. I started smoking weed and hanging out with my friends who I hadn't seen after school much in months all the time. I began to see a happier, less tightass stressfest way of life than I had ever known. I'm single and can't bring myself to really give that much of a shit anymore.

I didn't know how to be alone and the thought scared me. The relationship just dragged on for much too long, but I eventually found the strength to let go.

When I was in my Sophmore year of high school, I was called down to the guidance office towards the end of my 8th period Italian class. This isn't uncommon. Often students are called down to talk about how school is going, courses for the next semester and so on so I didn't think much of it. When I got there, I was told by my dad that my Mom had passed away that morning. Now each and every time I am called down to the guidance office which happens no less than 5 times per school year. I get this intense feeling of dread that I have lost someone else I care about. I somehow convince myself that this is the only reason I would be called down.

It doesn't even turn me on almost at all 99 times out of a hundred to see a girl without seeing her face no matter what shes doing.  I think this has to do with spending alot of time reading people and looking at people in a light that has to do with drawing them and seeing them in a way that tells a story or makes them come alive in a way that's beautiful outside of skin deep superficial type beauty.  Like the way regal old person with a long history and deep spiritual connection is beautiful.  I like to read people and honestly it gives me a great deal more pleasure to see a person with a beautiful soul than a person who is outwardly gorgeous, though i often appreciate both.  For this reason I constantly find myself attracted to girls that no-one else seems to find as stunning as I do.  I just wish to spend hours staring into their eyes and interacting with their soul, not even in a way likei would as when i am deeply in love with someone, just like they are pure beauty and i want to witness it.

My schedule is more flexible and I like to go on trips by myself because prior to being married I traveled alone often. We spend a couple or few months a year apart divided into various chunks and for us it seems to keep some excitement between us. We appreciate our time together more now.  We also like to maintain our individuality within our relationship.  We don't want to lose our individual fulfilment or identities just because we agree committed to one another.

But I also know couples that see each other very little, and are really happy. They trust each other, and are happy when they are together, and equally happy when they are not together.

It's more of a question of trust, and also how, well for a lack of a better work 'needy' the people in the relationship are.

makes_her_scream,"I am and will always be anti-drugs. But weed is an exception. 

I was a cigarette-smoker (quit now) but always stayed away from pot because drugs. In college some friends told me that this stuff wasn't addictive, in fact less addictive than nicotine, and that's how I first smoked it. I found the experience extremely relaxing. Waking up the next day without a hangover but in fact with what appeared to be a deep feeling of peace was a wonderful feeling. 

Weed also helps me tap into some inner well of serious creativity and some of my doped-up jams with my musician friends have been memorable.

Lately I don't smoke up anymore. Reasons are: it makes me hungry as hell and I eat too much so it interferes with my fitness goals; and also I have a tendency to mix booze and weed which ruins the high and makes me feel like shit.

bradbrokill17,"It has a long standing relationship with the human consciousness.  We have a system set up in us called the endo-cannabinoid system that regulates a great deal in our bodies and there are a great many other reasons why it seems to me that there is a deep physyological/biochemical connection between the cannabis plant and humanity, as well as many other forms of highly active biological forms.  
Another reason is we have 4 basic needs. 3 are the food shelter clothing you are familiar with but the fourth is a little more difficult to discuss as it is not often brought up or intellegized, but this is our need for things like meaning, joy, understanding of ourselves and our environment, satisfaction of curiosities, and deep seated itches in our psyche that are begging to be scratched by knowledge, experience, joy, art, and science etc.  the cannabis plant is one example of a part of our experience that helps us come to terms with this part of ourselves and learn to live in a society that is inhospitable to notions of that nature and that doesn't support us, and often condemns us, in our quest to understand and fulfill this part of our psychology.  Terrence McKenna said ""you need to bear in mind that a culture takes its tone, its clothing, from the drugs that it admits and you can know a great deal about a culture from the drugs it excludes, the drugs that it excoriates and fears because various drugs excentuate and supress different parts of the psyche. So these are statements about anxiety about various parts of the psyche.""  In my opinion it seems that western society has a fear of the creative and intuitive mind and one way we relate to this part of our mind is through consciousness expanding compounds such as cannabinoids, as well as psilocybin, mescaline, dimethyltryptamine and other plant based boundary dissolving consciounsess expanders that involve us in a creative dance that life is made up of on a deep level. They bare our minds to the psychic winds in such a way as to open us up to the notion that everything we beleive; everything we've been tought and learned and assumed and understood about our world is both wrong and unnecessary or misguided even.  The psychadelic experience dissolves your preconcieved notions about the world so that new, truthful concepts and understanding will have a place to take root.

elves_cant_dance,"A little backstory, I guess. My parents never really got along. My mother had a very volatile temper. She had random bursts of anger that manifested itself as violence, and I could never predict what triggered this. It could be something innocuous, like someone picking up her socks(she had a habit of just tossing them to the corner of the room, lol) and putting it in the laundry without telling her, to something that was justifiable. There's a period of my life where I can't remember a single day when she didn't physically attack me, so needless to say, I was terrified of her. 

When I was about 8, I was alone in the car with her and she said something along the lines of, ""If I get a divorce, you'd choose me, right? Right?!"" As she said so, she swerved the car and almost crashed into a tree. Of course I said I'd choose her to appease her, but as a naive 8-year-old, lying came really hard to me. This was the first lie I remember telling.

For a few years afterwards, she'd make sure to ask that question in front of my dad with the same threatening tone. I never really knew what to say. On one hand, I was terrified. On the other, that look on my dad's face just hurts. :\

Mythnam,"Kind of a lot of background leading up to the worst part, but whatever.

My parents are divorced, and my sister and I alternate which holidays we spend with which side of the family. Well a few years ago, having spent Christmas with my mom's family, we were with my dad's family for New Year's—at my uncle's house in a different state.

So it was me, my sister, my dad, my aunt and uncle, my grandparents, and one of my two cousins. For about 5 days. Now, I have two cousins: one my age and one a year younger than my sister. My sister and the younger cousin love spending time together when we visit, but the older cousin and I have drifted pretty far apart over the years. And he wasn't there anyway—he'd moved into an apartment with his girlfriend.

So I pretty much had a bunch of old people I don't particularly like hanging out with (and one I really hate hanging out with, but that's a different story), and nothing to do. I ended up sitting in bed on my laptop all day until dinner every day for that entire trip. It was pretty much either that or watch football and the news with the adults, because my sister and younger cousin sure didn't want to hang out with me all day.

**So anyway**, all of this meant that I was in a pretty foul mood the entire time. And my sister and cousin had been frequently borrowing my laptop to use the camera to take selfies. And it was getting on my nerves. So I ended up snatching the computer away, deleting all of those pictures, and hitting my sister when she tried to get it back. If I remember correctly, I made it less than an hour into the new year before punching my little sister. Pretty pathetic.

So yeah, that was a shitty holiday experience.",null,0,cdpe0lz,1routd,AskReddit,top_day,1

Basically, it tries to wake you during a time when you'll feel the least groggy. When you sleep your brain goes through different sleep cycles, each lasting 90 minutes. There are cycles that allow for deep sleep and shallower sleep. When you wake from deep sleep you'll feel shitty for the first few minutes of your morning, but if you wake from REM sleep (shallower cycle) you'll awake feeling better. There's a description on the website too. Good luck :]",null,0,cdpeh2u,1rovhs,AskReddit,top_day,2

The_Nation_Of_Israel,"When my friends and I are getting bad vibes for the day and feel like it's gonna be a bad day, we call it getting the itis.  Whenever I get the itis or actually have a bad day, I like to lock myself in my living room with my laptop and game systems.  I'll start out with a little Metal Gear Solid 4 and watch the opening for the thousandth time because it just makes me smile that someone could put that much work into a game.  Then, I'll play a little DayZ because it completely takes your mind off everything else (you'll die otherwise!).  By this time, I'm usually getting kind of bored.  Now this is where my paths get a little varied.  If my parents aren't home, I'll smoke a little pot and listen to some Frank Sinatra and other famous jazz artists because there's just something about the swing of jazz that makes me feel something.  Now if they are home, I'll watch Take Me Home Tonight because for some reason that movie makes me feel something too.  

Really, what I've found to make me feel better is just doing things that bring out my emotions.  Whenever I feel something, I always thing back to that episode of South Park where Butters says that though feeling bad sucks, the fact that you can feel anything means that you at least have the potential to feel really happy.

Cheima15,"Ugh fine.! Lol

It was two years ago. It's very clear in my mind. I was at a local restaurant with a couple of girls and one of my friends. We were eating when a guy, the 70 year old man, came up to us and sat down. I still don't know his name to this day although I see him regularly around town. We both vowed to never talk after that day at the restaurant. When he sat down, he asked us if we would be interested in making a lot of money very quickly but there would be a risk. I agreed along with the girls. My friend, however, did not want to because he didn't trust the guy. I felt that he was shady but I took it that he had experience from his age. He asked my friend to go to the bathroom so that we could talk. He agreed. The man gave us an overview of what we were going to do and we were still in. We arranged for a meeting at a more private place that Friday after school to go into detail. Friday came and I told my mom that I was going to study with the girls and I didn't know when if get home. We get to the spot and he is already there. This is when it gets real intense because it turned out this was his so called HQ. He had copious amounts of guns and other weapons of sorts. We sit down and he hands us all packets. I felt like I was being briefed by the CIA for a covert operation. It turned out that that's exactly what was happening except it was for the Cartels in Mexico. He began to explain what would happen and what we needed to do. He would being playing our grandfather. We would go out on a ""spear fishing trip"" along the California coast. The cartels were trafficking drugs in watermelons. It was a genius idea. They would front it as a small cargo ship with crates of fruit and one of the crates would be the watermelons. I would dive down, being the only certified diver with any amount of experience. We used a large parachute type thing to raise them. I used the secondary regulator to fill it up so the air would carry it to the surface. They would then pick it up and I would surface once they got it on the boat and we would leave immediately. Once we got to the port, we would load up some modified cars with the drug filled watermelons. At this point I was really considering backing out and asked him if we could if it sounded too sketchy. He said no and that if we did we would be killed because we knew too much already. I got really scared and started freaking out but one of the girls calmed me down. We resumed the briefing shortly after I got some fresh air and drank a glass of water. He assured me that if I were to finish this with them that the cartels would not track me down and kill me anyways. He then began to tell us how we would have to drive these very expensive, fast cars to a drop off point in the desert. I felt that I could do it since I had driven a couple time before and the desert wasn't that far from the port he said. At that point we would smash the watermelons and leave one car behind and all ride in the one that would have a small back seat in which the drugs would be hidden. I thought it would be all good from there because we would only have the drugs while in the desert and about a mile from where we extracted them from the watermelons. There would be a large pile of boulders at the edge of a cliff where we would hide the drugs. After that it was home free or so we thought. He finally told us when this whole thing would go down. A month from then.
I counted down the days and it finally got there. It was all good until we got to the port. It was a small one and not what I expected at all. It was an old run down thing but security was surprisingly tight. They knew what was going on but I had a bad feeling about the coming hours. We unloaded the watermelons and got them onto a forklift. The driver brought them into a shed where we followed him. There were two very nice exotic sports cars. I became very afraid that they would kill me if I even put a scratch on it so I asked the old man what would happen if I hit something or someone. He said he had connections and it would be fine because they would destroy the car after it was all finished. I became a little less scared and a little excited too. Once the watermelons were loaded up, we took off to never look back. The hotter of the two girls came with me which made me quite happy and a little arrogant. We got on the freeway and were headed towards the site when the old man floored it. I didn't want to lose him so I followed. We got up to around 120 mph and I was filled with adrenaline. Then, my bad feeling from before came again and it wasn't a second later and the red and blue lights were flashing in my rearview. I had played a lot of video games like this and now it was reality. I knew I could escape, our speed rose higher and higher. 140, 160, soon we were doing 190 and the cops could hardly keep up. It was only a few special highway patrol cars that were only for this sort of situation could keep up. About 30 miles from the port there was a roadblock. I saw the man in front of me go towards the shoulder. It was our only chance. We approached faster and faster. He made it through with ease but one of the cops tried to stop me. I didn't slow down. I was about 50 feet away and he dove. I clipped his leg and his boot flew off. I assume his leg was shattered. I saw it on the news a couple days later and it only said that he was severely injured. Just a little down the road there was an off ramp that we took. This is what helped us get away. That and the fact that we were in the open desert from then on. From there we came to spot where there was a cave in the side of a mountain. We went into it and got the drugs and moved them into his car. We then left the car with some sort of remote explosive that he said would obliterate any evidence. We went to the drop off site from there and put the drugs in the pile of rocks. We then drove back past the car that I was driving but somehow the cops found it. There were only a couple of police cars there and I assume they had called for back up already. As we flew past, the man pulled out something that looked like a garage door opener. He clicked it three times and five seconds later, an enormous fireball came out of the cave. He proceeded to a remote shed where he fitted the car with another explosive. There was also another car in there but this one was a little more low profile. It was an older Cadillac. We got in and began to drive. When we were a bit away he blew the whole shed up. He drove us back to my friends house where we told our parents we would be studying after school and probably stay there that night. We got back at about 3 am. My friend was really cool about it and before the man left he said to come to his place on the next Thursday unless he contacted us. Before I could ask how he would contact us he sped off. 
The next Thursday we went to his house in the morning because we were off for some reason that I don't remember. When we showed up we knocked on the door. No answer. We continued knocking. Still no answer. We walked around back to find a trash bag with a note explaining how much money is in the bag and how much we had helped him. The trash bag was packed full of 100 dollar bills. I don't remember the exact amount but it was upwards of 1 million. We split it up and went our separate ways. I brought mine home and I had to tell my parents and they were really mad and I told them the whole story and how it was pretty unlikely that i would get caught. They grew to like it and accept it. I will be using it for college. I want to become a doctor so I probably won't have much left. I still am a little scared but I live with it and I don't regret doing it at all.
Well this took about 1 hour to write and 45% of my battery so thanks for reading and I guess now is the time to tell you that this is completely fake besides the fact that I am 16 and have scuba dove.

Find out later that the girl had only been using me as a way to make her ex jealous. When he finally lost interest and told her to go fuck herself, she made up a story that I had tried to rape her and she was deathly afraid of me....This psychopath's utter disregard for my feelings and well being while she used me as a pawn in her twisted little games ultimately taught me a valuable (unfortunate?) lesson about the ugly nature of certain individuals.

3dogs3catsandahedgeh,"I was dating a wonderful, sweet guy and things were getting serious. His parents seemed to be happy around me, and were always smiling and courteous to me. One night we were coming home from a couple's night out, just hanging out with friends at their house. We were driving on some back roads and came to a blinking traffic light. A pickup truck came out of nowhere, ran the light, and broadsided us. The driver rolled his truck and was crushed by it. We rolled our car and the roof on the passenger side collapsed. I was driving, and broke my jaw and tore two abdominal arteries and my intestine, shattered my tib-fib, and broke my finger and thumb. My boyfriend wasn't so lucky. The right side of his head was crushed, and he was comatose for two weeks. We were both in the same hospital, so I went to visit him at his room when he was waking up. His parents acted very strange when I went to see him. I got put into a rehab center to get back to walking, and he got put into a head injury center. That's where the cruelty came in. His parents would not let me see him or talk with him. Month after month went by; I would talk with his brother to find out how he was, but could never see him or speak with him. 

His mother asked me to testify for him for the lawsuit they were bringing against the bar. The guy who hit us was drunk, and he had 3 previous drunk driving tickets. So they were suing the bar, and they wanted me to testify about the accident; but I couldn't remember what happened, since I had had a concussion. He couldn't remember either, because his short term memory was gone. And he couldn't remember me either. He had lost all of the past year, and I was in that year, so he had no memory of me. Perhaps if I had been able to see him after he woke up, or been able to speak to him, it might have stirred something, but I'll never know. Eventually they let me see him, but we were just friends. He was apologetic about it, but he just couldn't feel what he used to, and that was that. 

A psychologist told me that they needed someone to blame for the accident, and since I was driving, they blamed me. I was the only one they could blame, since the other driver, the drunk one, was dead. So, I never saw him much after that, and I just had to get over it all on my own.

My best friend at the time said it was probably nothing and that I should stop being a pussy, so he slapped my broken finger really hard. It was the worst pain I had ever felt in my life, well, until I was brought to the hospital where the doctor put the bone back to its place by putting a pen between my ring finger and the little finger and pressing the broken finger to the pen, without applying anesthesia.

The bully - I never learned his name - walked up to us and acted like he was interested in what we were doing. I guess he really was, because he sure had a laugh over pulling out the link cable from my Gameboy Color mid-trade.

At first, I thought nothing of it. Both our games hung, and my friend reset his Gameboy and loaded his save just fine. I reset mine, watched the Nintendo and Game Freak logos go by, and went to load my save game... but it wasn't there.

jsmooth7,"Here's the story of the most senselessly cruel thing that's happened to me.

This story takes place in Grade 10 in gym class. We were doing a fit run that day. We were put into relays of 5 and we would run to the other side of the gym and back and then the next person would go, until 30 minutes was up. Pretty standard, nothing too exciting. One of the guys on my team I didn't know very well. Lets call him Jack, just for fun.

With about 2 minutes or so left to go, I stopped paying attention to the order and accidentally leave one person early. Jack was supposed to go, so he yells out something to me. At the other side of the gym I stop, and he catches up. I tell him sorry about that, and then we both run back to the other side. Now I was running back at full speed with Jack slightly behind me. Normally I would only start to slow down about a meter before the wall, and use the wall to stop me the rest of the way. Well as I was approaching the wall, Jack decided to push me from behind as hard as he could. I put my arms out just before I slammed into the wall. Instantly I feel excruciating pain in my wrists.

Shock took over and I realized I couldn't stay standing up, so I just laid down on the ground. People looked at me strangely but that wasn't really something I was concerned about. The fit run ends, everyone goes to get changed, leaving me still lying on the *fucking floor* in pain. Finally the shock wore off, so I get up, walk over to the PE teachers, and they finally realize they should do something.

At the hospital I found out both my wrists were broken. The next day when I went to school I found a lot of support and sympathy from my friends, and other people too. That, combined with the Tylenol 3 I was taking made me feel a lot better. However Jack had no remorse what so ever. The school administration basically forced him to apologize, so he gave me a lovely card that said:

&gt;I'm sorry your wrists got broken. Get well soon!

Thanks for the ""apology"".

A few days later Jack got expelled. I still have no idea what motivated him to push me like he did.

**TL;DR** Dude breaks my wrists because he really doesn't like relays going out of order.",null,0,cdpfzv2,1rowu8,AskReddit,top_day,1
homerBM,"I was dating a guy for 4-5 months who just disappeared.  Was usually with him several days per week at that point, we'd had a nice day out and never heard from him again.  You go through many emotions when this happens, worry / concern, anger, feeling down, inadequate, questioning yourself and so on.  I was able to check he was alive and well as I could see when he signed on to a website we both used. After ten days of silence from him, I stopped trying, but became near obsessive about seeking out info on him online and reading back through texts and online conversations, not something I usually do but I was just trying to piece together anything I could!

I think it's cruel because had he just said he wasn't interested any more, it would have hurt, but I'd have been able to move on.  Instead I spent a good couple months overly focused on trying to work out what happened and feeling awful and confused.  The rational head takes over eventually and you see that this was not about you but their own issues and cowardice, but it takes a bit of time to get there.

mrchososo,"From family experience of a coma post accident, not medically induced, my understanding that the idea of a coma as most of us think of it is wrong.  It is not like it is binary i.e. you are in a coma or not.  Rather there is a continuum that people are on and that can vary whilst they are in the coma ie get deeper or shallower.

This is best reflected by the [Glasgow Coma Scale](https://www.headway.org.uk/glasgow-coma-scale.aspx).

The other thing to consider about a patient gaining consciousness - and mentioned in some comments here - is the amount of drugs in the patient, their other injuries which may make them incapacitated and simply being in ITU.  ITU is a scary place if you're waking up confused, in pain and can't move.  There are a lot of machines making odd noises, you've almost certainly got wires and tubes going into and coming out of you.  And for a while your field of vision will be limited to what is immediately above your head, or perhaps a bit more of the ceiling if you can move your neck.  Your nurses may well be wearing masks and almost certainly everyone is wearing scrubs and aprons.  I heard a story that one patient had a phobia of bananas after a time in ICU.  Turned out it was because all they could see were the yellow aprons and they weren't able to process what they were - their brain decided that it was walking bananas.  Sounds amusing, but indicative of real mental strain of ICU.

My family member had very slim chances of survival (let alone coming out of the coma) but thank goodness they did.  I'm convinced that constant family presence, talking to him and simply holding his hand helped. I wish you all the best.",null,3,cdpjzgp,1rowy0,AskReddit,top_day,13

It may have been from all the meds I was on, but it surprised me.  One funny story from when I first woke up, a neurologist was asking me questions like number of days in a week, easy stuff like that.  He asked me how many nickels are in a dollar fifty, I answered 30.  He said no, and told me another number that he said was right, I don’t remember what he said exactly.  My mom was in the room and said that 30 was the correct answer and he argued that no, his number was right.

They have to remove the top of his head and cool his brain with ice. Very grim but he did make it, not without severe injuries and many sugeries in the next months. Surprisingly he got no brain damage.


My relative was pretty much drunk, slip twice and hit his head. Doesnt help that he's a senior (60+) with a story of alcoholism. Got into a hospital with a concussion, things get complicated and they have to get into the comma to wait for his brain to go back to normal, as it was swollen.

They don't really ask me for personal favors and if I want to avoid them I just ignore my phone and fb (this is rare but even though I don't see them in person I still need some alone/offline time or if I'm mad at them. 

One of my online friends lives about 30 minutes away from me but we have only met briefly a few times and do not hang out in person. For awhile he really didn't take me seriously - when I called him my friend and things like that. But now we've spent countless hours online and I feel we know each other a lot better and we fight less. I thought he didn't want to hang out with me because he didn't like me but really it is an anxiety kind of thing. Again it's convenience - we make plans before getting online and I can work around them. For example I'm out of town this week and he was home but we still got to play together.

Rks1157,"There is a simple axiom that can take you far in life when you understand and apply it.  *You are what you do.*  What it means is that you are seen by your actions.  In life, your hopes, dreams and intentions are invisible to others. What's not are your actions.

If you want be more outgoing and social you can begin by acting more outgoing and social.  If you do not know how to be outgoing observe what others do and imitate their actions as best you can.  It's best that you choose to imitate someone admired for their ability rather than a loudmouth of boor.  The world already has enough of those.  The next time you go to a social event make it a point to shake everyone's hand and take the time to learn something about them.  There won't be a test and you won't be graded and no one will think you're wierd.  Part two of the axiom mentioned above is *bring the body and the mind will follow.*   If you act as if you will be as if.  This doesn't mean that you become insincere and act like someone you're not.  Don't pretend to be a big shot you are interesting enough as you are.

The same holds true for your other wish, to do things more timely but it takes a little more work.  Invest in learning a system that works for others.  Learn to prioritize your time.  David Allen developed a system named Getting Things Done.  The system is awesome but his book is a real snoozer.  Fortunately others have distiller the important parts of the system into smaller, more enjoyable parts that you can find online by searching.  His system took me from being a procrastinator to a highly efficient machine in practically no time at all and the best part of it was that I liked implementing it.

nothingelseworked,"A habit takes somewhere around thirty days to form, and once to break. So pick something tangible and small, and do it every goddamn day for a month. No excuses.

Want to use your time more wisely? Set aside thirty minutes of  every day for getting shit done. Get off work, walk in the door, and pretend you're still on the clock. Set a timer, and whatever most needs doing, just knock it out. Stop when time is up; you don't want to get everything done, or wear yourself out, just form a habit. The rest will wait for tomorrow. Repeat every. Goddamn. Day. No excuses. You don't go to bed until you've done your half hour.

Want to be more social? Use that half hour to talk to people sometimes. Go to a bar, set yourself a goal - I will sit at the bar, and ask the bartender three questions, or speak, even if briefly, with two other patrons. I will introduce myself to the people on either side of me at the bar and ask if they come here often. I will speak with the person next to me on public transit (if they don't seem like a creep).

-leviathan,"I did in high school during senior year. It was some sort of senior only speaker event in the auditorium.

Homeboy came onstage and went into his act with an audience of teenagers paying close attention. He told us to close our eyes, then led us through a series of exercises to see who was ""compatible"". He talked for a bit to warm us up, then got into it. A few jokes, some charismatic comments and smiles for miles.

""Imagine a hot air balloon is tied to a string that is tied to your wrist"" he said. ""And that hot air balloon is pulling your wrist UP! UP! UP! UP! Now open your eyes!"" If you had your arm raised in the air, imagining it was being pulled up, you were in.

Most of the kids weren't paying attention when he dropped this on us, but out of the ones who were, about 20 of them raised their hands. I was one of them.

I knew it was bullshit the whole time. He picked like 6 or 7 of us that he thought would play along. I happened to be one of them. He called us onstage and had us play out little skits that he fed to us, the ""hypnotized"".

""You! Take off your shoe!"" he said to one girl, Katie, who happened to be the queen of the drama club.

He pointed to me. ""The phone is ringing! Aren't you going to answer it?""

He pointed to Katie's shoe, and I dumbfoundedly ran over to it, picked it up and pretended to answer it. He had the rest of the kids doing various things at this point. Pretending to be dogs and barking, dancing by themselves with invisible partners, and me pretending to answer this girl's shoe.

I got so caught up in selling the fact that I was actually hypnotized to all my peers, having some ridiculous conversation on the shoe he had pointed at, that I missed some direction he gave me, some new command, and broke the illusion.

He quickly made some comment about me being only ""partially compatible"" and then ushered me offstage while he focused on the kids who were still barking and dancing around in circles.

I went back to where my friends were sitting and watched the rest of the show.",null,0,cdpfcfg,1rp0a1,AskReddit,top_day,7
12ozcurls,"I was brought on stage to be hypnotized at a show at my university about two years ago.

I wouldn't necessarily say I was ""hypnotized."" I realized I was on a stage and was part of this show. The magician's job was to relax the people on stage and make us feel comfortable doing whatever he asked us to do, and he succeeded at doing so.

So how I felt was basically really relaxed and comfortable to the point where I had no inhibitions.

As for what we did, he had us do a bunch of different things. One skit involved us acting like we were driving a car and he would throw different scenarios at us. Like seeing an attractive lady walking down the street. Or someone cutting us off.

In another part, we were supposed to become children in a preschool setting. There were a bunch more scenarios like this that the hypnotist was able to implement.",null,0,cdpfdv0,1rp0a1,AskReddit,top_day,4

davincisgirl,"If you're the type of person who (in general) can relax, go with the flow, and you can laugh at yourself, then you're able to be easily hypnotized.

You feel like whatever action you're performing is the right thing to do at the time and you honestly just dgaf. But if your nature is more uptight and reserved, then you're going to have a hard time letting go enough for the hypnotist to relax your mind and body. ",null,0,cdph08m,1rp0a1,AskReddit,top_day,1

StabbyMcGinge,"I've been ""hypnotized"". It isn't what most people think. You don't go into some trance and start being controlled by the hypnotist, its just a clever series of events which place you in a situation where you're likely to listen or you'll just look like a douchebag.

My experience was in my local pub, it was packed. He did a compatibility test, something to do with a ball being held between your hands and it slowly growing. He picked around 10 of us, myself included, and sat us in a row.

Now think of it already, he's performing in a pub at roughly 9pm in Wales, so everyone was already shitfaced. Drunk people will do anything anyway. He played some soothing music and did the generic ""you're getting sleepy"" and whispering in our ears what he wanted us to do when we awoke"".

He counted to three and snapped his fingers, and my job was to be a gay aerobics instructor. So I was mincing around the stage, and everyone was laughing. But I was under no trance, I was fully conscious and knew exactly what I was doing. 

I just didnt wanna be a dick and ruin everyones fun. If I had stopped and said ""Oh I'm terribly sorry but this is bullshit and nothing has happened"" I would have just looked like a prick. So you play along.",null,0,cdpipiu,1rp0a1,AskReddit,top_day,1

Yossarion,"Theoretically nothing would be immoral since most holograms aren't even artificial intelligences. There's nothing there to cause harm to. The more intelligent a program gets the more blurred this line becomes, though. If it is advanced enough to have preferences, and would prefer you to not be doing whatever you're doing, does it become immoral? If not, what if it were Data instead of a computer program? What is the difference between the two aside from processing power or a permanent physical anthropomorphic body?

Also, there was a Next Gen episode in which Barclay was inserting the likenesses of the bridge crew into his fantasy world on the holodeck. When the crew members in question found out about this, some did not take it well, and it's hard to blame them in my opinion. Even if the programs aren't intelligent enough to have preferences, their existence causes distress in the people they are copies of. I think this makes Barclay's actions immoral, though he did not have truly bad intentions at the time.

It's a trivial level of difference, but it's also an excellent window on how people treat others, if you treat a server or staff poorly, unless you are just having an absolutely shitty day I tend to get a sense of how someone is in reality.

As close minded as this method sounds, I've been able to successfully predict the type of person they will be every single time I use the method. A really interesting observation is every turbo-Christian I've done this to absolutely *loves* the show, despite being heavily science influenced and actually called the Big Bang theory.

I've come to the conclusion that they see the actual Big Bang theory as satire due to the poor comedic representation of science that show has to offer. Thus affirming their religious beliefs even further.

Bob lives on a flat surface. Essentially on a piece of paper. He can move forever lengthwise and widthwise, and that is it. Now let say he builds himself a safe. His safe has 4 walls and is impenetrable, and he puts something inside. Completely safe from his 2D enemies.

However, you can come around, and look down upon his 2D world from your third dimension. To you, the safe has no lid. It is completely open on the top. To Bob, there is no top, that is the third unexistant dimension. But you can just reach in and grab his prizes from above, and he would never be able to understand where they went. He could not picture a third dimension. However, his two dimensional world is just as infinite as ours is. He could go forever and ever in each of his 2 directions. 

But to us, they would look like infinite papers. We could stack them up into the third dimension. Infinitely many of them. Bob cannot possible picture a third dimension, and we could not possible picture a fourth. Possibly there are four dimensional beings existing right now, and could just reach in from the fourth dimension and fuck with us, take from our safes.

Things were going well, not much was going on - except for the girl who sat nearest to me.  Now, she wasn't a 10/10, but she was a solid 7-8/10 and I was pretty into her.  As we were finishing up some notes on derivatives, the entirety of the class grew silent for one of those awkward moments of silence and this girl happened to attempt to let one slide by.  

What she thought was a silent pass of gas turned out to be a land mine exploding, the decibel level was basically equivalent to someone shattering a glass bottle on concrete in a silent room.  The whole class turned around, and someone even screamed in surprise.  I saw her face go bright red and she looked down in the most embarassed way I have ever seen in my life.  

Seeing this girl who I was crushing on in such embarrassment created an idea in my head and I immediately blurted out, ""I think I shit myself... Mr. Jahncke can I go to the bathroom?""

And that is how I saved this girl from extreme embarrassment, while earning the nickname, ""Loud and Deadly"".

biffysmalls,"My parents are mortgage brokers so I can honestly say, they are a dirtbag profession with no real accreditation or college. 

Real Estate agents are fucking useless and will only show you listings of their or their friends listings that they will be getting a taste of. They are not working for your interests, but for their finders fee or commission. If you ignore this advice, most agents will focus on your monthly payment. This is stupid and so are they. With interest rates not getting any lower, you have to assume some increase when you renegotiate at the end of the term, and you will putting yourself into a potentially precarious position if rates increase and your income doesn't.

Find a good real estate LAWYER. Do pay more for the services of a reputable firm if you have to because they will go over the associated documents and point out the legal risk.

Also do not skimp on a good home inspector. Walk through the house with them. If you have a friend in the trades, take them too.

Consult any number of online calculators to determine your maximum mortgage. Now cut it by at least one third. That is what you can comfortably afford to buy and maintain, particularly if this is a resale of an older home without a warranty.

As for when we knew...we're bursting at the seams with little one on the way. For another $60 a month, I'd rather build my own equity than someone else's.",null,1,cdpg907,1rp2kp,AskReddit,top_day,3
Here4TheDipshits,"&gt;how did you initiate buying a home?

Find a mortgage broker you trust, find a real estate agent you trust. That's honestly all you need. They do this for a living, they know the business. No sense in you figuring it all out. You can read about the basics, but when it comes to all the details just sit down with them and they can answer any questions you have and explain the process and how it will go.

You start with the mortgage broker, and work out how much you can get ""pre-approved"" for. Getting a pre approval lets your real estate and sellers know that you are a serious buyer, and already have a mortgage broker lined up. Without one of these, it makes the process a little more difficult. So it's nice to have one ahead of time. But not hard to get at all. Also, shop it around, talk to a few mortgage brokers, you don't have to pay them anything. They make their money when you buy a house and take a loan with them.

Then, your real estate agent will show you houses that they recommend for your budgets and wish list, or you can send them listings you find online and they can arrange showings for you. When you find one you like and want to put a bid in, your real estate agent will work with you AND your broker on this, so that they can write up a specific bid for that property. The real estate agent and broker will do a lot of the talking for you, you have the final say in everything though of course, and have to sign the paper work.

It can be exciting and stressful, but it's not a hard process at all. Just find a good broker and agent you trust. Start by asking friends and co-workers who recently bought who they used.

Just make sure you're ready to be a home owner. It's a lot of work, and there will be some money to spend on things like a ladder, mower, tools, paint, etc. But it's all worth it.

Good luck. :)",null,0,cdpg0h2,1rp2kp,AskReddit,top_day,2

Niashiby,"My mom never got my father back at home.

Edit: Here's a little story about this. My mom used to work for my father, it was in a restaurent, I don't remember the name tho, she was a waitress. My dad had this restaurent but didn't live in the city, Amos in the north of Quebec. He used live in La Chenaie, it's about 5 hours in car, so my mom fall in love with him and you know what happen when two people love each other, they made some love. Right after, my father sold the restaurent to another person so he didn't have to come to Amos. She got pregnant (me!) and she called him but he didn't answer, it was his wife. Surprise, my mom finally got him on the phone and told him that he is gonna be a father. He said that she don't know her and it's probably not true because he never had a restaurent. 9 months later, i'm finally out and my mom wanted me to have a father so she called him again and he was telling that if she called him for that again, he will call the police. The whole story got in front of the justice court and my dad still said that it was not from him. DNA test, and suprise he was my dad. So my mom wanted him to pay something to help  our family to survive (she was a waitress), he said I will just pay a bit but i'll say my son every month. She said ok, i've got a picture from him and it's an old one so I can't see nothing. He promised me to come see me and kiss me on my head and leave, this was the last time I saw him.

We'd drive around from place to place making drop-offs and occasionally picking up more shit.

The police were taking people out and searching them.  One of our friends came up, grabbed my arm and we took off out a side door.  

He and I split up not too long after that.

The job seemed easy enough - make whatever ""product"" the boss wanted, and get paid. Easy. Or so I thought. In the first month, trouble arose within the business. This led to that, and then before I knew it, I had killed someone for the first time in my life. It didn't end there. Over the course of the year I built a name for myself in the business. I did things that nobody should ever have to - things you couldn't even imagine. I've killed more people than I can remember. Through my hard work, I built the biggest meth empire in the South West.

Yossarion,"Melatonin helps me. It's the chemical your brain releases when it decides it's time to go to sleep, only in tablet form, so when it kicks in that's all you really wanna do. It also has a low probability of dependence if not used for long periods of time. Some sources I've read say that means 2 weeks, others say 6 weeks or 2 months. I generally try not to take it more than 7 days in a row just in case, my sleep patterns are weird enough already. 

Another plus, it's commonly available over the counter as a nutritional supplement for a few bucks. I'd recommend starting with the smaller doses (3 or 5mg I think are the two smallest ones, can't remember though) until you know how much it's going to affect you and in what ways. I also recommend taking them with a big glass of water; some mornings after taking it I wake up parched but hydrating the night before keeps it from happening. 

For some immediate relief, try meditating. It seems new agey but it doesn't have to be. I'm as skeptical as they come and have found meditation to be a useful trick my brain can do. The metaphysical parts are optional, and the actual practice of meditating is simple as can be: close your eyes and try to focus only on your breathing. The feeling of air entering and leaving your lungs, or passing across your nostrils, the sounds it makes, whatever works for you. When your mind wanders, and it will, stop and refocus on your breathing. Rinse and repeat until unconscious, ha.",null,3,cdpgtk5,1rp56t,AskReddit,top_day,3

When I was younger, my older brother didn't really want to invite me to hang out with him and his friends and generally was the focus of my parents' attention until my sister was born. I strived to be the older and wiser sibling and try to share as much knowledge as I could with her even while I was still developing. As we grew older, my brother eventually moved to a different city while I was still around to look after my sister and show her how to prepare herself for high school as well as sharing some of my experiences so she knows not to make the same mistakes. She is now an honours student I couldn't be more proud. My brother comes back to visit time and again and he's working on strengthening his relationship with my sister as he can still provide guidance through her teenage years. I moved to a different country so I won't be able to see her do a lot of her work, but she shows it to me from time to time.

Peevesie,"A sibling is like the best friend you have been forced to have. Like your parents put two people in a room for around 20 years and said ""Now be friends"". After about 20 years you can't wait to get away but miss each other when away. You inexplicably defend and love this person in public about everything you may or may not like about them. But in personal life you have plotted about a million ways of slowly, torturously killing them. 

Plus there are the day to the day things. Its all the small things and nitpicky things about the other person which seem designed to make your life hell. If you say anything, you are raking up a fight. So as long as it peaceful its ok if the block the bathroom and make you late for school and then brandy about that they are always on time. COz he only has to bathe and put clothes and leave. You have to do it after him and then plait your hair coz you are a girl and the stupid school rules need your hair plaited. And your lateness is family legend that you will hear even when you are married

But he is also the guy who will threaten someone who he thinks is wrong for you and be all protective and come to your college past midnight to pick you up so that you don't have to take public transport at the creepy time despite having an early term paper the next day. He would make the best food for you when your parents are away(like restaurant quality), teach you how not to die of starvation and messiness and then tell you helped to your parents. 

He is the guy you have to tell everytime he is being inappropriate to other people, call out when he is unfunny, hypocritical, insensitive and hateful and pray to the lord he doesn't end up on the streets when he is being irresponsible

I am a younger sister and have an elder brother though honestly I feel like the elder and mature one almost 90% of the time.  And we lived in the same house till he was 23 and I, 20.

It sort of happened three days ago. 

Firstly, I'm an RA at my university (resident assistant) meaning that I, along with 4 other RAs in my building, have to deal with all of the stupid bullshit that college students do. Well, at the start of the semester, one of the female RAs and I had a fling. This is apparently strictly forbidden and I was told that if it continued, I would be fired. No one said anything to the girl I'm involved with, let's call her Kathy. Anyways, so I go to break the news to her and she acts cool for a week or so. We even had a few other ""meetings"" if you catch my drift. But, when it finally comes time to end it or be found out by the boss people, I decide to end it since I like getting paid to do nothing. She flips her shit and goes crazy. Starts doing stupid stuff to get on my nerves, but that's not too important. 

So, the semester continues and everything dies down between us. She calms her tits and we start having a decent time. I'm no longer single, but at this point I still hate Kathy because of all of the bullshit she pulled after I ended it. So, Kathy and I are cordial towards each other. Neither of us are single. We try to avoid each other as much as possible. Erything is cool. 

Then, two days before Thanksgiving break, (three days ago) she says something to me that pisses me off more than anything has ever. ""Your new girlfriend is kind of a slut."" 

If you knew my SO, you'd laugh at that thought, but I digress..

So, Kathy says that, and I laugh it off to her face, but start hatching my plan. See, as RAs, we get master keys to every room in the building. I know when she's leaving for Thanksgiving break, so all I have to do is wait. 

She leaves, I key into her room, and start jerking it. This is a jerk out of anger. Guys will understand. I pull up all of my old nudes that Kathy sent me to help me get off. It's poetic in a way, and to be honest she's kind of sexy as fuck. 


So, there I am with my dick out beating it like it owes me money while I'm looking for a place to drop my seed that's inconspicuous but would still be hilarious to me. Then, out of the corner of my eye, I see her favorite pair of zebra print rain boots. And that's when I realized what I was about to do. I was going to cum in her rain boots. I knew that she always wore them without socks and she would never notice the cum stain inside them.

naturesbitch,"The most admirable person, and it's really an easy choice, is a man called Bernie Fisher. He was the first instructor I learnt to fly gliders with.  
  
Bernie is getting on 80 years old now.its hard for him to push the rudder pedals when he's in the air these days, and he can't stay in the air for too long before he needs to rest. But everyday without a doubt Bernie is out there just waiting to give you his knowledge. He wouldn't stop.  
He didn't earn a cent from teaching me, and my friends, and still you could see how much he wanted to be doing it.  Amazing.  
He was in charge of the majority of the Huey helicopter fleet the navy had in the Vietnam war. He holds *every single non-type-rating licence that exist in this country*. Think about that now. He can get into any Cessna, private jet, gyrocopter, hang-glider, small chopper, and whatever else he pleases and simply fly it away.  
He spent the rest of his career post-war flying only in positions that directly benefited others. He fly the emergency rescue job for years, and was a Royal Flying Doctor Service pilot to top it off.

I live out in the country, but my county charges a dog tax.  I'm supposed to drive 30 minutes to the courthouse once a year to pay $10 per dog I have living on my property.  My dogs never set foot off my property unless we go for a walk at a park which is out of the county.  The tax was put in place to pay for the damages caused by irresponsible pet owners.  So people like me, who keep my dogs indoors and only take them for walks in appropriate places have to pick up the tab for people who let their dogs wander around.  The tax pool was completely used up last year to pay a farmer for the loss of several chickens and other small animals when his neighbor's dog attacked them.   His neighbor should have been forced to pay that tab, not the county. 

I shouldn't have to pay for this kind of shit.  I'm responsible, I keep my dogs indoors so they're not barking and howling all night.  I pay hundreds of dollars per year to vaccinate them, control parasites, and test for diseases.  I shouldn't be punished because other pet owners suck.",null,0,cdphs4x,1rp7l7,AskReddit,top_day,2

I have nothing against gay people. I have close friends and relatives who are gay. But when a gay man hits on me, it does still sort of freak me out.

There's probably a few reasons for it:

First, I don't really want to deal with being hit on by a gay man, especially a guy I know. I don't want to have to say let's still be friends, etc.

Second is I wonder if I come across as gay.

Then why don't I come across as hetero? Is this why women aren't dropping at my feet?

I've been really into eating apples lately. I go to the grocery store and I actually read the cards that tell about which breed of apple I'm buying; it describes the texture, colour, where and when it was developed, the flavour, and what they're best suited for. I make a point of buying at least two different kinds of apples every week. It's been awesome so far.
Also, did you know that if you eat an apple from the bottom it won't have a core? Try it, it'll blow your mind.

singles_in_your_area,"The Radiolab podcasts (and shows) from WNYC (an NPR station). 
They cover almost any topic imaginable, from human understanding of regret, to epidemiology, to the history of sewage treatment, to the mathematical &amp; life importance of loops. They do all of this in an incredibly artistic and in depth way, interweaving several story lines, either anecdotal or factual, always told by either experts or primary witnesses, into whichever theme they are addressing in each show. I say it's artistic because they truly have an incredible mastery of intermingling sounds whether that be the spoken word or contextually relevant noises (bird chirps and forest sounds for a show about birding, general hospital noise in doctor interviews, or incredible onomatopoeic pairings for all words like ""click"" and ""pop"") as well as editing segments together. Their podcasts flow exactly like the human mind would while trying to grasp these varied topics: the edits cutting away from experts for explanation as soon as things get confusing. 
My takeaway each time is what seems like an experiential knowledge of each topic due to the depth and context provided, and it never feels like someone just crammed a textbook into my head because it always sounds just like a very interesting story.

captbritcorps,"Tell-Em Steve Dave. It's on the Smodcast network and it started off with two friends of Kevin Smith; Bryan Johnson and Walt Flanagan and another friend and former View Askew employee Brian Quinn as their 'tech guy'. If you've seen any Kevin Smith films you've probably seen Walt and Bryan in them mainly known for ther Steve Dave and Fanboy characters which is where they took the name, Brian Quinn people may know from Impractical Jokers on TruTv. Walt agreed to do the podcast originally to help Bryan through a deep depression he was going through and thought he would lose interest after 3 episodes (it's now on episode 178).

It's hard to explain it but I just love this podcast so much. It's not so much about any specific subject it's more just about these 3 guys as they talk about their lives, news stories, stories from their past etc. Usually it would sound boring but the 3 have such a great chemistry that just makes it such a hillarious and sometimes touching thing to listen to. Walt and Bryan have been friends for 30+ years, Quinn and the others for 15+ years so they know each other well.

The podcast doesn't really have any set format it's just whatever the guys want to talk about. Over the years this has included one members pretty serious painkiller addiction, them all getting tv shows, depression and basically whatever comes to mind. I'm really struggling to describe what it's about or why I love it but I'll say this it's probably one of my most favourite pieces of entertainment at any one point in the day I'm probably listening to an episode.

Learn from my mistakes reddit! don't let yourself get super huge. Also it is never too late to change your wicked ways. I never in a million years thought I'd be wearing the clothes I wore in high school again. Persevere my friends! It is remarkably achievable to lose the weight!  

My biggest pieces of advice are to incorporate exercise in your everyday life, change your diet dramatically, and count your calories religiously. If you have a high calorie day, have two very low calorie days, or fast, for a day. This works wonders for me allows me to binge eat for a period as long as I use my powers of self control for a longer period following the binge. As far as exercise goes, walking and biking everywhere (I do live in the city though) and also I have a physically active job which was CRUCIAL to losing the weight. I would make my job more active than it needed to be (take the long way, take the stairs, carry heavy boxes instead of using carts, or hand trucks etc) Eventually I got a stationary bike and some 25 lbs weights and do cardio, curls, and also sit ups, pushups, and bicycles/flutter kicks. The human body is amazing and can transform itself completely in a relatively short period of time.  YOU CAN DO IT!! It's totally achievable.  

I've also been experimenting with fasting and it works wonders. I fasted for 72 hours before thanksgiving and lost 10lbs. I weighed myself this morning and was up 6 lbs haha, but that usually goes down fast with exercise and low calorie days.

just_kitten,"Anime. And all the things that came with it. 

I'd be voraciously eating up anything new that caught my eye, and if I latched on to an anime I'd go crazy looking for info - and trust me, there's no shortage of stuff to dig up and read. Official interviews, online and offline. Every single forum thread and blog post on the show. Even subtle comments on animators' blogs picked up from an unrelated 2ch thread. It got to the point that I was structuring my life around real-time broadcasts so that as soon as it finished, I could furiously refresh nicovideo to grab the latest unnamed LQ stream and load it in the minutes before it would get removed.

I did get some good things out of it; I got a lot better at reading *and* writing Japanese (communicating with other fans), I learned a lot more about online culture in that time than I ever have since, and I got a lot better at digital art, too. I had so much energy.

But eventually life moved on and shit happened, and I found myself wanting to run away from it all for a while, so I latched on to some other interest. Watched less and less anime, eventually sticking only to ones I really absolutely wanted to watch, until even they started to seem a bit silly. 

The turning point was when I didn't visit my main forum haunt for a whole month as I had moved to another country. The desire just never came back, and when I moved into a house that had a low bandwidth cap, I just stopped altogether. On the other hand, it ended up being a symptom of depression (anhedonia), so it was a bit shitty... still, even after getting better, I've never regained the interest.

I'm kind of glad I did that because now it's even easier to get completely caught up - staff twitter feeds, legal streaming, more direct marketing to Western audiences... It's not like anime is bad per se, far from it. But I had been taking it too far and really blinkered myself.",null,0,cdpj1cu,1rp8su,AskReddit,top_day,10

persepolisp,"Being a controlling/mentally abusive lover.

I left a trail of psychologically damaged women, and I'll never be able to reverse the damage I inflicted upon them. Seeing what I've caused showed me how destructive my personality was. I thought about never dating again, and in recent months committing suicide. But I choose instead to change, and be proactive. I've done some heavy introspective detective work, and I've also been practicing exercises that allow me to put myself in the shoes of others, and to realize and reverse the error of my ways before or as they happen instead of in retrospect.

It's an uphill battle, even to this day, but I feel like my approach to women is much more healthy. I still wish I could reverse the emotional damage I've caused other people to have to live with, though. It's unfair that I've burdened people with trust issues, etc. and possibly prevented them from having unhealthy experiences when my experiences with them inspired me to improve. I still think about suicide when I think of that. Is it fair for me to live in a world I've made significantly more awful for others? But I wouldn't do it.

Also, feminism played a big role in my recovery, but I don't feel right calling myself a feminist after how I've treated women.

In reality, although the extra money is nice and I have been able to afford several things I've been wanting to buy for years, as someone who used to smoke everyday for at least 4 years, it's been a bit of a struggle. 

Unfortunately, my depression has reared it's ugly head for the first time in 5 years since I first started smoking trees. I've cut down fairly big (for example, it's Friday and the last time I remember smoking was Monday night) from everyday to just mainly weekends/days off. But my depression has hit me like a ton of bricks over the last month. I started smoking weed every day in order to keep myself regular. It basically saved my life. Without it, I would have killed myself years ago. 

It's cool have a little bit of extra money each week but I should consider going back to smoking every day.

I'm assuming this is high school we're looking at here.  
Myself, I hated school from about 9th grade onwards. Hated it. Really despised being there, and trust me I had my reason. Without getting in to it too much I moved schools 7 times and dropped out twice with two years.  
I thought my education was done at the stage, and that I'd be labouring for a long time to come.  
But, one day, I came to realise that I really did love education. Hated school, but loved education. I found so many options were available to me such as distance courses and online classes. And for me that was a godsend.  
  
Anyway back to you. I'm not sure it's at all relevant but maybe your the keen-to-learn type without being the love-school type just like I was.

whether this article applies to you or not is up to you, but i felt like it made sense. basically it says that 'discipline is a myth', and that the choices we make are based on love. so in your case, it's not that you're lazy, it's that you love playing League of Legends etc., more than you love learning and getting a good education. if that is true, then try and find something about education (or the end result of it, e.g. a job) that you love, or would love. when you have something like that in mind, and a somewhat clear path of how to get there, putting in the hours to study, and saying no to the distractions comes a little bit easier.

Tell someone you will do X thing by Y date. Make sure it is someone who will ask you about it. Promises to yourself are worthless, you'll break them. When you tell someone else, you will (hopefully) be pushed to do it, if only to not look bad.

Always be focused on a goal. If you have nothing (likely), then simply on the goal of turning into someone useful to society/not being poor/making your parents proud. Does not have to be very specific.

Evaluate your friend circle. Make sure you are hanging out with the kind of person(s) you want to be. Might be the most difficult on this list, because breaking and forming bonds is tough. But remember though, it is better to be alone than be with people holding you back. And feel free to PM me if you need support :)

As the obedient, sheepish red-head I was, I would also attend youth group afterwards. Like most kids, I had discovered the wonderful world of cursing and along with the obligatory porn viewing. Those were my only real ""faults."" I was told when I died and went to heaven that I would have to watch a video of all my sins and have to answer for them. All I could imagine was my dad in heaven saying, ""You jerked it HOW many times at the family computer?!?"" It was mortifying to think about.

I had always been slightly suspicious about the whole church thing, but did it because that's what was expected of me. As I got into high school and heard about or witnessed things people were doing on Saturday night before church I started to realize the kids on the front row at youth group with their hands outstretched singing God's praises were some of the biggest hypocrites and I decided I wanted no part of that club.

foamed,"**Roguelikes.**

Basically more or less every single roguelike out there are frustratingly hard. You thought Dark Souls or I Wanna Be the Guy was hard, think again. Roguelikes will laugh and kick you in the groin even before you've started the game. The games can be extremely unforgiving, especially considering they all got procedural generation, random items and monsters and also permadeath. It keeps the game fresh and interesting and you'll never see or play the same game twice.

I've been playing **[NetHack](http://www.nethack.org/)** for more than 15 years and I've still not been able to beat it. Sure, I could most likely have won it if I used guides and tutorials, but personally I find that takes some of the fun away.

I've also been playing games like Brogue and Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup for several years now, I'm not great at them, but it's still a ton of fun even after all these years of playing.

There is no other answer to this for me. I never enjoy playing this *game*.

I have huge qualms with the game in general. You have so few meaningful decisions and you are largely the victim of multiple forms of randomness - dice, cards, other player's decision making.

The game accomplishes it's goal of teaching you the flaws of capitalism but it does it in a grueling frustrating way. I feel good game play involves players having agency to control the outcome of the game. Monopoly lacks that.

other one wasn't as good. basically this couple decided that we should act like they broke up, and we sided into two groups, one that was on the guy's team, and one was on the girls team. everyday, we would come in and arrange it so there was a huge gap in the middle.we made the vibe super intense and awkward for the instructor. after a week or so, we just stopped cuz he would see us all kicking it during break and found out it was just a joke.

If the number of steps didn't land on an even number, I'd walk around the block or parking lot so my arrival to the door was an even number. When I am stressed, this routine calms me down still.

starknakedmonster,"Not the most violent, but emotionally the most fucked up. 

I went to what would be considered a 'posh' girls' school in Asia when I was in middle school. One of my classmates was easily the poorest among us, and this was obvious from her clothes/bag etc. Being totally apathetic, I didn't give a fuck, treated her like any normal person (I was a dick to everyone), and just generally lived my own life. 

Unfortunately, not everyone gave as little fucks as I did. One morning, I walked into class to see a gang of bitches picking up her laptop (we were all required to have those) and throwing it violently to the ground, where it broke. Keep in mind that this girl's family probably saved up for months to be able to pay for the laptop and all her things, even with the school's measly financial aid program. 

I will never forget the expression on her face when her laptop hit the ground and the case cracked. As if this wasn't enough, the bitches were yelling things at her like 'You're a fucking loser', and then stepped on her broken laptop while laughing like maniacs. Being unable to control my anger, I walked straight at the group of bitches. 

One of them, a fat nerdy girl who was only 'popular' because she happened to be fucking loaded, smirked at me in the most obnoxious way possible. ""What's your problem?"" 

I slapped her across the face so hard she immediately started crying (girls, lol) and ran to the toilet in shame and embarrassment. Unfortunately, her bitch friends told some teacher, and I was nearly expelled. The poor bullied kid didn't help me, either. Which I didn't mind, because I'd always wanted to slap that pig anyway.

ChesterHiggenbothum,"I met my first love in college.  She went to a different school in a different state, but we made it work.  We would visit each other, call each other, and talk online as much as possible.  On breaks, one of us would drive down and spend the break with the other person.  We did that for three and a half years.   It was the best relationship I ever had.  We talked so much, it felt like we knew everything about each other.

During the summer before my senior year, while I was spending the summer with her, I proposed.  She said yes, which made me very happy obviously.  We spent senior year planning our future together.  I was going to go to law school in California, she already had a job loned up writing for a magazine.  We were planning the wedding.  It was going to be an amazing life.

My birthday is in April, a month before graduation.  I wanted her to visit me, because... Well, it was my birthday.  She said she was busy, it was a long drive, she wouldn't be able to stay long.  Driving from North Carolina to Ohio is tough, but she knew it was important to me so it was pretty easy to convince her. 

She got into a car accident and died.  It was late at night, so I'm not sure what happened.  She might have fallen asleep or hit a wet patch.  She was alone in the car and didn't hit anybody else, but two people died that night.  For all intents and purposes, my life ended with hers.

I've been kinda drifting ever since it happened.  Working part time jobs, not really forming any relationships, moving around a lot.  I never went to law school.  I've been working on short stories and a novel.  She wanted to be a writer, so I guess I feel it's my responsibility to write the stuff she never had a chance to write.  I doubt I do her justice.

I would do anything to have her back.  I haven't met anybody else that even compares, even after a few years.  People tell me that I need to get out there and meet new people, that there are plenty of fish in the sea.  But the ocean is empty without her.  

I would give up everything else for a life with her.  No matter where I am or what I'm doing, or who I'm with, or what I have, I'd pick her.  

  TL;DR - This is the one story that I won't summarize.

 And thank you to everybody who offered advice.  It's nice to know that so many people care.  I'm working on building a new life and becoming a person that she would be proud of.  It's taking time and I'll always miss her, but I know that I can find happiness in the future.

Xmas456,"This actually happened to me.

Dated her in high school and college and we broke up. We tried to stay friends but college life and then careers took over.

I just severed ties with her at that point.  

8 years later...  We crossed paths completely unhappy with our lives. We were married to people that didn't appreciate us.  We were on the outs with our SO's and the reconnection with each other sped the process up.

I jumped ship on my ex and moved out near her.

It started up again with a face to face.  Dinner...  Second date.. Introducing each other's kids.

A year later, basically living together... We had our own daughter on the way.  Then I bought a house for us and our kids.

We got married last weekend after 5 years back together.  Could not be happier...

EDIT:  

Thanks for the Gold kind stranger!

Some of you have asked why the ... at the end.   I don't know if there is an answer to why/how this all happened.  This is a 22 plus year old relationship.  I still believe that the best is yet to come after the smoke clears.  We officially got married last Saturday.  I am still awe of it.

I broke him. I never meant to. And every day I'm sorry for my actions and hope that he has found true love and happiness. 

Edit: Thanks everyone for the advice and for sharing your own stories. To give a bit more information: 

This was nearly 15 years ago. We were 18 at the time, I was messed up and intent on throwing myself at a wall while he was a hard worker, studious and serious. I loved him and knew that one day I wanted to settle down with him but I also knew that I had to walk a long path of painful self discovery before I was ready for what he was offering. I could have stayed with him, but by doing so would have done more hurt in the long run. It took me years to understand the level of damage I caused but there are three major things stopping me from contacting him to apologise: 

1. He doesn't want to know me. He has blocked me on Facebook and has seen me on the street and changed directions to avoid me.

2. His name is very, very common and therefore impossible to Google-stalk so I can't even post a letter to him.

3. While I don't believe in carrying unnecessary pain, I fear that my desire to apologise is only to assuage my own guilt. If I knew absolutely that he wanted or needed to hear it I would do everything I could to say it. But for all I know he could be ok now and I'd merely open old wounds. 

I've thought about this for a long time and I would give ten years of my life to see him, to explain, to tell him that I've never found his equal, that my love for him has never diminished. But I am reconciled to living with this heaviness in my soul. This burden is my own creation and I will continue to carry it for as long as I have to.",null,251,cdpj3o0,1rpdk1,AskReddit,top_day,1117

punkwalrus,"Not an ex, per se, but everyone thought she was.  She was my best friend in high school, but we had a platonic relationship.  Anyway, our lives split apart after some shitty drama, and we grew in different directions.  I got married, had a kid, wrote a book, and started to become famous in the sci-fi convention circuit.  She got married to an abusive drug addict, and became an alcoholic (I didn't know this at the time).  At the time, I was with a burgeoning comedy group.  It had been maybe 7 years since we last saw one another.

I was at a large science fiction convention.  My wife came up to me and said, ""Hey... you know [Mary] is here?""

""Mary who?""  Mary is not her real name, but her name was really common.

""Your old best friend, Mary.""  The group had heard about Mary and how our friendship ended.  Most assumed she had a crush on me, and that's what led to the end of our friendship.  I disagreed, but whatever.  The end of our friendship was super-dramatic, and so *they just had to meet this person*.

Keep in mind this is a comedy group made of college-aged people.

If I had to do it all over again, I would have denied it was her.  Instead, I was stupid and insensitive, and we stalked her for a good 20 minutes.  She got this sense we were doing so, and double backed on us.  

She did not look good.  She was going through this... alcoholic ""I am channeling the Joker"" phase in her life (again, I was not aware at the time).  But all I saw with this former friend of mine in a ridiculous jacket, a tee-shirt showing the Joker, and bad stage makeup.  She kind of looked like a Comic-con nerd and a Juggalo.

One of our directors said a little too loudly, ""YOU used to date THAT???""  And an entire group of comedic professionals just pointed and nearly collapsed in laughter.

I immediately regretted this moment.  One, because she was my best friend and deserved better treatment than a group of strangers pointing at her and laughing.  Two, some of the insults the writers had were funny enough for me to not laugh, which I hated every fiber of my being for doing.  Three, I had a punk/goth past of my own they didn't know about, and *I* felt insulted.  And Mary?  Just stood there.  She must have been in immense anger, embarrassment, and pain and all she probably wanted to do was attend this sci-fi convention in peace.

I felt bad the rest of the weekend, and weeks afterwards, cringing at the memory.  Some six years later, I found her on Usenet, and apologized.  She thanked me, and told me what she had been going through at the time.  I still regret being part of what was essential junior-high behavior.  I am better than that.

Awesome spin of awkwardness: Were now part of the same university-revue/cabaret group, which my current boyfriend (of three years, whom I live with) are the leader of and has been for four years. I think my ex got the worst part of this arrangement. It's lucky for all of us that were quite down to earth and rational people, so today it doesn't make for awkward times (though quite stupid conversations when drunk), but that party was a special kind of awkward.

It was a rollover accident and I was the second on scene right behind a guy who had a radio in his truck that he could use to call for help (where they live to this day cell service is spotty at best).  So I ran to the car.

I got there and the Woman in the front seat was pinned so I made sure she was alright and calmed her down so she would stop struggling against her pinned legs.  I looked up during this and saw her child who was in a car seat, but the seat hadn't been properly secured and it was suspended above her head between the two seats.  The child's neck was obviously broken and there was nothing I could do.  He was probably about 8 months old.  I could see him trying to breathe and then he kind of let out this sigh and died.

Because of the adrenalin I had going, I didn't react at the time and kept helping her.  It took medics and the rescue about 15 minutes to arrive on scene and I stayed with her.  They got there and started working on her and I walked away from the wreck, talking to the CHP officer and the guy who had called in on the radio about it.

Suddenly the adrenalin left me and I fell to my knees on the side of the road and threw up.

The Mom was extricated and survived.

Its not really disgusting in the sense you're probably looking for, but its something that comes back to me in my dreams sometimes, and it is something I will never get out of my head for sure in my life, ever.

This was sometime like 1985). So, little boy, had an almighty bollocking and a smack and then (this is the important bit) made to go to the shop and while my mum waited outside glaring at me through the window had to ask the shopkeeper for a replacement. My six year old brain associated dealing with people with punishment and fear.

I had a really nice group of friends that I'm still friends with now, so the no friend part wasn't true. Also I don't think I was a bitch - I was 12, really innocent and quite a sensitive person.  What really scared me was that the person must've known me well - they knew my home address, mentioned personal things about me and printed the message through a computer (no hand writing to analyse!)

I just a wanted to forget about it at the time and wouldn't talk about it, and even though the school got involved I never found out who sent it. So knowing that someone hates you that much and would go to that much trouble to tell you at such a young age pretty much shattered my self esteem.

I have taken my non spanish speaking boyfriend with me. He is visiting Mexico for his first time. We get settled in my small house on the out skirts of town. Make the bed with fresh sheets, take advantage of the freshly made bed by getting into them and experiencing the all time ""take your breath away"" moments of all time. Only the first of many to come in that day. Get cleaned up head out on the ranch. Grab some horses and heard the family cows out to graze and drink water. He had never been on a horse before. I can still remember him attempting to mount and failing.. We road the horses out for miles. Green pasture in every direction as far as the eye could see.. A few hours later we came back home and messed up the sheets again.. Cleaned up and headed out in my suburban, got that thing stuck in the mud... we piled lots of dead branches in the rear tires to give it traction.. I reved it up and spraid mud all over his face.. I got out the truck and laughed so hard in this face.. he hugged me and got mud all over me... we fell and rolled around in the mud till an old man walked by and asked if we needed help.. after some pushing and reving and more sticks we got the thing un stuck... 
Covered in mud we head back in the house.. Showered cleaned up and messed up those sheets once more for the road.. by than we are famished... headed into to town we grabbed some amazing shrimp cocktails at the mercado. We had a few beers with some friends .. roamed around the town, sang with the mariachi, laughed, enjoyed the day... lots of little moments that are engrained in my memory forever... 
than we headed out to the plaza de toros to watch a bull fight. Ate lots of yummy food, drank lots of great tequila.... 
hugged, kissed, held each other like we couldn't possibly let go.. So we didn't... The day was amazing.... 
I would gladly re live it over and over.... 
and having the full conscious of it I can always alter small details throughout the day.... But really that day was perfect....

The party atmosphere was like nothing I've ever seen before.  People shoulder-to-shoulder in the streets.  Live music everywhere.  People dancing without any cares written on their faces.  The streets were shut down to car traffic, so the restaurants extended their 'dining rooms' into those streets.  Easily-accessible intoxicants.  Easily-accessible women.  I had plenty of money in my pocket and nobody to answer to.  I feel like I could relive that night forever and have no problem having a different experience every day.

PDaviss,"I've actually thought about this exact question too many times.BBack in may of this year was my favorite day not because everything went right but because it's one of the few days where I felt proud of myself.  Here we go:
It was the last friday for senior, I was one at the time, so all my classes were slacking. My friend's parents were in chicago and gone for the weekend, so the only logical thing to do is have a reefer party at his house. In our group of friends was this girl who I had been crushing on for two years. I'm shy as fuck, but somehow i got enough courage to ask her if she wanted to chill after school. She said yeah. The end. 
Nah, just joking, anyway she wanted to get a piece so we went to our local sketchy gas station/headshop. On the way there we talked and laughed and shit, and we ended up planning on going to the party together. 
At like 8, we head over to the house. She told on the way over that i couldnt cuddle her because her prom date was coming and she didnt want him to find out us. She said wait until he left. Trill. 
It was a normal reefer party, lot of smoking and food. At one point the girl says we should watch Spaceballs, which is my favorite movie. 
At midnight, everyone left her and i. Literally within 2 minutes of her date leaving we were cuddling. Yes. We're all super frosty and somehow we ended up watching public access television. Jamaican and old people dancing has never been so amazing. Anyway we fall asleep still cuddling. The next morning I drop her and felt like King Shit.

The door opens and an ugly fat repulsive woman asks them what they want. ""Just some food.. We are starving!"" one of them said. The woman takes a look and says: ""Sure, you can eat whatever you want but you have to have sex with me afterwards."" One of the guys takes another look at the stinking sweaty woman and decides he rather dies outside than have sex with her. The other one takes his chance and follows her inside. There's a big table with a lot of food: Turkey, chicken, fruit, swine and lots more. He starts eating like a maniac while the woman looks at him. ""Your eating is making me horny"" she said.

As she pulls him along he manages to grab a big corncob. She undresses and lies down. Her belly is in the way, so without her noticing the guy manages to use the corncob to make the woman squeel and have an orgasm.

SpinYourMeat,"Carl Scheele. Referred to by Isaac Asimov as ""hard luck Scheele"", he made several important scientific discoveries a considerable time before they were 'officially' discovered. He discovered oxygen, molybdenum, tungsten, barium and chlorine.

He was an old-school scientist and had an odd habit of tasting and otherwise sampling the chemicals and compounds he worked with, and was eventually found dead at his work desk surrounded by various deadly chemicals.

muchtoomuchtoomuch,"I am not a pilot myself. But I once met a sweaty guy in an Indian restaurant in Panama who claimed that he used to be one. After a few decent drinks he told me the following story:

Many years ago he was the captain of a trans-pacific flight from Honolulu to Kuala Lumpur. The plane was packed with people and the air was thick and sweaty. Smoking was still allowed in those days. The take-off and everything thereafter had gone well enough, but something apparently did not feel quite right to him. After they had reached cruising altitude he handed over control of the plane to his co-pilot and then left the cockpit to make the rounds and greet the passengers; and to reassure himself that everything was proper and the way it was supposed to. The passengers were the usual bunch for this route. There were sticky guys in tacky Hawaiian shirts, stressed families with rummaging kids, sleeping old people, slightly frightened looking young people, and about the usual amount of men in suits, not really doing anything. But this sight did not calm the pilot. The people looked wrong, and they terrified him. They all seemed to him to be empty shells, imitators. He just knew. And because he knew, he was in danger. He half-expected them all to fall quiet and stare at him blankly at any moment. And indeed, out of the corner of his eye he saw them drop their facade. He saw the faces of laughing people fall blank, the eyes of sleeping people open and those of children pierce him sharply, reading his thoughts. He was sure. Of course, as soon as he looked at them straight on they had their masks back up and looked and acted perfectly normal. But no matter, he rushed back towards the cockpit, nearly stumbling. He entered, slammed the door shut and without a word, took over control of the aircraft and began to figure out the best way to crash the plane into the ocean without his crew being able to interfere, at least before it was too late to stop him.

In the end he did not do it, obviously. The thought of dying in close proximity to these things terrified him too much. He brought the plane safely to Kuala Lumpur, disappeared into the city and got drunker than he'd ever been. The passengers never knew.",null,3,cdpl8b6,1rpkzy,AskReddit,top_day,8

 Eventually after laughing at me a bit, he turned the engine on again and we came back to the airport immediately. Just about 30 minutes after we started our flight. I thought it was weird but i was more like, meh, whatever. 

We landed and he was very nervous, and it wasn't  until a few hours later while having a beer that he told me after he turned the engine off, it wouldn't start again, and it was so that he actually started looking for an Emergency Landing spot to which he could plane to. Eventually the engine turned on again and thats why we came back immediately, so he could send the plane to the mechanics. 

Phew! 

I flew a bunch of other times with him and everything was always ok. 

Eventually that piece of shit plane did it again, and this time it turned into a real Emergency Landing. The plane broke in half. but fortunately my friend and his trainee (a girl who was on her very first lesson) were completely unharmed. ",null,1,cdplphy,1rpkzy,AskReddit,top_day,1

Its fun to see movies about the future where our technology is advanced and we are travelling amongst the stars. But in this movie we have no hope, we haven't learned to come together and now we can see a possible end approaching. Clive Owen's character isn't some macho hero, he's a scared alcoholic who gets a flash of hope and wants to do the right thing. Not once does he fire a gun in the movie, and he's in sandals a good portion of the movie when there is rubble and debris everywhere. Plus you have a couple of those cinematography shots where the camera does not cut away for minutes at a time.

Two dead boys got up to fight,
Back to back they faced each other,
Drew their swords and shot each other,
One was blind and the other couldn't see
So they chose a dummy for a referee.
A blind man went to see fair play,
A dumb man went to shout ""hooray!""
A paralysed donkey passing by,
Kicked the blind man in the eye,
Knocked him through a nine inch wall,
Into a dry ditch and drowned them all,
A deaf policeman heard the noise,
And came to arrest the two dead boys,

MrManicMarty,"I like the story told in Fallout: New Vegas. It's the story of a land, two conqueres on either side with different flags, different motives but still the same end goal. But there is one who would fight against them, to make his plans fall into place and provide a new future, but to do this he needs you. But *you* decide who wins, who falls, and it could be you that wins in the end because your tasked with uniting Vegas, the Khans, The Boomers, The Kings all these tribes and people and problems you decide what happens to them, who they support and who dies for who. Because in the end war is about who has enough friends to make a difference, and war... war never changes.

Dead Money - A tale of letting go, many people all with different burdens that weight them down yet they cling to them in frustration and greed. You have to work together with these people to get the end and put an end to the greed, you've got to make them let go.

Honest Hearts - A great people destroyed and scattered, a man who seeks redemption for his countless sins - but does God decide what happens to us, or do we make our own destiny. Do we save what we can, or destroy what we can.

Old World Blues - A phrase that means to look at the past and feel blue because it isn't the same as it was. Things change, and science is the greatest catalyst of change. But the desire of knowledge knows no bounds, we always seek to analyse, to dissect, to disseminate - to see what makes the world works. But sometimes we can know too much and sacrifice too much for knowledge, so we must stop great minds from causing great catasphroe.

Lonesome Road - Two couriers, each bearing his (or her) own flag. We see how even the most insignificant action by the most insignificant people can cause the most significant change. Here it is where we settle things, where we lay down our flags and fight for what we want to prove but we do so alone, because the world is lonesome yet many fight on it.

There are two tentacles – Purple, who is evil, and Green, who is good. A mad scientist pollutes a river with some crazy chemicals, and Purple tentacle drinks from the river, causing him to grow arms. He then sets off for world domination.


The scientist finds three kids/teenagers who are willing to stop Purple tentacle, by travelling back in time to the previous day and preventing the river from ever getting polluted, using a time machine (with three capsules) the scientist built in his basement. The time machine breaks, because the scientist didn't use a real diamond, and the kids get stuck in different time zones: 


- Hoagie, who’s this huge roadie guy with long hair, gets stuck 200 years in the past, with Washington, Jefferson, Ben Franklin and the like.


- Bernard, a skinny geeky guy, stays in the present.


- Laverne, a crazy blond chick, is stuck 200 years in the *future* where, since no one stopped Purple tentacle’s evil plans, tentacles rule the world and humans are enslaved.


The kids can still communicate and send objects to each other via their time capsules. You have to fix the capsules (which is kind of tricky, since Hoagie is stuck 200 years ago with no electricity), bring the kids back and then stop Purple tentacle from taking over the world.


I hope I've managed to make this game sound awesome, because…well, this game is *awesome*.

Mythrowawaywheee,"Halo 4. Stay with me, let me explain. 


Now the first 3 Halo games were great. The flood reveal in 1, the cliffhanger ending in 3, they were a really brilliant trilogy. 



Reach was also incredible. It showed war in a brutal light. You'd get attached to these characters and build up this pseudo-relationship with them and then BANG — they're gone. And that ending — heroism at its finest, sacrificing yourself to save the human race. 



But 4 was different. Throughout the original trilogy we saw Chief and Cortana as a team. A well-oiled machine. And that's all we saw. The machine. There was barely any connection. They were tools for the greater good. And then 4 came around. Cortana is lonely, dying, and lost. We start to see the human side of Cortana. Then suddenly, they're thrust back into battle, Chief and Cortana, like back in the old days. But as we progress, we start to see that something has gone wrong with the machine, something is malfunctioning. Cortana is dying. Falling apart, and trying to hide it from Chief. Why? Because she genuinely cares about him. And this feeling is reciprocated. All his life, Chief has been trained to be emotionless, a human weapon. Now, we start to see less Chief, and more John. He is scared. He has to get Cortana back to Halsey, must save her. And they both know it's a futile cause, but Chief will not accept it. Throughout the game, we see the emotional side of both protagonists. Cortana displays absolute terror and anger, and we see that she's tearing herself apart, and she knows it. Chief is scared — for the first time, truly scared, because he can't fix the problem. Everything he knows is falling apart, and the man is separating from the machine. 



SPOILERS:


Now it's endgame. The Didact has reached Earth, and although Chief and Cortana are so close to home, it's being destroyed. The player completes the objectives, and victory seems clear when suddenly everything stops. 



Chief is confused. He doesn't know what's happening. Cortana, life size, walks up to him. 

""It worked, you did it! Just like you always do..""
""I'm not coming with you this time...most of me is down there. I held only enough back to get you off the ship.""



John is terrified. He can't lose Cortana. His partner. His second half. But he must, and he is absolutely powerless. 



Then she's gone. The AI we've been rooting for, praying that she'll survive, assuming that because she's a protagonist that she must live, is dead. 



Halo 4 made the player empathize with it's characters. We always assume that the heroes will win in the end, but that's just now how life works. They're cruely ripped away from us, mere inches away from salvation. They become our friends, even projections of ourselves, and then suddenly, they're gone.

He is a man impossibly broken by his own desire to do good. He knows what he has done and his soul fights against evil inside himself.

It was an old Chevy pickup with a large overhang built onto the back that got loaded up with corn, and I sat by it and sold it all day for $10 an hour, which was pretty awesome for someone still in high school. The selling part wasn't all that bad, I typically just brought a book and read between customers, and it taught me how to be really fast at returning change.

The shitty part was GETTING the corn. We didn't actually grow it in the area where we were selling it, so I had to drive two hours to get the corn, and I had to drive my boss' rickety old pickup truck that should have never passed inspection. That or an old Chrysler mini-van that had no suspension left at all.

The first time I went down, I went down with someone more experienced than me. We had to pick up 100 bushels of corn. I don't know if you've ever seen a bushel of corn, but it's a lot of fucking corn, and we had to stuff 100 of them into two small vehicles. It was WAY more corn than we should have been carrying, and was blatantly illegal.

Me, being an idiot, didn't just say ""no, fuck this"" and go home, I actually did the job. So I filled a van with something like 55 to 60 bushels of corn and had to make the two hour trip back north in a van so full of corn that it was nearly bottomed out. I couldn't see out the back, I couldn't see out of the passenger's side, I had corn in my lap and I was holding up corn with my right arm so it wouldn't fall over on top of me.

Now this would have been fine on a back road. But I had to drive this monstrosity on a four lane highway, through tollbooths, during rush hour traffic, and I wasn't really sure on the correct route to go. So I was following my fellow employee in the pickup, when they get pulled over in front of me by the police due to the CLEARLY illegal amounts of weight they are carrying. We had talked before hand, and the strategy for if this happened was ""Just keep going cause you'll get a ticket too.""

So here's young, naive me, with a van full of corn on a four lane highway, trying to somehow not kill myself. In order to stop I would need at least a thousand feet, as there was literally TONS of corn in the van. And I had to switch and merge lanes by blind hope, as I couldn't actually see where the hell anything was with all the corn I had in the van.

I spent the next two-and-a-half hours in blind terror, the whole time. The van was slow as shit, and any bumps I hit at all would cause a horrific grinding noise followed by sparks shooting out the back (I could see from the driver's side mirror only).

The worst part? I was dumb enough to do this for FOUR MONTHS. I don't know how I never got a ticket after all the illegal shit I did to get fucking CORN to where it needed to go.

TL;DR: Was an illegal corn hauler.",null,3,cdplwpa,1rpn7n,AskReddit,top_day,3

Raiders takes place in 1936.  For the second movie, Spielberg did not want to have Indy go after Nazis again, but that would not make sense with the timeline.  By 1937 and after the rise of the Third Reich was a huge fucking deal.  So very quietly at the start of Temple of Doom, the date appears as 1935--the year before Raiders.

Anyway, Raiders--the sequel--is much better than Temple of Doom.

My parents would often fight. My dad had a terrible temper and my mom was an alcoholic. Nothing physical ever happened but the verbal abuse between these two was insane. My mom would drink, become incredibly irrational, which would trigger my dad's temper and the yelling would start. When I was about 15 I had enough. It was almost midnight and they were screaming at each other through the hallways. I asked them to stop, and they would, for a few minutes, and then my mom would slur something at my dad and the fighting would escalate again. Well, I decided if they weren't going to listen to me, then I would call someone who would, and I dialed 911. The police arrived, made sure I was okay, then pulled my parents aside. The officer that spoke with them was incredible. He asked them if they knew what kind of impact this was having on me that I was willing to call the police. My parents broke down in tears and apologized profusely. The officer calmed them down, spoke with them a bit more, made sure I was okay and then left. They came into my room, hugged me and apologized. My mom stopped drinking any form of hard liquor from then on. She absolutely refuses to have the stuff in the house. My dad has since learned to better control his temper, but he does let it get to the best of him from time to time. Instead of blowing up, he leaves the situation, calms down, and returns in a better frame of mind.

brocolicookies,"Not my favorite thing to talk about but here it goes...

June 4th 2012 I got a call from my girlfriend at about midnight, I was asleep at the time but my dogs had woken me up to go outside at about 12:30, I see a missed call from her and a voice mail.  I checked it and all she said was ""you should come over, you should come over"".  I called her back, it was weird because it was her work phone and not her personal number.  After a few failed attempts I finally got ahold of her.  She was a mess, emotionally floored.  The only things I remember her saying was, ""i'm tired and I just can't do it anymore, i'm too tired"".  Finally, the conversation came to a point where I had to ask if she was going to hurt herself or someone else, between screams, and heavy breathing, she refused to answer it.  I finally gave her an ultimatum and said, ""I have to call the police if you don't answer me"".  She then said the last things I would ever hear from her, ""I'm sorry brocolicookies, I love you more than anything, but I just can't do this anymore"".  She then hung up and never answered again.  I knew she had some issues with suicide in her past but she had not had any episodes for quite a long time.  I then called 911, and here's where the story went from sad to excruciating.  I live in a town that's a bit behind the times... I talked to the 911 operator and told them everything and that police needed to be there asap, I told them she owned a gun(She was a small woman and the town was known for assaults).  They then began to tell me that they couldn't find the address, well actually, they couldn't find the street on their map.  They then began to tell me that she lived in another town and they were sending the state police out there.  I begged and pleaded with them to meet me somewhere and I could show them where she lived.  The operator refuted what I said and hung up.  I then called the state police, because they said that they sent state troopers out there.  I finally got through to someone and had to explain where the street was.  After about 3 hours after my initial call to 911 the police finally figured out where the street was.  I ended up having to be on the phone with the trooper and explain to him how to get there.  You'd think that it ends here.... but no.  I finally hung up and paced back and forth, sat at my computer and ended up falling asleep on my desk for about 3 hours.  The officer went in the house and found her cut up and barely breathing in her bath tub. *note* I did inform the officer that she owned a gun.  He went outside of the house to call for an ambulance.  After he goes back in, she had the gun to her chest.  After about 4 hours of negotiation, she chose to end her life on the morning of june 4th, 2012.  I ended up driving over there at about 6 because I couldn't get ahold of anybody.  I was then pulled aside for questioning and finally heard the words... ""We were unable to help her"".  The whole ordeal was one of the most painful things I have had to go through, and I feel like I handled it poorly.  Not a day goes by wishing that I just went over, not a single day.  

-tl;dr:  Girlfriend was suicidal, called 911 and they couldn't find the street she lived on, 3 hours later they found her barely alive but forgot there was a gun in the house.  Went outside to call for an ambulance.  She grabbed the gun when they called.  She ended up dying later after negotiations failed. 

-Thank you for the gold, and, thank you for all the supportive comments/pm's.  I hope this can bring people to take part in raising awareness of suicide prevention.   ",null,324,cdplz5k,1rport,AskReddit,top_day,1615

Arrabiata,"Story time!
This actually happened two days go. I live in a house with four other people. About a month ago we got a new housemate called Joaquin. For three weeks he was completely normal.

Then last week things started to get a bit weird. He would put really dark sunglasses on and stare at himself in the mirror for up to 20 minutes at a time. He would laugh to himself and ignore any questions we asked him. At around midnight he took his dinner and went to the bottom of the garden, still wearing his sunglasses. He also started taking knives from the kitchen and walking around the house with them and was in love with his pen knife.

A few days later he came in to my room and wouldn't leave, insisting that i had invited him in. After that I locked my door at all times.

The next morning I unlocked my door to go to the toilet for a maximum of thirty seconds. When I returned he was in my bed. I told him to get the fuck out of my room and he just said ""sorry, is it a problem?"". I told him obviously it was and repeated to get the fuck out of my room. (Yes, I have a foul mouth).

That evening my housemate Gabi and I were locked in my room when my other housemate Beth knocked on the door. When I went to open it Joaquin came sprinting up the stairs and shoved his foot between the door and the door frame. Again he refused to leave and if we said anything he would make eye contact for like thirty seconds. Fucking creepy! We kept trying to physically push him out but with his foot in the door we couldn't close it so I swung the door open and shoved him hard so he went reeling backwards.

That night he came outside my door and started saying ""Girls...you can't stay there forever, get out! Who do you think you are?! Jesus Christ? Well I killed him and I'll kill you too"".

I don't know why I didn't call the police there and then, I think we just didn't know what to do. We're young girls and hadn't really been in such a weird situation before.

We called the landlord and told him we wanted to speak about something so he told us to come over at 7PM. Except Joaquin came home at ten to seven and went straight to my room. Just laughing really loudly and being generally freaky. I called the landlord to pick us up and as soon as he came upstairs Joaquin went in to his room.

The landlord took us to the police station where they told us that they couldn't do anything unless we rang them when it was actually happening. (The police that attended us later told us that was complete bullshit and they could have arrested him).

So we went home to wait in my room like bait. Sure enough after half an hour he started slamming his body against my door trying to gain access. I rang the police and they came after fifteen minutes. In that time he was laughing manically, moaning behind the door and exhaling smoke from his joint through my key hole.

They arrested him and I've gone to stay with my parents for a while. The creepiest bit is that after they arrested him I came out of my room and he'd set up camp with multiple pillows, slippers, an ashtray and those weird ass sunglasses. Creepy as fuck.

Studentem,"This happened in the Netherlands.

On a cold January night I was waiting at the buss stop and saw a very drunk old man making his way along the canal walking next to his bike. It looked funny until all of a sudden the man was gone. Next thing I saw was a nearby guy dropping his bag and running down the bank, so I made my way over there fearing the man was lying in the water (This was late at night in early January, which meant he wouldn't last long). Turned out he rolled down the bank and had fallen into the water. He was too drunk to swim or even properly notice what was going on and just moving his arms around a bit. His clothes were completely soaked and he was also quite fat, all of which pulled him down and his drunk movements only caused the top of his bald head to pop above the water every now and then. By now there were 4 of us, and one guy managed to grab a hold of the old man. With all our might we tried pulling him out of the water along the steep bank of the canal (old fat men in soaked winter clothes weigh quite a bit). After me slipping, which almost caused the five of us to fall into the canal, we managed to drag him all the way up back to the road. At this point I figured it'd be best if this guy went to the hospital, though he was determined to go home, though fortunately too drunk for that. So, that's when I called 112 (which is the Dutch equivalent of 911) and the guy was picked up by an ambulance after being laughed at by the police who also showed up (they were clearly bored and happy to have something to do on their nightly patrol).

I'm not expecting anyone at this time and everyone in my family was already asleep.  I turn on the porchlight to check who it was.  It was a lady of maybe 30 that I've never seen before. 

 She's ringing the doorbell excitedly.  She's clearly distraught.  I ask her who she is and what is going on.  She tells me that her boyfriend was drunk and abused her.  She's babbling through tears about how her boyfriend is after her and pleads for me to let her in because my house was the only one with lights on. 

 I cautiously open the door and let her in.  I call 911 and explain the situation.  As I'm talking to the dispatcher, she sits on my couch crying.  The dispatcher informs me that she's sending a patrol car over.  I casually chat with the woman on the couch as we wait for the cops to come.  She asks me about the game I'm playing.  So I try to explain starcraft to her.  She doesn't understand, but at least she stopped crying.  

A policeman knocks on the door shortly after.  I explain to him what happened and let him talk to the woman.  She points out the house she lives in and where her boyfriend was.

punkwalrus,"First time, 1987: discovered my mother's body after her suicide.  They were very nice, and I was surprised the ambulance arrived in 3-4 minutes.  It was pretty obvious she was dead, and the EMTs were kind but obviously awkward I was the only person in the house, and a teenager.  Police were called, and I had top handle the whole investigation because my dad was away on business and the only people who knew where he was staying was his work (closed because it was a weekend), and my mom who was dead.  That was a circus and a half, and part of the police duty was keeping neighbors from just wandering into the house to see what the deal was.  One of my worst memories of my life.

Second time, 1989: customer in my store ran up to me and said there was an unconscious woman in front of my romance section.  Assumed it was a figurative joke for about 10 seconds before the customer became agitated that he was being literal and not making it up.  I went up into my ""tower"" (my store had a place in it where I could see most of the store from above), saw an unconscious woman with a few customers around her, and called.  Despite taking maybe 3 minutes, she came to before the EMTs got there, and refused treatment to them when they tried to get her to get on the stretcher, saying she just had the flu or something.

Third time, 2001: My wife fell down a flight of concrete stairs in front of our house while packing the car for a road trip.  EMTs took 20 minutes to get to my house, despite the fact the local hospital, fire station, and police station are less than a mile from our house.  They arrived just as I started calling a second time.  Broke her left ankle, sprained her right, road trip canceled.  She still has a metal plate in her leg to this day.

He went on the highway ramp, sped up and was normal for a bit, before weaving dangerously out of his lane a few times and then snapping back when someone honked him.  We called OnStar (which I am not sure is 911), and reported him.  In mid-call, giving our position and his car make, model, and plate number, he must have passed out and swerved off the road, hitting a tree at maybe 40-50mph.  His sports car crumpled like tin foil and flew apart (it's amazing how flimsy car bodies are), and the main body rolled down a steep hill out of sight.

Saturday Night Live has some cute jokes, I especially liked the Stephan character.  But all of those shows I didn't watch regularly.  Although I am seeing Seinfeld doing standup in a couple weeks.

Perhaps a defining catalyst was American Pie, a film that aimed to get laughs not by demonstrating wit or cleverness, but by shocking gratuity.  At this point, the downward slope of American comedy had finally found its core audience - dumb male teenagers.

British comedy, on the other hand, is still for adults.  It prides itself on knowledge of the world, an appreciation of the absurd and the simple pleasures of a pun.  A panel show like IQ or Nine out of Ten Cats would never work in America because its subject matter is too refined.  Monty Python is the gold standard of all things funny and American comedy has given up any attempt to meet or exceed that standard.

But my friends take one look at them and just see the big ridiculous SPESS MAREEN covers and just crack jokes about lame and silly and over the top they must be.

There was another instance where I picked up a book that had a female protagonist on the cover, and she looks over and my friend says ""wait, that's not a big refrigerator man, that actually looks like a real character.""

It just grinds my nerves because yeah, I know it's a universe based on a tabletop game, but it's actually a really rich lore and I enjoy it. But whenever I try to explain its not just over-the-top silliness they just kinda blow me off as a fanboy.

EpsilonSigma,"Not knowing about death. I remember vividly the day I lost my innocence. Before that day I was careless and without responsibility as is any other child. My only grandparent I knew died when I was 6 from lung cancer. That day when my mother picked me up from my babysitters, she turns to me to let me know that nana passed away. I just put my head down to show I was sad, but on the inside I didn't really care. I just wanted to get home and watch tv. I loved my grandmother of course but I didn't really understand what had happened, but one day, I did. I was laying in bed, trying to go to sleep at around 8-9 years old. Our house is next to some train tracks, so you can always hear when one goes by. It's about 11:00, I'm laying there, and a train goes by. Not much out of the ordinary, so I just ignore it. Trains go by all the time. 

But there was something about this one time. Was it the darkness? The silence? The fact that my mind was empty and had room to wander? Whatever the case, a thought manifested. A simple thought.

What if that train just derailed and crashed into our house, killing me?

It didn't have a huge impact at first, but as the minutes went by, I thought more and more about it. If that train derailed right now, and crashed into this house, I'd die. I wouldn't come back. Everything would go black and I wouldn't exist anymore. The next 20 minutes consisted of laying in my bed on the verge of tears until I couldn't take it anymore. I got up and went to my parents room. They were still up, watching TV. I stood in the doorway, with my blanket, tears streaming down my face. My mother asked my what was wrong and I just broke down. I ran over to her and jumped in her arms and cried. **Hard**. She my mother asked what was wrong. I just looked up at her, sobbing harder than I ever had up to that point, and said ""I know I'm going to have to die someday, and there is nothing I can do about it."" She realized what had just happened, told my father, and I just laid there, sobbing for a good 20 more minutes. By the end, I had calmed down, I got up, and my mother tucked me back into bed.

From that day on, I was a different person.

**TL;DR - Laying in bed when a train goes by. Realize if it crashed into my house I would die and never come back. 20 minutes of hardcore crying.**",null,12,cdpmj31,1rpqi4,AskReddit,top_day,72

Ya I know I could volunteer but getting paid and having an income is nice even if I don't necessarily need it. I would probably not work as much as I will IRL though.

I don't need a million dollars. A few hundred k + whatever income I'll still make working is plenty to maintain a middle class lifestyle and feed my geeky hobbies without ever having to really worry about money again as long as I have enough self control to not go nuts.

To all the people saying how they don't mind losing a year or two of being senile/dying of cancer/etc..., I don't know about you but going by my grandparents 3 out of 4 were pretty happy with their old age lives all the way through for one (died of sudden heart failure), until the last few months for two, and only one has been suffering for a while although I don't know if I would really call it suffering because she has extremely bad dementia but still seems to be in a good mood most of the time. And if you're a young adult now living in the US I think with the advances in medicine and society by the time you reach old age we'll have gotten significantly better at improving the quality of life for someone near the end of theirs.

Although communist regimes have been associated with violence, violence and death are not necessarily built into the political theory. 

Nazism is a very specific socio-political ideology that blends authoritarianism / militarism, nationalism, and racism to create very distinct in-group / out-group dynamics in a society. It has only been tested on a large scale once, and the result of that was the Holocaust. The dehumanization of anyone different from the core group of believers is built in to the ideology; which pretty much guarantees some form of violence will result when this kind of mindset meets with a differing opinion.

Same with hiccups. If your mind is focused on something else, they disappear. So, I thought to myself: I will help this girl. It's gonna be painful for a while, but it will all end good. So I started dissing her in the most obnoxious way possible: ""Here we are, nicely dressed and groomed for a special night and all you can think of is your own problems. It disgusts me. It's people like you that is wrong with society today. Me, myself and I, just talking about, thinking about, caring about yourself..."" I went on a rant for a good three minutes.

And, in real life, you try to make sure that nobody knows you have big money or has any reason to suspect it.  

Those wealthy people who are ostentatious are generally struggling and suffering mentally and emotionally and are quite discontented.  That's precisely why they're still constantly chasing amusements, showing off, seeking fame and reputation, and otherwise out there everywhere -- they need distractions from themselves and their own disturbed minds and, feeling nothing but whirlpools of misery within themselves, they desperately seek external affirmations of their self- worth.  Don't be fooled when you see their ""exciting and happy and adventurous"" lives -- especially when they're blasting every detail out to the world on Facebook and Instagram.

Nine-Foot-Banana,"I've been down to the states half a dozen times or thereabouts and every time I have a great trip, meet some really cool people and come home happy, however, every trip, there's something that happens that ruins a day.  

Last time, I saw Black Sabbath at the Gorge as well as a little road trip with my wife before we got pregnant.  We met a bunch of people at the show who shared their food and booze, we exchanged email addresses and hosted one of the guys on a trip up to Canada.  Then, in Seattle, there was a super rude asshole at a coffee shop who told me that he was allowed to cut in front of me in line because he was American and I was a guest in his country.  

Before that, we went to Vegas for a wedding, stayed in a great hotel, saw some shows and had lots of fun.  But someone tried to mug me.  

The time before, we were in Denver and met Jarome Iginla in the airport.  Then in the bookstore on the way to the plane, I was accused of stealing and referred to as ""Arab"" despite being Samoan and having a New Zealand accent.  

Back in '04, I was working at Summer camp in NC, had some great campers, made some lifelong friendships and learned a lot about myself.  But I got told by three inbred hicks that my friends, all American, and I should go back to our own countries then got involved in a bar fight.

I would never end this friendship (or any friendship) because anyone felt unjustifiably insecure about it.  

By the same token, I have never had any problem with women I date maintaining a positive or close relationship with any ex.  My preference is that they had a great and happy relationship when they were together and that they remain close friends.  I see many people who seem to prefer that their current partner had absolutely horrible past relationships and that hatred, bitterness, or at least indifference and distance remain.

Infinite_Ambiguity,"Throughout Europe in the 1500s, people used to haul buckets for miles to get and retrieve fresh water. This was a principal daily task -- requiring huge amounts of physical labor -- for many medieval and Renaissance Europeans.  And then they began constructing piping systems that eliminated the need for anyone to do this water hauling.  

To see how this worked during a time when the transition from water hauling to piping was in progress, read Montaigne's travel journals, which are absolutely fascinating.  Water is obviously essential, but we forget that everyone -- even the wealthiest kings and aristocrats -- struggled to find and keep water resources, and, once some of them figured out pipes and fountains, it was considered an amazing luxury and brought endless entertainment to those who viewed the fountains.

sts86,"I was years late to the party, but I finally gave in thinking it might be useful. I had hoped it would be something like reddit, except with people I knew. It's actually just a lot of vague whining, misinformed soapbox rants, and pictures of mundane shit. Also, old, bottom of the barrel memes. Basically nobody ever posted anything that was interesting to me, and nobody seemed to be interested in the stuff I posted. I'm sure it's useful if you want to keep up with when your friend's children's birthdays are and things of that sort. But I don't care about the details of people's lives. So it was kind of frustrating to see it used in such a lame way and after too many daily facepalms I decided I'd rather not see any of it and go back to my blissful cocooned ignorance about the acquaintances in my life.

SirMixesAlot,"I strive to add value to my life. I want to spend my time on enriching myself with things that interest me.  I  believe in self improvement.  I realized that facebook did none of these things. 

It became a boring time sink which glorified narcissism and banality. I genuinely do not care what you had for dinner with strangers. I'm not interested in how many parties you went to on Halloween.  I prefer not to know how warm your winter coat is. Glorifying the minutia of mediocrity washes the real mysteries of life away in a deluge of unoriginality.  I do not want to witness the broadcast of your weakness. 

I found that facebook made me dumber. It dulled my senses and awareness of the present. It made me dislike people I found tolerable to be around in real life, due to their soapbox of mental diarrhea.  It just reinforced my belief that we are losing our humanity and ability to behave amiably in the presence of others.  How long has it been since you were in a room full of people who actually were present in spirit, and not with their eyes glued to some device? 

So there are times in life when you should ask yourself if you are going to be part of a problem or part of it's solution.

MilesGayvis,"* The main features of Facebook are impersonal.

Things like wallposts, pictures, etc are shared en masse between tons of people. The fact that it's public leaves it very impersonal to me. The only other feature left is the chat function, which I have on my phone and computer in a lot of different ways. If someone wants to talk to me, they'll talk to me. The rest is noise.


* I already talk to my friends regularly. The rest are acquaintances.

I'm not interested in maintaining surface-level relationships with people. That feels really shallow and gross.

* I felt uncomfortable talking about myself in front of an invisible audience. 

It felt gross, conceited, and ultimately kind of empty. I wasn't adding anything to the conversation other than how my day went or what I was up to. That's something that even *I* struggle to care about.


* Ultimately, I was giving ad revenue to a company that provided a service I rarely used and didn't like that much.

AlsoTheyReallyDo,"In college, my neighbor lived with his girlfriend and they were pretty wild party people. One day there was a really cute blonde over there and I was invited over to hang out and all. It was pretty cool. That Friday the girl was over again and I was invited to go out to the club with them. Afterwards, we all took a taxi home and were drunkenly hanging out in their living room. The guy and his girlfriend disappeared and soonafter we heard loud sex noises, moaning, headboard slamming against wall, etc. The blonde and I laughed about it and she put her hand on my leg and said ""They sound like they're having fun...I'm jealous"".

I nervously took her hand off my leg and said yea it was weird and I should probably get to bed, anyway.

So, I live literally right next door but she gets up and asks if she can walk me home and I was like ""sure"" and then she follows me in and is sitting on my bed undressing while I brush my teeth, etc. She is in her bra and panties laying on my bed -- it's a twin-size (small) bed so I climb over her and squish myself against the wall and fall asleep.

Even drunk, I don't know what the fuck I was or wasn't thinking. Could I have been THAT drunk, tired, and oblivious? The thing is that the girl was pretty damn cute AND hot but I wasn't dating her and she was a friend so I somehow didn't process all of the obvious signals. I remember having a pretty bad hangover the next morning and driving her back to her place and as she was getting out she sorta grabbed my head and pulled me in for a kiss on the cheek and told me I was a nice guy.

I did find out later that she was quite promiscuous so she was probably just hoping for another notch on her headboard but goddamn did I miss out. I tell myself she probably had an STD to make it seem like I dodged a bullet instead of just a wild night of hot sex. I still have a picture of all four of us at the club/bar that night.",null,5,cdpo6tn,1rpufd,AskReddit,top_day,20

LovetoGoRound,"TL;DR Was in a long distance relationship and convinced myself that when he came back/sex would make magic would happen. I noped the hell out of there at the last possible moment. 




A few months before he came back he started to stop communicating with me. Our Skype's were him playing video games and answering my conversations attempts with one word answers or nods...""So it's okay"" I thought, ""when we see each other, it will be great."" 


Then it started to weigh on me. I was sending him care packages, letters, doing strip/shower teases, texting/calling/Skyping him first, no effort on his side. I talked to him and asked if he could send me a letter. He said no. He didn't have the money. I thought that was werid...he was living with his aunt a few states away... ""It's all good."" I thought, ""I suppose I understand,""


A little bit more times goes by and I talk to him about it again. I told him I wasn't happy. He wasn't doing anything for me, no texts no calls, no letters, wouldn't let me get to know his aunt or cousins. ( By now I had given up on our Skype conversations, it was now just two hours of silence everyday.) and I was feeling like I was single and showing affection to a stranger. He told me I was being selfish, that I knew how he felt. ""No problem."" I thought, ""I am being selfish. Just wait.""


About a month before he came back I was at my wits end. I was so done I had his stuff already packed. I told him I wasn't happy again. I was sorry, but wanted it to end. He yelled at me through text and Skype for hours. He told me if I had a problem, I should've talked to him about it. That I was just 'giving up' on our relationship/not trying hard enough. That I didn't love him. He asked who the other guy was, he said he 'knew' I was cheating. ""I'm overreacting,"" I thought. ""I wasn't trying enough. When he comes up it will be magical"" We agreed to go on a break until he came back.


During that month, I felt so relaxed. I thought it was just because I was working myself up. When he came back...I felt nothing.At all. I thought, ""It would come back. Just wait."" Then when I was on my back, naked, I looked up at him. He wasn't even wearing a condom. He had said he didn't want it the first time and that it didn't matter, we were going to be together forever. 


Then it snapped into place in my mind. That he wasn't wearing a condom. That I didn't want to risk having a kid with him. That he wasn't showing any affection until he got to touch me physically. That he wouldn't listen to me. That I wasn't in love with him anymore, etc..... All the common sense I should have had before was overwhelming.

Later learned that everyone around told her how stupid she was and asked her why she would want to fuck an ugly piece of shit loser like me.  I think that this was another situation where my stopping it prevented someone from really fucking up their life.

Two opportunities in 30 years is not great, but it could possibly be worse.  The real problem is that ugly people do not like other ugly people.

FVPlant,"I moved in with this girl I met at a coffee shop, we were both looking for a roommate at the time. I went through the usual questions and hung out with her a few times before moving in. I should have known something was up when she assumed we were moving in the moment we brought up the idea. Looking back on it she was really forceful about us living together. She said she hated a dirty house, didnt party, didnt drink, blah blah and all that. On paper she sounded great. (Im a college student and she has been out of highschool for a few years but decided on an assistant manager job at arbys) Every night she would party and drink with lots of people till 6 am. The house was always trashed! Like her clothes and underwear spread about the living room, tons of actual trash and food wrappers scattered around the house. Her room had about 2 feet of clothes and garbage. She NEVER cleaned and the bathroom looked atrocious when she got done with it. She fucked this guy all over the place, leaving me locked out of the bathroom and even apartment for hours at a time. Once, at 3 am, she burst into my room because she wanted to introduce me to the people she met in the parking lot of a bar! after a few months of this (and my grades suffering from lack of sleep and study time) I pleaded with my landlords, showed them pictures, invited them over, and got my friends to verify that this chick was a nightmare. I was willing to rent a one bedroom from them (they said I couldnt afford it though....). When she caught wind that I was trying to move out she started getting really bitchy. Telling the landlords I was breaking things, preventing her from eating by destroying the stove (I took the top off to clean it), and then full on attacked me one night. The cops where called.

Fast forward a year, Im living with 2 new people after having got away from that psycho after she attacked me. My 2 roommates are getting ready to move out forcing me to either find a new roommate or leave as well. So I chose to leave. My ,previously nice, landlords refuse to send me my deposite for 4 months. I FINALLy get it back and notice that 60% of it is missing. They claimed I had DESTROYED the apartment.

leak_proof,"I was about 10 years old. Father died suddenly  a few years before, which was a trigger for an older brother's schizophrenia. One day, our mother was working, he had a troubling episode. He decided to to kill us. Me with his hands, and then him with a knife. I struggled to to get away. He kept swinging with his hands, then the knife. Fuck, the soulless anger in his eyes is what will be forever burned into my mind. I finally get a bit of an upper hand when I started to swing a bat. I was able to get him out of the house until the cops could show up.  After they nearly kill him in the struggle they take him away. I remember a chaotic scene that felt like it took an eternity to play out, but was more startled by hoe quickly all that chaos descended into silence, then into me crying in the kitchen, alone, for while. After are bit I realized, well I don't remember what I realized. I stopped crying and just got up. Cleaned the house up a little. Then walked over to a friend's house. We played some video games (atari 2600 and pitfall for those in r/gaming) and I listened to him complain about the KD his mom made not being cheesy enough.  I lost faith that day. Faith in a lot of things.

EDIT: Grammar and spelling.

EDIT 2: AFTERMATH: My mother never really knew what went on that day, as I never really told her. She did well, and despite all that crap raised the rest of us, got us through university and one to our lives. My brother in the story ended up institutionalized after this and bounced in and out of hospitals, switched between his meds and heroin, he finally lost his battle with addiction either accidental or intentional a few years ago when they found him OD'd. I lost one brother to suicide a few years after the death of my father because he couldn't handle the switch from our great family life one day to schizophrenia fueled chaos the next. 

That day changed me but I seemed to have turn out relativity fine.  Finished university, found and married a great woman and have a chain of successful small business that keep me busy. No kids, too afraid to pass along the crazy gene but have a noisy house full of animals. I work hard, have someone that loves and am I wake up day a little happier than the last.

I was crushed. I decided to try and contact my father figure, who I hadn't seen in 8 years. Found out he had turned into a wife beating son of a bitch who I was better off without. After that, I tried to reach out to the people around me for some source of comfort, but no one cared. My friends were all too selfish and immature to even try to help, and my mom was emotionally unavailable and actually became very verbally abusive during that time. I remember sitting on a curb near my house at 3 am one summer night, realizing I had no one who really loved me and everyone had walked out on me even though I had done nothing to deserve it.

My high school guidance counselor (there was only one) was a complete fucking idiot, and actually told everyone not to bother with college because we ""couldn't afford it.""  He brought military recruiters on campus constantly, with the strong implication that that would be our only ticket out of town, but we never had (nor attended) ONE college fair.  Even the ""career fairs"" were an absolute joke -- I swear to God, the only people who showed up to those things were the local merchants, manicurists, etc.  No professionals whatsoever.

Thankfully, one of the teachers finally broke down and organized an assembly regarding financial aid.  We heard words like ""Pell grant"" and ""FAFSA"" for the first time in our lives.  We were absolutely stunned; it was all we talked about for weeks.  That was absolutely the reason that many of us went to college, and I will be forever grateful.

It was a warm summers evening, the sun was sizzling in the sky and roasting us in Biology. Our teacher was laid back and easy to manipulate, with our students, we made class fun. There was this young lass called 'Shannon' a red haired bitch with a moody attitude who spread certain false facts. It was time to put her down. My friend and I hatched a plan. I would distract her by throwing a eraser past her face whilst my fellow mate grabbed her bag.

Ready, set, grab... Now note this is last period and you can easily stay after school, so we had to be sneaky. Upon grabbing her bag we emptied all of its inventory around the room. Carefully hiding her iPhone, make up and multiple over nick naks. Then we placed her bag back and carried on with our work.

We then left Biology with her staying behind trying to find her stuff, I heard she stayed around an hour behind trying to search.

My group of friends and I were always mischievous and I, so I end this story saying ""Fuck you Shannon"" and that there will be more adventures of us soon to come.

My mother proceeded to yell at me about the state of my apartment and the dustbunnies she'd found while moving my stuff. I asked her why she was at my apartment and also why she was moving my things.

She was moving me back in. The homeowner had decided to sell the house and move literally days after I'd moved in, but had never bothered to tell me.  I looked around for my car keys in the hopes of intervening, but she snapped at me that she'd had my sister take it so they could carry all my things back in one trip with the two cars. While I was trying to wrap my head around what was happening, she proceeded to yell at me for not being there to help move my things.

That's right. She'd intentionally hidden from me that the owner of the room I was renting was about to move away, tricked me into ""visiting"" with no intention of letting me leave, taken my car while I slept, had snuck out to move all my things back in without my knowledge, and was now screaming at me for not being there to help.

My mom's eldest sister decided it was her turn to host this shit show (my mom has the most disorganized family on planet earth), and stick all of us, roughly 45 people, in her basement. My dad and I usually become wall flowers, watching what shenanigans happen, and a few did happen that night:

-My brother was forced to play Santa Clause by my aunt for her grand children. When he initially refused, she accused him of being the ruin of these children's Christmas, and she was **not** quiet about it. He eventually gave in which produced [this](http://i.imgur.com/5urwgkz.jpg) lovely photograph

-My cousin's wife (who is the size of a Cornish pixie) got profusely drunk and got into a very loud argument with my aunt because she wanted to hold a baby, while wasted, in five and a half inch heels.

There was more, both at that Christmas Eve as well as years past. I'm so happy no body wanted to host it this year, and we're all doing our own thing. Those people give me nothing but a migraine. ",null,3,cdpr30d,1rpwjq,AskReddit,top_day,14
De4con,"My dad picked me up on wednesday night after work to go to my aunt's house and have thanksgiving dinner a day early since we'd all be meeting at my grandparents' assisted living place for their excellent buffet. It was a really good night, my brother wasn't able to make it that night due to working, but we met up afterward and had a couple beers, my mom had one later when we came back to my parents' place. My dad did nothing but bitch and moan, then exploded at me the next morning since he was kept up past his bed time, and proceeded to throw a tantrum that made my mom refuse to come to thanksgiving lunch. My dad drove by himself, my brother and I brought the gifts my mom and I got the night before on the way home, and everyone enjoyed themselves.  My dad left a short while after the meal instead of staying as long as everyone else, my brother and I were still around and being family, and that was that. My mom's still pissed at my dad for how he treated my brother and I and how he totally fucked up a wonderful family thanksgiving because of his bitchy attitude and how he can't ever let anything go, and my brother and I grew closer with family after so long of us feeling and thinking that we were always on the outside of them because of our dad's relationship with his family.

**tl;dr** - Dad's an asshole, everyone's pissed at him for his bad attitude, the rest of the family gets closer since he opted out of it. The pre-thanksgiving dinner the night before was great, but the thanksgiving lunch the next day was also good even though my mom didn't show because my dad's an asshole.

My two cousins (let's call them Maria and June) each have kids. Maria has a son ""john"" who at that time was 2, maybe 3 years old. June has three kids that ranged from 7 to 13. One night our family got together and had dinner at my aunts house. June's middle son Ray was pouring soda for Maria's son in a cup. John moved the cup, soda spilled on the floor and started laughing. Ray got upset and screamed at him. Maria didn't take to kindly to that, told him to STFU and to pour him the soda. Ray started complaining and whining which angered Maria and she slapped him upside his head. June got upset and started arguing with Maria. 2 minutes later June goes into the kitchen and Maria sits on the couch. It seems the drama had passed when all of a sudden this plastic container with beans goes flying across the room and it strikes Maria. It. Was. On. Shit got real and they started hitting each other. It moved from the dining room to the kitchen back to the dining room. June's eldest daughter was hitting Maris from the back which prompted another female cousin of mine who was a year older to grab her and beat the living shit out of her.

We had taken a family photo with my best friend Marcus (the token black kid in my small town growing up) and right off the bat elderly Joyce says 

""Oh such a nice picture you sent me....except for that black spot""  followed immediately by ""I have some shotguns for sale, do you kids want to see them?""

She also kept asking my girlfriend at the time if she was cold and where was she from with the answer being Hawaii but Joyce was very suspicious.  Later realized Joyce thought she was being slutty by not wearing shoes/socks in the house.

Joyce also used to be a professional women's league pitcher and drives around in a massive pickup with a lift kit at the ripe age of 82.


Then we met Mom's cousin, massively obese pale sweaty guy I can't remember his name so I'll call him Andy.  I shook his hand and commented that he's a big S.O.B and he immediately overshared by saying ""My wife is 6'4"" and 500lbs"" with no further info provided (or needed)  and told us he's a prison guard qualified to carry everything from a 9mm pistol on up to an m16.  Then immediately told us he's suffering from severe depression and thinks about suicide a lot.....

Finally this other jolly fat man shows up, not quite clear his relation to my Mom but he shows up at 11am at Grandmas house with 3 dozen Krispy Kremes (only 8 people at this gathering) and 3 bottles of Port wine and starts enjoying both together.

Nothing is scarier than waking up one morning and realizing that you may never be able to move again. The fear sets in slowly as you start thinking about how long it will take before someone finds you. You become your own worst enemy with the constant stream of thoughts.

""Am I dieing?""

""Will I die of dehydration before someone finds me?""

""Will I ever be able to move again?""

Grn_blt_primo,"I was always way behind the other students in elementary school.  In fifth grade we had to take a math aptitude test and the results would determine if we were to be placed in the average, advanced, or ""special"" level the following year.  I took the test and just hoped that I wasn't going to be the only one in the special class.  The results came back and the teacher announced to the class that three of the 22 students would be going on to the advanced class.  The first, unsurprisingly, was the smartest girl in the class and the second was the teachers pet.  I had pretty much tuned out at this point and had moved on to turning my mechanical pencil into a rocket ship with some folded paper when I heard my name.  I was so surprised I thought I was in trouble.  Apparently I got the highest score in the class and I would be going in to the advanced class.  From that day on I had more confidence in my school work and my grades improved in other subjects as well.  I skipped another grade in math by high school and I was even took calculus from the local community college before graduating.  I went on to get a degree in electrical engineering and am now an engineer and enjoy the work the I do.

MeganAtWork,"A tornado hit my home town.  It was one of those really bad, destroyed a huge part of the town, end up on the news and the President visits type natural disaster.  

My mom was a nurse at a nursing home.  A police officer told our neighbor that the nursing home was destroyed and that everyone had died.  She came over and told us, which was fucking stupid, since our dad wasn't home and it was just my sister (9th grade), me (7th grade) and my brother (4th grade).  

She wasn't actually dead - in fact, no one at the nursing home died, though we didn't find that out for hours.  But it completely changed me because I realized that terrible things can happen to anyone.  I lost that sort of protective child bubble where you think nothing bad could really happen to you.  

The whole experience of the town cleaning up after the tornado, knowing some kids who had died, knowing people who had lost everything, would have been an important event no matter.

cornflakez,"Every day for 6 years I suffered from migraines, insomnia, heart palpitations, stomach pain, nausea, panic attacks, crippling depression, and a slowly degenerating spine.  The symptoms were all treated by individual doctors, none of which put together the full picture.  My primary diagnosis?  Bipolar disorder.

Eventually, my primary care doctor found a [benign tumor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_hyperparathyroidism) and related all of my symptoms to the condition.  It seemed impossible.  How could one tiny tumor cause so many issues?  At that point, I was on a high dose of anti-psychotic medications, sleeping up to 14 hours a day.  My life was a haze of naps and doctor's appointments.  I had given up on the possibility of a future that included graduating from a university or raising a family.  

The conversation with the pre-op nurse went like this:

Nurse: ""Have you ever been diagnosed with bipolar disorder or severe depression?""

Me: ""Yes, Bipolar disorder.""

Nurse: ""Mood swings?  Insomnia?  Severe depression?""

Me: ""Unfortunately""

Nurse: ""That will go away when the surgery is done.""

Me: &lt;long pause&gt; ""...What?  Really?""

Nurse: ""Yes, most people feel better in a few months.""

Me: ""Can you please say that one more time?""

 The woman was an elderly lady and had to take plenty of medications to keep her from getting ill. I had been walking my dog when I saw her down by the river walkway. She informed me that her room mate was acting oddly and that she needed her medications but did not want to go home alone. I went with her. The first thing I noticed were her room mates eyes when he opened the door, then the glass on the floor, and shortly after we were in the house that the walls were ripped wide open. 
 
 My dog whined and he kept us locked in that house for 4 hours, as he would casually take turns dragging a machete type knife across our throats. I was almost raped. I talked him into letting us leave. The Special Task force had to be used to remove him from the apartment after that. The house was trashed and she had no where to go. My mother is a lovely woman and insisted that we go with her. Both the old woman and myself moved into my family's home.

 The woman turned out to be not a kindly old woman but was a thief and an alcoholic. She stole thousands of dollars from my parents over the course of a year. Her son, who we had heard stories of, was released from prison and he ended up in our house. Turned out he had been incarcerated for murder. My sister became pregnant at 17 with HIS child, and then he got himself killed 6 months after my nephew was born in a confrontation during a drug deal. My sister was pregnant with her second child at the time. My sister is now a widow with 2 children.

MissFrizzel,"Ready for a long one reddit? Just a bit of back ground first to make sense of everything. 
 
Since the age of 8 I've been dealing with horrible depression. It runs pretty heavily in my genes so I just so happen to inherit it (yay for me). Anyways I have been on and off medication my whole life (I'm 21 now, female btw) and in about grade 9 it got to it's absolute worst. I couldn't get out of bed in the mornings, I basically stopped going to school. I had started self harming very young (10) and it just continued to get worse and worse.  

 I was hanging out with the wrong crowd and I basically didn't give a shit about anything and thought I was invincible. Anyways I happen to get in a fight at school with another girl when I was in grade 10 (I still cringe thinking about it) and her mother pressed charges against me. I should tell you that I come from a pretty good family but this little incident was too much for them to take. 
 
My siblings pretty much stopped talking to me all together, I was facing assault charges and I was failing in school and I had stopped all contact with my friends. I was in pretty rough shape, and I pretty much knew that I wouldn't be around much longer as suicide seemed like the only escape. 

If it weren't for my parents unconditional love and support I wouldn't have made it. I figured I was at a fork in the road and I could continue down the path of destruction or I can make a change. Thank God I decided to change. I found an antidepressant that worked for me (finally) and that pretty much kick started my brand new awesome life! I'm currently in uni and have an A average, my relationship with my siblings is wonderful and I am as happy as a clam! It still blows my mind to think that five years ago I was pretty much ready to leave this earth, and I didn't even know how beautiful life can be. 

That single fight changed the course of my life, and I am so thankful for that.

eodiv,"I've had several but the most recent happened just two days ago.  
  
I was married but ended up separating from my wife due to my own substance abuse issues (mainly alcohol). At one point during the separation, we didn't talk at all for a good 2 months.  During that time, I landed a great job, was able to buy a brand new car and was really turning things around.  Then one day, she called me and said she wanted to meet up.  So we met at an iHOP for breakfast.  It was August and she was wearing a hoodie, which I found odd.  After we sat down, she proceeded to tell me that she wanted to tell me about what she had been doing.  It turns out she had started using and became addicted to heroin.  One night, she overdosed and was found by a neighbor unconscious on the floor.  They called 911.  An ambulance and police came and the police searched her apartment, finding heroin and paraphernalia. After she was released from the hospital, she was taken to jail and charged.  Her parents, who were extremely well off, got her a good attorney and she pled out, getting only probation and an order to attend outpatient rehab.  
  
Needless to say, I was upset and disappointed about all of this.  We had done other substances together in the past but we had an agreement that cocaine and heroin were the two things we would never do because of how dangerous they are.  
  
About two months into her probation and rehab, she was tested randomly at rehab (I've been, they pick one person at random each session - which occur every other day, three times a week - and test them) and she pissed dirty for heroin.  She was taken back to jail, bonded out and went back to court.  Her lawyer negotiated a deal to keep her out of jail but requiring her to attend a 30 day inpatient rehab facility.  
 
During all of this, she (pressured by her parents) decided our marriage was irreparable, and we got divorced in January of 2012.  We still kept in touch though.  The rehab seemed to do her good at first but once she really got clean, about half way through it, she turned into a huge asshole.  She would call me or text me and say degrading things.  Eventually, she stopped and then I never heard from her again.  
  
Due to the divorce and my own mental health issues, I was struggling worse than ever with substance abuse.  I was drinking heavily every day and abusing Adderall and Klonopin.  Last June, under the influence of a lot of alcohol and Klonopin, I lost my balance and fell through a plate glass topped coffee table.  The glass shattered and a large piece lodged itself near my shoulder and, as I learned at the hospital, nicked my caroted artery.  I had to call 911 and was rushed to the hospital where I received 46 stitches and was told that if the glass had gone in a half an inch further up, I possibly would have bled to death.  Just the next month last July,  I was hospitalized after I began hearing things due to being up for 3 days straight on Adderall (amphetamine psychosis, basically) and probated for 9 days.  I had to attend a court hearing and basically convince a judge that I was capable of taking care of myself and living on my own.  I bullshitted my way through it and was released from the hospital, got on medication for bipolar disorder and began seeing a social worker/counselor twice a month.  I stayed clean for awhile and would text my ex to let her know how I was doing but never got any response.  It pissed me off.  
  
A few months ago I began drinking again, as well as abusing Adderall and Klonopin and smoking weed and I could see myself sinking fast.  A couple of weeks ago, after talking to my parents, I decided I needed help and checked myself into the emergency room, attempting to be admitted to the psych ward or referred to a rehab facility.  They refused to do either because I was drunk as hell and released me instead after keeping me for about 4 hours and giving me IV fluids to re-hydrate me.  When I got home, I texted my ex and told her that I was planning on checking myself into a rehab facility. Again, no response. I figured she would have been proud of me for doing the right thing.  
  
Two nights ago, I found out why she hadn't been responding.  
  
I looked her up on Facebook, as I knew she had an account but nothing came up for her name.  I found that strange.  So I Googled her name and the first result was an obituary. She died from a heroin overdose in her parents basement in October of last year.  Even though we were divorced, I never stopped loving her so I pretty much lost it and began crying.  
  
After regaining my composure, it hit me.  While I may not be doing heroin, the Adderall and Klonopin abuse could be just as dangerous.  I could take too many of one or a lethal combination of the two and die and since I live alone, no one would find me for days.  As much as I abuse them, I have been extremely lucky up until this point even though I've been put on a 72 hour hold in the hospital twice (the one I mentioned previously and prior to that in 2005) for overdosing on Adderall and flipping out.  
  
So I took both pill bottles into the bathroom and flushed the contents of them down the toilet.  Today, I called my doctor who has been prescribing them to me and admitted what I have been doing and asked him to stop prescribing them to me.  I have resolved to never drink or smoke weed ever again and I'm researching Narcotics Anonymous meetings that are close to my house and I will start attending them at least once a week.  
  
I'm absolutely heartbroken over my ex wife's death.  She was only 30 years old, had moved back in with her family and seemed like she was on a good road to recovery.  Part of me is mad that noone called and told me that she passed.  It would've been fine if they didn't want me at the funeral but a phone call would've been nice.  Yes, we were divorced but we were together for almost 11 years.  We started dating when she was 19.  I was a huge part of her life.  When I told my parents about this yesterday, they were shocked that noone called me.  Another part of me is upset because she had told me, when we met up for breakfast after she OD'ed, that she started doing heroin because I was doing so well at the time and she ""felt like she deserved to feel good too.""  In a roundabout way, blaming me.  I'm sure she shared that with her parents, who never liked me to begin with, so I wonder if they hold even more of a grudge against me in light of her death.  I thought for an hour straight earlier today about calling them but after talking to my dad, I have decided against it.  I'm not going to get anything out of it and it's only going to upset them and open up the wound I'm sure they have and probably still are working extremely hard to heal. I do know where she is buried though and this weekend I am going to go buy some flowers and place them on her grave with a little note so that anyone who comes to visit her will know I was there. 
  
I don't know what I'm going to do to cope with her death but I do know that I will never use drugs or alcohol again.  If she couldn't overcome her addiction and died as a result of it, I could just as easily suffer the same fate.  I realize this is going to be the hardest thing I've ever done.  I'm going to need support and I may slip up but  I don't want to die.  Despite my drug and alcohol abuse, life has been going really well for me lately.  The medication I take for Bipolar disorder is working well and it's basically in remission.  I don't get hyper manic like I used to.  I don't always think people are talking bad about me and I'm not constantly paranoid.  I've turned into a pretty friendly, outgoing, normal person.  On the surface, at least.  After being unemployed for over a year, I've landed a great new job that pays well and I enjoy and have started dating a cool, intelligent and beautiful girl.  In addition to not wanting to die, I don't want to risk losing any or all of those things just so I can get high.  
  
Drugs and alcohol have cost me a $50,000 a year job, my aforementioned new car, almost all of my friends, my marriage and have landed me in the hospital numerous times.  Yet I basically flipped fate a big ol' middle finger and kept at it.  Now that I know drugs have taken the person that I was closer to than anyone ever in my life, my eyes have finally been opened. I'm **done**.  I wish I would've known sooner and had this eye opening experience a year ago but, despite the sadness I'm feeling right now, I'm filled with the hope of having a happy, healthy and substance free future.

His douchebaggery shaped me into exactly the person I want to be, and showed me how not to be the type of person he is.

Drewsilver,"Probably taking acid was what changed my life forever. Pretty stereotypical, but it's true. Acid is much more than ""feeling funny"" and having visual distortions and hallucinations. It changes the way you think, and the entire trip you're incredibly introspective and analytical of everything around you. This depends on the person of course, but that was me. I was able to face down some worries and insecurities in my life honestly for the first time and acknowledge exactly what I was. For those against drugs, there is a broad difference between hallucinogenic drugs (LSD, shrooms, etc.) and those commonly abused for ""fun"" (opiates, meth, etc.). This is correlated to your reasons for experiencing the drug in the first place though. Do some research, find if something is right for you, and most of all be happy :)",null,4,cdpqmlc,1rpwpk,AskReddit,top_day,26
Trevastation,"June 21, 2011

I went to a day camp that occasionally went on field trips, and for the first week, we went to the beach. It was after the 7th grade, and I was struggling to make friends (only some years later til I learn I have Aspergers). For one reason or another, I had been in the sand, and someone shaped it to be like I was a turtle. Details hazy. Over above me, there was a girl taking pictures. She had the most beautiful body and golden blonde hair, with eyes as grey as a valiant knight's armor. She also has the most adorable laugh and smile that would make your heart melt. I asked her for her name. I had never asked a girl for her name before (still haven't after her). Her name was Ally, short for Allyson. I swear I heard that name for the first time that day, even though it was the name of my neighbor's cat. He hung out that day, and many days after that during the summer. I spent some of the best days of my life that summer, and the summer after that. We never had time during school because she went to a private school and I went to a public school. For the first time, I felt like some girl understood me, was weird like me, yet wanted to be my friend. Never in my life had I had a female friend. She became my best friend and one of my only friends. But, I started to fall in love with her...

I ruined our friendship and maybe a possible relationship. She's dating a girl and I never felt so alone in my life (especially with me mom, who really understood me, just died of Ovarian Cancer). I fucked it all up and she won't even talk to me (her GF doesn't want her talking to me either). I wish so much to just have a second chance. Just fix all the mistakes I made. She was different from all the other girls. I didn't look at her with lust to take her to bed. I saw beauty and magnificence in her. I saw a future. I saw a chance of not being afraid anymore. I remember that day because that day I met a girl. A girl who rocked my world, and I'll always treasure her. 

tl:dr Met an amazing girl. Sorry for wall of text

Apple devices are generally on the expensive side, whereas Android devices usually come cheaper.

Apple devices are basically unrepairable, most (not all) Androids are to a certain degree repairable.

If you want to code, Android is easy, free, and all it needs to start is any PC, MAC, or Linux machine. iPhone coding requires a Mac and a (don't know how expensive) commercial IDE.

And he would only roll gi-fucking-gantic cigar sized blunts and he would do it using pipe tobacco with bits of hash interspersed throughout. Either that or he would roll all our pot at once and you'd have nothing to smoke later. So one night he rolls all my pot and we get unnecessarily high and go pick up our other friend from work who was fed up and all he wanted to do was relax and get stoned but we had no more pot and he was desperate so he starts rolling nasty, nasty, filthy disgusting pipe tobacco roaches from the ashtray into a big, sticky, smelly joint and smoked it. He nearly threw up, but he was determined. He was quiet and sort of green for 20 minutes in the back seat, and then he goes ""that was a mistake, I am really, really high."" then kept repeating ""wow I am really high"" in a calm, matter-of-fact tone once ever 5-10 minutes for like 2 hours. he had a great night",null,0,cdprqzg,1rpxpc,AskReddit,top_day,1

HayricanSAMA,"Oh I got a nice one for this. Or sad one..
I'm from Germany and in summer 2013 I was in England for two weeks. It was kind of a language course and there were about 60 other students in my age. Two weeks passed and I had a lot of fun meeting people, living at a host family and doing stuff with my frined who had come with me.
On our last evening, when there was almost no time to meet the others, because early in the morning we had to return, the whole group ate pizza at a restaurant. I sat there with my friend and all of the sudden a girl I haven't seen before sat down on the other side of the table.
We had one of the most magical and enthusiastic conversations EVER. It was amazing. I've never before felt such a deep and strong connection to anyone. We were definitely meant for each other.
Unfortunately we were seperated, because when we had to go back to Germany, I got to know she lives in the south and I rather in the north. 
I'm so glad I asked her for her number, usually I am not the guy to make such a optimistic move when getting someone to know.
We chatted since then everyday on Whatsapp and it is still amazing, because she felt the same way I did in that restaurant: our conversation was absolutely fantastic and we soon fell in love with each other. There are like 500km between us and we didn't have the chance to meet each other yet, but we will.
And as soon as I can finally hug and feel her, this story will be complete.",null,20,cdpobib,1rpyj1,AskReddit,top_day,115
OlivesRose,"I started talking to this guy on facebook, he was blunt, opinionated, and from what I could tell a genius. He intrigued the fuck out of me on an intellectual level and we started talking. Mostly joking and insulting eachother. Eventually I got comfortable with him and I'd vent to him, even though I was sure it only bothered him. It didn't. 

One particularly bad day, I wasn't really in the mood to talk to anyone, and I made it known. He told me that he didn't count when I didn't want to talk to anyone, and he ended up giving me his phone number so I could text him about it. I did. I stayed up all night texting him. He kind of became the only person I went to to talk about things, but at that point we weren't interested in eachother romantically. He was pursuing a different girl kind of quietly but I ended up catching on after a couple months.

Now I have to take a second to say, we were totally opposite people. He smoked, drank, partied, and generally didn't give a single fuck. And I went to church every Sunday, got straight A's, and had never gotten drunk. It sort of bothered me that he was into those things, but I'm also not the type of person that will tell you how to live. And like I said, he intrigued the fuck out of me.

One night, he called me. I thought it was on accident because it was late at night and well, he'd never called me before. I answered hesitantly and sure enough he called on purpose. We talked for about 5 hours that night. He was so interesting to me, and from then on we talked on the phone quite a bit, often for hours at a time.

Anyway, the girl he had been pursuing ended up changing her mind. It broke his heart, and I remember him telling me that I was the only girl he didn't hate now. At the time I didn't know what he meant. By this time, I cared about him more than he knew. This is where it get's scary. I almost lost him before anything began. He almost ran away, he stole a truck and made it to the border of our state and then decided to turn back. He later told me, he came back because of me. He didn't tell me this even happened until a while after it did. I remember a little while after he told me, he went camping in a part of our state that is essentially wilderness. There was no cell service and he didn't answer me for 4 days. By the 4th day, I thought he left. It scared the shit out of me. We weren't even dating at that point.

Fast forward a little and we started actually hanging out. It was kind of an unsaid date the first time we hung out. He walked all the way across town to meet me and we hung out at a park. He'd comment on how small my hands were just so he could compare hand sizes and almost hold my hands. I think he thought I was oblivious. I wasn't. 

We continued hanging out and everytime he would walk all the way across town. He'd say sweet things to me and we both knew where it was going. One day, we were sitting on a hill overlooking a feild at just about dusk and he put his arm around me. It was the time of year where your not quite used to the colder fall air. He was warm, and I was shivering. Half because of excitement, the other half cold. I remember it like it was yesterday. 

Then he officially ask me out. It was all so perfect. He'd call me every night before I fell asleep to say goodnight. Actually, he still does only now sometimes I'm asleep first. We'd write eachother letters, and he made me music. We'd lay on a blanket outside and look at stars, and we even danced under the moon. He'd sing Frank Sinatra to me when we go on walks. One time we met at the beach and it started pouring rain, I wanted to wait it out under a gazebo but he insisted we just walk back to his house. So we did. It was summer and the rain was warm enough to comfortably get soaked. We ran the couple blocks back, kicking water at eachother and laughing. I only wish I would have kissed him to make it more cliche. Nonethless, that day was wonderful. We've been together a little over a year now and I feel like my life is a romance novel. We of course have our fights, not everything is perfect. But I am incredibly greatful for the memories I have shared with this man. He means the world to me.

TL; DR I got carried away. Literally and figuratively.

Gettin_Hooked,"Time for another addition of ""Super Gay^^*literally* Story Time"":


I fell in love with my female best friend when I was 14 years old. It was confusing and given the fact that she was extremely religious, conservative and by all noticeable signs straight it was pretty much a bummer. I never told her I was gay let alone in love with her and it strained our relationship throughout the years. 

As most 15 year old girls are, she become pretty much awful throughout high school. Obsessed with social climbing and doing whatever was the status quo. We drifted apart and I had to painfully watch her date d bag after d bag for a few years. Eventually I came out and had a few relationships, in the long attempt to move on and forget about her. 

Toward the end of high school we rekindled our friendship and she apologized for letting peer pressure get the best of her. Right before graduation we got drunk and hooked up. It was about as amazing as I ever thought it could be. But afterward she freaked out and insisted we should talk or see each other especially next year(we ended up at the same college).

As much as it hurt I respected her decision and figured it would stick since she was going Greek which is essentially the college version of high school cliques. I had accepted this end until she called me one day a few months into freshman year saying she had to see me.

We met up and she instantly started sobbing, saying she couldn't do this anymore. That she'd always been in love with me and had tried so hard to just ignore it. She had no idea what this meant for her life or sexuality, but she knew she couldn't fight it any more.

It was a long long journey and it hasn't ever been easy but we're now out to friends and my family. Going strong for over a year now. I still can't believe it when I wake up next to the love of my life who I thought would never be mine. There were a thousand times when all reason and sense told me to give up on it forever, but sometimes the heart knows best. 

**TL;DR: After many years my first lesbian crush turned into the happiest relationship of my life.**

AlysDutton,"In the first few weeks of my current relationship I wrote Boyfriend a letter from Mars--I was bored in class and constructed this alternate life we were living as a long-distance relationship while I researched on Mars in a colony of scientists. I threw up some touches that I thought would amuse him (like, ""How was Better Call Saul season 6? The finale was such a cliffhanger!"") and he was delighted. Anyway, two weeks later he presented me with a copy of The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury. Inside was a return letter and the whole book was annotated with his thoughts and expressions of affection (for me and for Bradbury). 

I hadn't told him just how important Bradbury was to me (I'd mentioned him in passing but not expressed that he was my favorite author) and had never brought up my love of personally marked books.

mantarey5500,"We meet at at a gender-bending party.  I think, ""damn, that dude looks good in a dress!""  So I go over and over to him.  Turns out he is a really cool geeky person like me!

Fast-forward a couple weeks.  We've been talking every day, and we get along really well.  We go to Quizno's for our first date, and he's wearing socks and mandals.  I take this as a sign that he's a comfortable, casual person, and I like him a lot for it.

Our second date is at my place.  We stay up talking long enough for my roomie to go to a party, come back, get high, and eat two bags of oatmeal cookies.  At 3 AM he leaves without kissing me.  I get a text later that says ""Sorry I didn't kiss you.  I'm always really nervous the first time.""  This is coming from a 23-year-old man.  I decide that he's the most adorable man I've ever met.

Our third date is at his place, and we watch ""The Thing"".  We kiss for the first time, and I find out that he's a damn good kisser too!

Fast-forward a month or two.  I stay over at his apartment for the first time.  My friend attempted suicide that morning, and I've been having an awful time.  We snuggle all night.

Fast-forward another few months.  We've been staying over at one another's places for a while, but no sex.  We're not abstaining for any reason, we just haven't felt like it I guess.  One morning I wake up and see his face caught in the sunlight that's slanting through the curtains and think ""This is the most beautiful person I have ever met"" followed promptly by ""Oh shit"" because I realize that I have feelings for him, even though we're supposed to be just casually dating.  I proceed to squash down those feelings.

Fast-forward another few weeks.  We split up over the winter holiday because we'll be long distance and supposedly neither of us is invested in the relationship.

Fast-forward another two months.  I go over to his apartment to play games and hang out.  A couple hours later, we go into his bedroom and sit down on the bed.  I tell him that I want to start dating again.  He gets all flustered and says he doesn't know if that's a good idea.  I convince him that there's no harm because I think he's awesome and I liked when we were dating casually.  He finally agrees.

Fast-forward to the next morning.  I find out why he thought it wasn't a good idea.  He wakes up, looks me right in the eyes and says in the cutest, happiest voice ever ""mantarey5500, I love you, and I don't want to just be casual anymore.""

freedomsong85,"You want a love story? Um... Okay. Let's see. Oh yeah! Okay, so um.. yeah, here we go..

Met my husband back in high school. We were friends. He married one of my best friends. We had a series of party houses with semi-regular room mates. Basically, lived together (including his wife/my bff? and others)off and on for years. She cheats. They have a crappy divorce. I was right there for him. I am still best friends with him at the end of it. 

We continue living together with friends for a couple of years. One day I am just sitting around looking at him and realize I have a HUGE crush on him. (I'm talking one of those scramble to the journal and freak out moments.) Since we were best friends, I decided that going for it was a terrible idea that would end our friendship and destroy the house dynamics. My world is crumbling. So, I set him up with a girl I know. Logical solution? (IDK) Obviously that doesn't work out. 

Then, the worst luck ever has to strike. He and I wind up going after the same girl. (Crazy confusing, I know.) That doesn't work out for either of us. So, I start dating a guy and we hit it off.
 
Future hubby finds out and his world comes crashing down now too. 
He starts going after me HARD. I soon find myself in a bad break up. Presto! 

Future hubby and I start talking about our feelings. I was VERY resistant to the idea. (To the extent that we sat down and had several very long talks about it.) I never saw myself with someone like him, I didn't think he could handle the kind of relationship I needed, and I couldn't see our relationship change going well. Basically, my answer was a cautiously stern NO!

Little did I know that he was a man who had finely crafted the 'Wear them down' approach to love and war. Through a series wide of romantic gestures, like ninja kisses, he slowly won me over. It was a week or two before I realized we had already transitioned from best friends to boy/girlfriend. Surprisingly it worked. VERY well.

I have never been good with relationships. Honestly, the fact that we were friends for a decade before anything happened was probably the only reason we lasted the first year. 

We dated for a year, were engaged for another year, and have been married for four years now. We were inseparable as friends. (As in if someone either of us dated wouldn't deal with our close friendship and constant presence in each others lives, the relationship was over. In hindsight, that was probably a BIG clue.) I can't imagine my life without him.

I always had a rule that I would never date my best friend. Friendship is important, and lasting friendships are more precious then you realize when you are younger. If it weren't for the series of insane events that brought us closer and closer together, we^never would have gotten married. 

Today, I would highly advise anyone considering letting a possible happy relationship pass them by *due to friendship* alone to feel it out and give it a try. 

It is not a 'normal' love story I suppose. It was chaos from the start. It was exactly what we needed. Finally saying YES to him was by far the best decision I have ever made. I am happy and we have an amazing child together. This really could not have turned out any better for us. ",null,4,cdpq94r,1rpyj1,AskReddit,top_day,14
Flubbing,"My girlfriend of 8 months (still a baby relationship, but still counts) started off as good friends. When we met, we were both freshman at a new college and both had semi serious long term relationships. We first met when I caught a closing elevator with my hand, and slithered in through the cracks of the doors. My first words were, ""Have you ever had that fear of being crushed by the elevator doors?"" Suave, I know, but she smiled and that was the last I saw her for the day. 

Over the next couple months, we built a friendship in a group among other friends. As a commuter to the college, I had a car with which I started giving her rides back home everyday. Overtime, we grew away from the group of friends and became close friends to one another. 

Separately, both of our relationships to our other significant others kind of  deteriorated from issues of distance, miscommunication, and differences that were no longer able to be abridged. Meanwhile, she and I became closer than ever and over time closer than our previous relationships. ",null,2,cdponan,1rpyj1,AskReddit,top_day,14
gobabygo11,"I'm sorry. :( My SO and I have been together nearly 7 years. We met in high school, but it wasn't until after he graduated (he's a year older) that I put it together that he was interested in me. 

In class, he would draw me silly cartoons of pirates, make me gifts and we would share cosmic brownies. He ate the icing, while I ate the brownie and the little sprinkles on top. We hung out outside of school a few times with friends, where he showed me that he learned how to play my favorite Christmas Song on the guitar and he borrowed a friends Nintendo Wii because he knew I wanted to play it when it first came out.

What did I do? I tried to find him a date for prom, talked him into going with this crazy exchange student and I was completely ignorant of his feelings for me while I was dating a guy that was manipulative, mean and controlling. 

After about a year of him trying to show me that he had feelings for me, it finally hit me. It gave me the strength to break up with my mean boyfriend and I showed up at my current SO's house on Valentine's Day with an origami rose.

master0jack,"A story from a patent I once had, from a WW2 concentration camp when it was liberated:

As a young girl in a concentration camp, she saw a teenaged boy lying face down on the other side of the fence, bleeding from the barbed wire. The camp was being evacuated and she was being forced out with a crowd, but she noticed that they were not trying to help this boy lying in the mud. At 5 years old she REFUSED to leave without this boy and ran from soldier to soldier begging them to help him. She was ignored so she ran back to the fence and stayed with the boy, until she saw and flagged down the first truck she saw, not knowing if it was friend or foe. The people in the truck ended up saving the boy. 

Years after the war, she had settled in Toronto, and he was living in Poland and frantically trying to find out if she had survived when he came across people that had known him and remembered the girl from the camp. From this contact he found more people who had known her, and eventually figured out that she was living in Toronto. He made his way there and showed up at her house, and told her that she had saved his life and that he wanted to spend his making her the happiest woman alive.

RosalindSHH,"This will probably get buried because it's late in the game, I'm not great at articulating things or writing stories, and this is so god-damn long. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. But hopefully it might cheer you up? Or not. 

WARNING THIS IS REALLY LONG BECAUSE I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH BREVITY:

I was home from University for winter break. I had broken up with my SO over a year ago, just had the worst sex of my life with the first guy I had a hint of feelings for, and was not looking for a relationship.

I had never been in love and wasn't sure it existed. I didn't think I'd fall in love.  I had worked my whole life to get into a top university and now I was working to get into a good graduate school.  
Relationships were too time consuming.

My cousin/close friend and I are hanging out during winter break and she suggests we go see a movie at one of those dinner-and-a-movie movie theaters. After much debate, I reluctantly settle for the Hobbit. (It was a great movie, but I didn't think I would like it at the time).

I walk into the theater and in the enormous lounge/bar area I see a cute/handsome waiter. Completely out of my league.   (I'm pretty socially awkward and have never considered myself attractive, but my friends describe it  as ""ugly duckling syndrome."" Ugly in high school. Less shitty now).  I quickly look down when he lifts his head. We walk past him and I don't dare make eye contact. When I think it's safe, I turn around to get my last look at him.   We make eye contact because we both did a double take at the same time.  Oops.  (Now I know he was checking my ass out. How romantic.)

I head into the theater and we sit down for pre-previews.  Although my cousin is pushing me to talk about my past quarter, I'm raving about how hot that guy is to my cousin.  There are four people in the whole theater.   I see a waiter walk into the theater and squat down to take their order. As the waiter gets up I realize it's him.  He's coming towards us.  Oh shit. I should order something. I wasn't planning to.

He squats down near my legs. Focus. Focus. ""Hi. My name is _____can't hear over the panic in my head____ what would you like?"" After fumbling with the menu, I order peanut M&amp;M's.  He comes back with the order.  I want to see him again, I push the button, he returns so I order a Kit Kat bar.   Then I push the button again and order water-two cups.  I've spent $7 on overpriced candy.  Not good- I still have to buy presents.

And now I have to pee. I get up and as I walk out of the theater out of nowhere I hear, ""Can I help you?""
""OH MY GOD. Oh god. Sorry. You scared me.""

He laughs. 
""...um yeah no I'm good..just..."" [DON'T TELL HIM YOU HAVE TO PEE RosalindSHH] ""...out.""

At this point I realize my pants only have back pockets into which to place my hands uncomfortably. 

He replies, ""Oh ok. How's the movie?""

""It's good, it's good. Yeah.."" *silence* Say something. Anything. 

""You're wearing TWO sets of glasses!!!!""  

""What? Oh yeah, this is so I can watch the Monsters, inc. movie in 3D. I love those movies.""

""Me too! I really like pixar.""
We banter about pixar and some other stuff for a while and then the desire to pee becomes overwhelming. 

""Ok, well nice meeting you!"" 





In the bathroom, I decide I'll write my number on the receipt. He'll never call. That's going to be so embarrassing.  Worth a shot. Right? Right. Something something miss 100% of the shots you don't take. Now I've been in the bathroom too long and hope I don't run into him.

As I'm turning the corner back to my theater, he is opening the door to deliver the receipts.
""Hey!"" I wave.

""Oh hey!"" he replies nervously, I think?

As I get closer I ask him, ""Which one is mine? I'll take it now""

""No, don't worry about it  I got it."" He replies.

""That's silly. I'll just bring it inside."" [I had given my card before].

""No, no, really I got it.""

I see my receipt.  There's another piece of paper on top of it with writing on it. A careful smile appears on my face as I take the receipts and I read it.
*Hey, I don't mean to embarrass you, but you are cute and you seem like you're worth getting to know.  Maybe give me a call sometime. 555-5555.*

He's red. I'm beaming. And admit, ""Don't worry. I was thinking of doing the exact same thing."" I write my phone number down on his copy. Make some awkward comment about tipping being awkward now. Give a 35% tip because my brain isn't working.  And run back into the theater to inform my cousin.

We text for a bit and settle on a coffee shop for our first date.  I can't go for drinks because I'm under 21. I find out later he's 27 and working that in addition to a normal business job to make extra cash.

The start of the first date was horrible.  We just sit there and drink tea because neither of us actually drinks coffee. Interview-style questions are occasionally interspersed between sips. The rest is awkward silence.  

""Look, I'm really bad at this whole sitting and talking thing. I just don't know. I don't do this. I don't know how. can we go for a walk?""
He replies, ""yeah sure.""


Three blocks in I realize that the fleece-lined tights I borrowed from my mom are too big. They are slipping closer to the ground with every step I take. Shit.

""Hey, I need to stop in that dark spot. And I need you to turn around and don't ask questions. Ok? I'm not going to kill you or mug you I swear. Just stare at that tree.""

We do this several times until I finally admit that my tights are coming off. We talk back to my car where I take off the tights and leave them behind.

Then we walk around. For miles. 5 hours of walking It's freezing and we don't care.  5 hours later, we do care and return to the coffee shop for an hour to warm up. We talk about everything. We even happened to have watched the same neuroscience TED talks. He's actually really funny and smart.  It's 2 am now and the coffee shop closes.

He walks me to my car and we hug goodbye. It's awkward but kissing doesn't feel right quite yet.

Our next date we end up just walking around my neighborhood for 6 hours.
The next date, same thing. 3 hours. Just talking and getting to know each other. 
In the following weeks, he drives me crazy. He seems to be hot and cold and it bothers me like it's never bothered me before.  My sister asks me if I'm in love and I tell her that that's ridiculous because I just met him.  I wonder if I'm lying to her and myself.  I decide not to dwell.

We go on four more dates and at the end we decide to keep in touch.  As if that's going to happen. We're 1700 miles apart.  But we do. We would end up Skyping for 6 hours at a time. It sounds really long, but time just flew by. Months later he asked me to be his girlfriend.

It's been almost a year and we're still together. That's not long for some people, but I've never been in a committed relationship for more than 9 months before.

Ive never loved anyone. I never did, I do not love now, and i dont think im capable of this kind of feeling. I had some deeper affection towards certain women in my life. But i was always declined. ALWAYS. 

Yet now i share my time with certain girl, and while i am not sure what i feel, i know one thing: I feel good and warm when she smiles and laughts. I feel good when she hides in my arms. I dont think its love. I think she gives me purpose, she gave me the meanin behind being a human being and a man at that. And it feels just right. 

this wont last long i fear. This will colapse or spiral down as we do not use similiar values to describe reality. But i dont care. Shes a good girl, Im obidient calm man. 

We have some good times. If I just loved her, it would be perfect. And it would be perfect if she would give me more of her time. Cause she works all the time, and we cannot see eachother that much. When we do - its ok. 

And being just ok, is good. After being alone for so long, i find myself in \ok\ position and im happy. im good. Im satisfied. 



... somewhere deep inside my soul wants to die. Wants to rip my heart from chest with bare hands. just because i dont love. But i keep demons inside as long as it is ok. 

so keep it cool. Keep it under control. Find something that gives you control. Sence of puprose - like my girl that gives me that feeling of being involved and important for someone.

gummybaerchen,"**TL;DR: We met. Tried not to fall in love. Fell. Had to go back to my country. He drove 3 days to meet me and almost died. Together since.**

We met in a bar, the day we both were supposed to meet other people but they didn't show up. Coincidence.
I was planning on leaving the country three months later (I was working there for a year and wanted to go back to my country because my work contract was not going to be renovated), we kept hanging out together but we tried not to get too atached because we knew we would separate short after and there was nothing we could do against, and we also didn't wanted a long distance relationship.

Well, we did get attached, and two weeks after I took the plane to go back to my country, he decided to drive for 3 DAYS straight to see me. He drove trought 4 countries. I freaked out and took a plane as soon as he told me he was driving, to meet him somewhere in the middle of the way. The day we were supposed to meet, he would not respond. I waited for hours. I arrived there at 7.00, and waited until around 14.00... I thought he just said that as a cruel joke that i took too serious and never took his car, or if he ever took it, he died in a crash and that's why he would not respond his phone or call me.

Well... he finally calls me. I was already crying, because I didnt bring money with me to go back home since I thought I could drive with him, and I didnt tell anyone I was there. He told me where he is, not far away from where I was, and run there. He got mugged, and they broke his car window. He was calling me from an internet shop. He had to beg for gasoline and sold something just to get where I was.

We spent 3 days more in the road with no money, no food and drinking water from service stations... until we finally got to my place. The thing is, we realized we were in love with each other when we had no food, no bed, we were both smelly and tired... but happy, because we were together.

and so are we since that moment :) we have been together trought poverty (like right now...haha), and also trought good times... but we don't care we have nothing at all, as long as we have each other. ",null,0,cdptgae,1rpyj1,AskReddit,top_day,3
lil-praying-mantis,"When I was in high school I had a douchey football player as my ""first boyfriend.""  He was a terrible person to me, I don't know why he even wanted me in the first place. I was never popular, just a plain wallflower. All he wanted was sexual favors and never got it, and when I found out he was asking out my cousins (who told me right away) he beat me for trying to leave him. Punched me in the face. Got away with it completely.

After him I had instant love at first sight with a boy in the hallway, our eyes locked and I was sold. I'd take shortcuts in the hallway to pass by him every day, i'd rush to my class in hopes that he was slow putting his books away... and I could've sworn he smiled at me. I found out he was an 11th grader who was a very nice boy; had this reputation of being friendly to everyone. He was perfect, but then I found out he football player and tried to force him out of my mind. How could I date another guy, let alone a football player again? 

I graduated high school miserable, especially because I never told him how I felt. He probably didn't even knew I existed. I met guys in college who I just couldn't get past being friends, nobody compared to this guy I never spoke to. I gave up and found him on facebook, flat out confessing my creepy love to him. It turns out he felt the same way the entire time, he creeped on me too and DID give me that cute smile. He wasn't a jerky football player, just a sweet guy who liked the sport enough to join the team.

We instantly became best friends and dated shortly after. Since he was a year younger I went to his prom and graduation, everything I wanted to do with him when I was a senior. Now I had my second chance. He's my absolute best friend, I go everywhere with him. He's exactly my other half who I've always wanted in a boyfriend, such a charming guy. He wants to marry me within the next few years and I'm looking forward to spending my entire life with him. Nobody in the world is better than him.

**TL;DR:** Got in an abusive relationship with a football player in H.S, fell for another guy who ended up being a football player too. I tried to force him out of my mind to prevent pain again, but caved in years later and confessed my love to him.

He had gone to Catholic school until high school, and he was a year younger than me. He was in my sister's friend group and I started talking to him while I was away at college, encouraging him to date my sister. (They went out on a date and decided she didn't like him.) He started talking me through my depression at school, and when I took the semester off, we started dating.

LV99_Cyndaquil,"My story is not complete but I have to say. Back in highschool, a girl moved to our school and was sucked into my group. I say my group as I was a part of it and someone else kinda lead it. Well she was the pastor's daughter and I was afraid to talk to her much since I was agnostic. Well some time went by and we started to hang out during school some more. Overall she was a cool person.

Fast forward to our senior year and Valentine's day comes up. For some reason, partially caught up in the moment, partially why the fuck not, I asked her out. She said yes and we were official. I remember the day especially since word spread like wild fire. We went on a couple of dates, hung out and everything was cool. 

Was. We were seniors and had made plans to go to separate colleges. I didn't know what to do. On one hand I really really liked her, but I didn't want to go into a long distance relationship. The day came when I had to tell her we should break up. The plan was that we would hang out at her place, watch a movie or 2 and some moment I would break it to her. It didn't work like that. We hung out but she went to give me my birthday presents (my birthday was a few days ago) and my words were just caught up. So later I texted her. I never felt so bad in the world.

College came and things changed quite a bit. I wanted to experience college and do things I never could, to explore my new bound freedom. At one point I asked a new girl out. Things did not go so well with this girl, and we broke up but I was not over it. I tried over and over to keep up with the new girl and she did not try to keep thing broke up. At one point she told me how she was dating one of my friends and I was overly pissed. 

In my depression I texted my high school sweetheart. We ended up talking through the night. And throughout the night I remembered how much I like her. No how much I loved her. During the summer, we went and saw a couple movies and it was like old times. A couple days later, I got a long text from her how much she missed me and how much she loved me.

I used to dream about dating her and sweeping her off her feet like in the movies. I've always wanted to be a film critic so I used to watch all these rom-coms and stuff, and had this idealistic view of love.

It took me two weeks to realize that she needed help with EVERYTHING in life (not just Maths), her parents were ultra-conservative, there were at least three guys into her apart from me who made it their personal mission to ruin my life.

When I finally did end it with her, I came out of it jaded. I used to think that the moment I saw her, I was in love with her, but as it turns out, it was just my hormones.

I've been in love once more, but that one is not that interesting, this one taught me that there is no such thing as love at first sight, to fall in love with someone is to know them as completely as you can know them, its not something ideal or cliched you see in the movies, its much more organic in real life, and if you're hanging on to the glorified vision of love, just let go.

As for the OP, I'm sorry it ended for you, what you need is not love stories from other people, you need to go make your own new one, and keeping making new ones till you find one that lasts till you die. I wish you all the best.

TL;DR: Don't idealize love. Love is more 'Annie Hall' and less 'When Harry Met Sally'

I met her 3 years ago. Actually, we have varying opinions on where we first met. She says we sat together at one point, and I talked to her briefly. I say we met staffing a Halloween carnival. (She's entirely right about where we first met, but she likes to mock me with what I said, so I tend to ""forget"".) At the class where I first met her, I thought she was kind of strange. Cute, but not somebody I thought I'd have any interest in. Looking back, it seems funny that someone who's come to matter so much to me, initially seemed like somebody I had no interest in as a friend. So, later at the carnival, I was stuck working a booth with her. So, I made some small talk, and we wound up hitting it off pretty well. And then, at the end of the night, she introduced me to the girl I had sat with at the class. Confused? So was I. Turns out, the girl I was working with was the identical twin of the girl from the class. So, we talked for a bit more before I left. At the classes after that, we'd hang out, and times were good. I started to fall in love with both of them, since they were both great friends, and I enjoyed hanging out with both of them. As we started to hang out more, I only loved them more. However, our schedules caused us to see each other infrequently. After about a year, we saw each other less, and most of our communication was electronic. This worked fine at first, but even that slowly stagnated. But then, this year, we started attending the same school. They were new to the area, and didn't have many friends, so they spent a lot of time with me. It was around this point I figured out which one of them I wanted to be with. However, they started to make new friends as well. I became obsessive, and started to worry every time they talked to a guy who wasn't me.

scoatney_hall,"Typical beginning. I dated a whole lot of jerks and was verging on desperation and/or spinsterhood. My best friend was having a lot of luck on a dating site and convinced me to join. It seemed like a failure at first. Then one night, I was watching a movie about a character from a certain part of the UK and thought the accent was cool. Randomly searched for guys from that area on the dating site and checked a few profiles out, but didn't initiate contact because I figured no one would want to start something with a girl in America.

A few minutes later, I got a message from one of the guys whose profile  I looked at. We wound up talking for hours and kept in contact. Long story short, I planned a trip to meet him but my mom was diagnosed with cancer and I scrapped the idea for a while. He got a girlfriend in the meantime, though I was too overwhelmed with my mom's health issues to think about it. Once she got better, I went to Scotland with a friend who insisted that we meet if I was going to be in the UK anyway. Turns out, he and the girlfriend had broken up a few weeks before I got there. We meet in his home city. After a lot of initial awkwardness due to my social anxieties, we hit it off immensely and I left the UK with a long-distance romance.

We went back and forth between America and England for three years. It was expensive, it was exhausting, but it was also incredibly beautiful at the same time. We had ten airport reunions. The last airport reunion was when he came in two weeks before our wedding. We cut the visa process close, but we got it by the skin of our teeth. 10 days later, we were picking up his mom and friends at the same airport. That was a year and a half ago and this has been the best year and a half of my life.

Everyone always thinks that how we met was the fairy tale, but the fairy tale has been everything that came after. We've had a lot of obstacles in our way, but at the end of the day, I married my best friend who I somehow managed to meet from thousand of miles away. He's the funniest, most intelligent person I have ever met. We're usually laughing within the first 5 minutes we're awake and in the 5 minutes before one of us (usually me) falls asleep. I've never felt comfort with anyone like I have with him. I could go on and on, but I'll just sum up by saying I didn't know this was possible. And it's all because a friend had to push me into starting a dating site profile. Fun fact: She also met her husband on a dating site and we're all best friends now. Thank you, internet.

This new girl in one of my classes (who is now one of my best friends) took me out to a frat party on campus and introduced me to this guy. I can't explain that moment, other than to say sparks flew. There was literally magic between us, I was so caught up in the moment, that it wasn't until after I went home that night that I realized I forgot to get his number. Luckily my friend saw how into this guy I was, and was able to contact him again. 
It took a while for me to get up the guts to go on a date with him. For some reason I was scared that those sparks wouldn't be there anymore, and I would be devastated. But you know what?

suicidal_reverie,"Well, uh... This has a sad ending but I like it. :) Here goes:

Freshman year of high school, I was kind of a hopeless loner. Didnt have any friends since I'd switched school districts; ended up spending most days in total silence. One day I finally talked to that cute girl named Natalie in art class, and she smiled and actually *talked back* (No one ever talked to me when I talked to them, so this was a pleasant surprise), and we had a nice conversation during class change.

Next couple days, we break the ice some more and become semi good friends. One day, I get a random text message. It's from her; she'd found my page on Facebook just to get my number. I'm normally stupid about this kinda thing, but I got the hint this time; it was obvious she was at least a *little* interested.

We ended up becoming amazing friends through text messages. She became my sole confedant, and I hers. Well, three weeks after I first talked to her, I asked her out. It was New Year's Eve, and I'd already worked the entire date out with her parents (how she'd get there and all). She said yes!

An hour later my brother drives me to her house and her parents drive us to a nearby theme park (we were both freshman, not old enough to drive), then let us stay there til the next morning since the park was open and monitored the whole night due to it being New Year's Eve.

We rode some rides for a few hours and then ate at one of the ""fancy"" (it was disgusting and overpriced) restaurants in the park. Then we got in the ridiculously long line for the ferris wheel, but we were lucky: we managed to get on at the perfect time to be at the very top the minute the ball dropped.

It was possibly the most clichéd moment ever, our first kiss. Top of the ferris wheel on New Year's Eve with fireworks going off in the background... It was *magical.*

Fast forward a year and we're still dating; I'm convinced I'm going to marry this girl. Her brother, a complete and total stoner, is supposed to drive her home; she has no clue he's high. He runs a light and gets t-boned by a semi. She dies instantly, he gets a few scratches.

Mr_Mimiseku,"Back in the spring, I took a class in College covering the Mythology of Ancient Greece.  It was the last class of the day, and I always just walked straight to my car.  Well it turns out there was this girl who also took the same route as me to her car, and I noticed she was in my class.  We made small talk for a few weeks.  Then in April, I finally asked her to lunch, and she said that she's been wanting to ask me out as well.  I would love to be able to say we're still together, but alas, she broke up with me in August.",null,0,cdptybt,1rpyj1,AskReddit,top_day,1
charlie2292,"My story is pathetic. I'm pathetic. I met her when I was young, even before high school. I was relatively new to this school but I already knew most people by that time, apart from her. Some friends were talking about her and I didn't know who she was, so they pointed her out and my god, it was like I had seen an angel... It may sound cliché but I really have never experienced something like that again. I've had a few crushes before, this was very different.

I was still pretty social back then so I didn't really have any trouble introducing myself and I learned she lived nearby. From then on I just wanted to spend as much time with her as possible. When I was playing on the streets I would always check if she was out aswell or when we were at school I'd try to be around her as much as possible.
We've had some good times together, some are definitely highlights of my life. Most likely not as meaningful to her as they are to me however.
 I honestly didn't try having a relationship with her. If she wanted it, heck yeah, but I didn't want to force it in that way. I just enjoyed being with her, I was happy. 

But then of course the clouds got darker. See, my brother was also in love with her but he didn't approach it in the same way. He told her pretty much right away and he got rejected. He didn't give up though and made several other desperate attempts to confess his love to her. Eventually she got fed up with it I think (can't blame her) and she insulted him by calling him a fatass. We've always been larger than most kids, not obese or anything, just bulkier. I've always been pretty insecure about my body and this certainly didn't help, since I was a few kilos heavier than my brother. It didn't change the way I feel about her though. I simply realised she doesn't feel the same way about me, or atleast my chances would be very low. 

Then my parents split up and we had to move and change schools. We lost touch. The whole family situation (stepmom mainly) had quite an impact on me. To put it short: became very insecure, got addicted to computer games which made me lose pretty much all my friends, and my social skills are zero. Got fatter on top of that. Still didn't get back in touch with her.

This went on until my last year of high school.  I started thinking about what's gonna happen after high school. I had zero ambition. I started looking at some possible educations and decided studying IT would be my safest bet. Then I looked at what colleges/unis would be possible and I noticed she went to the one that stood out the most. Some other good stuff happened aswell, which made me realise it isn't all that bad and some changes made me lose my MMORPG addiction. I started going to the gym which made me lose quite some weight. Life was starting to get better.

Skip to my first year in college. I wanted to see her so badly but I'm so fucking shy and socially awkward. My appearance improved a lot but I'm still fucking insecure. I checked when and where she would have class and I'd try to 'accidently' meet her. This went on for a few weeks but I never saw her for some reason. Until one day it finally happened. There she was, so beautiful... I got so nervous I could barely walk and I definitely didn't have the courage to go talk to her. I walked past her and hoped she wouldn't notice me. This went on for the rest of my first year. I saw her a few times but never had the guts to go talk to her. 

Now I'm in my second year. I lost some more weight but still very insecure, shy and socially awkward. I already saw her a few times in the first period but again I always chickened out. Until one time I just thought ""fuck it"" and I finally said hi. It was fucking awkward... She was so nice to me but I just didn't know what to say. It turned into some awkward smalltalk. I wanted to know so much about her but I just didn't get to it. Now I'm still trying to 'accidently' meet her on the subway and have a second chance...

Even after all these years she means so much to me, eventhough nothing ""serious"" ever happened, and she probably couldn't care less about me. She's what has kept me going for the last 3 years. Without her, or atleast the idea of her, I would have ended up much worse. I just want her to be a real part of my life again. I don't want to be just a stranger from the past... I'm pathetic.",null,0,cdpu3uq,1rpyj1,AskReddit,top_day,1

toridoubleyew,"At the time, I was in high school and living in the Middle East. This was back when FB still had proper groups I was a part of one, along with a about a hundred or so others. We made/shared old school memes, awful, scum of the internet type stuff. It started off being a way to pass the time during the summer, but soon I was hooked. It wasn't long until I started contributing and started online friendships. Since it was probably 2008/2009, MSN Messenger was still alive and kickin'. One day, out of pure boredom I started a conversation with him about what he would name his first child. She'd be called Mia. That started a friendship between him in Brazil (where he was for school) and myself in Kuwait. A year, exchanged pictures, and hours of late night chatting later my family moved back home to Seattle, Wa, USA. He'd been back home in Ontario, Canada. In January 2010 we admitted to each other that there were definitely feelings. In August 2010 we met for the first time at SeaTac Airport.

Fast foward to Novemeber 2013- we've been together ever since. I've had two trips to Canada, he's had three to WA. Unfortunately still living apart to to immigration/costs. Engaged since Decemeber 2012. I haven't seen him in person since August. I tell him I'll come for a visit in May but what he doesn't know is that I've planned to surprise him for Valentine's Day. When the time is right, we'll be naming out first daughter Mia.

NowWithMoreChocolate,"Winter of 2008. I was 13 and had just joined the girls basketball team at school in order to impress my ex because I still liked him. On the way to the game, we passed by a performing arts school. The girl I was sitting next to on the bus, Olivia, commented that she went there and we got into a huge discussion about it, resulting in me deciding to join. 

Fast forward a few weeks to that day. Our first lesson was Dance and as I walked into the dance studio, I saw a guy of my age sitting on the windowsill on his own while everyone else was standing around the room, talking to their friends. I asked Olivia who he was and she said his name and said that he didn't really talk to anyone in the group.

Now, I suffer from slight social anxiety. To this day I still hate the thought of having to talk to someone I don't know unless they speak to me first. But something about this guy just drew me to him and before I knew it, I was standing it front of him, introducing myself and getting into a conversation about Doctor Who.

I liked him as more than a friend within 6 weeks of knowing him. He took about a year before having an epiphany into realizing that he liked me back. However we both only realized that the other one liked us back after 5 months of his epiphany when, in a game of truth or dare, he got asked whether or not he would date me if I asked him out.

We dated for a month. We broke up and I ended up dating his friend for almost 3 months. Broke up with him because I realised I still loved my SO. Got back together with him, dated for a year, broke up again. Got back together for a week, broke up again. It then took us 6 months to finally get back together, including a period of friends-with-benefits. We've now been together almost 2 years and I couldn't be happier.

The break ups were all my responsibility, me doubting my emotions and breaking up with him because I was scared. I am so thankful that he has always taken me back. He loves me more than I can comprehend at times and sometimes I can't believe how lucky I am to have found someone that has that much love for me. He looks at me as if I'm the universe itself. He'll do whatever it takes to make me laugh or to cheer me up even if he ends up looking like an idiot. He takes care of me when I'm sick and makes the best grilled cheese and ham sandwiches IN THE WORLD.

I'm now about to turn 19. I can't see a future where I don't end up marrying this guy and I wouldn't change that for the world.

ahohako,"Forenote to the story: my partner and I (of 2 1/2 yrs now) lived in the same state during our childhoods, of course, never knew.

Met on a relatively obscure ('urban') gay social networking site. Neither of us frequented it much and were both at the stage of being content single. My wife lived in the midwest and I on the east coast. We were never too far from each other, it seems. Anyway, late one night I'm getting drunk and I decide to ask people what they think about polygamy. I didn't get any responses except one: my would-be wife. 

We end up chatting for three days online and on the phone when she decides she's coming to kidnap me and bring me back to her home. I ended up having to abandon all of my things and my dog in the process but met the most wonderful person I've ever met. My mother died 5mos before I met her.

Gwenji,"Get ready for a rock and roll love story to rule the others....

I lived in a big house when my roommates were moving out and I needed to find new ones. I searched for months to no avail when my roommates said they found 2 guys to take over. They were friends of theirs and music majors at the local university, which was perfect for me and I knew we would get along. The first time I met them they visited me at work and I fell in love quick and hard. 

His name was [DT], he looked like Jim Morrison, dressed like 80s Keith Richards and acted like axl rose. A few nights after we met, I came home and found DT on the porch, drinking whiskey, smoking a cigarette, van halen blasting through the window. He was wearing more jewelry than me, nose ring, vest but no shirt, tight white jeans and shit kicker boots with his feet propped up on the ledge around the porch. From that moment on, he's never left my mind.

We started hooking up immediately. We were young and ripe to party, and every weekend it was another Kurt and Courtney type escapade. We would make out on tables in bars, in our yard, no concern as to who saw what because we were in love. I'd go to his gigs and he'd make me feel like I was the only person he was playing for.

Come Christmas we had been officially dating about a month and I was late. Sure enough, I was pregnant, and we weren't ready at all. We decided we were going to give our son up for adoption pretty quickly, and that meant our lives had to change. No more parties, no more recklessness, and we crossed our fingers hoping there was more to our relationship than that. We got lucky, because there was most definitely more to us. Through the entire pregnancy and post adoption fog, DT was there. I became a part of his family, which was something I had never had before, and through their love and his I became a better person.

We eventually broke up, but it wasn't for lack of love. The adoption had changed us both and to be the best versions of ourselves we could be, we needed different things. We are still good friends, his family and I still speak and we will forever be a big part of each other's lives.",null,0,cdpud6g,1rpyj1,AskReddit,top_day,1

Lascondes,"I was in Canada (from Australia) and was talked into getting on a silly dress up pub craw on St Patrick's day, green everything. We ended up staying at the third pub because the lines were getting long. This guy super drunk walks past knocks into me and spills green beer on me, while trying to talk but he was to drunk to talk. His friend came over and apologized to me and sent his drunk friend home (the drunk friend lived in an apartment on top of the bar so it wasn't far), I ended up getting pretty drunk and making out with the friend. My friends wanted to leave and I wanted to go with them, so we said goodbye and I never expected to see him again. 

Two weeks later I was getting a coffee in ANOTHER CITY and here was this guy again, we exchanged numbers and he called a week later for dinner. We went to dinner but I was leaving to go to see my parents in Australia so I said I'd call him when I got back. He found out from my roommate my flight details and picked me up at the airport with flowers and a nice frosty bottle of water, I was pretty shocked and to honest a tiny bit concerned that he was a stalker. 

We spent a great summer together, we just had fun with each other ""hey I am going to teach you to fish this weekend"", ""We should really hold rifest in your backyard for weekend"", ""So I saw a deal to buy a kayak at the local pawn shop, wanna get it?"" (we sank the kayak as we packed too much food and wine, we are not smart people). 

Then one day after 6 months he said ""I think I should meet your parents"" I sort of said ""Well they are in Aus, it is kinda far"". We both had good paying jobs so we found tickets and made plans to go, snag was I hadn't told my parents about him so basically it was like ""Um Mum and Dad I have a boyfriend and we are coming to see you in three weeks p.s Can he stay at our house?"" That did not go down so great but after my parents met him they loved him. We came back to Canada and talked about if I was going to stay in Canada as I had an option to take another year contract so I did. From then on we have just been a stable couple, dated a couple of years, got married, move from one side of Canada to the other, then China then Chile. We just fit each other. We have made sacrifices for each other, career and family wise but we (fingers firmly crossed that we continue to do so) just completely ""get"" each other, we talk our options though, I think the success of our relationship  boils down to the fact that we each want the absolute best for each other.

Soon he had asked for my phone number, and I was still convinced that there was no way this guy could have feelings for me. After that, we hung out on campus between classes, just silently doing homework beside each other because I was too afraid of messing it up (which feels so silly to say now!) and one day he finally asked me out on a date.

So there is this Canadian girl I met 2 years ago at a science camp here in Australia. And I didn't just love her instantly at the time, I just thought of her as an extremely interesting girl, and loved spending time with her. After our short two weeks together, we were both crying when she had to leave, and I gave her a kiss on the forehead.

Another 6 months later, she came back to Australia and stayed a week between my friends house, and my house, and then flew to Sydney with us all, and stayed for another week! During this first week, my friend and myself all slept together on the same bed. So me and my awesome Canadian (let's just call her Felicity) got some great cuddle time over the next few days. We spent all day together every day, and I just loved being with her, and around her every second of the day. I suppose it was around here I fell in love with her.

Since then she has came back a few times, and I could run you through everything we did on each of these time, because they are all so clear in my memory. I really really love this girl.

First day of college. Freshman keg party. The crowd parts and SLO-MO moment: who is that beautiful blonde?

Although a fairly confident fellow, I was usually the type to ""look cool and hope she notices me."" In other words, kinda shy. Not this time. I strode right up to her and we had a nice half-drunken chat. Chemistry but no action... and it turned out she left school a couple of days later (long story). I promptly forgot about her.

Fast forward to the first day of 2nd semester. I'm strolling the dorm, notice a door open, and WHOA! Who is that beautiful blonde? 

Again feeling preternaturally emboldened (seriously, with no other beauty have I felt so confident, so quickly), I walk right into her room as she's unpacking, put her bra on my head, and generally do anything I can to make her laugh. We become friends. Just friends. Both of us had SOs at that point.

Fast forward again, to sophomore year. We are good friends now. Flirting more and more openly as our respective relationships decay. I finally break up with my SO (she's already single), and turn to The Blonde for counsel and comfort. We make love. It's awesome. 

Still together 25 years later. Still going strong. Passionate, fun, loving... And I swear to you, she still looks like that gorgeous teenager! Carded nearly every time we order a drink.

We were FWB for about a year, and one night I was just leaving from work and felt NASTY. All I could think about was showering and going to bed. He calls me and BEGS me to go to this Indian restaurant with him and some of his friends from uni. For whatever reason I actually agreed to go even though I wasn't hungry, and when we got there his friends were already eating. I sat down across from this guy who was stealing the show telling stories of his childhood to the group. Im really not one to be a ""maneater"" and had never really found someone super attractive before, nor do I ever think about random dudes in an intimate way if I don't know them. But with this guy, I was instantly interested- I started admiring the muscles under the shirt, the way he laughed, the sound of his voice, the way he ate (ok sounding creepy here), everything. I started to think about what kind of lover and boyfriend he would be. I really felt that I wanted to get to know him. 

When we left the restaurant I specifically remember being disappointed and literally thinking ""well I will probably never see this guy again"" which I have never in my life thought about somebody I have just met. About 2 months later I'm at my best friend's bday party (delicious, free food and booze) and for some reason, I'm completely restless and just want to go and hangout with the friend from Okcupid (no, not for sex, just for some professional potato-couching). After we meet up this friend from the Indian restaurant calls (who is actually more of a friend of the other people that were there) and asks my FWB if he wants to hangout, but doesn't know I'm there.

We never fight, and if we disagree we talk about it, but it isnt often. We have a great time doing absolutely nothing. We can and do talk about everything under the sun.

I was always off doing my own thing so I never went to the neighbor parties or get-togethers, at least not until I was in high school and more of a social butterfly. By then though, he was already off at college. Eventually I graduate high school and leave for college as well.
We didn't meet until the summer after my freshmen year of college. All the neighborhood families went camping together and I remember my mom pointing him out to me and I had no idea who he was, apparently his parents had pointed me out to him and he had no idea who I was either. We get to know each other that week of vacation and exchange numbers.
Immediately when we're all back home, he asks me out on a date. We had a really good summer romance and I think we both assumed that was all it would be. I had to go back to school in the fall and my college was several hours away. Eventually we talk it out and we decide to give the long distance thing a shot. We missed each other a lot, he visited  me once and for academic reasons I ended up moving back home.
We continued to date for a few more years. We've had our arguments and our bad nights but the good out weighs that greatly. He is my best friend, I couldn't imagine my life without him. He proposed to me in May, we're getting married in July.
Sometimes he insists that our parents kept us away from each other for so many years because they wanted us to get together when we were adults. It's not true but it's funny to think about. Sometimes I wonder if we would have still ended up together if we watched each other grow up and go through all our awkward phases. It's interesting to think about, but I'm glad I met him when I did and I really love our story.",null,0,cdpwotr,1rpyj1,AskReddit,top_day,1
throwawayy2224,"Gay story here

17 in my senior year, i went to my university orientation for my program. i met this guy there and we just talked a bit. i know this sounds cliche or dramatic but for some reason i thought in my head ""he's going to become very important in my life someday."" i usually don't think stuff like that. i actually hate when people are dramatic like that and stuff. during first semester of university we had each other in a lot of the same classes. we would always smile at each other and that was it. but second semester came along. my friends didn't go to school one day so i was in the caf by myself. i saw him and he was sitting by himself too. i asked him if it's cool if i sat with him. he said yes. that day we just hung out and talked all day. after that day we pretty much became best friends. we were both in the closet at the time and we were best friends for about a year. i never told him i was gay and he never told me. although i had strong suspicions that he was. so for over a year it was pretty much me being in love with my best friend who i wasn't sure if he was gay or not and it was absolutely horrible. fast forward to second year of university, one day he called me and said he had to tell me something. we met up and he looked really really scared. i thought somebody had died or something. then he came out to me and i pretended to be completely shocked. i don't know why but i was too scared to tell him i was until a few months afterwards. after i told him, we made out and then a few days later we were ""officially dating."" although it didn't really feel like anything had changed. (just the physical stuff) i guess for over a year we were both in love with each other and were both too scared to say anything. anyways, now we've been ""officially"" dating for two and a half years and i absolutely love him. i'm really glad i decided to sit with him that day at school. and i was right, he did become very important in my life.",null,0,cdpwp3o,1rpyj1,AskReddit,top_day,1
CankleMan,"I can't provide you with a love story, but I shall tell you that it does get better. I was in a serious relationship for two years before college, ended up going to the same school, and she dumped me about two weeks into the first semester. It was utterly shocking and broke my heart. I never thought I would get over her, and while it is still a painful memory six years later, it has gotten tremendously easier to deal with. That was probably the darkest time of my life and I'm thankful that I got through it. My best piece of advice is talk to people. Don't cut yourself off from human interaction, it can be one of the most healing of things. If you ever need someone to talk to, feel free to PM me.

km1bm30,"So, I lived in Ohio until I was about 8 or so, then we(my mom and I) moved to Arizona because she got a job offer. 7 years later, we move back to Ohio, because we own a house here. I started school in a familiar, yet strangely different place. When I was in Arizona, I got my first girlfriend at the age of 15. Two years ago. I thought I loved her, but I really didn't. First girlfriend, I didn't know how love felt!

Anyway. After she dumped me, I got depressed as all hell, and was like that for two years. Well more like two and a half years. Okay so we move back to Ohio. I start school in a new school. New kid, don't know anyone, still depressed, thinking of suicide, bleh. After a few weeks, out of nowhere, I notice this girl. I've no clue what made me notice her. But goddamn is she cute. I didnt know her name, so I referred to her as 'That cute girl with the cool hair'. I would see her in the halls, in the morning, during lunch, and I'd always want to talk to her, but never worked up the courage too. 

But, one day, I said, ""Fuck it here goes nothing."" I scooted to her table during lunch and started talking to her. It was nice. And extremely awkward. The next day, I sat with her again, and she was surprised. We didn't talk much that day. But the next day, oh man the next day, I sat with her, and again, not much talking, until her brother came over and got us to talk. My god it was amazing. We talked about games, movies, comic books, things we have in common. 

That lunch period ended with me getting her number. I was so happy. I kept taking the paper out of my pocket the rest of the day just to look at the number. I got home, and immediately sent her a text saying, ""DC is better :D"". She was surprised I even texted her. She thought I was too cool to talk to her. 

That weekend, all I did was talk to her. The following week, just talked to her. A week after meeting her, she asked me if i wanted to go to the library with her. And I did. I found out a little bit about her past. She had told me I would never know about her past, but in that moment, she trusted me enough to tell me. And that was when I started to fall for her. 

We first kissed that Friday. In the library, no less! But, the next day, she said that her heart still belonged to her ex, and that they just got back together. I was so hurt. But, hey, just a few days later, she dumped him because she didn't want him. She wanted me. And it's not like she broke his heart or anything. He was kind of a shit. Actually he was a lot of a shit, and he didn't deserve her. So we started dating on a Thursday. We went to the homecoming dance that Saturday. We didn't really dance, but neither one of us knows how to, so we were fine with it. I have the picture we took at homecoming pinned to my ceiling in my room. 

About a week later, I accidentally let it slip to her that I love her. Oops. I may have just scared her off. She's still here? Great! Two days later, she told me that she loves me too. And I just smiled and hugged her and it was perfect. 

But, all good things must end I guess. I'm pretty sure she's going to dump me sometime soon. Probably after Thanksgiving break. But, she also may not. I'm hoping she doesn't. She's an amazing girl that I never want to let go of. 

TLDR: I fell in love with the most amazing girl in the world. ",null,0,cdpx0av,1rpyj1,AskReddit,top_day,1

We were both musicians, and she was certainly the best out of the girls in the school band, sooooo... Yay me? 

Anyway, we got pretty close and started hanging out a bit. She asked me to drive her home from school one day, and of course I agreed. When we got to her house she asked me to come inside so she could show me her new kitten. 

I still don't know if that was a euphemism.

Either way, we went inside, and nobody was home. Score. We were sitting on the couch watching Big Bang Theory, and out of nowhere, I felt her tracing her pinky up my thigh, and faster than the speed of wood, she was on top of me. About a minute into the frisky-ness, she sits up, grabs her head and says: ""Oh my God, I cheated"".

Apparently there was this dude in Chicago she was kinda seeing, who I had no idea about. Apparently our little make-out session was just the reminder she needed. Dammit.

Things kind of fell apart slowly after that. She was the first girl I really ever fell in love with.

AzureMagelet,"Summer if 2006, I was dating this guy I had met recently. He was nice and sweet but we didn't totally click. We were together for just under 2 months when I met another guy. I actually only met him because of my current boyfriend. This new guy invited me and my friend to hang out with him and his friend at a 7-11 one night. We talked for a couple hours and his friend hopelessly flirted with my gay friend. We joked about it quietly. We exchanged AIM screen names, because that was the cool thing back then. We talked for the next few weeks, he told me about Clerks 2 coming out and I admitted I'd never seen Clerks. He couldn't believe it and invited me over to watch it the next day. I had work and didn't drive, but he offered to come pick me up after work. We watched the movie and I loved it. We hung out with some of my friends later and the next day they told me he liked me. I laughed it off, I'd rarely had one guy interested in me much less two, it just didn't seem possible. My boyfriend and I continued to not quite click and the following Saturday the new guy, myself, and my best friend spent the entire night hanging out and driving around going to multiple Denny's and a donut wheel. He even taught me to drive a bit. In the wee hours of the morning we went back to my place. My friend fell asleep on the floor and me and the new guy started cuddling on the couch while watching tv. I looked at him and just knew this was what I wanted. I told him I liked him and it was the longest ten seconds of my life before he said he liked me too. I broke up with my boyfriend that evening, soonest I could see him. I felt horrible, because he and I had talked about the new guy and I told him that I didn't like him just a few days before that. He was great about it, because he's that type of guy.

I'd broken up with my boyfriend of 2.5 years (who was also my only real ever boyfriend even though I was 21) only about a month before.

His delegation is doing a quick meeting after though, so I lose track of him, even though he'd agreed to go for a walk with me near the water after. I go back to my room and start thinking I'm never going to be able to find him again, when the two guys in my delegation come running in and tell me they found him, he's only a few hotel rooms down the hall from us, and next thing I know he's at my door. We went for our walk, played some card games with friends, and then just chatted and watched movies all night, before finally just sharing one quick kiss good bye, figuring we'd never see each other again, since he lives in the US and I'm from Canada (about 500 miles away from each other). But when we get home, we're chatting each other on facebook, and chatting on skype, and just in contact all the time. Within 2 weeks, he'd booked tickets to come visit me.

ObviousBicycle22,"Are we just talking happy love stories? Because surely there's such a thing as unhappy love stories? Not unrequited love stories. Just shitty love that doesn't work out because you're both too afraid to properly commit. Both too afraid to admit how much you adore each other because you have both been hurt in the past, and you both have weird issues. Weird issues that the other only really knows a fraction about, because that one time you got hammered and spoke about it a little before bursting into tears. You kiss, it's there, you can feel it. It's totally there. There's a connection that you'll never forget, ever. There's that feeling you get in the pits of your stomach when you think back on it. How when you first kissed there was such an urgency in it. An urgency that won't ever be repeated with anyone else. You wanted each other so much in that moment. You knew you loved each other right then and there. It wasn't just lust. We've all felt lust before, but this was something completely extraordinary. Everything completely disappeared around you in those moments. Moments you replay over and over again in your head.

There's the comfort of them just being there, physically, but then at the same time being totally unattainable because you can't communicate properly because you don't know how. You can feel the frustration at yourself and them growing inside you, but you can't do anything about it, because that would require changing each other, and that would, in turn, affect everything you love about them already. 

But then you try and do something about it, because you want them all, you want all of them. You start being selfish and you say you don't want half of them any more. But that means that you've blown it. You've blown it forever, because you tried to change it, and even though it wasn't healthy, it was still love. And love is eternal, you can't change the way you love someone. You love someone because you love someone. And risking it all because it's not the normal way of loving someone is foolish. But you do it. You ruin it. You ruin the complete and utter life changing love that you once had, that you can't ever brush under the carpet.

patricenicole2,"I was 17 and sorta dating/flirting with a bunch of boys at once. I had just come out of my awkward stage, and dudes noticed. One of the dudes was absolutely in love with me, but the feeling was not completely mutual. 

One day, a girlfriend and I were out shopping at the mall, when that guy calls me and says there's a show at the local YMCA, and to come by when we are done. So we did. This guy introduces me to his friend: This super cute, tattooed, pierced, crazy, wild guy. I was hooked instantly. This was back when Myspace was in its prime. When I got home I looked him up, and just started melting over his Myspace photos. I added him as a friend, and he accepted. 

You remember those bulletins people would post? Well, this tattooed boy that I was already head over heels for after three days posts one that says, ""I'm -his name-, and I know you want to marry me."" Obviously it's not directed at me, but I replied flirtatiously saying, ""Yeah, I do"" and something along the lines of ""We should probably start planning that."" It became a silly-stupid-flirtatious-teenage thing we did, and we would refer to one another as ""future husband"" and ""future wife"". 

Fast forward two weeks, we had our first date: We ate some pizza, explored some cemeteries, made out like crazy. On our second date, I told him, as we were sitting on my parents' couch watching Conan O'Brien, that all joking aside, I was truthfully going to marry him someday, so he should plan accordingly. He agreed, more making out, permasmiles forever. 

And eight and a half years later, we're happily married. That friend of his was pissed for awhile (which was understandable), but he eventually got over it and was a guest at our wedding. 

He's still a smokin' hot tattooed dude, but instead of piercings he has a sexy red beard. Jackpot. He supported me through college, he's stood by me through some really awful stuff, and he never stops making me laugh, even when I don't want to laugh. ",null,1,cdpxyvb,1rpyj1,AskReddit,top_day,2
SergeantCoodles,"Boyfriend and I have been together for a little over a year now. :) We met on the same University dorm floor... and initially didn't like each other. He seemed outspoken and slightly rude, and liked to flaunt his knowledge. He also had some experience with drinking and drug use, which I didn't at that time. I was in the middle of a trying-to-break-up-with-my-ex while my ex's best friend was also trying to pursue me. I was confused, and on top of that, was a new freshman attempting to make friends, so I had a difficult time adjusting.

We had mutual friends on the floor and that brought us infinitely closer. He was there to talk me through my relationship issues and just be someone I could message or drop in with. I could eventually cut off ties with the ex and the bad situation with his B.F.F. We went deer-watching and stargazing and had random sleep overs and movie nights (with other floor members). One night we awoke and we were the only ones still up after a night of social drinking and horrible movie watching. He asked if I wanted to spend the rest of the A.M. in his room. I was reluctant but obliged. :)

Thus began over a month or so of us purely cuddling - spooning and just talking. I felt safe. Eventually he wanted us to be ""official."" It took me a while to come around out of fear of how my other relationships spiralled down, but he awaited patiently. Now I have no regrets!

Sure, we fight a lot and have squabbles about purely nothing. He's annoying and games way too much. But he pulled me out of a bad time in my life - I was dealing with family issues and am now having trouble with anxiety and depression. Even with meds I can be moody and unstable, assigning blame and crying a lot.

No matter what, though, he's stuck through it with me at all times. It's a learning pathway for the both of us. We grow and learn how to communicate better each and every time. Most of all - I'm happy.

I'd give him a hug but alas, we're on the verge of a new disagreement.

She was very manipulative and frankly pretty abusive. She lied to him, would cut herself and send him pictures saying that it was his fault. (I have seen pictures of their conversations that he had saved) She also wrote this fucked up anonymous note to him saying that she was going to reveal that he was bisexual to our very homophobic school &amp; he stayed with her because she threatened to commit suicide if he left. She caused him a lot of emotional damage. He feels often that he can't reveal how he feels to me and that if I'm upset that it's automatically his fault.

wanderlust81,"I don't know when my boyfriend came into my life.  Sometime in elementary school we met, but we were never really friends -- never in the same class, never played on the playground together.  On the first day of middle school we had our first classes together. For the next three years we had multiple classes together and became quite friendly, but we were totally platonic. 

When high school came we lost contact up until one random day our sophomore year. I was in the hall with friends for some reason or another, and some people were just getting back from lunch. I was in the middle of a conversation when I felt a bop on my head. There he was with an empty waterbottle. ""Hey!"" he exclaimed. We hadn't talked or even really seen each other in a while so it was refreshing to see him again. We shared a quick exchange and he headed back to class.

Fast forward another year and a half. My best friend and I are at a football game at another high school's stadium. We don't see anyone we recognize except him and his friends. We spend the game standing together and grow close. The rest of the year we spend more and more time together with mutual friends until one day over spring break, our flaky friend bail on plans and we're left to either stay at home or go out, just the two of us. He says we should still go see a movie and it won't be weird because it's not a date. We meet up at Taco Bell and then go to the movies to see The House on the End of the Street or some crappy horror movie like that. Maybe 30 minutes in there are boobs and it's evident of how bad this movie is going to be. He says screw this and we leave and go to his place where I meet his family for the first time. 

Fast forward again -- it's been 5 years and we're still going strong. Of all the colleges we both applied to, only one was the same, and we both ended up there. In a week I graduate and start a career, and he's hoping to get into medical school.

He was my first real boyfriend, my first kiss, my first everything. There are so many other smaller, funnier stories in our love-story we can hardly keep everything straight -- we still don't agree on when our first kiss was. We've made it through some huge life milestones and it's scary to think about how much I love him and how long we've been together. Five years may not seem like much, but it's almost a quarter of my life. I hope we get a happy ending someday, because I just don't know what I'd do if we didn't.

I went to my college orientation at SLU in St. Louis. I remember one of the speakers/leaders said ""Look around you, people make life time friends with people starting out at SLU 101 (what they called our orientation)"" I remember I scoffed at that &amp; thought ""Yeah right.. with all these random people here? How do they know that?"" Fast forward to that night, everyone in our group was playing Scoot Your Boot, a game that had the same concept as musical chairs, but you had to state something that you could do &amp; everyone else that could do that would have to run across the room to another empty chair. This literally is going to sound cheesy but.. I saw him across the room from me, and I remember thinking that he was really attractive so I was like ""I'm gonna go ahead and run on whatever this next thing is and sit right next to him"" So I did. Annnnd he got up and ran somewhere else haha. Fast forward a couple of months, we were friends on facebook and I saw him make a status about his nephew wanting to be like him so I ""liked"" it. He poked me. I thought it was an accident haha so I poked him back. He sent me a message saying ""How come I never see you around campus"" and I told him that I was a commuter, so we decided to meet up and hang out. I still to this day can remember what he was wearing the first day we hung out, but not what I was wearing, and where we decided to meet to walk back to his place -- The Bean. When I saw him, he opened his arms for a hug &amp; we hugged, which I wasn't expecting at first because I realized everyone at SLU shook hands. So this always stands out to me. We walked back to his dorm and watched The Crazies. I was instantly comfortable with him, which never happens to me. Around guys I've always had my guard up, but with him.. never. We were sitting in chairs in front of his TV and my legs were wrapped in his and I remember thinking that this felt right. I felt like I was supposed to be there with him. The next day, we hung out again. It honestly was what I was looking forward to all day. We ended up watching tv at his place and one of his chairs broke. Totally out of character for me I said ""Well I don't mind just sitting on your lap"". Again I felt comfortable and right. Like I was supposed to be there with him.

We knew that we wanted a fling for the summer before we went off to college, but didn't see it any other way. Slowly and slowly it grew into something more. Every day from May 10th we would stay up until 4am FB messaging each other. I was on vacation and still found a way to message her. You could say that we were in love... Until we left for college. Communication began to diminish, mostly because she was indecisive with where she wanted the relationship to go, when I clearly wanted more. So, I broke things off with her. It was difficult at first because it was the girl I wanted to be with. I thought about her every night/day. I eventually got over her and I am completely happy now.

tbhbbidgaf,"My current boyfriend and I met through Twitter. We both loved the same bands and is both addicted to Lord of The Rings. We were friends first, of course. Then we finally met at a Bring Me The Horizon concert. Our interest in each other just grew since then. After a few months, we saw each other again at a concert and our friends have been teasing us for talking online too much (they see our convos on Twitter and Facebook). Luckily, we both live in the same city and we both go to work and school in another city. He pursued me since and we're still together. 

Backstory: when we were in high school, we both went to exclusive schools. Meaning I came from an all-girls school and he came from an all-boys one. During our sophomore year, our schools had an interaction. Little did we know, we were both in the same room. Years passed and we finally met.

Python2k10,"Late, I know, but oh well. Well, I met my fiancee over Xbox Live.

She joined the party I was in randomly. She was friends with a couple of my friends that were also in the party. Side note, she randomly joined their party one day with zero prior knowledge to their existence. So we kinda talked.

As time passed, she started playing Minecraft with us more. This is when we started actually talking. One night, it's me, her and one of my friends. My friend went to go check on a mod he was installing for Skyrim. It was just us for the first time ever.

So we talk. And talk. And talk. My friend gets distracted with Skyrim, so we were able to talk one-on-one for a while. The first thing we ever played together, just me and her, is the Resident Evil 6 co-op demo. We had a blast! 

So, gradually we start talking to only each other more and more. It turns out, this chick I randomly met on Xbox Live lives literally 15 minutes away. So, naturally, we meet in person.

We get off to a rocky start, due to her having undiagnosed bipolar disorder and depression. A near suicide attempt and month long stay at a treatment facility (of which I didn't get to talk to her once. I'd only seen her in person once as well) and I get a phone call. It's her! Her voice filled my ears for the first time in a month. Even though we'd been together a mere month, and the only time we'd been together physically was before we even dated, I waited for that call. Never laid eyes upon another woman.

Now we see each other regularly, practically every day. It's...amazing. That doesn't even do it justice. It's some adjective that eclipses the word ""amazing"". It's love.

Sorry about your loss, OP. Hang in there. It'll happen when you least expect it! ",null,0,cdq3zng,1rpyj1,AskReddit,top_day,1
shabawabadingdong,"I have a cheesy story, this is all true. At the age of 8, we celebrated my nieces birthday party (she is the same age as I am). She invited one of her distant cousins, that I was not related to what so ever. He is 2 years older than I am. The first time I met him was at that birthday party, we stared at each other and it was like I knew him already but, I have never met him before. We ended up talking a bit. He left early and from that day I never stopped thinking of him I guess you could say it was a little crush but, I was little so like it matter right? I didn't see him for another two years but I still thought of him. Luckily, I was spoiled so I had a phone by then. We saw each other again at my nieces birthday party. We talked the whole time, when he had to leave, he picked me up and twirled me around in circles... By then I still thought of it as a phase that I liked him. I just moved on and continued with life.
 A year and a half later I created a facebook. I was 11 he was 13.I added him on facebook and we talked all day from then on. I STILL thought of him everyday. I had no idea how he felt towards me, but I was curious. Almost 2 years after talking to him through technology for so long, I got to see him again. I jumped into his arms, we both cried as if I haven't seen him in 20 years. We flirted a bit back and forth.
Fast forward another 3 years.. I was 14 and he was 16. I still thought of him every single day. I cared for him more than I've cared for anyone else in the world. I found what love was even though I was young. I couldn't describe what it felt like. We never confessed our feelings towards each other. I decided to confront him about it. We talked it out over the phone since I didn't see him very often. His exacts words over the phone were ""I'm glad you finally said something, I've been in love with you for so long."" I was so happy from that moment. 
We ended up being in an unplanned relationship to this day hes 18 and I'm 16. We're perfectly happy together. (:

Imakemyownjam,"I heard this at my grandmother's creation, and it was one of the sweetest and saddest stories I'ver ever heard. I'll try to tell it in English.

My grandmother was born in 1923 and later on married my grandfather I thing that would be around 1950. They had 7 sons, my father being the youngest. I estimate they were married for over 30 years, before my grandfather died.

She now was a widow. When she was nearly 70 years old, she met a man again. He was a widower too and had three daughters. These daughters actually knew my grandmother already, because when they looked at photographs from their parents' youth, their mother proudly told them that the beautiful and very smart girl in the picture was their father's girlfriend before they separated(due to class difference, I believe).

So at 70 my grandmother married her first love, and my father gained three sisters. One year later though, he passed away. 

One of these step-aunts told this at the funeral, and I never really knew this before then, because all this happed before I was born. I thought it was very sweet, and a beautiful story.

While I lost my grandmother, I gained three people I mentally call aunt that day.

I did some on the job sit-ins with 911 dispatchers because that's what I thought I wanted to do when I finished high school and college.

One time I was just listening in and we get a call from an older woman, very older woman. She was crying and saying her husband was hitting her and that she was afraid he was going to kill her.

The dispatcher that was my guide for the day got a sad look on her face and went on to ask general questions. Where she was, was she hurt, what did he do, where is he?

The older woman just kept repeating that she was scared and that her husband was going to hurt her. After reassuring the woman she would be okay she transferred the older woman to another line.

The whole time I was shocked beyond belief and wondered why my guide acted the way she did and why she didn't seem to take this call seriously.

It turns out the older woman that called had dementia and her husband had been dead for some years. She still got delusions that he was alive and out to harm her. She called 911 often and there wasn't much anyone could do. We would send officers over to check on her but she was never really in any harm.

It's just weird because it's a very real thing to her and she felt real danger even if there was nothing wrong. That's got to be a huge thing for 911 dispatchers and that's why I decided I didn't want to go into that.

I ask her if she knows CPR and she says no, I convince her to let me walk her through it while we wait for EMS to get to her.

He tied his belt around the stump and crawled to his phone on the porch and called. He died with the phone in his hand.

**2)** A man locks his 2 toddlers in the bathroom, shoots his pregnant wife, calls 911 and says, ""Call my father and send police. I killed my wife and I'm going to kill myself."" He hangs up and kills himself. Police get there and hear the toddlers crying in the bathroom and they kick in the door.

Lonewolf8424,"I'm an emergency dispatcher for a company that monitors emergency elevator, help, and pool phones. I work the night shift on weekends so I get a lot of weird calls. Honestly, after a while, they all kind of blend together, but a few stick out. 

Back when I first started, I had a lawyer who was stuck in a public storage elevator call in. I ask my questions, and I'm just about to hang up and begin calling for help when she starts ranting about how she's a big fancy lawyer and is going to sue public storage and my company if she's not freed from the elevator in the next five minutes. I had to try hard not to laugh at the absurdity of threatening the only people who can help you. I believe she ended up staying in the elevator for another thirty minutes or so. Which is actually pretty quick as far as elevator entrapments go. 

Another time we got trolled hard by this one guy. Now, being a little fucker and misusing the phones isn't uncommon, but it usually amounts to some asshole kid calling, yelling, ""DICK"" into the phone and running off. This time was different. At the time, we were acting as the answering service for an elevator company. The only thing about that that's relevant is that when someone called in on that line, it wouldn't pull up the exact location of the caller. So this highly irate gentleman calls in yelling about how's he's stuck in the elevator. I'm unable to get a location message to play, and all the guy will say when asked is a nonexistent address in Manhattan. Then he starts calling me a cunt, among other colorful things. Now the elevator company I was answering for was based in Colorado, not New York. When i pointed that out, he'd just repeat the address in Manhattan he listed earlier, then rattle off the same string of insults. After about five minutes of arguing with him and becoming more and more irritated, it dawned on me that everytime he said something, he'd say it in the exact same tone and rythm. Yep. It was one of those Soundboard things. I wasn't even mad. I'd been duped by a machine. I transferred it to my supervisor and told her my Soundboard theory. The best part is that she proceeded to argue with it for another five minutes even though I told her it was a machine. There's probably a recording on YouTube somewhere.

One guy called FRANTICALLY saying that he saw the dead body of a young woman, early 20s, wearing nothing but shorts. He gave a detailed description, hair color, skin color, body position, the whole bit and said she was by the side of the interstate (in the middle of an affluent suburban area at rush hour) so we figured this had to be a really fresh crime scene. We started scrambling together officers to get there ASAP, a big hassle considering it's rush hour and they're all dealing with accidents and stuff like that. On top of that, we can't say what the issue is on the radio is because we have too many busibodies who monitor police radio, then call us to try to get juicy details, or othewise meddle. So we have to get these officers to their cars to read the computer, leaving other issues, etc. And these are suburban cops in the Midwest, a murder is a damn big deal.

goatse_is_my_father,"it's pretty lonely and boring and my best friend constantly changes (meaning, one month it'll be one person, another month a different one and so on and so forth).  I'm 31/m and pretty much been single the whole time minus a couple of years a few years ago.  some married friends still go have drinks with me occasionally, but the frequency of that has dwindled exponentially. Also, it's hard not having a wingman, I'm not the type that has just a ton of female friends, nor am I very good at meeting new ones.  I occasionally hang out w/ my ex, it's just turned into a booty call type situation.  In my early twenties when most of my friends were single, it was going out and meeting people all the time, a couple of times a week.  Now if I want to get out and do something, I go sit at bars by myself and talk to the other weirdos who do the same thing. Or I just sit at home and watch TV or fuck around on the computer. In the summer, the single people I go hang out with are typically in their early and mid 20s. It really kind of sucks.  Although there are some friends of mine that are married that their situation sucks quite a bit more.  However, it does allow me to be a lot more flexible with work.  I travel a lot for work so I don't necessarily have to ""check-in"" all the time, or ""do things my wife doesn't want me to do"" - like all the other guys I travel with do.

I mean, I'm healthy, employed, and have a roof over my head. I'm slowly but surely getting out of debt. I'm a musician who's in his element all day every day: I sell music instruments during the day, and play in one of two bands on the weekends. I don't make a lot of money, but I've got most of the stuff I need in life, and I'm doing the things I want to do, so I'm definitely a happy person (in a holistic sense).

But, I'm *lonely*. I never figured out how to connect with women, particularly the kind of connection that leads to the Warm-and-Fuzzies. Without that, nothing I'm doing or into seems to be of any real consequence or importance. I don't feel that I'm making anyone's life any better or more enjoyable in a way that only I can do. There's a part of me that wants out, but it simply can't find purchase.

I distract myself as much as I can, though. That way, I don't think about being lonely, thus I (hope I) don't show it. I mean, no one was ever attracted to someone else because that person was lonely. I practice or exercise when I've got the energy, watch movies when I don't, go hear some live music when I can afford to go out, and just keep myself busy.

frotzed,"I'm 34.  I have a large tattoo on my forearm.  It hasn't prevented me from getting a job at all.  Basically, it comes down to this: if a job is rigid enough to not allow a visible tattoo then it should be equally appropriate for me to wear a long sleeve shirt to work everyday.  

In my experience I always wear a suit to the interview.  Not one interviewer has _ever_ asked if I had any tattoos (if they asked I'd be honest).  Eventually my employer notices my tattoo if I'm not wearing a long sleeve shirt.  If the employer doesn't like it then I volunteer to wear long sleeve shirts to the office every work day.  If they don't care, I don't care either.

As far as the high school girlfriends go, I think the biggest single difference in my life would be my social circle and where I live. I think academically/professionally my path would have been pretty much the same. I think I would have went to the same undergrad school and met many of the same friends. But I think my connections with old friends back home would have continued and they would have continued to be my main social group. One hs girlfriend had a different social group so I imagine I would have gotten to know them as well; the other pretty much hung with the same groups I did back then so if it was her then I'd still be in those social groups. I still talk to them (exes and friends) but I think the main social group I roll with today would have been acquaintances I lost touch with after college. Also I probably would be living in a different neighborhood.

abetterthief,"Mainly co-worker blunders. Had one guy leave the back door of a 4 door sedan open and back it off of a 4 post lift. Post on the right rear caught the door and bent it forward till it was flush with the passengers front door. Little old lady driving it didnt seem too upset about it. We of course ended up paying for it to be repaired. 

Had another co-worker who removed all the lug-nuts off the wheel before lifting the vehicle off the ground. He hadnt even set the hoist up, just started removing nuts. Called me over because he was confused as to why he couldnt get the wheel off.

I my self have had butthole puckering moments where the lock on one of the posts of a 4 post lift stays locked, but the rest of the lift keeps lowering. In essence the vehicle starts tipping towards one direction and will keep doing so unless you lift it back up off the lock.  Did this with a BMW 5 series that rolled until the tire chucks stopped it because I wasnt paying attention. 
 
I've got more if anyone cares.

*EDIT TO ADD*

I had a coworker who forgot to take the expensive alignment head reflectors off the passenger's side of the vehicle after aligning it. Drove it around the block and somehow they managed to stay on. Luckily as they are atleast $600 a piece.

I had a service manager have one of the techs remove an air pressure regulator off our tire machine because it was too slow to fill up tires. Service manager later had his drag racing buddy bring in pure aluminum rims so they could mount some tires for him. Machine ended up completely warping the rims beyond use because there was nothing to stop it from continuously putting force on the rim. Shop ended up paying out $1300 for a new rim.

Sooo many double gaskets. So many. 

I had a 60 year old alcoholic coworker, while he was welding exhaust, accidentally weld a hole into a metal gas tank on a 1970s something-or-another(it was while ago so I cant remember what kind of vehicle. Maybe a Maverick?) Seriously starts dripping gasoline out right next to his arc. Only moments away from horrible firey disaster.

I watched the owner of the previous shop I worked for spray brake cleaner all over the underside while it was in the air, to clean up some oil. Which is no big deal its what we all do. But he did it moments before the tech working on it came back and did not tell him so. The tech was going to get the acetylene torch to cut off some exhaust shielding. It was too late to tell him before the underside of the car started on fire with a ""poof"". Luckily the tech had a water hose in front the the car to spray it down with.

Something driver related: Had a 92 Acura Integra brought in for a clunking noise. While I was lifting up the vehicle, the upper ball joint fell out of its socket. Like just fell out so the knuckle was hanging by the lower control arm and the tie rod. We tell the driver she cant drive it like this its 100% going to cause a crash. She says she will call a tow truck to come tow it away. I set the ball joint back in the socket while im lowering it so that we can atleast roll it out of the shop. While we weren't paying attention the driver grabbed her keys off of the hang up hook and drove the vehicle away never to be seen again. Thats is as dangerous as you can get.

We nicknamed a previous coworker chicken sandwich. He had just gotten lunch at Wendys and had a unwrapped chicken sandwich in his hand. Other coworker comes up behind him with a lighter and brake clean. Proceeds to light it and spray said sandwich eating coworker, which then lights sandwich eating coworkers ass on fire. Takes his sandwich and pats out the flames, then proceeds to continue eating it like nothing happened. 

Still have more if anyone is still reading.

**MOAR!**

A guy who got canned shortly after I started was fired for accidentally crashing a Landrover into the pillar between our baysl. He said he mixed up the brake pedal and the gas pedal. This was his second time doing this.

One of my shops fired a guy because we was just a full on dumbass. We had an oil ""gun"" that had a gallon meter that didnt work. This guy used only that gun for 1 whole day, basically guessing about how much oil he was putting in. No one noticed until the end of the day.  Same guy put the wrong oil filter on a Scion XB, which then fell off as he was pulling it out. A Chevy Express came back into the shop 2 days after he was canned for a complaint of  a oil leak. Guy did the oil change on that vehicle but didnt tighten down the oil filter enough and it spun off. Engine was ok just had to pay for the underbody clean up.

The scariest things that I saw pop up where what we called ""wheel offs"", or when the tech forgot to properly torque down the lugnuts. My friend did this on a Hummer H2 with 20s. Guy got down the road and his front wheel went rolling past him. My friend had completely forgotten to put the lug nuts on that wheel. My shop owner ran to his bay, grabbed the lug nuts, and threw them into the parking lot where the guy picked his H2 up from after we worked on it. Told the guy someone must have been trying to steal his rims. He was a shitty owner, had I been there I would have called him on that bullshit. 

Friend did a timing belt on a Hyundai. Started it to make sure the timing was set right and it ran fine. Sadly while doing this, the timing belt walked itself off the crank pulley and, being an interference engine, one of the valves slammed a hole through the piston. His shop owner had him put in a used engine with more miles and never told the driver what happened. 

Had a driver complain that his tail lights were not working. Explained to him that they do not come on while your daytime running lights are on and that you have to actually turn the headlights on to turn on your tail lights. He told us we didnt know what we where talking about and said he was going to bring his car to the dealer. Whatever I guess. Go embarass yourself elsewhere.

A favourite:

Weather strip Fat woman

Had a lady customer who returned to the service dept with her month-old new Saturn, stating that the rubber door seal was falling off.  

I got the work order, and sure enough the weatherstrip rubber was falling off.  I squeezed the metal in the weatherstrip so that it would pinch onto the body tighter and reinstalled it.  Since we almost never had any problems with these door seals,  I handed in the work order for my next job.

Two days later, the car is back.  Weather strip is starting to come off again.  Huh?  Ok, we source a new door seal and I install, even though the first one is still showing no adverse signs, other than hanging loose in the door frame.

Finish it off, added some trim adhesive for good measure, and paying special attention to make sure that the seal is fully pressed onto the seam around the whole door frame.  Hand in work order.

One Week later, she's baaaacckkk...  WTF?  Starting to get pissed off, my boss is starting to get pissed off at the comebacks.  Weatherstrip is hanging loose yet again.  

This time I had the chance to see the customer as she headed to the waiting area  - suffice to say that she was a large lady.

I postulated to my boss the theory that her ass was dragging across the weatherstrip every time she got in or out, and that said posterior friction was working it loose from the frame.

His words ""Fix chubbies door seal so that fucking thing never comes off again""

I decided that I was going to use windshield adhesive (urethane) to re-affix the seal.  If you've ever worked with urethane, it sticks to everything, and once dry, it holds tenaciously unless cut.  That's why it's used for windshields.

Let dry for an hour with a heater blowing on it, and send the customer on her way - my boss gave me the stick-eye as she was driving away.

Didn't see her for three months.

She rolls into the drive-thru, and my boss won't even come out of his office.  I get paged to the drive-thru.

I get to the car, and the weatherstrip is still in place - yay!  the rubber however has worn away completely down to the metal crimps inside, at ass-height at the rear of the door frame.

With her glaring at me, I stated to her ""Ms. *****, I need to tell you that your car is warranted for defects, but not for wear-and-tear.  This falls under wear and tear""

She drove away and I never saw her for anything maintenance or warranty related ever again.

That made his rims bounce around on the studs a bit, and was the reason. We checked the balance, none were out.

Second one happened a few days ago. This lady had ran her tire while it was flat and the sidewall got cut in half. Tire fell off. So she had a spare on (her husband did all that).

PraxisLD,"They tell a story in engineering class about a guy who complained his car would never start when he bought vanilla ice cream.

Any other flavor and the car started fine, but never with vanilla.

They car checked out fine, they couldn't reproduce the problem, etc., but the owner kept complaining.

Finally, they sent a tech with the customer to buy ice cream.

Turns out that all the ice cream was kept in the back of the store, except for vanilla, which had its own freezer right up front. So buying vanilla ice cream was a very quick trip, and the car wouldn't start because it was still overheated and vapor locked from the short time it was turned off.

Since the other ice cream was further back, the longer stop gave the car enough time to cool so it would start again.

Once they had changed the symptom from ""vanilla ice cream"" to ""car won't start soon after being turned off"", they were able to find the problem and fix it properly.

Real music is released in its finished form as an album. Not individual songs. Unless its pretend music pushed out JBs flacid sphincter.

I blame pop. Popculture was pushed on us, eventually most budged and started loving it just because the flood of pop flushed out real music. We had no time to wade trough the shit any more. The fact remains it is scientifically designed to be smooth and easy on our ear canals. Do we want oat meal, or chilli stir fry? 

Rant over thanks for not agreeing.


Please listen to the albums by the artists who defined musical categories. Whatever your preffered category is.


I listen mostly to melodical swedish metal, death and trash, power and polyrhytmics such as djent.

Made in Sweden(c) tells you its genuine and thought out in a fashion you wont find anywhere else in the world.
An experienced metalist will be able to tell whitin seconds where the band is from. Especially if its american (just btb). (not that american music sucks, its often really good). 

In Flames defined death metal in the early days, and continued to pave the way into melodical death metal. Any of the early albums, take your pick. 

At the Gates defined the thrash metal genre. Their album Slaughter of the soul is beyond a shadow of a doubt the most beloved and soul-enlightening creation of all time. They then evolved into The Haunted. Possibly the best band of all time.

The Haunted - Made me do it, and One kill Wonder. Just definitions of music my teenage years. Professionals, tight as hell and just perfect thrash metal. 

Meshuggah defined i guess ""djent"". I dont like the word but there really is'nt any other. Polyrhytmic deep hyper advanced death metal really.
The album Nothing did it for me. It changed my life as a drummer, and since the day it was released i have tried to master it. Tomas haake is so far beyond any other drummer and performs flawlessly every time, creating sounds and rythms that will chill your spine and wonder how a human can do that. Nothing will ever come close. Mention Dream Theatre and you dont get it. (DT are good too, but the singer is horrid and spoils it)


Other awesome albums are anything Sepultura/Soulfly. 

TL;DR

At the Gates - Slaughter of the soul. I have actually listened to this album a minimum of 8000 times.

The Haunted - Made me do it, one kill wonder

In Flames - 1994 - Lunar Strain 1995 - The Jester Race 1997 - Whoracle 1999 - Colony 2000 - Clayman are the good ones portraying their old sound. The new is good too. Great even.

Meshuggah - Nothing. The title says it all. Nothing comes close. You wont be able to speak.

Zonaria - Everything they have released so far. Awesome melodic death metal from northen sweden. It headbangs your organs inside you as well as your mind.

Down - Diary of a mad band. Think ""New Orleans is a dying whore"". Was Pantera.

Also Pantera - anything. You dont like it you are not alive.

ConfusingUsername,"I used to consider myself one, and I honestly had 3 relationships going at once, all knew the others existed, and usually would have sex with 2 of the women a minimum of 2 times a day.  Apparently they loved the arrangement due to the lack of strings, and they trusted that I wasnt going to break that bond.  They would even out source said info as well and sometimes I often found myself in new company. Oddly enough though, I had a testosterone deficiency at the time.  After a while my sex drive went from multiple times a day, to nothing.  No masterbation, no thoughts, no arousal at all really.  I have no idea when or why it happened, but I have had no desire at all for 3 years now, and honestly have to concentrate very hard if a situation arises for sex and is just selfish for me to reject the person for whatever reason.  It's amazing how completely objective everything became after that as well. Also no sperm at all, so children are out of the picture.

arkilla95,"I think my ex was a nympho. Sorry if this post seems nsfw. Anyways, she wasn't a slut at all, she was a well kept girl, would hardly talk to boys etc (not that I ever encouraged her to do such things) 
One day we are both just laughing about the song blow my whistle, then out of no where she starts ""blowing my whistle"". This is the first time her and I had any sort of intercourse. Anyways, she gave head quite often after that as she said she enjoyed making me happy. (This was way into the relationship)
I thought it wasn't fair that only I got to enjoy it, so one day once she finished, I said it was her turn, and we both had intercourse. This was the day we both lost our Vcards. We had a lot of sexual chemistry between us, and had been dating for over a year. Literally we had sex like 5 times a week, or sometimes 3 times a day. At first it was amazing, but being a human, I started to get really tired of it. It wasn't me taking advantage of how consent she was, it was actually 90% of the time her encouraging me to have sex, instead. I said yes like 90% of the time too, but believe me it isn't a dream. It doesn't feel as special unless we took like week long breaks, which was quite hard for us, some times just her. I started to feel challenged, wandered if I was a real male or not. Started to feel insecure about the fact that a woman would want more sex than me so my hormones were obviously all messed up, I started having thoughts like ""wow I must be gay"" ( I'm not actually gay)

I looked for advice on the Internet and then realised i wasn't alone, and that this actually happens in a lot of other relationships. It definitely helped afterwards. After a while things turned down so we'd have sex once a week, which was completely fine for both of us.

P.s she was 16, I was 17, so it may of just been hormones.

Sadomi,"This dream came in 2 parts back when I was 16.

There I was, sitting with the girl of my dreams. Long, luscious hair, a pure, white sundress, and a couple of stools next to a bar. She stood out form everyone else in the room, who was a faceless entity save for a few people I had seen passing by me that previous night. We sit down and we start drinking all of my favorite drinks together, and Talk about football and video games. She was my perfect girl.

Then the fun started. A faceless man ran inside the bar and screamed ""ZOMBIEEESSS"" I see my dream girl just sprint past me with a shotgun in here hand. At this point i was aware of the dream, so i just picked up a revolver off the table and unsheathed my Katana. We sprint outside to a pier where there is a huge goddamned zombie spider. I did the only sensible thing in that situation. 

I threw the spider a Beer and sat and watched the Zombie Apocalypse take over, with my Dream girl just sitting on my lap and broing it up with a 4 story spider.


Part two was in the same dream. I woke up, and my family was standing over my death bed. I felt fine and looked even better. My family and friends were crying and I'm just like ""Shit you guys look ugly crying"" Now, some guy in a 3 piece lime green suit and a pimp hat walked over and started listing off the things I hadn't done yet. The only 2 I remember well were having sex and pull off a heist. The pimp doctor told me I had an hour to live.  I sit up and haul ass outside, and I see my crush from high school. She had already heard the news, and she jumps on my back, piggyback style, and we sprint towards a bank. 

We walk in, hand the bank teller a note laced with instant heart attack powder. The teller starts to have chest pains, and then My crush goes over the counter to help her out, swiping a key in the meantime(The safe only had one physical key, no keypad or anything)  She asks for something in the vault to save the tellers life, a Golden Bamboo stick. We run into the vault to get the bamboo stick, but we lock ourselves inside instead. We cry out for help, and they can't find the key. We snicker to each other and we look at my watch. I had 9 minutes till i passed away, so we did what any virgin would do in that situation.

We awkwardly tried to make love but ended up just cuddling for 6 minutes. The grim reaper walks up to me from out of nowhere and hands me a joint. I didn't smoke at the time in real life, so I don't know why that came up all of a sudden. That's when i woke up. at 5:34 AM, 2 hours before I had to get up for school.

Mescacakanisnapesis,"""I managed to muscle in on a fishing day with my Dad and is buddy, Ted. The day started off well, I was volunteered to drive, put the boat in, pull up to the dock and park the truck while my impatient mentors sat in the boat. Once we were on the water, I was more than ready to wet a hook. We pulled across the channel to a rock wall, a favorite spot of the two old anglers. They gladly pointed me to the ""choice spot"" to fish from, the drivers seat of the boat. Strategically placing their casts, they forced me to the other side of the boat, and open water. I took advantage of my Dad when he was ""buzzed"" by a bird the size of the boat. Dad hit the deck, I checked to make sure he was OK, then snuck in a few casts on the ""prime"" side before he gathered himself. On the second cast, ""it"" hit. Out of the water jumped the biggest largemouth I had ever hooked. I reeled and kept tension like a pro as this fish exited the water another time, showing us its size and beauty. I told Dad to grab the net. He took too long reaching, fumbling, and kicking for the net. By the time he had a firm grip on the net, the fish I had worked so hard to get in the boat had freed himself from my line. Disappointed by the lost battle, Dad apologized with the biggest ""I'm so sorry"" I had ever heard. The spirit of fishing was not with us the rest of the day, as we didn't get anything else. The only thing we talked about on the way home was the ""dive bombing"" bird. My Dad passed away a few years later and at the funeral several stories were told, but one story had new light. Ted brought up our fishing trip, and what he told me brought tears of joy and sorrow. He said there were forces beyond my control keeping me from landing the ""bragging rights"" fish that day. He then told me that when Dad was reaching for the net, he paused to look at Ted and winked-this fish wasn't going to make it in the boat. Tears rolled and as I walked over to his casket, I remembered that award winning line, ""I'm so sorry"". But now, I knew he meant, ""I gotcha""!",null,0,cdpoxm1,1rq25j,AskReddit,top_day,3

He would text me a bit for the whole month of June and I would answer for a bit and then stop. Just thought it of it as nothing. Then I had someone close to me pass and I mentioned it to him in a text one day. For a stranger, he said so much that actually helped me through this rough time, more than any of my close friends had said. So I decided to give it a shot and go out to dinner with him. Our first date lasted 7 hours. I had never met someone who I just instantly clicked with. Felt like I finally understood what people meant by that stupid love at first sight thing. We spent the entire date just talking non stop. We spent the next 3 weeks hanging out everyday, met his family, met his friends. Then summer was over and I had to move 3 hours back to school for my final year. He was 25 and had a full time job so we couldn't see each other too much. He visited me twice and we talked everyday for 3 months. Then he slowly stopped answering. Our plans fell apart. Then one day he just sent me a message saying he was done, and he was sorry. That's it. Haven't seen or heard from him since.

In reality he was communicating in a healthy, mature, and correct manner for a kid.  Years later his mom said he gets so embarrassed when she uses his nickname in public.  (I wish I had told him as he sat by me that when his mom teases him or affectionately calls out to him, it just shows how much he's loved.)

nojustice,"One of the few useful things I learned from a ""driver re-education"" class I had to take one time was that every feeling we experience has a finite lifetime in our brains. The neurochemicals that are released when we feel happy or sad or angry or aroused or need a drink quickly fade away again, **unless we keep re-activating the pathways that released them in the first place**. This is why they tell you to ""count to ten"". But it's not enough to just count to ten and let the time pass; you have to also not keep triggering the emotion. The way that I like to think about it is that i experience whatever emotion it is, I let it have its moment, and then I let is pass. It's like I neither suppress it nor reinforce it, but rather let it pass over me. 

You will find your own way of dealing with it, but just remember that each emotion only lasts a few seconds to half a minute. Any more than that is you choosing to keep feeling it. All you have to do is choose not to. (I say ""all you have to do"", but I understand it's not as easy as that. It takes practice and it takes intention, but it can be done) ",null,0,cdppl3m,1rq3gy,AskReddit,top_day,1

That's clinical but more anecdotal also involves reasons for different individuals wanting to be in a different state of mind.  Some people can't face the day sober or will drink to be more social in situations where they usually aren't.  It all depends on the person.

Lisaland,"I broke up with my boyfriend of nine months after his girlfriend informed me she had been with him the last three years, and they were still together.  Swore to me he wouldn't see her.  Showed up unannounced and she was there, on the couch, next to him.  Broke up again.  Refused to talk to him.  Over the course of the next six weeks, he broke into my house, poured water down the back of my 52"" plasma tv, stole items of emotional value, stalked me, keyed my car that I had bought six months ago and reported to my boss I was selling drugs out of her office.  (Not true). Endless texts and phone messages at all hours.  Finally got a Stalking Protective Order when he left a voicemail message that said ""I'm going to kill you bitch"". 

He spent 30 days in jail and got out after pleading to a class A Felony.   No previous felonies or jail time.

Left me alone for four months.  Then texts and messages started arriving from unknown and blocked numbers.  Begging me to meet him so he could say he was sorry and return my stuff.  Three weeks of this.  In retrospect I should have reported him for violating SPO, which carries a mandatory minimum.  But I didn't.  Foolishly enough, I met him with the hope of getting my stuff back and that he would then leave me alone.

Ended up dating him again for about three weeks, then realized he was still the same pathetic loser I could never be happy with.  When he showed up to take me out last Saturday night as prearranged, I just couldn't do it.  I just didn't want to be with him.  Not even for dancing and drinking.  He hung out two hours hours while I did other stuff, and finally said he was going hone, he was tired.  Great.  Finally.  I then left for some pool at my favorite bar.

Ran into, what I thought was, his ex.  Nope.  We started talking and sharing texts and pics only to discover he had never broken up with her!  He literally was either with her or me, leaving my house for hers and vice versa!  While chatting she receives a text from him inviting her over for movies.  I said of course he did, I cancelled on him!  We decide to set him up.  She replies she'll be right there.  Then I text him saying I changed my mind and decided to come over.  He then texts her and says something came up, gotta cancel.

We arrive at his home arm in arm, a united front, both deciding neither of us want to be with the lying, cheating, idiot.  We also commit to supporting each other as friends.  

While all three of us are standing there, and she is civilly laying it out, I start looking around and thinking about all he hurt I've allowed him to cause me, and I started loosing it.  I did something I've never done before.  In an act of pure freedom, hurt, anger, and self loathing, I threw my arm out in a wide sweep, taking out a lamp, tv, and Bose speaker system, that all crashed to he ground, complete with the sound of breaking glass.  He threw me on the ground.  He pinned me.  We exchanged punches.  He is screaming at his adult niece, who lives with me to call he cops.  His ex and niece are screaming back that if she does he will go to jail because of the SPO.   They repeatedly order him to let me go. I manage a few feet every so often towards the front door until he rep ins me.  Finally I break free and we are out of there!

So me and his other girlfriend go to my place and stay up talking until 4 am.  Real life plot twist:  she's been MARRIED for the last ten years!

Sunday afternoon the sheriffs office calls.  Apparently he demanded we both be arrested and jailed for assault, burglary, and that I pay restitution!  We talked a very long time, and he also called the other chic he was seeing, that I was with.

Monday morning he was arrested on SPO violation, and he remains in jail.  The cop I spoke to sounded more than amused when I shared my part of the event, and assured me none of the females involved were going to jail.

I am 51, in fact, all three of us are.  I own my own home and have worked in the lea gal field for over 30 years.  I'm a Notary Public for Gods sakes!

This was my first relationship in 8 years.  Being single the rest of my life doesn't sound so bad .

I had sex with one of them a couple of weeks ago (big mistake although I did it cause the guy likes me), and my ex found out. He acted really weird and ended up having sex with someone else. Then he came to me telling me that he could only think of being with me from then on. Fast forward 3 days, we were back to being just exes with benefits again. This is ongoing...

Meth_Useler,"Steve Martin: If I had one wish that I could wish this holiday season, it would be for all the children of the world to join hands and sing together in the spirit of harmony and peace.

If I had two wishes that I could wish for this holiday season, the first would be for all the children of the world to join hands and sing in the spirit of harmony and peace.. and the second would be for $30 million a month to be given to me, tax-free in a Swiss bank account.

You know, if I had three wishes that I could make this holiday season, first, of course, would be for all the children to get together and sing.. the second would be for the $30 million every month to me.. and the third would be for all encompassing power over every living being thing in the entire universe.

And if I had four wishes that I could make this holiday season, first would be the crap about the kids.. second would be for the $30 million.. the third would be for all the power.. and the fourth would be to set aside one month each year for an extended 31-day orgasm, to be brought about slowly by Rosanna Arquette and that model Paulina somebody, I can't think of her name, of course my lovely wife could come, too. She's behind me 100% on this, I guarantee you.

Wait a minute, maybe that sex thing should be the first wish! So, if I made that the first wish, because, you know, it could all go boom tomorrow, and then what have you got? No, no.. the kids singing would be great, that would be nice. No, no, who am I kidding! I mean, theyu're not gonna be able to get all those kids together! I mean, the logistics of the thing is impossible! It's mroe trouble than it's worth! So, we reorganize: here we go. First, the sex - we go with that; second, the money. No! We go with the power second, then the money, and then the kids. Oh, wait, oh geez! I forgot about revenge against my enemies! Okay.. revenge against all my enemies, they should die like pigs in Hell! That would be the fourth wish! And of course, my fifth wish would be for all the children of the world to join hands and sing in the spirit of peace and harmony. Thank you, everybody.

Something I am doing this year is definitely my research. Depending on what you are looking to buy, I would check online for prices first.

You can always check craigslist too... sometimes I've found brand new things on there for cheap.

Also, homemade gifts are great! I'll probably be baking a lot this year. It's slightly embarrassing that I can't afford to buy the gifts I really want, but the thought it was matters (yes it's cliche, but it's the truth!).

ThatsSoDorian,"I was a cook at a Sonic Drive-In in small town Iowa. I mean, I hated it, but there were also some fun stories that I took away from it. 

1) There was a guy--Luke--who was a redneck slacker. You'd ask him to do something, he would make you explain it six times until you get up and did it yourself then later brag about how he got out of work. I hated working with him, and so did everyone else. 

Fall rolls around and school was starting again. We were open until 11. Despite being 16 at the time, I was closing 4 or 5 nights a week. I liked the money, but pulling 37 hour weeks while in high school and living at home is a tad extreme. What made it infuriating to me was that they never announced the closers. Managers just told cooks to go home at random intervals until there were two left. It was like a gameshow from hell. But somehow, it was always me and Luke and Luke always got out of it saying he had a big test tomorrow or he'd close next time. It was bullshit that I had to close until midnight four days a week because he had other things to do. One night, the manager told him at the start of the shift ""Luke, you're closing tonight. Thatssodorian has closed for the last three."" His response: ""I can't. My mom won't let me close."" Spat ensues with the manager, and she lets him go around 9:30 under the stipulation that his mother calls and explains to her why her son can't close. 

Once he leaves, about 20 minutes goes by, and the phone rings. Manager answers, a few ""uh-huh""s later, the conversation ends. ""That was Luke's mom."" pause ""There was no way that girl was over 16."" So she got out Luke's application, and called his home number to speak to his real mom. She made no such rule. In fact, he doesn't come home until 1 am claiming that he was closing every night. So yeah, I closed that night (for the 4th time in a row), but I closed with a plainly visible justice boner. 

2) I had a coworker quit by changing his voicemail to ""Fuck you. I quit."" and not coming into work.

3) One of the cooks, we'll call him Jeff, was a self-described fuck up. Military background but left after a tour (I think--he was vague on the details), currently working as a cook, dreamed of opening a car stereo shop in my town. Nice guy, if a little coarse. 

When I worked with him, he'd always say things like ""Yeah, I'm good at this because I've been doing it so long. I don't like it, but I'm okay with it. Every now and again, we hire kids and they're really fucking smart, you know. If I can scare one of those smart kids to doing something better with their life, like my life as an example, like you don't want to end up like me, man. Like, thatssodorian, you're pretty fuckin' smart, you know. There's nothing glamorous or rewarding about this job, and you gotta go do something better when you grow up.""

This story has a little less of a plot, I guess. I just still remember Jeff, and his ""Don't fuck up your life like I did"" speeches. I don't know if he ever opened a shop. I occasionally Google his name and find nothing. I doubt he'd even remember me. But as a 16 year old kid in Iowa, I remember him pretty vividly. 

It wasn't a glamorous job at all. I worked shit hours and got paid $5.25/hour, but I had some laughs, some fights, and eventually rage-quit for a better job that didn't involve fry oil.",null,8,cdps5vg,1rq58k,AskReddit,top_day,25

I don't understand why everyone assumes they're dirty, some are but like i said any self respecting person with dreads takes care of them, even going through great lengths to do so (special oils, shampoos, and other junk)

On the flip side some people who are impatient or ignorant to natural dreads will put dread wax in their hair to achieve the look with uniformity in size and shape. this method is fast and somewhat reversible, but the wax will cause the dreads to pick up dirt and other gross stuff over time and holds water, causing mildew. If you see gross looking dreads they're probably these type, which do not clean easily and in fact attract grossness.

tl;dr: Natural dreads can be washed weekly quite easily and are usually clean. Waxed dreads (cheater dreads) on the other hand don't clean easily and attract dust and dirt and other crud. They also need a TON of maintainence.",null,1,cdpw2me,1rq5v3,AskReddit,top_day,4

Or is it more like the United Nations, where I would be the central figure over different heads of states (Only with some sort of power over the other nations)?  If the world is unified, does that mean internal conflicts between all countries have ended?  Is there a centralized military, or is that up to me to dismantle previous national militias and create a (scaled down) World Police force?  

Regardless of those issues:
Generate incentive based funding for Energy, Science (Including Space exploration), Transportation, Environmental remediation, Medical exploration, and Global nutrition/Clean water.  (Similar to the Gates Foundation model)

Begin cultural campaign to diminish importance of collecting material wealth while promoting the benefits and status of people who help their neighbors.
Aaaaand...since all countries are all unified, the now unified world bank means tax havens and loopholes are much easier to close.  

Massive reforms to copyright legislation.

Education reform, in that standardized curriculum is pared way down.  Teachers and Professors are in charge of determining their curriculum, best teaching methods for their classes.  Curriculum is encouraged to teach practical life skills expanded to encourage appreciation of nature and manual labor (home-ec, Shop, gardening, basic animal husbandry).  

Drug reform.  Legalized, quality controlled, heavily taxed, provide safe places to use and dispose.  Black market sales of tainted quality risk life in prison or execution.

Correctional institute reform.  It needs to reform prisoners.  Teach useful life skills.  After following a curriculum of basic life skills the capstone to their learning, is to develop a life plan for once they leave the prison.  Allow them to work while incarcerated (auto repair, farming, computer programming, etc) and apply that money toward their life-plan, such that they can more easily transition between release and regular life.

Healthcare.  Eeeeesh, what a cluster.  Unhealthy lifestyle choices are taxed heavier (cigarettes, alcohol, junk food, sugars / desserts).  Procedures for people unwilling to make lifestyle changes will have their treatment priorities diminished and/or their co-pay will be increased.     

Tax Reform.  Taxes are flat, and based on consumption, not earnings.  Luxury items and items that require more natural resources are taxed heavier.

Prostitution is legalized.  Men/Women must be of consenting age, tested every few weeks.  Taxation offsets clinical costs of test/treatment.  Pimps for underage children are given life sentences or executed.  

Zero tolerance for religions that preach or practice violence.  Anyone who kills others for religious reasons will be executed and have their remains publicly desecrated, according to their religion (pigs blood, excommunication, whatever).

aught-o-mat,"When I was 13, I sucker punched an 'annoying' kid at a Boy Scout meeting. Right in the guts. I couldn't tell you why, exactly. It remains the only time I've ever struck someone with harmful intent. 

And I hit harder than I meant to.  He doubled over and collapsed onto the gymnasium floor. Before I'd time for regret, I was afraid. I thought I'd caused serious injury. He was screaming. 

One of the scout leaders came over. I assumed I was in trouble, but his anger was for the boy on the floor. ""Come on! Get up! Don't just take it!"" It was his father. 

I don't think he was encouraging a fight, he just wanted us to quit the scuffling. What he didn't grasp was that I'd just gut punched his son and knocked the wind out of him for *no apparent reason*. 

In the end, he was fine. It was just cruel, inexplicable, kid stuff. But it's that kid stuff that can be formative. It sticks with you. And this certainly stuck with me. 

20 years on, I saw him at a community picnic while visiting my parents. Now a volunteer with the scouts, he was in uniform and working with kids. It was a perfect time to offer a long overdue apology. 

I sought him out, but somehow lost him. I asked everyone - including his father - if he was still around, but wasn't able to connect. I wanted to tell him that I'm sorry for, and still regret what I did then. And that whenever the ""what's the worst thing"" trope comes up in conversation (or on Reddit) I think of him.

 Personally, and this is just me, but the entire winter holiday thing is supposed to be about togetherness, appreciating what you have, and helping others. The only of those three main tenets that is touched upon in this Black Friday garbage is togetherness, and even then only in the sense of ""TOGETHER WE CAN DEMOLISH THIS BARRICADE AND GET TO THE TASTY DEALS WITHIN"" And you better believe that as soon as that barricade raises or comes down, all semblance of cohesion is lost as everyone starts running around, grabbing, shoving, and fighting like fucking retards. 

What it comes down to is that this behavior speaks ill of Americans as a whole. A casual observer may believe that we are incapable of acting in a manner resembling civility. Having worked in 3 different types of store over the course of 5 holiday seasons, I am inclined to agree. You always roll the dice with customer interaction, it comes with the territory. But in my experience, Black Friday dice are weighted to roll snake eyes. The ability to get a TV at half price or what have you seems to bring out the worst in people. Not just in their wanton destruction of whatever retail environment they may currently inhabit, but their treatment of other people as well. I'd never heard someone actually call a person a cunt with intent to insult until Black Friday. (Granted, I swear like a sailor, and jokingly throw that word around like it's ""and"" but here you will find that it is the baddest of words, for some reason.) I have seen groups of people break out swinging when told we are out of stock on a high demand item. Stealing shit out of other peoples carts. No civilized person should be acting this way.

Granted, not everyone acts this way, even among those who are habitual Black Friday shoppers. I met quite a lot who were just out, didn't like the packed stores or long lines but couldn't afford high price gifts if they didn't get them at a Black Friday sale, and really wanted to get them. These folks were more often than not courteous and understanding, and the ones that weren't didn't force it too terribly. These folks are exempt from my rant. They may go and do whatever they must today with no ill will from me. 

There's a lot more to my hatred of Black Friday than listed above, but those are the main points. It's not all bad as an idea, but(**TL;DR**) it attracts all the wrong kinds of people and causes them to behave in a way that I find fucking reprehensible. ",null,0,cdpshrq,1rq6vq,AskReddit,top_day,1

fabbricator,"Best and worst, all in one.

Went on a solo motorcycle tour from CA to mid-west.  I've done this trip several times.  I always get the first leg in in one day: so cal to Denver.  It's 1000 miles exactly.  Now, motorcyclists usually make this out to be some sort of super-achievement, but honestly, 1000 miles in a day isn't a big deal at all.

Anyway, I left at 4am, things were going great.  I'm on my Honda VFR with aftermarket padded seat, full custom leather suit.  Enjoyed seeing the sun rise when i was passing Neveda.

By the time I got to Utah, it got real cold.  Pulled over, and rest for a bit.  Have some breakfast... which attributed to the ""worst"" part of the story.

This is the first time I eat on the first part.  Unfortunately, I didn't count on suffering food coma... worst yet, food coma while going at 80mph on the interstate isn't good.  

By the time I got closer to colorado, I was dozing off on the motorcycle.  I am now an hour west of Grand Junction, Colorado.  I realize I am not gonna be able to make to Denver today.  I will get a hotel room in Grand Junction, it's on the way, and only an hour away.  Or, I can go out of my way and get a room in Moab Ut.

I booked it for Grand Junction.

I was now riding half dozing off, half awake.

By the time i open my eyes, i was already in the center divider of highway 70.  Speedo says 75MPH.  There's dirt and dried brush ahead.  I let go of the throttle (hitting the brake while at speed, in loose dirt is a bad idea) but the bushes came up faster than expected and there's no way I can dodge it.  

Front wheel of the bike hit the bush, twists the handle bar immediately, and I flew off the bike.  I did a few flips before hitting the ground, and a few more flips after hitting the ground.  

At this point, i was afraid the bike was going to catch up with me.  Thankfully, it stopped about 10 feet behind me.

now the good part:

The traffic stopped, and many people got out of their vehicles to help.  I couldn't move, so they held up a blank over me to shield me from the sun.  It was just after lunch time, so the sun is pretty brutal.

Ambulance came, and took me to the hospital.

Amazingly, after an accident like that all i had was a sprang ankle.

While contemplating what to do next, one of the drivers who stopped to help at the accident showed up.  He offered me the spare bedroom at him and his wife's house, and I took him up on it.  Seeing that it's already late in the afternoon, and i have no transportation (bike was towed away, it will start, but unrideable).  He let me stayed overnight at his place, and drove me to pick up my motorcycle at the tow yard (he had a truck and trailer).  Some times, strangers will do good things for travelers, no string attached.

Called a buddy of mine after picking up the bike and he drove up from so cal to pick up me and the bike.








If there ever was a ""priceless"" commercial, this would be it:  

* $3000 custom leather suit
* $400 helmet
* $300 leather gloves
* $400 boots

walking away from a motorcycle going 75mph to 0 mph in 2 seconds... priceless.

LonelyFrenchFry,It is all apart of American mythology stemming from the Declaration of Independence and the American Revolutionary War. Even though England had a parliamentary system of government blaming the woes of the people on a group didn't ignite the same firey passion for independence as did blaming one man. The Declaration of Independence put blame for the ill treatment on King George III. This myth reinforced the ideology that a single person with too much power leads to great evil and the United States Constitution took measures to prevent tyranny from ever taking root in the new union.,null,0,cdpqj4x,1rq7a1,AskReddit,top_day,6

Be prepared for an emotional rollercoaster.  Not all divorces are bitter struggles, but don't rule by exception.  You may lose friends.  You may lose family.  You may lose material things that are important to you.  You may lose money - a lot of money - depending on your situation.   

I guess what it really comes down to is making sure that you'll look at your divorce without regret.  So before you commit, reflect and make sure that you truly feel as though your life will be better without being attached to your SO.  You must be prepared to permanently separate no matter what the cost.  ",null,0,cdpqx7l,1rq848,AskReddit,top_day,3

At some point in our lives, related to out marriages or not, we all have to realize that we cannot control other people. We cannot make people do something we want them to, regardless. Giving up that desperate struggle for power and control is the first day of the rest of your life. It will positively influence every interpersonal relationship from then on.

And regarding a suicidal SO, when I left, I called my dad to come help me leave and I called his brother to come and stay with him after I left. He downed a ton of pills anyways but it just made him sick. We both realized that night we couldn't control each other anymore. I couldn't keep him from trying and he couldn't keep me emotionally trapped in the relationship. We both married other people and he seems to be happy now. I am too- i learned so much about myself.

studio595,"**Alabama**: Like many southern states, a warm southern Mother figure with a dark, dark past.

**Alaska**: Little bit of Canadian in their blood, so there's some kindness but like the state itself--cold. 

**Arizona**: Not quite California, Not quite Nevada, Not quite Texas. Serious parent issues.

**Arkansas**: Oklahoma's twin that doesn't get enough attention so has to act up with its ""tornados."" (Not trying to downplay tornados, that shit is serious and I don't mean to offend). 

**California**: Superiority complex with a little bit of valley girl thrown in their for good measure. 

**Colorado**: Stoners. 

**Connecticut**: as /u/pspencer1841 stated, ""Connecticut would be very starkly bipolar.""

**Delaware**: Surrounded by two very foul places--New Jersey and Philadelphia. Asking for more attention. Please, please help.

**Florida**: America's penis. Has major trauma because of this. Recluse, but has a rough streak. 

**Georgia**: Another kind southern bell, but also with a dark past. A peachy exterior with a pit of pure evil (heh). 

**Hawaii**: Everyone loves Hawaii, and it knows it. Can be a real jerk because of it.

**Idaho**: Potato Potato Potato pot--cold as fuck. But a really nice guy once you get to know him.

**Illinois**: This dude is just full of wind.

**Indiana**: I could give 500 reasons why he's a pretty cool guy, but you just can't get over his steely gaze. 

**Iowa**: French? So by proxy, an asshole.

**Kansas**: Oklahoma's hat. A really kind soul. 

**Kentucky**: I mean come on, its shaped like a piece of fried chicken. So you know this girl has bound to be a motherly figure. 

**Louisiana**: And again, a southern bell with a dark past. Also she was dating some French guy for awhile there. She was pretty bitchy during that time...

**Maine**: Lawbstah. A wise seaman. 

**Maryland**: A small, old state, that just wants to be loved and for its kids to call it once in awhile.

**Massachusetts**: Another kind soul, but has a pronunciation problem.

**Missouri**: A miserable, miserable fellow. 

**Montana**: Sort of spread out all over the place. 

**Nebraska**: Who cares about Nebraska, there's like 4 people living there. 

**Nevada**: The fun dad state. He lets you stay up all night and have fun. But wont care about you in the morning. 

**New Hampshire**: Vermont's exact doppelganger. 

**New Jersey**: Faggedaboutit. This dude will rough you up.

**New Mexico**: Quiet, but if you piss them off, they'll go all Heisenberg on your ass.

**New York**: California's nemesis. Sort of a major asshole, but can be kind at times. 

**North Carolina**: Home of Steven Colbert. Automatically the coolest kid in town. 

**North Dakota**: Basically Canada. So a pretty nice guy.

**Ohio**: A sandwich of Indiana and Pennsylvania. It wants you to call more often as well. 

**Oklahoma**: OOOOOOOOKLLLLLLAAAAAAA-dusty dusty dusty. 

**Oregon**: Trying to be as cool as California, but as refined as Washington. But its got Portland going for it, which is good. 

**Pennsylvania**: Generally a nice guy, but soured because of Pittsburgh. 

**Rhode Island**: So much populous for so little land. A nice guy, but can be pretty rude during the fall seasons. 

**South Carolina**: Another southern bell that just wants to feed you.

**South Dakota**: Like North Dakota, also pretty much Canada. A nice guy at times, but pretty airy. 

**Tennessee**: A loud and proud singer, with a streak of violence. 

**Texas**: Big man on campus. Kind and warm, but piss him off, and there will be hell to pay.

**Utah**: Its over-abundant kindness is a ploy. Its hiding something. Beware.

**Vermont**: New Hampshire's exact Doppelganger. 

**Virginia**: The oldest, and wisest. But evil lurks. 

**Washington**: Refined, but is a real prick in the morning. 

**West Virginia**: Another sandwich that wants to be a big boy state like Virginia. 

**Wisconsin**: Again, basically Canada. But the nicest fellow you will ever meet.

rhythmforest,"**I believe quite a bit of it has to do with ego.**

They want to soften the situation or avoid the discomfort because it's not just an uncomfortable situation - it's also a miniature pandora's box of self-doubt and questioning for some people. 

If someone knows and has to own up to being responsible for something negative, they may have to face the fact that they don't always have all of the answers. They may smart to question whether or not they are smart, brave, responsible, etc.

It's natural to want to protect your self-esteem.

As for facing a situation - again discomfort. We are creatures of comfort and habit. We enjoy happiness and positive sensations. Just as the majority of people have an aversion to physical pain and will go great lengths to avoid it, some people have aversions to social pain and avoid situations that they may see as potentially painful. (Situations involving rejection and/or the questioning of their abilities, decisions, etc. and therefore who they are as a person.)

Of course, often if people would just face the situation or answer the question concisely, they would probably suffer less, but they don't consider the consequences in the future. With the people who do it to me, I've noticed it's somewhat of a knee-jerk reaction for them as a means to try and avoid what they don't realize is ultimately inevitable.

Amadeus3698,"To preempt some criticism (which I welcome; my goal is to foster discussion) I will state that I am American and have been since birth and my family has a long history in the US.  This discussion was prompted by discussions last night with my family.  My discussion here will focus on the US however, but I am sure people from other countries will agree that things are similar in their own countries.  I encourage people to add to what I have or rebut my points.  After all, I can be wrong too, but please keep it civil.  You can still disagree without being profane or attacking me personally. 

The things that I think need improvement in the US:

1.	A culture of consumerism – one of the huge reasons why businesses have grown so large and influential is that we have let them do so.  One example is the existence of “Black Friday” and its encroachment into Thanksgiving.  Every year people rush to stores to save a few hundred dollars on Christmas gifts; I find the idea of fighting someone for the bare-bones model of a plasma TV and waiting in line for an hour to buy it to be asinine.  No one needs something that badly and all the deaths and serious injuries each year are senseless.  I feel sorry for the unfortunate souls that have to work these stores over night and deal with insane customers the next day instead of enjoying the company of their families for Thanksgiving.
2.	Failure to perform one’s civic duty – the social contract that all Americans have with their government is that the power of the government is derived from them not the other way around.  A government that does not serve its people is not a legitimate government.  Many Americans fail to stay informed about what is going on.  I am not saying that you need to follow all the happenings of the world but you should know what your local and state governments are doing in a general sense.  Also, investigating candidates before voting for them and not just voting along party lines is also your duty
3.	Lack of accountability and oversight of government – do you know who your state and federal representatives are in your state’s legislature and in Congress?  Do you know what this person does/did before becoming a politician?  Probably not.  A majority of politician are probably “good” in that that they aren’t embezzling or conveniently awarding contracts to a relative’s company or their own, but this happens sometimes.  A politician can construct the law so that they and/or their family comes out on top.  It’s hard to do anything after the fact because it’s “legal”.  The recent fiasco of the healthcare law should be lesson that someone needs to be watching and guiding this process.
4.	Lobbying – this the most deleterious and the result of the previous three points.  They are inherently self-interested.  Groups like the NRA, AARP, Cassidy and Associates, and many other have undue influence over governmental affairs.  Lobbying has its place, but its power has grown unchecked and much of what goes on is obscured so that the laity cannot understand what is going on.  People should be allowed to form groups to request their representatives help with an issue, but the representative should not be pressured because those groups might not support them in the next election or actively undermine them later.
5.	Elections/gerrymandering – in this technologically advanced country, elections should all be by popular vote; the Electoral College is archaic and is no longer needed.  In this way the person who is truly favored by the people is the one in office and not the one who’s good a playing the system.  The same is true for gerrymandering; carving out safe districts so that the same people continually get elected leads to stagnation in the government.  Campaign finance needs to be reformed.  There is no need to spend tens of millions of dollars on a campaign; election campaigns should be funded from taxes and private donations should be banned.  The defense that contributing to elections is freedom of speech is weak; your First Amendment rights end where someone else’s begins and downing out other voices because you can write a bigger check is not respecting other’s rights.
6.	Blindly following – just because your pastor, parent, church, political party, news channel, or other “authority” says something does not make it true.  You must think for yourself and not let others tell you how to vote.  It is your right and no one else’s; any arguments to the contrary are inherently false.  I have had friends in college tell me she votes in line with her parents because they support her financially and her father knows which candidate is best so that he won’t hurt financially.  This again shows lack of civic duty on her part; she should investigate for herself.  In the end, she may decide to vote the same way her parents do, but at least she decided to do it.  Another good example is the war in Iraq.  At its beginning, if you did not support the war, you were viewed as un-American.  The Dixie Chicks are a good illustration of how an essentially brainwashed fan base ended their music career (granted the girls should have known, but still).  I doubt many of the people that hated them knew anything about what was going on in Iraq and to this day still probably don’t understand what went on.
7.	Lack of foresight – years of borrowing has left the federal government in disarray and threatens to destabilize the economy.  Never should the government been allowed to borrow so much money.  Government services should be paid for through taxes; if you don’t want more taxes then you get fewer services.  Borrowing money to pay for these is poor financial planning on the part of politicians; they should not be advocating for plans that they then don’t want to fund by increasing taxes.  As a nation, we must choose, lots of services and higher taxes or fewer services and lower taxes; the balance must be found.
8.	Being distracted by hot button issues – gay marriage, abortion, entitlement programs, and others are all important topics that need to be settled, but for any of them to be the constant focus of discussion or a deciding factor in who you vote for is foolish.  “The gays” aren’t going to destroy America by getting married.
9.	Policing the world – it is not the job of the US to fix every problem in the world and we should stop trying to because it is bankrupting the nation.  That is not to say that I don’t care about the people of Syria, Libya, Haiti, or whatever other country seems to be on the brink of collapse, but we should be encouraging the UN and other nations to facilitate this.
10.	Arm-twisting – no other country exerts as must influence unilaterally as the US.  Economics is how the US manipulates weaker countries into forming partnerships that are mostly in favor of US business.  Also, subversive actions by American intelligence has played a large part.  Go to Wikipedia and look at the numerous things that the CIA has done in Latin America.  The people of these countries know this and American arm-twisting is a major reason for a lot of disdain abroad.

The good this is that you can find them on Ebay in their refurbished store: [http://www.ebay.com/itm/Monster-Inspiration-Noise-Isolating-Over-Ear-Headphones-Black-Refurbished-/121146038132?pt=US_Headphones&amp;hash=item1c34ddd774](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Monster-Inspiration-Noise-Isolating-Over-Ear-Headphones-Black-Refurbished-/121146038132?pt=US_Headphones&amp;hash=item1c34ddd774) for 99$ which is better.

I was left by my fiancée a little over a month ago while I was at work. I assumed our relationship was happy as ever. I see that I was wrong now and due to a conversation we had a week ago I stopped thinking ""what if"" and started thinking ""what now"". I got the absolution I needed.

Until about four days after when some truly unfortunate circumstances led her new phone number to be linked to the iMessages app on my phone. I told her immediately, that I was receiving both her incoming and outgoing texts, and she told me she'd take care of it. They stopped for all of four hours. Then I started receiving sexts from her, and some guy.

Let me get it straight here; this relationship was a marriage, kids, years and years of straight honest love between the two of us. It has not yet been more than six weeks and she's already fucking someone else, sexting saying the exact same words she used to say to me.

I put a stop to that in all of 30 seconds. Still enough to get a tiny discourse between the two. Called her, went off on her, called the dude, told him to keep it to Facebook until that whore actually fixes this issue and to BE FUCKING CAREFUL with her, then called her back and went off some more.

This occurrence has crept into my mind every minute of every day since. How indecent she was. How hurt I was. She told me she wouldn't be seeing anyone for ""a very very long time"", so what, she just lied to make herself look like less of a selfish cunt?

mrs2208,"Bradley has stage 4 high risk neuroblastoma which started in his adrenal gland above his left kidney. The tumour is so big it puts pressure on major organs and arteries which at one point made it very dangerous. The cancer has spread to his chest, lungs, lymph nodes, bone and bone marrow. 

Bradley is already onto his 5th lot of chemo in which he is coping extremely well with. We have been told that Brad has a long way to go and it's going to be a rough ride but my baby is a fighter so the least I can do is fight it with him no matter how much I'm hurting.

High risk neuroblastoma has up to 80% relapse rate if cured the first time and the UK don't have no relapse treatment, this would mean having to take Brad abroad to pay for treatment therefor any fundraising you can do no matter how little or how big would be appreciated. If Brad doesn't need the money it would then go to someone who does. 

Please help my baby get through this horrible disease xx




This is copied from his appeal website. He is a local boy who was diognosed in january this year. He is now on his 6th lot of chemo. A few weeks ago his body couldnt take no more and he ended up in intensive care after having his lungs drained. He has only just been taken off his ventorlater and tonight he has be allowed back to his normal ward. He is awake and eating icepops while watching santa films. He is still seriously ill amd dying yet our own country wont help him if he relapses. If that happens they need £500,000 to take him to the USA just to stand a chance of living.

There are more options for bigger range of audiences.  For those who has childish fun, they can try the mainstream r/funny or r/aww, and they are still pretty damn good.

Doctor who fans can go to r/doctor who for memes, which represents culture and those who are genuinely  interested in discussion can go to r/gellifry.

I was happy, secure in my warm and cozy world of shitty reposts. 


Then I found 9gag. ""Like, OH EM GEE,"" I could be heard squealing. ""Le 9gags is teh GEM of the internet."" I was a cool kid. But soon I tired of 9gag, and its limited content. I found Reddit.


At first, Reddit was too confusing. All those links, all those things called ""subreddits,"" that weird thing called ""karma."" I shied away from the front page and the defaults. I found comfort in f7u12, the diarrhea of everything reddit has to offer. Yet I loved le rage comics, sympathizing with forever alone guy, asking my mother ""Y U NO cook dinner?"" It was a dark time.


But as I grew more comfortable with Reddit, I crept into the default subs. First r/funny, then r/pics. AskReddit soon became my go-to sub. I even experienced a world beyond default. I saw r/mildly interesting and r/foodporn. It was a love affair, but abusive. I tried to leave Reddit in search of a better future. But Reddit kept calling me back, keeping me up at night, refusing to let me work. A few days ago, Reddit finally held me down and forced me to make an account.

Enderdejorand,"**I've always felt lucky that when I was little, I came to live with my dad.**

My mom didn't have a lot of money, is pretty much an alcoholic, and has been involved with drugs on and off throughout her life. Around my third birthday, her sister came down with cancer, and she went to Florida to take care of her during her final days. My dad didn't believe her sister was sick, and he refused to let her take me. He assumed that if she left with me, he'd never see his son again, so he immediately went to the courts to petition for custody. 

My dad's a lot more stable than my mom. He's always had a job while I was growing up and is relatively well off money-wise. He's always been really willing to help people with his money if he can. For example, when my half-siblings (from my mom's first marriage) went to college, he helped pay a decent amount of their education costs. He's also helped keep my mom afloat so she can have an apartment. 

But he's never really let me feel like I didn't have to work to get a benefit. For instance, in high school I wanted to take art classes on the weekends, to get formal training on top of my school work. For me, it was a pretty big cost: almost $200 for a semester of weekend classes. I had to work really hard on my studies to justify that type of expense, and eventually my dad paid for it. I always felt a little guilty that he would splurge on me like that. But years later, he told me he would have always paid for those classes, because he thought I had talent and he wanted me to embrace my talents. (sort of a don't-hide-your-talents-under-a-basket thing)

I believe I've done relatively well for myself, but I'm always very aware that I could have been raised in a completely different situation. People often talk about the privilege that comes from growing up with money, and I know that if I had grown up with my mom I wouldn't have had the same opportunities. For me, college was expected; for my half-siblings, college was necessary. That's one big difference among many others that let me know that I was really lucky to grow up the way I did. 

Don't get me wrong. My half-siblings are very successful, married, and have their own families now. They have wonderful lives and it worked out for them. But in my mind, it worked out in-spite their circumstances, not because of them.

Puffsdangerfield,"The whole idea of ""Black Friday"" is now a farce. Rarely does anyone save any real money. There is quite a few reasons why:

1. If you have camped out for longer than 24 hours, You have probably spent more money in preparation and expenses than you would have saved in the difference between actual and markdown price. 

2. Quite a number of items sold on Black Friday are cheap versions. Some TVs will be made in a cheaper version just for this special purpose. 

3. If you took any amount of time off to shop on Black Friday, you have lost pay. If you used paid vacation or paid leave, you have still lost, since that is time you earn. 

4. All items sold on Black Friday will be sold at a much smaller price in the off season. Look at the cost of shorts in the fall and coats in the spring. You also have deals like this for electronics in low buying seasons or when the newest models of anything are about to be rolled out. (And everyone knows if it is a gaming console, you are gambling on the quality of product for the first few months of its roll out. Look up the problems with both the XBox One and PS4.  Same thing as the Windows hype back in the 90s.)

5. If you spent money on any object, you didn't save anything. A TV marked down from 200 to 150 didn't save you 50 dollars, you spent 150 dollars. 

There is also other things like the mob mentality that takes over. People are scary in that mode and I avoid it like the plague. Besides, most of that crap is not needed, especially as far as gifts go. It's great if you have the money, but most don't, who the hell needs a waffle maker for Christmas that bad? Most of the time it will get used once or twice and then chucked in that place where kitchen gadgets go to die.

Earth_Bug,"For example, last night, I had a dream about my ex who I haven't even seen or talked to in almost 10 years.  It's not the first dream I've had about him often either.  

The dream; I was in a town where everyone that I've ever known lived in.  I owned some sort of business until this Asian guy comes and fires me.  Then I'm sitting at a bar with this girl Cassie when in walks my ex.  Turns out they are dating and have been for a while (in my dream).  My ex and I lock eyes and all of the amazing feelings that I had/have for him came rushing over me.  The rest of my dream was just a bunch of random things where Ryan is with me.  

This dream was pretty mild compared to some of the dreams I've had about him in the past, a lot of sexual dreams, me leaving my husband for him and things like that.  Feeling guilty as fuck!

For the record, I am completely devoted to my husband and have a near-perfect marriage.  In my dreams, I'm always elated to see my ex but when I wake up, I feel really down about things all day.

LifeGoesOnDude,"My first ever throw-away account! Never told this to anyone, including my Dad and brother....

Twelve days after I graduated from college, I was taking a shower in my childhood home. When I shut off the water, I could hear my Mom's voice on the other side of the wall, speaking softly on the phone. Instantly 60% sure she was cheating on my Dad, hard to explain how. She'd been acting more distant and dressing better lately.

Next day (asshole me) went through her texts on her phone. Saw a guy's name a couple times, but nothing definitive. Up to 75% or so. Two days later went through her email in the middle of the night, which she always left open on our family's shared computer(!). The 100%-sure moment is the one that sticks... I cried, drank myself into a stupor, confronted her then next morning. 

My Dad and brother are 'oblivious' types, but wanting to possibly save them from the pain I was in, I coached her how to cover her tracks better for a few weeks. Still caught her and scolded her multiple times.

She faked her way through marriage counseling until the inevitable divorce a year or so later, two-ish years ago. She was definitely the favorite parent, so life sucked for awhile. Getting back to normal-ish now, she moved to a more tropical locale with her new boyfriend, visited for the first time last week. Life goes on!

EDIT: **TL;DR**: Caught Mom, helped her cover her tracks in hopes of an amicable divorce.",null,0,cdps93j,1rqcqs,AskReddit,top_day,5

AllButOne,"Growing up, my mother was never an affectionate parent. In fact, she was the opposite. She only ever paid attention to my sister and I when we had done something wrong, and then she would punish us severely. A lot of the time, our punishments bordered on abuse (she used to physically abuse my older half sister, but my father would not allow her to touch his own children like that). Needless to say, I was not a ""mama's girl"" and I think I hated her long before the proverbial shit hit the metaphorical fan.  

Both of my parents were pretty technologically inept, but we had a desktop PC in the house that was for me to play games and do homework, etc. The summer before my senior year of high school, I notice that my mother is spending a lot of time on the computer, a lot more than normal. I chalked it up to her trying to start her own Ebay store (she did a lot of arts and crafts type things). It started off being a couple hours a day, mostly editing her store and adding new inventory. Eventually, it escalated to her being on the computer before I woke up in the morning, still being on when I got home from school and she would still be sitting there when I would go to bed. It got to the point where I had to actually fight her to gain access to the computer for homework! She went from barely knowing how to work the damn thing, to being on there 14 or 15 hours at a time. I knew something was up.

To make things worse, more packages were coming into the house than leaving the house. Every day, she would come home from the post office with three or four packages from various online stores (Victoria Secret being the most prevalent). If you went into my parent’s bedroom, there would be stacks, actual piles, of packages that weren't even open! They were coming in so fast that she didn't even bother opening them all at the time. She just threw them on her dresser and went through them when she had the time. On top of that, she gave herself a mini make-over, started getting her nails done once a week and being overly distant towards her family. She completely abandoned her responsibilities as a stay-at-home mom, and my father and sister and I often had to fend for ourselves. The house fell into disarray, there was never any food in the house and there was just packages all over the place (always for her). My father is a complacent man, didn't mention anything to her (that I know of) and this continued for a couple months.

Now, coming from a single-income household, I knew all this shit she was buying couldn't be good for our financial situation. The nail in the coffin was when she purchased a brand new laptop for herself (and not for her daughter who was going away to college in less than a year). She used her newly-purchased mobility to lock herself away in my parents bedroom for hours at a time, chain smoke and generally ignore her family. 
 
One night, I logged on to her gmail account (she had the password saved on the family computer) and I found HOURS AND HOURS of emails between her and this guy. I went all the way back to the beginning of these conversations to see that it all started out friendly enough. Asking about theirs lives and so forth (my mother, being the sociopath she is, created this ideal life when really we lived in a pretty shitty area). She talked to him my sister and I (which infuriated me). I guess he was some sort of computer-whiz and was helping her format her Ebay store, which is how they started talking.  

Things did not stay platonic for long. He eventually started asking about her relationship with my father, and she told him this horrible sob story about how she was an ignored housewife who never left the house (by her own choice), how my father wouldn't let her get a job (which was a lie, it probably would have helped), how her children didn't appreciate her (why would we, she was a lazy slob), etc. I'm sure you can imagine where things went from there. It started off with some pretty soft corn cybering and escalated quickly to naughty pictures (that would be wear all the Victoria Secret packages came in). I was appalled. I was infuriated. White-hot **RAGE** seeped through my veins and I wanted nothing more than to watch my mother get hit by a train. A train with lots of spikes and barbed wire....that was on fire. I hated her.

I waited a couple weeks, checking every now and again to see if maybe it would stop. It didn't. Finally, things came to a head when he started talking about flying up to NY (he was from VA) on a ""business trip"" and that he booked a hotel in our town and he wanted to spend the weekend with her. AND SHE AGREED TO. I printed out the message, and left a note in my dad's wallet that we needed to talk (and to not tell mom).

We get in the car to take me to my senior year orientation, and he asks me what's up? I show him the messages and start bawling my eyes out. I don't know what to do, or say. He just kind of looks at the messages, and starts the car and drives me to school. He just keeps saying ""Things are going to be okay. They're going to be fine"". I guess he told her the following night, the night before my first day of my senior year. She was so furious with me for blowing her cover, she wouldn't even look or talk to me. 

The following week, I hear my mom telling my sister that she's going on a trip with her ""friend"" for the weekend, but that she'll be back on Monday when she gets home from school. I run out the door, and wait for the bus in the pouring rain, instead of letting my mom drive me. She pulls up next to me, and I tell her to fuck off. 

My dad slept on the couch for a couple months (they were obviously separated). My mom became more brazen with her affair, obviously not giving a single fuck about the feelings of her family (the selfish bitch). She would parade around the house while talking to him on the phone, she locked herself away in her room most of the time and she would go away on ""trips"" with her ""friend"" often. 

This continued until about February, and my parents were passive aggressively at each others throats for months. When she finally moved out, it was because this scumbag actually abandoned HIS family to move to NY. He was renting an apartment in a town about 45 minutes from us, and she was moving in with him. She told my sister that she would come see her on the weekends, and that when they got settled, they would buy a house in our town and she would live with her (my parents aren't married, and my dad doesn't have as many parental rights, so my sister didn't have a choice). As she finished her packing, she walked up to me and said ""I know you don't approve. You can come visit anytime."" I completely ignored her, and she walked out of the house. My dad continued to sleep on the couch. 

My poor father, my heart breaks when I think about what this did to him. He lost weight, he became sickly and depressed. He tried so so hard to be strong for us, to be stoic and supportive, but I knew better. One day we were driving somewhere, and he just cracked. He was down at ground zero on 9/11, and he had to hide under a firetruck to avoid the debris. He pulled over, and started crying and said ""I wish it would have killed me, I wish it just would have fucking killed me."" I didn't even know what to do, how to help him. I just held him as he cried like a child. 

I didn't see my mother again until she showed up at my high school graduation. I rocked my senior year, and got a bunch of awards. In the middle of the ceremony, all the seniors got four flowers to give to their family members. I gave one to my father, one to my sister, one to my older half-brother and one to my boyfriend’s mother (who was my maternal figure for almost 5 years at that point). I watched as my mother shoved my younger sister at my father and stormed out. 

That was in 2008. I have since graduated from college, moved into my own place, started a job and I am seriously considering graduate school within the next couple years. Coming from a pretty shaky educational background, I have come very far and I feel that I have tried to make the best of the situation. My father has gotten remarried to the mother of some of my half-siblings, and she is a completely wonderful woman. He is STILL paying off the credit card bills she racked up with her impulse buys, and we've been struggling for a couple years, but we're getting by.

My mother? My younger sister is 16 now and still lives with her. It sounds like she's doing pretty shitty, both health-wise and in her relationship with her now-husband (who looks like a sickly skinny, Harley-riding Santa Claus). I haven't spoken to her in years, and have no plans to rekindle our relationship.

chrisgond,"Prior to choosing the M.D. route, I had declared as a Computer Science/Engineering major.  But in my Freshman year, my Grandpa died of cancer, and that had a profound effect on my career choice.  My family cared for him until the final days where he needed a skilled facility.  During that time, I took more of an interest in medicine in general and specifically elder care.

With that in mind, I switched to a B.S. in Chemistry and a pre-med path.  I never loved Chemistry like I did computer programming, but I stuck with it with my eyes on the MCAT and med school.  I volunteered at hospitals and worked the night shift at a nursing home to become immersed in the culture, so to speak.

A potential red flag that I missed happened during my time as a CNA.  I despised it.  At the time, I told myself that it was just the gritty truth of nursing home care, especially during the night shift, but with 20-20 hindsight, I just hated the work.  I soldiered through it, graduated and was accepted into three different schools.  Score!  Hard part's over, right?  

Wrong.

I was always near the top of my class academically, but in med school, the competition and material became much more intense.  I mean several orders of magnitude of intensity.  I struggled, and it wasn't for lack of studying.  The sheer quantity of material and the pacing blew me away.  None of it individually was very difficult, but the collective amount of material and the frequency of week-long testing marathons kicked my ass.

If I had been truly captivated by medicine, I think I could have made it, but the subject matter turned out to be not all that interesting to me.  I grew to hate it, and in the middle of Year 2, after failing a biochem test that I had busted ass for, I was despondent.

I wasn't failing school, mind you.  I maintained a C- average, and there were aspects of it I excelled at - particularly Anatomy, but I got to thinking about being average at a career I wasn't thrilled with.  I got to thinking about being an average doctor and what that meant.  Would a patient want an average or slightly below-average doctor?  My classmates were all about ""P = MD"". In other words, pass and you get your degree.  

Another smaller factor in contributing to my decision to leave was the MD lifestyle - high divorce rates, high rate of depression, brutal hours, and high liability insurance.  Wait, you thought MD's were all rich?  Yeah not so much for a small town family practitioner. 

After dropping out, I immediately enrolled in a CompSci program.  1.5 years later I had my degree and was writing code.  But now I had a Chemistry degree and lots of medical terminology/concepts to boost my credentials, and I was offered a job from a medical device manufacturer who wanted to send me to grad school.  The $60,000+ in debt was a bitch, but it was just money, and we chipped away at it.

I am infinitely happier now.

TL;DR

**I could not deal with the thought of being a below-average anything, especially a doctor with patients' lives hanging in the balance.  Ultimately that thought and encouragement from my wife brought me to my senses, and I dropped out.**

I wanted to settle down by my early thirties and it worked out quite well.  An ex-girlfriend of mine did not share that plan and that made it obvious it would never work out.  She had two older sisters, both in their 40s a good 8 years apart; one had actually lived, had a career, kids, on her second marriage, houses bought, sold, lost etc. she had *lived* because she tried.  The other was still working entry-level jobs, living in a sharehouse and going to nightclubs surrounded by people 20+ years younger than her. That's not the only thing, she was miserable. She was just clinging to the same lifestyle. It was sad, but of course she could argue she's enjoying her life with no attachments.  That ex did not share my views of the 'success' of her two older sisters. At the end of the day people ought to do whatever makes them happy but it's often a fear of growing up or fear of failure that leaves a life stagnating as age kicks in.

I own my own home, have a boyfriend who shares my house with me and my four dogs and two cats. I've traveled through most of Europe and Africa, and have a good job that pays well that's several thousand miles away from where I was born.

As for having kids, I knew a long time ago that I would be a terrible mother. If I want to get my 'child fix', I just borrow my boyfriend's niece and nephew for a few hours, and give them back again the next day.

I'm the eldest child in my family, so some day I'll be expected to return home and take over running of the estate. Until that day comes, I will set goals for myself and make sure that everything I do in my professional and personal life gets towards those targets . Anything else is wasted energy.

emberspark,"For me, it was the Thor films (and I suppose Avengers). I think Loki is a fascinating character, and I think he plays on a lot of people's insecurities. He essentially turns into a villain because he finds out that not only was he adopted, but stolen from Odin's enemies in an effort to one day unite the two opposing groups. He finds himself without a true family, without a path to the throne that he so desperately wanted, and saddled with the knowledge that he only had the family he did because of the possibility that he might be of use to them politically in the future. I think there's a lot to his character that people can relate to - feeling out of place, having something taken away that you feel you deserve, feeling the weight of expectations on you at all times, and especially living in the shadow of your sibling's triumphs. He's a very relatable character on a lot of levels I think, because the things that really push him into being a villain are very human and widespread.

When I took the question seriously, and asked who the client was and why did he need to move a national landmark for the country of Japan (was it in the way, or did he need the rubble?) he was taken aback. He didn't have those answers. I asked if moving a foot if soil from the north side and slapping it on the south side would be considered ""moving?"" He did not know. 

He eventually asked how I would physically move it, and I said it would first start as a matter of diplomacy with Japan, and possibly the UN. Then I started talking about how this would vastly affect the local Japanese economy as tens of thousands of workers were employed for the job would need housing, food, roads, and whether foreign labor would be employed (as the Japanese are rather resistant to that). 

Then the massive environmental protests, security, and eventually how the need to move a volcanic mountain would vastly alter the local environment and the surrounding runoff into the oceans...

He liked my answer so much, he asked me to discuss it with others on his team. Eventually, he confessed he didn't know the answer and was given it from a book he read on how to interview people.  ""They make me ask them, he'll if I know why.""

YellowOrbitz,"Edit: I just remembered another one! Also I apologize for my bad writing I'm on my phone. I was with my boyfriend and his older brother in the basement when my boyfriend got a boner. However, we were under a blanket (not including his brother) when it happened so it wasn't a big deal. Well, my boyfriend pulled his pants down to free his boner under the blanket and forgot about it. So he's talking with his brother and they get into some playful argument when his brother rips the blanket off my boyfriend. My immediate reflex was to hide his junk so I immediately grab it. His brother was laughing his ass off and it took my boyfriend a second to remember he pulled his pants down a little. It was so weird staring into his brothers eye while holding my boyfriends boner. 

Also: 

Well, one day I was crying and talking with my boyfriend when he got a boner. We had sex and I actually felt better. 

Another time we were at the mall and I had gotten a new dress. We had already had sex so I thought it would be okay to change into the new dress I had gotten. Nope, instant boner (I'll admit I felt very complimented). We couldn't leave because we were going to see the movie at the mall and it was too far from the house to get there and back. We had sex in the car. We missed the movie. 

I don't think it was awkward for me as much as him because he didn't know how I'd react. I mean I've never turned down sex from him but I guess he thought I'd say no? It was really cute too because he'd give me the guilty face like he did something wrong. 

Oh, and every time we were with his family and he got a boner. I know that was definitely weird. ",null,2,cdpt6k6,1rqgeh,AskReddit,top_day,3
