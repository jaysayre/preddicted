She tried to grab my wrist as I was pulling the case away from her and I pushed her hard enough to cause her to fall over (which was not difficult due to her drunkenness). She filed a complaint, but with security tapes, management saw that she'd touched me first, I told them that I'd defended myself and if they terminated me, I'd be suing them.

It is usually not an issue, but this one woman I was serving seemed to take exception to my use of slang. I can't remember what I was getting for her, but I said ""grab"" instead of ""get"". While I was putting her order into the till, she suddenly grabbed my wrist, held it for a good few seconds and said ""THAT is grabbing, next time remember that."".

She told me about a customer who tried to come behind the counter and how her manager saw and responded quickly. The event, nonetheless, left her shaking and she had to take her break early due to a panic attack. Fortunately she had an understanding manager.

I told her that if something like that happens again and the customer DOES touch her, to scream. Scream loud, scream with all the panic in her shy, anxious soul. No words, just noise. They did not have a right to touch her and this is nature's signal that the other person is out of line and send help quickly.

A few months go by and I get a call out of the blue. My cousin thanked me for the advice saying it was the best she'd ever gotten. She's a cashier at a grocery store and occasionally manages those sample kiosks. Same customer (large, rotund woman) had the same issue (cousin is only allowed to give 2 samples per person, customer wanted moar) and grabbed her wrist when cousin said ""no"" politely.

Cousin did as advised. According to her sister (who also worked there as an asst. manager) it was the howl of a thousand banshees. EVERYONE came running to see this large woman gripping my tiny cousin's wrist in an apparent death vice. Later, cousin said she wasn't actually hurt, just scared. 

Customer was ejected immediately and is banned from the store. Cousin said that she actually felt better from the scream and the aftermath was not as bad as other occasions. She also said she wasn't likely to do it again as she was mortified by everyone coming around.

llama_delrey,"Hi OP! Based off your story (and a pervious one), I am pretty positive that I used to work at the same craft store you do (assuming it's a chain?).

First off, those coupons are the worst things ever. I one time had a woman who didn't understand why her coupon for $15 off a purchase $45-$74.99 didn't automatically bring her purchase down to $30, when she had spent $65. Holy shit. She literally did not understand how subtraction and addition worked, and there was no way for me to explain it to her without being condescending, which only pissed her off more.

Second off, the fact that we could not delete coupons after scanning them nearly made me cry on several occasions, i.e., psycho coupon lady hands me a 50% off coupon after I've scanned a stack of 40% off coupon and it screws up the entire order. I would usually just smile and enter it as a special discount it by hand so that they didn't try to murder me.

Third off, if a customer came behind my register, I would have called the manager up immediately and told the customer to get out from behind the register, even if they hadn't touched me. My store was not in the safest area, and there had been several stores that were robbed at gunpoint within a couple blocks.

etterboce,"To everyone who keeps saying she should file criminal charges against the customer, I agree in theory. However, even if OP knows who the customer is, simply calling the police could result in her termination depending on the company. 

It's a really terrible thing, but many corporate retailers side with the customers so much that they will terminate an employee for calling the police without authorization. And they are completely allowed to do this without any worry of recourse because it is company policy and in the employee handbook that they make us sign when we get hired.

I don't know how I would have reacted. I would love to say that I would have done something awesome and put the lady in her place, but I'm not sure. In times like that, it's hard to say how any of us would really have reacted. I've had some extremely tense situations with customers over the years, and I've never reacted completely how I would have expected.

Either way, I'm sorry you had this happen to you, OP. Nobody has a right to put their hands on you. Next time, the best thing you can do is remove yourself from the situation, call a manager, and fill out an incident report. Ask for medical care if you even slightly think its necessary.

She told me about a customer who tried to come behind the counter and how her manager saw and responded quickly. The event, nonetheless, left her shaking and she had to take her break early due to a panic attack. Fortunately she had an understanding manager.

I told her that if something like that happens again and the customer DOES touch her, to scream. Scream loud, scream with all the panic in her shy, anxious soul. No words, just noise. They did not have a right to touch her and this is nature's signal that the other person is out of line and send help quickly.

Cousin did as advised. According to her sister (who also worked there as an asst. manager) it was the howl of a thousand banshees. EVERYONE came running to see this large woman gripping my tiny cousin's wrist in an apparent death vice. Later, cousin said she wasn't actually hurt, just scared. 

Customer was ejected immediately and is banned from the store. Cousin said that she actually felt better from the scream and the aftermath was not as bad as other occasions.

llama_delrey,"Hi OP! Based off your story (and a pervious one), I am pretty positive that I used to work at the same craft store you do (assuming it's a chain?).

First off, those coupons are the worst things ever. I one time had a woman who didn't understand why her coupon for $15 off a purchase $45-$74.99 didn't automatically bring her purchase down to $30, when she had spent $65. Holy shit. She literally did not understand how subtraction and addition worked, and there was no way for me to explain it to her without being condescending, which only pissed her off more.

Second off, the fact that we could not delete coupons after scanning them nearly made me cry on several occasions, i.e., psycho coupon lady hands me a 50% off coupon after I've scanned a stack of 40% off coupon and it screws up the entire order. I would usually just smile and enter it as a special discount it by hand so that they didn't try to murder me.

Third off, if a customer came behind my register, I would have called the manager up immediately and told the customer to get out from behind the register, even if they hadn't touched me. My store was not in the safest area, and there had been several stores that were robbed at gunpoint within a couple blocks.

etterboce,"To everyone who keeps saying she should file criminal charges against the customer, I agree in theory. However, even if OP knows who the customer is, simply calling the police could result in her termination depending on the company. 

It's a really terrible thing, but many corporate retailers side with the customers so much that they will terminate an employee for calling the police without authorization. And they are completely allowed to do this without any worry of recourse because it is company policy and in the employee handbook that they make us sign when we get hired.

I don't know how I would have reacted. I would love to say that I would have done something awesome and put the lady in her place, but I'm not sure. In times like that, it's hard to say how any of us would really have reacted. I've had some extremely tense situations with customers over the years, and I've never reacted completely how I would have expected.

Either way, I'm sorry you had this happen to you, OP. Nobody has a right to put their hands on you. Next time, the best thing you can do is remove yourself from the situation, call a manager, and fill out an incident report. Ask for medical care if you even slightly think its necessary.

I thanked him and asked him to pull around for a wait on his food. Before he goes he hands me a couple bucks, saying that I had amazing customer service. Tried to refuse, oh no take it! Accept the money and he pulls around. 

I was pretty embarrassed at this point, for working in customer service I'm pretty freaked out by strangers. His kindness was appreciated, but gave me a bit of a panic attack. Asked my manager to take out the food, and he agrees. He returns with more money from this guy, saying he had nothing but nice words to say about me. We then hear a beep in the drive-thru, go to the window to say we're closed and guess who it is? It's him again! With a tip from his girlfriend this time.

To give you an idea, I've had one tooth that had to have a root canal, a crown, and recently a replacement crown. The replacement crown turned into an additional $1600 procedure called a crown lengthening to give the dentist access to a spot he needed to fill first.  All told, I've put about $5500 into this *one* tooth. The one behind it, which had a second root canal and ended up needing an implant, has had probably closer to $10,000 of work done on it.

I've been at the place just about as long as he has and because of this many people come to me before him when they have issues.

I make sure to tell people when they're doing well, I thank people for their effort, even if they're just doing their basic tasks. I will go over to the next station and ask ""You doing okay? You need help? Okay, come to me for anything"". I'm not a manager. I'll never be a manager at the place and I know this.

I've had people come to me and tell me I'm too good for the place and I have a lot more potential than I give myself credit for. Because the other manager is such a dick to everyone, morale is way down, people have up and quit because they don't want to deal with him, and inventory has been fucked because people just don't care anymore. I love my job but I'm not happy where I work anymore because of these issues.

I don't really have a point to all that but I just want to agree. Yes, management, please tell your employees ""thank you"", ""good job"", and make sure they're happy. I promise you, your employees will enjoy work more and it will show in the business. You can have a line to draw when it comes to getting personal but take an interest in your staff. Even if it's something small, like, if you know someone is interested in sports and you saw the same game or something, talk to them about it. It's not showing weakness, it's making a connection. In turn, I believe employees will be more honest with you and try harder.",null,2,cdps306,1rpynq,talesFromRetail,top_day,13

I work in a corporate tea shop in a mall, and we were busting ass today. We were beating our daily plan so well that we were in the top 10 stores in the country for the day, competing against stores that were larger and in more populated areas. (By the time I left at 5, we had met our sales goal for the day.)

As a thank you for busting our asses all day, my GM gave myself and one other coworker a small prize: 3 ounces of any tea we wanted. It's not a whole lot, but to be recognized and given something just feels good.",null,0,cdpzh9r,1rpynq,talesFromRetail,top_day,6

johnnydakota,"I work in a bar where one manager thinks we're all replaceable and I have literally only heard him say one positive comment to staff in the year that he's been in the position and that was to one specific person who cleaned the bathroom well. I've been at the place just about as long as he has and because of this many people come to me before him when they have issues.

I make sure to tell people when they're doing well, I thank people for their effort, even if they're just doing their basic tasks. I will go over to the next station and ask ""You doing okay? You need help? Okay, come to me for anything"". I'm not a manager. I'll never be a manager at the place and I know this.

I've had people come to me and tell me I'm too good for the place and I have a lot more potential than I give myself credit for. Because the other manager is such a dick to everyone, morale is way down, people have up and quit because they don't want to deal with him, and inventory has been fucked because people just don't care anymore. I love my job but I'm not happy where I work anymore because of these issues.

I don't really have a point to all that but I just want to agree. Yes, management, please tell your employees ""thank you"", ""good job"", and make sure they're happy.
