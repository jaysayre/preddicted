TimeToHaveSomeFun,Chlorine is a very effective oxidizing agent meaning it is capable of oxidizing a lot of things while itself getting reduced in the process Intuitively this makes sense because the chlorine atom is very electronegative meaning that its happier existing as reduced Cl anions as opposed to neutral Cl in Cl Chlorine also has a very positive standard reduction potential meaning that it is capable of reducing anything with a lower potential which just so happens to be most things Because of this chlorine can attack a huge variety of molecules including most carbonbased compounds Thus it can effectively destroy living things,291,cdebezc,1qm8be,askscience,hot,1231.0,940
poundsign,To add to uTimeToHaveSomeFuns comment in the context of water disinfection the mechanism by which Chlorine kills pathogens in water varies it is thought to either directly oxidize genetic material or destroy cell membranesChemically chlorine gas bleach and calcium hypochlorite are also common species for disinfection reacts in water to form an equilibrium with  hypochlorite and hydrochloric acid The hypochlorite is important because it then forms an equilibrium with the highly effective oxidizing agent hypochlorous acidI hope that was ELIsorryIt is also interesting to note that chlorination is NOT effective against hardshelled cysts eg Giardia which you may have hear of This is one reason why affluent areas are turning away from chlorine water treatment plants or most often using chlorine in conjunction with another disinfectant though you still get the most bang for you buck with chlorine Note the other disadvantage you may have heard about chlorine is in regards to disinfection by products also its sensitivity to organic matter if youre interested in these or other water disinfectants let me know I can also point you to some sources if youre interested,17,cdearfk,1qm8be,askscience,hot,77.0,60
JaxHostage,Chlorine chemically reacts with the moisture in your lungs nose throat eyes and on your skin and creates hydrochloric acid  The acid burns the various tissues in your body your body reacts by attempting to flush the containment out which provides more moisture for the chlorine to react with creating more hydrochloric acid  In burning the lining of the lungs your body is no longer able to extract oxygen from the air coupled with your lungs rapidly filling with fluid you suffocate  All of this depends on the concentration and duration of exposure IF you survive chemical burns are an certainty ,8,cdemgx9,1qm8be,askscience,hot,35.0,27
Iretrotech,My Chem teacher explained this interestingly the other day Basically A chlorine atom has  valence shell electrons in its outermost shell It REALLY REALLY wants  so it decides that ripping electrons from atoms it comes into contact with is a cool idea It was used in WW as a chemical weapon because upon inhaling it it rips apart you cell walls and your essentially drown in a cell smoothie of cytoplasm and blood Chem teacher explained this once so feel free to correct me if I missed something am wrong,4,cdeouxy,1qm8be,askscience,hot,21.0,17
holeymoley,Chemist here coming late to the game  This is how I explain chlorines mechanics to my nonchemist clients  Chlorine is very reactive oxidative particularly against organic molecules  Ususally it comes along and lops off a carbon from an organic molecule which in essence changes that organic molecule to something else  That organic molecule may have been a blue dye but the action of removing just one of the carbon atoms from that blue dye could change its colour  Thats why we use chlorine as bleach  If that organic molecule is something that is essential for life and the chlorine destroys it by ripping off one of the carbons then it is no longer available to perform its life necessary function and so death  Close enough is not good enough in organic chemistry particulary biochemistry so changing an organic molecule by removing a carbon atom doesnt necesarily cripple its function it often completely disables it  ,2,cdeo11m,1qm8be,askscience,hot,19.0,17
Vruk,Chlorine is really corrosive It strips electrons out of anything it contacts Ive used it to sterilize gloveboxes for home projects Id read that in pandemic situations of tuberculosis the World Health Organization switches to a th concentration of sodium hypochlorite to water to kill the sporesId also read that adding a small amount of vinegar to the sodium hypochlorite solution will acidify it which increases its killing potential Instead of taking  minutes to sterilize not sanitize it will now take  seconds Time is dependent on concentrationSo before you do this to clean the kitchen table I read an article that adding vinegar to bleach unleashes chlorine gas Twice during a lapse in concentration Ive added too much vinegar which creates a lot more gas Upon spraying this  I perceived a smell that reminded me of touching a battery to my tongue sharply metallic Then my throat started to feel raw and my lungs felt like i was developing pneumonia Just all coughing and mucus Getting yourself to fresh air and breathing heavily works It burns for a few days though Ive etched plastic with this stuff Its truly mean Also would like to ask if any chemists here could confirm what the hell I inhaled CHCOOH  NaClO,2,cdefwdz,1qm8be,askscience,hot,10.0,8

and,When chlorine steals electrons from whatever it can the atoms that it steals electrons from undergo shifts in their bonds and their geometry  This causes molecules bound to these atoms to undergo conformational shifts or changes in their superstructure  Most biomolecules only operate in their intended D form disrupt this and their structure can change lose parts or even collapseWhat complicates this is the reaction that chlorine undergoes when it contacts water Cl  HO gt HClO  HClHypochloric acid the first product is not only an acid albeit weak but its conjugate base the hypchlorite ion is a strong oxidizer Hydrochloric acid is a very strong acid Acids also induce conformational changes though through a different mechanism Highlyelectronegative atoms like oxygen can act as proton acceptors via extra electron pairs This also induces conformational changes the oxygen molecule becomes less negative which can affect the entire molecule through shifts in where bonds are located since the oxygen attempts to shed that proton to return to a standard two unpaired pairs of electrons,5,cdeh6kj,1qm8be,askscience,hot,9.0,4
BioChemistryStudent,Another point I would raise from a biochemical point of view is that Cl in solution is used by most organisms to help maintain osmotic gradients and prevent themselves from taking too much water and dieing Its a bit more complicated than that but adding a large volume of Cl ions to any living organisms habitat is going to alter the equilibrium its existing it and will either desiccate it or cause it to swell so much it pops Cl is also used in alot of secondary transport systems and can gum up those works as well In PChem the other day we were talking about how the concentration of ions in solutions changes the interactions between phospholipids and I would hypothesis that the Cl ions are also weakening the polarpolar headgroup interactions between the phospholipids So to recap the ions in solution will change the osmotic pressure of the cell as well as weaken the cell membrane allowing them to be lysed thus killing your microbesThere are exceptions to this however the Halophile family of bacteria can live in extremely high concentrations of salt Staph Aureus for example is normally a helpful bacteria that lives on your skin it can survive in up to  NaCl solution Chlorine doesnt kill everything but it does a good job with those not used to it Hope that help,2,cdeh1kq,1qm8be,askscience,hot,6.0,4

LeagueBoots,Ice cores seafloor sediment cores pollen cores and tree ring records are all key indicators of past climateOne of the most common and reliable ways of measure past thermal conditions is to measure the O and O different isotopes of oxygen found in the shells of animals that build with calcium carbonate In colder time periods the shells contain more O and in warmer periods the ratio is more skewed towards O  This is then correlated with the oxygen isotope ratios from ice cores with have an inverse O and O proportion   This doesnt measure the temperature directly but measures the change in temperature that the wet air moved throughWithin the ocean the temperature affects how much dissolved oxygen the water holds warmer water less oxygen and to a certain amount acidity although the latter is more closely associated with CO content Each of these things leaves a very distinct record in the ocean floor sediments that can be read like any other stratigraphic sequence or like tree rings  These records show up in coral banding plankton remains in shallow sea floor sediment like that found between the Channel Islands and Santa Barbara in California and spottily in the fossil record going back many millions of yearsPollen cores provide species specific information about what plants grew in an area and allow past environments to be partially reconstructed  We can compare the current range of those species with the past range and gain an idea of what the climate range was like at the time the pollen was laid downThese records and tree rings all need to be looked at in the local context which adds a great deal of complexity to climate reconstructionsUsing these methods and looking at both ocean and land based lines of evidence we can build up a pretty long record of temperatures Look at the RealClimate blog for some good articles on this sort of thing httpwwwrealclimateorg ,1,cdf1fhg,1qovsz,askscience,hot,12.0,11
darkness,Plant biology PhD student here Scientists rely on proxy measures to estimate things like prehistoric temperatures which of course are impossible to measure directly Ice cores are indeed one of the more reliable means of measuring past temperaturesHowever ice core data only dates back to about  years so we must rely on other measures to get estimates from further back One very interesting method is to use plant fossils There is a rather good correlation between leaf morphological traits such as leaf size leaf margin and number of teeth on the edge of the leaf and temperature This is due to the fact that leaves are best adapted to the climate that they evolved in For example large thin leaves are good for absorbing maximum sunlight in warm environments but would lead to water loss in arid environments and freezing in cold environments Therefore paleobotanists can determine what the climate of the region was like based on the average trait values from fossils that they collect in a particular area There are likely other ways that this is done as well but these are the two methods that I am most familiar with I should also point out that the leaf method is typically used to estimate climate at a localized scale Im not sure if it is used to estimate regional or global temperatures averages I would need to look into this,3,cdezc7y,1qovsz,askscience,hot,9.0,6
elderbio,Geotechnical Engineer here  Holy hell Im relevant on reddit  As some have pointed out previously soil has a saturation limit  Varying types of soil may have greater infiltration rates than others  Such as sand versus clay  Sand is a much larger particle than clay and as the particles settle sand will create greater voids per unit volume than clay  These voids allow for water to filter through more readily increasing the hydraulic conductivity of the soil type  So the larger the particle  the easier water can flow through the soilIn the case of a stream bed it becomes a bit more complicated  The stream bed is the physical representation of water collecting from a massive watershed  For instance the Mississippi Rivers watershed collects from the majority of the eastern United States  At the starting points of these watersheds typically the larger particles cobbles and gravels and sands are located here  It is likely that in these areas the infiltration rates are higher allowing more water to drain into the ground but because the water is continually being fed from melting snow pack and rain and other sources the stream bed is continually being saturated beyond its maximum infiltration rate and capacity  Thus standing water will begin to form and if the water eventually finds a way to move downhill streams begin to formNow follow these streams downhill until you get to a resevoir or a lake  As the water finds flat terrain and builds up it creates a stilling basin that allows even the smallest clay particles that have been previously suspended in the streams current to settle to the bottom These smaller clay particles can create a barrier that makes it more difficult for the water to seep into the ground  As a matter of fact clay is commonly used as a barrier to keep contaminated water or leachate from spreading such as a landfillTLDR  The water stays above ground because soils can only allow so much water filter through depending on size  If the water is coming in faster than it is draining through the soils water will build up above the surfaceEdit Thanks for the gold Edit  There has been quite some hubbub about the void per unit volume statement of sand versus clay and the ability of a clay to hold water  Clay is a peculiar material in that it has varying degrees of arrangements  In its underconsolidated arrangement it is likely that clay will have more voids per unit volume than sand  However in its highly overconsolidated arrangement it is likely not so  Imagine you have a deck of cards and you build a house of cards by placing cards in a sort of T fashion  This is how a clay is arranged in its underconsolidated arrangement A lot of voids between very thin small plates  Now take that house of cards and collapse it down so they are all laying on top of each other  This is the overconsolidated arrangement  Now keep pressing these cards together with an insane amount of pressure to the point they nearly start to make a brick  This is the highly overconsolidated formation  A clay shale is the result of overconsolidation This is not the only reason water is restricted from moving through clays  Because of the small particle size of a clay the geometry of a clay particle and what clay particles are made of clay particles has a tendency to attract water molecules  They will attract water molecules and these water molecules will hold on to the clay particle to some degree filling what voids are leftThe point is not about permeability or porosity but hydraulic conductivityhttpenwikipediaorgwikiHydraulicconductivity  Hydraulic conductivity is simply how fast can the water move through the clay versus the sand  Sand will have a much higher hydraulic conductivity than underconsolidated clay  cms and many orders of magnitude more than a overconsolidated clay  cms,618,cdf6r0g,1qpbb6,askscience,hot,2441.0,1823
Mookie,a question about my discipline huzzah Im a certified Hydrogeologist in the State of California with  years of experience working with groundwater as a water resources consultant The short answer is that it does seep in but at different rates that vary wildly and depend on the ground conditions beneath the water Often this rate is so low that the water cannot seep in at a measurable rate compared to how much water is present Further in some locations water has completely saturated the subsurface below the body of waterand no further water can seep in I will be updating this with detailed descriptions and links to diagrams throughout the day Ill start by talking about permeability Permeability is the measure of how fast water can move through subsurface materials detailed Wikipedia defition here httpenwikipediaorgwikiPermeabilityearthsciences Different types of materials have different permeabilities Ever pour water on a pile of gravel It goes right in through the holes between chunks of gravel right water on sand like at the beach still pretty fast but a little slower pour it on clay like the stuff you make ceramics out of it doesnt flow into that does it but you know when that clay is dry so it must have had water soak into it somehow right We generally order these materials in ranks of permeability from More permeable to Less permeableGravelSandSiltClayPhoto httpiimgurcomgcfmEdgifMost subsurface is a mixture of these grain size types andor bedrock Without getting into too much detail generally the more gravelsand an area has the more permeable it is and the more water that subsurface can hold storativity Stuff with more silt and clay is less permeable Lastly there is bedrock which is a term Ill use to describe the hardrock that isnt sediments and it usually has very little permeability as its very solid there are exceptions So Ill talk about what this looks like in a lake and a river example for now In a lake generally water flows to the lake from the lakes watershed a watershed is the geographic area that when rain falls on it that water will move downhill due to gravity to thing at lowest point in the watershed in this case a lake This water will work its way to the lake and pool up Some portion of that water will seep into the ground below the lake based on the material belows permeability and over time will completely saturate the pore spaces storage in the sediments below the lake Water will seep in and spread outward as well until it hits a space to discharge to or an impermable sediment like bedrock or very slowly permeable sediment like clay  Rivers and Streams are more complicated When it rains on a hillside some of that water seeps into the ground and some runs off The water that runs off will collect where hillsides connect and in rills gullys etc and flow downhill and collect into bigger groupings and form streams and so on to rivers The water that seeps into the ground will move into the ground and then move downhill underground this is generally called the gradient Sometimes after moving downhill underground it will come out of the ground and join a stream making it a gaining stream as it gains water as it moves from the subsurface If these rivers and stream flow to a lake some of the groundwater will also flow into the lake Gaining stream diagram httpiimgurcomBguIKDgifSometimes it will keep moving underground until it reaches the lowest point it can and still not have reached a stream This difference is dependant on how far down into the ground the water table is the top of the water table is the first depth that you would encounter water if you dug a hole In areas where the water table is far below the ground surface when it rains the water that seeps into the ground goes to the water table and does not reach the stream Any streams that form due to runoff remember water can only seep in as fast as the permeability of the ground materials will flow over the ground and slowly seep into the ground in these areas and are known as losing streams In the San Joaquin valley in California there are ENTIRE RIVERS like the Cosumnes river that rarely reach the deltaocean because of this phenomenon Losing stream diagram httpiimgurcomkEyCOjpgThats the simplest basics I can put together theres lots of exceptions and special cases to talk about as well Ill try to elaborate with hopfully morebetter pictures in a bit,24,cdf7608,1qpbb6,askscience,hot,140.0,116
ramk,What I wrote in a previous posthttpwwwredditcomrasksciencecommentseztswhydoesthewaterinalakeorpondnotabsorbcaetmgtIt does absorb infiltrate into the ground below but at some point that soil is saturated What stops the water from continuously going down is that there are different types of soilrock and some are less permeable than others It usually goes along the line of gravel gt sand gt clay gt rock Below the permeable soil at some depth depends on the location there is usually a practically impermeable bedrock The water pools in the ground above those impermeable formationsgtSince it cant go straight down any further the water in the saturated soil flows downhill just like water on the surface It looks for places with lower groundwater elevation or a lower water table In some cases those places of lower groundwater elevation will intersect with the ground surface and youll have a spring where water flows downhill and out of the ground sounds counter intuitivegtHeres a cartoon like diagramanimation thats pretty easy to followhttpearthguideucsdeduearthguidediagramsgroundwater In this example you can substitute the river in the picture for a lake or other surface water body gtAs you mentioned in your post when you dig a hole and fill it with water the water infiltrates If you keep digging in most places youll dig down to the water table like in the diagram above and youll have a wellgtYou can find plenty more basic info at the wiki page for groundwaterhttpenwikipediaorgwikiGroundwater or by googling some of the terms I used aboveTo add to that the places where the pools of water I mention above meet the surface are rivers lakes and streams,3,cdfdg8i,1qpbb6,askscience,hot,37.0,34

Riceboi,Hydrogeologist here Rivers and lakes water surfaces are really just the groundwater table when they are not in the ground Generally groundwater which is the saturated soil in the ground will kind of form a gradient into rivers and lakes and you will often find a gradual drop in groundwater table as it meets rivers and streams Keep this connection in mind rivers and lakes are always connected to the surrounding groundwater The golden rule in hydrogeology is that water always flow from high hydraulic head to low hydraulic head water flow downhill so most of the year rivers and lakes is actually being recharged by the groundwater However groundwater table fluctuates seasonally generally summer being high while water level drops during the winter Because of this in fact some time rivers and lakes are actually seeping into the ground below to recharge groundwater other time groundwater is seeping into rivers and lakes The rate of these water flow depends on type of soil and where littoral zone fully saturated is located generally groundwater flow is pretty damn slowI hope this answer your question,1,cdf9b32,1qpbb6,askscience,hot,6.0,5

ColHoraceGentleman,An ordinary plane is going to run into lots of factors that will prevent this  Eg insufficient airfuel mix getting too lean insufficient lift lack of response on control surfaces  There are also human factors beyond Armstrongs Line httpsenwikipediaorgwikiArmstronglimit your body fluids will boil without a pressurized space suitIn a speciallydesigned aircraft or aerospace craft in this case youd need a LOT of thrust and large surfaces to allow a nominally atmospheric aircraft to truly leave the atmosphere at which point it would drift on in a single direction unless equipped with some form of directional thrustA couple of military aircraft that do not truly enter space but still get high enough to require spacesuits include the U and SR no longer in service  Some of the old Xplane pilots were rumored to have their astronaut wings as well,1,cdfeowm,1qqeld,askscience,hot,6.0,5
ryannayr,I assume that youre talking about commercial aircraft  The air in the atmosphere gets thinner and thinner as the plane gets higher at  feet the plane will simply stop climbing because the lift generated by the wings is equal to the force of gravity pulling the plane down  The speed indicated to the pilots is lower than the speed theyre actually traveling at which is helpful to the pilot so they know whether or not they are going fast enough to generate lift given how thick the air is  At some point with the engines at full throttle the plane will not be able to go any faster but the indicated air speed will be near the stall speed because the aircraft is in thin air  If the pilot tried to pitch the nose up to climb higher near this speed the plane would stall which would be very easy to recover from at such a high altitude  ,1,cdfgrop,1qqeld,askscience,hot,4.0,3

burninatingpeasants,Short answer if the flow is isentropic then the output STAGNATION pressure should be the same as the inlet STAGNATION pressure  If the flow is not isentropic then the output STAGNATION pressure will be lower than the inlet STAGNATION pressure  In both cases the STATIC pressure is different everywhere in the flowfieldIsentropic means the flow is both adiabatic no heat is added or lost and reversible harder to define but essentially means that the flow is in equilibriumStagnation pressure this is the pressure of the flow that you would feel headon  Think of it this way if you are traveling down the freeway and you stick your hand out the window you feel pressure on your hand wanting to push it backwards this is stagnation pressure  This is different than the STATIC pressure of the flow which is just the ambient pressure not felt headon,0,cdpw7mk,1qqhbm,askscience,hot,1.0,1

RelativisticMechanic,Technically yes but practically no In particular if one assumes that any two runners of the race will start at the same point and end at the same point then the answer is no but in a real race the answer is yesThe average speed which is what you really mean if you want to talk about lower and higher is the magnitude of the net displacement divided by the elapsed time or possibly the distance traveled divided by the time depending on how you interpret the statement In either case if we assume that each runner either has the same net displacement or travels the same distance respectively then we can conclude that the runner with the shortest elapsed time will have the highest average speedHowever in a real race there will be minor variations in the net displacement and the net distance traveled between runners In this case if the winner and the secondplace runner have times that are close enough its possible that the winner will have traveled a shorter distance or experienced a smaller net displacement by a sufficient amount that their average speed is actually lower For example consider two runners on a circular track of radius  meters They run sequentially so that they can use the same lane The first runner comes to a stop precisely at the starting location after precisely  seconds The second runner comes to a stop  centimeters radially outward from the starting point after  seconds The second runner lost the race but had an average speed that was greater than the first runners in the magnitude of net displacement sense this is true regardless of the paths they took in the distance traveled sense it depends on the path but works out to this answer if we assume simple paths like a perfect circle and a simple spiral,1,cdfktam,1qqj3v,askscience,hot,11.0,10
APPALLINGUSERNAME,Velocity measured in distance over time is always somewhat of an average  if you are traveling ten meters per second chances are in different parts of that second you are traveling faster or slower than that speed due to acceleration force or deceleration friction The average velocity of a racing contestant can be expressed by the total length of track divided by the amount of time it took to complete the race then simplified If all contestants are racing in a straightaway the person who completes it in the least amount of time will necessarily have the greatest average velocity     Loser  kmm      kmh    Winner kmms   kmhIf the contestants are racing in a circuit think Indy  someone hugging the inside of the circuit will travel a lesser total distance than a contestant forced to the outside     Winner kmm      kmh    Loser  kmms   kmhThis is why you will see track amp field starting lines staggered back toward the inside if the race length necessitates a turn in the track In circuitous vehicle racing however by strategically forcing your opponents to the outside through maneuvering you can win the race by traveling a lesser distance even if someone else has a higher average velocitySource I won a statewide math competition in sixth grade amp got a plaque,2,cdfkuux,1qqj3v,askscience,hot,7.0,5

rocketsocks,First some background EPA regulations mandate limits on the Reid vapor pressure RVP of gasoline and these limits vary by the seasonThe reasons for seasonal changes in gasoline composition are several Its worth noting that RVP varies by temperature which is why the composition is changed seasonally to hit the same targets LowRVP fuels may be more difficult to ignite but this is not a reason for the EPA regulations The biggest reason is that high RVP gasoline can lead to gas tanks that become pressurized by vapors And more importantly from an environmental aspect gas vapors are a significant contributor to pollution Gas makers take advantage of the higher RVP allowed in fallwinter to add more butane to gasoline which is less expensive than the gas itself Thats why summer gas is more expensive it contains more gasoline while fallwinter gas has been blended with other hydrocarbonsIn terms of the automobile drive train summer gas doesnt make much difference any more Modern engines will run just fine on summer gas in winter or winter gas in summer it makes little difference and the emissions from the tailpipe wont change significantly But the pollution risk of winter gas being sold during summer comes from handling gas not in burning it Modern gasoline handling systems have also improved greatly though so its hard to say exactly how much difference seasonal gas composition still makes,1,cdfm7k4,1qqka2,askscience,hot,3.0,2

hiimsadako,T is the active form of the hormone but there are quite a few reasons why patients with hypothyroidism are treated with T instead of T and they all stem from the fact that T is converted into T in the liver and kidneys through deiodination This means that the replacement of T alone provides a long lasting store of thyroid hormone that is gradually converted to T T has a longer half life than T  T  days and T  day resulting in stable plasma levels of both T and T Being gradually replaced means that depending on how much the dose is when you get blood work done in order to measure TSH titers you will already have both T and T readily available for conversion which simulates normal thyroid hormone production So normal doesnt necessarily mean optimal but it really depends on the dose and how good patients are at following instructions about their treatment  ,0,cdfnl1o,1qqt8q,askscience,hot,4.0,4

homininet,The major cause of what most people call dizziness is when you spin at a constant angular velocity for a while and then stop ie you spin in an office chair for a while The reason which is what people have already mentioned is that there are  gyroscopes in your ear called the semicircular canals They are basically donutshaped and filled with fluid and have a little membrane at one end When you spin the fluid lags behind and moves the membrane and your body senses that youre moving When you spin at a constant angular velocity eventually the fluid will catch up with the rest of your body this doesnt take long However when you stop the fluid is still pushing the membrane and it does take a while for the membrane to finally push the fluid to rest this does take a while somewhere between  seconds but I cant quite remember This readjusting is what you sense as dizziness Your inner ears are telling your brain youre moving and to correct your vision but youre not actually moving So like others said below this would still happen in space because the motion of the fluid is angular and would be unaffected by gravity Now there are two other bits of your inner ear that might be affected and these are little pendula that detect the direction of gravity and linear velocity While these organs might be a little confused in space I dont think they would cause you to be dizzy in the sense you are thinking of,2,cdfxxpp,1qrcna,askscience,hot,9.0,7

atomfullerene,For chickens the main reason is because humans have bred them to lay large numbers of eggs whether or not fertilization occurs  Many egg laying reptiles and birds will occasionally lay unfertilized eggs  The unfertilized egg has to be produced regardless so it will be available to be fertilized  Sometimes these eggs get reabsorbed if they are not fertilized sometimes they are just laid whether or not they are fertilized  You may ask why not just absorb all unfertilized eggs but remember that this carries some risk a mechanism to do this could accidentally absorb fertilized eggs which in some cases may be worse than passing the rare in the wild unfertilized egg  After all passing an unfertilized egg just costs some energy absorbing a fertilized one directly reduces your reproduction rate,70,cdg66ev,1qsmuy,askscience,hot,276.0,206

c,Edit My answer was wrong I was mixing up two vaguely similar properties See the replies to this comment for the real answerNumber theory student hereThe property youre referring to is called normality  so a number where you can find any combination of digits in its digital expansion is called a normal numberThe basic definition of normality is that for an arbitrary positive integer i the probability of a particular digital sequence of length i appearing in the first n digits of the digital expansion of x is the same no matter which digital sequence you pickedPi has not been proven to be either normal or nonnormal It is transcendental but normality is a stronger conditionHowever there are plenty of other normal numbers out there and even plenty of ways of generating normal numbers For example if you concatenate the primes like  thats normalThe type of alternative memory storage you describe is actually a project Ive been working on on and off for a few years Heres the project page on Github httpcgithubioNormMemYou would basically need to store three things A reference to a normal number The starting index for the data in that number The length of the dataThe two primary difficulties are That second number gets big extremely fast Generating arbitrary digits of a normal number via indexing is difficult,10,cdg301q,1qsnvr,askscience,hot,34.0,24

HelenKeller,gtIn theory if we had enough of pi instead of storing individual files could we have references to indexes of pi As in this song starts at decimal k and ends at kTo answer this specific part of the question if we assumed pi is normal this would be possible but not feasible It is definitely possible to store a file with two extremely large numbers the length of the file and a pi index and then run an algorithm that calculates pi between those decimal places There are two main reasons this is not feasible thoughFirst and most obvious is the time required to both store the file into pi Its an absolutely massive search problem to find a specific sequence of that length in pi In fact the search would be exponential in the length of the file you are storing To give you an idea of what that means each additional bit of data you need to store could as much as double the search timeAs a result storing even a JPG picture in pi would probably be beyond all of humanitys processing powerAs demonstration you can actually search for digits on this website httpwwwsubidiomcompiI tried searching  then  then  The first one took  seconds the second took  seconds and the third took  seconds of course this isnt rigorous since its kind of random but you get the pointThe second issue which is even a bigger problem is that we wouldnt gain anything spacewise from storing these numbers That is if we found the index of pi that stored our movie the amount of data to store this index is in expectation the same as the amount of data to store the movie itselfIf youre interested in why I can make a sketch of a proof that uses basic probability and assumes the digits of pi are random which is clearly not the case but it may as well be if pi is normal I could probably make a more formal proof without this assumption but I havent tried before,0,cdg7nh9,1qsnvr,askscience,hot,7.0,7

ISkipLegDayAMA,Its deceiving because a typical heating coil on say a stove top typically has three layers  the inner metal coil to conduct electricity and generate heat a layer of ceramic insulation around that electrical insulation and then a metal sheath around the insulation So even though what you see is a metal coil on your stove top it doesnt pose an electrical riskInterestingly enough even if you were to touch a currentconducting coil it wouldnt necessarily shock you The reason for this is because the electrical resistance of the coil is much lower than your body so electricity still prefers the metal wire to your hand In order to short the current it would have to go through your body down through your rubber shoes and into the ground  a much higher resistance path than the metal wire Now if you were standing barefoot on a metal plate when you touched it you might feel a shock but then I would probably ask what you were doing barefoot with live electrical wire Edit  As a couple others have mentioned theres a bit more to handling voltage sources that Ive left out such as how close you are to the hot higher potential end when you touch the wire In a wall outlet for example the two connections are at  V and ground If these are connected by a simple wire then the voltage is dropped evenly along the length of the wire So if you touch the wire near the  V end then  V is what your body will feel which will hurt a lot If you touch the wire closer to the  V end then you likely wont feel anythingI should have been more clear in my initial explanation I just didnt want to get too sidetracked talking about voltage sources Please dont handle exposed electrical parts unless you know what youre doing,21,cdg4it0,1qss3e,askscience,hot,65.0,44

CookiesRiot,Shape and density are the biggest factors in wires tension and length are the most important The pitches you get when you hit something are due to a natural instability in the objectThe natural vibration frequencies can be calculated and are called modes The first fundamental mode is the lowest frequency and also the one that comes across the loudest The other modes are all considered overtones If you take shapes that arent simple like aircraft wings these can be frustratingly difficult to determine But strings are pretty straightforwardSo the fundamental frequency is the note that you hear If you play a middle C on a trombone and a piano the pitches are identical but they sound different The difference in sound timbre is due to the difference in overtones The higher frequencies of vibration make the instruments seem different even though the fundamental is the sameThe actual nature of the different vibrations is really interesting in a metal bar you hear several main virbations If you put your hand on the end of the bar after you hit it one of the pitches will go away because you stopped it from expanding and shrinking lengthwisePercussive sounds are not necessarily like pitches they dont have a set frequency or timbre and they dont sustain at all Instead of a vibration from a natural instability there actually single pressure waves caused by a collision If you hit two sticks together really hard youll hear a click sound and two extremely short pitches The click is a single bump from the collision and the pitches are the very shortlived vibrations of the sticks Cymbals actually have pitches but the modes are really similar in magnitude and are extremely dissonant so it sounds like a bunch of noise and the initial percussive sound is really important,2,cdg8w6b,1qst72,askscience,hot,4.0,2
therationalpi,There are a lot of things about a material that lead to the sounds it can make The two biggest are wave speed and geometry of the object The geometry determines the wave shapes that the object can support often called modes For circular geometries you can expect modes that look like bessel functions for rectangular geometries the modes look like sine waves Regardless of what the modes look like though the object itself will oscillate sinusoidally creating a toneThe wave speed will determine the frequency of those modes An object might have multiple wave speeds each corresponding to a different form of motion A solid metal rod for example will have one wave speed associated with longitudinal waves the bar compressing another wave speed associated with shear waves the bar bending and another associated with rotation Putting mode shapes and wave speeds together you can find all of the frequencies associated with an objectThat only answers part of your question however since knowing the frequencies of harmonics only tells you so much about the sound The initial amplitude and rate of decay of the modes will make a big difference for how the object soundsInitial amplitudes for the harmonics is relatively simple since its really associated with how you are creating the sound in the first place For example if you hit a xylophone key where you hit the key is going to determine which modes are initially excited If you are playing a reed instrument the frequency of vibration for the reed is going to make a differenceTo understand the rate of decay for the modes you really need to start looking into the chemistry and the structure of the materials The decay essentially comes in when processes turn sound into heat and the differences for each harmonic either have to do with the time scales or length scales of those processes Viscosity plays a part thermal transport plays a role molecular relaxation is involved etc For example the crystal dinnerware rings more than an analogous piece of unleaded glass because the crystal has a more regular molecular structure A metal key from a glockenspiel rings truer than a wooden xylophone key because metal can deform with less loss to heat,0,cdgkmik,1qst72,askscience,hot,2.0,2

Platypuskeeper,The ice cools it It takes quite a bit of energy to melt ice But if you have a mixture of pure water and ice at  C then itll stay that way the proportion of icewater wont change  some water will freeze and some ice will melt but its at the same rate If you mix water above  C with ice then there will be more melting than freezing and the energy for that is coming from the heat of the water which drops until it has melted enough ice to bring them both down to  C Same thing if theyre both at  C and you add salt and depress the freezing point You shift that balance The water is now above the freezing point for that solution not for pure water so the water doesnt freeze at the same rate as the ice is melting anymore So you have a net melting of the ice and the temperature of the water solution will drop until it reaches the new depressed freezing point,5,cdg849k,1qt7qr,askscience,hot,12.0,7

Eldritter,The question you are asking has a lot of words but its still vague  One possible solution to this is that you could type out the homework question you are trying to answer at full length to make it unambiguousOne possible rephrasing of your question would be as follows How does mixing salt and water both at the same temperature result in a lower temperature of the combined substances  One possible answer for this is that the property of a material determines how much temperature change that material undergoes when given a specific amount of thermal energy  The classic example is that the specific heat capacity of water is fairly high so that it takes a lot of heat to raise the temperature compared an identical amount of copper metal which requires less thermal energy to rise in temperature  Thus by mixing salt with water you changed the specific heat capacity meaning that the water still has the same amount of thermal energy but does not have the same temperature  You are right the crystal lattice of cold hydrogen bonding is disrupted by the salt  In some cases solutes will disrupt the lattice so that the brine water will be in liquid form despite being below the freezing temperature of water with noions dissolved  Energy input is required for the salt to dissolve  However the reason it is possible for the brine solution to be at a lower in temperature after salt dissolution is that after after the reaction is over many water molecules are organized to shield the ions instead of participating in hydrogen bonds  This shielding in the case of common table salt would result in less water molecule movement meaning a thermometer would see a lower temperature lower than  degrees C  The reason the water will be below C and will still be liquid is because the water is shielding ions instead of participating in hydrogen bonding that forms water crystal lattices  ,3,cdgpj53,1qt7qr,askscience,hot,1.0,-2

snickeringshadow,Very good question Unfortunately the answer is rather complicated TLampDR There were a lot of things happening at the same time Agriculture is kind of like a symbiotic relationship between plants and humans and the conditions that allowed this to develop first appear during the Holocene How this relates to the origins of complex society is even more complicatedFirst you have to understand that when youre talking the origin of civilization youre really talking about four major changes A shift from a hungergatherer to agricultural subsistence pattern A shift to permanent settlements The growth of cities The development of ranked and stratified societies that is a society with dedicated rulers and class distinctions You are correct in pointing out that this seems to happen at about  different places at the same point in time The classical six in chronological order are Mesopotamia Egypt Peru India China and Mexico Unfortunately these things dont always happen in the same order everywhere For example cultures on the coast of Peru c    BC developed cities with central planning without any agricultural food source So while we can identify general trends that seem to occur we cant really reduce it to some kind of formula to produce a civilization Permanent SettlementsNot all huntergatherers are nomadic Foragers that make use of maritime or lacustrine resources for example may live in permanent settlements along shore lines Other huntergathers are seminomadic and have specific places they go to depending on the time of year Others have migratory patterns that follow specific prey the cliche example of this is the Lakota of the US great plains who followed American Bison All of these patterns can lead to domestication of the food resource in question but complex society requires that at least some of the population lives in permanent residence at one location It is likely not a coincidence that many although not all early settled agriculturalists lived in areas where there were lots of resources concentrated in one location rivers coastlines valleys etc It makes sense if you think about it from a costbenefit framework If its easy for you to get all of your resources in one place it makes sense for you to stay there regularly or exclusively DomesticationAgriculture is about more than just planting Domestication is an evolutionary change that takes place in plants and animals as a result of humans interfering in the reproductive cycle of the organism However this isnt necessarily a conscious process and in some cases seems to happen by accident The wild precursor of maize corn for example is widely believed to be teosinte However teosinte is barely edible in its wild form It does not appear that the Archaic Period inhabitants of Mexico were planting it as a food source Instead its possible the grass simply grew in disturbed environments near campsites and people began collecting it The other possibility is that people were growing it intentionally but as a supplemental food ie to make beer Over time people consciously or unconsciously selected those cobs which had larger kernels and more easily removed seed husks Over time the plant evolved into maize Although we often phrase domestication as something we do to plants its important to realize that we were also changing in the process As maize became larger and had a higher caloric yield people began producing it more Population went up and the intensity of farming went up with it Humans were now interfering in the plants reproductive cycle to the point where it was dependent on us to reproduce As a result it evolved to be more attractive to us And in response humans adjusted their culture to make heavier use of it Since all of this took place over thousands of years this was not likely something humans set out to do It just sort of developed as a symbiotic relationship beneficial to both organisms Now as to why this seemed to happen at the same time in multiple places this likely has something to do with the ecological changes that occurred during the Holocene Warmer climates and the growth of grasslands meant that the conditions necessary for this symbiotic relationship to develop were more common However we have to be cautious with this interpretation Its easy for archaeologists to correlate changes in human society with paleoecological changes but correlation does not imply causation Some of this may be bias introduced by the fact that paleoecological changes are easier to see than more ephemeral changes in culture society and politics There is likely more to the picture that were still missingUrbanism and Social ComplexityNow the hard part how does this tie in to the development of civilization Most of the Old World civilizations like Egypt and Mesopotamia developed agriculture first then cities then social complexity However it doesnt look like that pattern is universal Andean civilizations for example developed cities and social complexity first then agriculture In Mesoamerica agriculture gets started early but the domestication process takes a long time Cities and complex societies develop before the process finishesUnfortunately there really isnt a good explanation for why complex societies developed Weve identified a number of key factors but a lot of research needs to be done before we can be conclusive about this Most archaeologists are split between two camps managerial efficiency or topdown models and agency or bottomup modelsManagerial Efficiency ModelsThese models attempt to explain complex society as part of a system that people buy into The most famous example of this kind of model is Karl Wittfogels Hydraulic Hypothesis Wittfogel hypothesized that complex societies developed in Egypt and Mesopotamia because people needed a central authority to manage irrigation systems With population increases in these regions there was not enough water for every farmer to use whatever he wanted for his own fields A kind of tragedy of commons developed and to combat this people developed centralized institutions that could regulate water consumption Its fairly well established that ancient Mesopotamian city governments and the Egyptian state did in fact do this but its causal importance in their origin has not been establishedAgencyBased ModelsThese models developed as a critique of the topdown character of managerial efficiency models which dont really explain why an individual would want to buy into this Think about it if youre John Q Farmer and a guy comes up to you one day and says youre only allowed to use x amount of water why would you listen to him What reason would you have in even acknowledging his authority over you Agency based models seek to address this by looking at economic and ideological factors in the origin of complex society These have been gaining lots of ground recently in archaeology but they currently lack unitySo basically bottom line we dont know the exact reasons complex societies developed yet There are two major theoretical camps but there are about as many different ideas on this topic as there are archaeologists ,2,cdgijoy,1qtfqk,askscience,hot,21.0,19
docious,Huntergatherers did not have the ability to store food for long periods of time and hence had to constantly follow the herds they hunted and move on from pastures that they had exhausted of resources Despite the fact that wild grain grew plentifully in areas like the Fertile Crescent the grain could not be stored due to the fact that the husks were so thin and weak that they would crack and break as a result of being piled up as if for storageThen our environment changed specifically the genetics of the grains that were growing wildly in the cradle of civilization A hybridization between two or more grains occurred that resulted in a grain with a stronger husk which allowed it to be stored Once humans discovered that the grains that grew in there area could be harvested and stored for long periods of time there was no longer a need to remain living a nomadichunter gatherer lifestyle,4,cdgfyjv,1qtfqk,askscience,hot,6.0,2
Zeakk, I havent seen this potential theory presented yet but it was published relatively recently in the Journal of Archeological Method and TheoryBasically the authors of the study suggest that the demand for cereal grains increased due to the interest in having the cereal grains to produce beer because we like alcohol They support their claims by noting that beer appears to have been the primary use of cereals before using it to bake bread was Their study also implies that the role of consuming alcohol became important in some societies and to paraphrase acted as a social lubricant to allow for folks to be able to begin breaking patterns of social structure that were crucial in huntergatherer societies and less helpful for an urbanized settingI think my favorite part about your question though is that having spent some time working on archeological digs and studying classical history is that basically everything related to the answer of our question is speculation Speculation based off of data but still speculation I personally enjoy the to have beer answer to your question because it takes it from anything lofty regarding rational understandings of improved survival chances or understanding of economic benefits and turns it into something simple that can be true to anyone in any society with any level of education Humans like getting drunk We grew cereals because we figured out how they could help us get drunkThe actual articlehttplinkspringercomarticlesyA free and wonderfully written laymans account from the New York Timeswwwnytimescomopinionsundayhowbeergaveuscivilizationhtml,1,cdgjk5a,1qtfqk,askscience,hot,4.0,3

DeathStar,The ferrite itself is not causing the frequency response It increases the inductance since it has a high magnetic permeability and can concentrate the magnetic flux in the core Then the inductor will respond more strongly to rapid changes in current though it due to a stronger changing magnetic filed though the loop per Faradays LawDepending on the circuit configuration this could create a low pass filter with attenuated high frequncy output For example if you are monitoring a voltage that is NOT the voltage on the inductor then it will be low since the high frequncy voltage is all dropping across the  high impedance inductor Just analyze the circuit using the impedance value of the inductor and remember that this impedance at different frequency is directly related to the core material,2,cdgipa5,1qtr3o,askscience,hot,4.0,2

bohrexciton,The orbitals you are describing are called hydrogenlike orbitals These orbitals are only the exact solution to the simplest system to which they can be applied a centrosymmetric system of two oppositely charged particles such as the hydrogen atom Even in similar system such as heavier atoms these orbitals are no longer exact because of interactions between multiple electrons In molecules  there are even more complications from the presence of additional nuclei in addition to the extra atomsHowever even in these more complicated systems we still use the language of hydrogenlike or atomic orbitals The reason for this is twofold  this practice can greatly help our intuition and  these orbitals are a convenient starting point for calculations In regards to the first point the case of the hybrid orbitals is a good illustration of the convenience of using the hydrogenlike orbitals It is fairly straightforward to think of an sp center say in a carbon double bond as consisting of a mixture of one s and  p orbitals While this description is definitely not exact it nonetheless give quite a bit of intuition regarding the resulting physical and chemical properties of that center from its geometry to its reactivity As for the second point it turns out that in many systems the atomic orbitals turn out to be very good building blocks more technically a good basis set for describing the electronic structure of more complicated systems The idea here is similar to hybridization but more general and systematic For example the electronic density at some point in space could be described as Cpz  Os  in this case showing that its a superposition of electronic density of a carbon pz orbital and an oxygen s orbital and so on weighted by certain numerical coefficients This picture is especially convenient when atoms interact rather weakly with one another however it is always valid In principle one can create a complete basis set out of specific combinations of these atomic orbitals and could thus exactly describe any physical system,0,cdgnebw,1qufpd,askscience,hot,9.0,9

TheMac,To go into a tad more detail than others here lets step back and look at how atoms are put togetherThe nucleus of an atom  what were concerned with  is made of protons and neutrons Now protons are positively charged as you might now positive things repel other positive things If you get a bunch of protons and neutrons together in a nucleus theyll all repel each other  this is the electromagnetic force if this was the end of the story well we wouldnt have any atoms Luckily theres something called the strong nuclear force The strong force is as the name suggests very strong but acts only over a very short distance If you get protons close enough together though the strong force will become enough to hold them all togetherHaving a nucleus then is a matter of balancing out the strong force and the electromagnetic force if the two are equal youll be stable To make some nuclei more stable you can also add neutrons Neutrons also feel the strong force but dont feel the electromagnetic force so they generally act to increase the force holding things togetherNow if an atom doesnt have the right ratio of protons to neutrons it wont be stable In this case it will be radioactive and will decay emitting some radiation in the process to get rid of energy and become more stableWhat if youre right on the brink of stability though Youve got the right ratio to hold the nucleus together but any small change would throw that ratio off In this case you have the possibility for fission  splitting the nucleusFission works like this a borderlinestable nucleus will get hit with a neutron and absorb that neutron The neutrons energy causes the nucleus to bulge out like the second picture herehttpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumbeeStdefpngpxStdefpng Now remember that the strong force  the one holding things together  acts over a very short distance When the nucleus bulges out the strong force cant reach all the way out to the edges of the bulge to pull them in since our nucleus was very close to unstable to begin with this turns out to be the final push it needed The new nucleus cant hold itself together and will basically break in half as depicted in the picture aboveIts worth noting that this can  theoretically  happen to pretty much any nucleus its just a matter of getting enough energy in your neutron to cause fission Practically however there only a few nuclides for which this is possible specifically we usually deal with Uranium and PlutoniumNow in the case of Uranium and Plutonium since theyre heavy and not superstable they release energy when they break apart the theory behind this is complicated just know that stable is moreorless equivalent to lowenergy and if a nucleus becomes more stable that energy has to go somewhere This is where the gamma radiation that we associate with nuclear reactions comes from  its essentially pure energy being carried away from the nucleus as it splitsFission also produces a few free neutrons which dont become a part of either of the halves of the splitting atom Remember that fission was initially caused by a neutron hitting our atom  if weve got a bunch of fissionable atoms and each fission produces a neutron then those neutrons can go on to cause other fissions causing a chain reaction This is how nuclear reactors and nuclear bombs work you cause a lot of fissions over a very short time which releases a lot of energy Thats why most people associate splitting an atom with explosions in reality splitting only a single atom will produce some energy and radiation but wont immediately result in a massive mushroom cloud,1,cdhbzh0,1qva0j,askscience,hot,4.0,3

therationalpi,The answer to this may seem straightforward but its important to remember the very long history that records had Over the years there were several ways that we converted the grooves in the record to sound Im gathering a lot of information from the relevant Wikipedia articlehttpenwikipediaorgwikiTurntablePickupsystems but Ill supplement it with my own knowledge as appropriateBefore getting started its worth going over what the bumbs in a vinyl record are The groove of a record is a timerecord of the acoustic pressure for a musical recording In general these recordings are built from combining multiple recordings off microphones and mixing them into a song The job of the recording engineer was thus to record these sound by picking the right mics and placing them in the right places as well as balancing the levels of the many tracks and applying any effects necessary An additional job was to be mindful of the limitations of the record itself since vinyl records didnt have as large of dynamic range as modern media Though admittedly we dont take advantage of that dynamic range anymore eitherThe earliest record players were completely mechanical A metal or diamond tipped stylus  would sit in a groove and follow them up and down as the record turned In earliest devices the stylus was directly connected to a stiff diaphragm The change of surface area from the stylus tip to the diaphragm made this effectively a mechanicalacoustic transformer changing the mechanical motion of the stylus directly into acoustic waves The diaphragm would be augmented with an acoustic horn which would help the waves from the diaphragm couple better to the air This was essentially a pure acoustic transformer meant to match the mechanical impedance of the diaphragm to the acoustic impedance of the airLater phonographs used electric transduction At this point the tonearm comes into play Essentially the tonearm is a mechanical lever attached to the stylus When the stylus moves the tone arm transfers the stress to a cartridge containing the pickup The second generation of record players relied on piezoelectric materials for pickups materials that respond to mechanical stress by generating an electric potential voltage This voltage could then be amplified and sent to a regular loudspeaker The first ones used free floating piezoelectric crystals like a sand but had very poor quality because of nonlinearity of the transduction Later loadspeakers used piezoelectrics suspended in a ceramic material which performed much betterThe next generation of pickups are very similar to the standard movingcoil loudspeaker but in reverse The tone are moves a magnet in a magnetic field which generates an electric current that can be amplified Alternatively the tonearm moves the coil around a magnet to the safe effect The only difference here is wether the magnet or coil weighs more which essentially depends on how many wraps of wire the coil is made out of If you are curious about this type of pickup just look up loudspeakers to get a general ideaBetween magnetic and piezoelectric charges youve probably got most of the record players that people used Some later models used strain gauges where an electric resistance is altered by the strain put on the device This resistance could be placed in a network of resistors with a constant current like a Wheatstone Bridge and the differential current could be used to measure soundMore interesting are the optical methods that developed late in the history of records These are called notouch sensors and they are still the preferred method for anyone who doesnt want to risk damaging their rare records like collectors or archives A classic notouch sensor uses a laser reflecting off the grooves to measure their depth These are used in place of a standard stylus on a tonearm and the record player looks quite similar to a standard record player Alternatively with enough resolution you can simply scan the record player like you would a document The grooves are then read directly from the image and converted to sound This is the preferred method for archives like the Library of Congress because the sound of the recording can still be enjoyed without risking the physical record itself getting damaged It does however require very high quality scans to be effectivePlease feel free to ask any other followup questions since most of this info was just the basic stuff from Wikipedia,2,cdh512s,1qvamu,askscience,hot,5.0,3

wyliee,Yes  Yes is the answer to your question technically however let me start with some definitions to be sure I am answering the question you are really asking  A gene is the common term for the part of the DNA that gets transcribed through the process of transcription  What we most commonly think of are protein coding genes  These are transcribed then translated to make a protein  However a gene doesnt have to be protein coding  There are genomic regions that get transcribed but dont get translated  For example there are many genes that encode entities that function as RNA molecules  These are transcribed from DNA into RNA but are not translated They are still functional they play a regulatory role as an RNA molecule  Since they are never translated into a protein they dont need stop or a start  codons   Most of the ribosome itself which translates the RNA into protein where an RNA needs the start and stop codon to be properly processed is made of these enzymatic RNAs  So the technical answer to your question is yes you can have a functioning gene without a stop codonIf you are asking only about protein coding genes these do not need to have a stop codon to be transcribed into RNA but do to be their properly functioning protein  It is possible for them to be processed by the ribosome What typically happens is that the ribosome will just keep going along till it hits the next stop codon or runs out of RNA  This usually results in a nonsensical protein and can cause problems for the cell,1,cdgxkly,1qvf2d,askscience,hot,9.0,8

Aeolitus,As a general answer It isnt What you need to consider is that a boson is composed of fermions if it is not an elementary particle All fermions adhere to the Pauli Exclusion Principle  but if they form a boson together then they do not need to do so anymore since the pauli principle is valid only for fermions and they form a boson now Thus there is no Problem with BECs Dont think of the Pauli Principle as something that prevents fermions from ever coming close to each other It is a mathematical Rule that describes the behaviour of fermions Nothing more As soon as we are not looking at fermions anymore Paulis Principle is of no importance anymore and this is the case in HeliumAnother Example is btw Lithium which we can condensate just fine and is a Boson  Proton   Neutron   Electron all fermions on their own form a Boson Source Physics Grad Student did my Bachelorthesis on Condensates EDIT As udampew pointed out we can make condensates of fermions aswell However this works by pairing the fermions to something between bosonic molecules and cooper pairs by tuning via the feshbach resonance and is thus in a way just a condensate of bosonic molecules If you wish to take a further look into this topic I recommend looking into the publications of Prof Ketterle from MIT Especially the Doctor Thesis of Martin Zwierlein is highly recommended,0,cdh2kqn,1qvfzb,askscience,hot,4.0,4

SingleMonad,Im going to assume you really are asking this question  If I tie a guitar string between two nails on a post and pluck it I dont hear much sound  How does the body of a guitar make the sound louderFirst  Why is the sound so soft to begin with  Because the string doesnt move much air  The string is so small that it just doesnt make good contact with the medium of the air and the wave energy cant move off of the string  There is an analogy to this in electronics called impedance matchinghttpenwikipediaorgwikiImpedancematchingThe body or resonator is an impedance matching device  The string can couple more efficiently to body via the guitar bridge  The walls of body have more area of contact with the air and can move more airWhat utherationalpi said about energy is correct  In equilibrium the same amount of energy moves from string to resonator as moves from resonator to air  Its the coupling efficiency that makes it work,1,cdihccf,1qwdkp,askscience,hot,3.0,2

wazoheat,tldr Using some very rough estimates it seems that cigarettes do likely have a small but discernible effect on air pollutionThis calculation was a bit harder than I thought it would be at first but I think we can make some solid conclusions from the following estimatesThere are about  trillion cigaretteshttpwwwlongwoodeducleanvacigbutthowmanyhtm produced each year Lets assume that each one that is produced is smoked To look at the impact on pollution lets look at one specific type of harmful pollution PMhttpwwwnasagovtopicsearthfeatureshealthsappinghtml or small particles less than  micrometers across This type of pollution is one of the most important for impacts on human health and is mostly attributable to combustion sources fires power plants cars so probably most relevant for this calculation Each cigarette weighs  gramshttpviewknowdoblogspotcomhowmuchdoescigaretteweighhtml so assuming that each cigarette is entirely burned and turned into particulate matter this will add  billion kilograms of this type of pollution to the atmosphere each year The whole cigarette is not burned and released in to the air as we can see from ashtrays and cigarette butts so the number is probably closer to  billion kgNow this might seem like a big number but we need to compare it to other emissions to be sure The worldwide emissions of PM are  million tons per yearhttpwwwworldenergyoutlookorgmediaweowebsiteenergymodelIIASAEmissionsImpactsWEOpdf or about  billion kgSo if we assume that every manufactured cigarette is smoked and  of the smoked cigarette is released into the atmosphere that means that  of particulate pollution worldwide can be attributed to cigarette smoke Now this is a very rough figure but even if its off by a factor of ten it would still be significant enough to be measured Additionally these calculations dont take into account that cigarette smoke is concentrated around where people are whereas other sources such as power plants and wildfires might not beThis is all just educated estimates but I think this is the best answer I can give It also agrees with some related studies such as this onehttptobaccocontrolbmjcomcontentfull,1,cdhiftx,1qwe0g,askscience,hot,3.0,2

manofoar,Folks have covered the theory behind the development pretty well In a modern context gates are built up through assembling transistors to work in concert to create the functionality  In modern chips these transistors are created by layering semiconductive materials with conductive ones or by doping silicon with a thin layer of conductive material in a pattern  The process of doing this is known as lithography  In the lithographic process transistors are assembled upon a silicon substrate with appropriate infusions of conductive materials layers in such a way as to create the conductive and semicondictive regions that can then be used as a transistor The sale of these operations is on the order of nanometers When you hear about chips that have  nanometer transistors that means that the size of a transistor is nm in width as measured from conductive region that collects the electrons to the other region that emits the electrons and with a semiconductive region between that also has in contact with it a baseIn more laymans terms you can consider the emitter to be just that  electrons flow OUT of the emitter the base is the control and the collector is where the electrons go to  the base controls this flow of electrons by means of a voltage applied to itThese terms actually originate from back in the vacuum tube era of electronics albeit with modifications In the old vacuum tube days you had your cathode anode and a grid These functioned identically with that transistor  your anode emitted electrons hence why the emitter is called that the cathode collected them and the grid was what controlled the current flow between the two,1,cdhjliy,1qwqb7,askscience,hot,4.0,3

quarked,Resonance is a phenomenon that can occur for any system with a natural frequency If you drive a system at the same frequency as its natural frequency you will pump energy into the systemTry taking some object attached to a string to make a simple pendulum Pendulums have a natural frequency they will oscillate at if you let them swing fgl You can see the natural frequency for yourself by letting the pendulum swing freely Now try driving the pendulum by holding the string and moving it backandforth If you move the string very slowly the pendulum wont swing it will just move with the string Similarly if you move the string very quickly to and fro the bob wont move it doesnt have time to respond to the strings rapid movements The pendulum doesnt see oscillations very far from its natural frequency But if you move the string backandforth around the pendulums natural frequency it will resonate and the pendulum will swing higher and higher until the oscillations become too big and it no longer behaves regular At resonance you are driving energy into the system You might say that at resonance the system most easily accepts the energy driving it,0,cdhdh2l,1qws23,askscience,hot,1.0,1
SwedishBoatlover,Another way to look at resonance is that you are in resonance when you can keep the amplitude of an oscillation constant with the least possible effortThink of pushing somebody on a swing You want to keep the amplitude ie the swing goes to the same height every time If you push right after the swing has reached its peak you dont have to push very hard to keep the swing going You are in resonance with the swing Now instead start pushing when the swing is at it lowest point You will have to push really hard first absorbing the energy currently in the swing then you need to push it back up You are out of resonance with the swing ,0,cdhgjz3,1qws23,askscience,hot,1.0,1

DarylHannahMontana,Well yes and noI mean if you are just asking what is the median of the set of all integers then there isnt one because as you argue there are the same amount of other numbers below and above any given number and so theres no good reason to pick one number over anotherOn the other hand if your set is all real numbers between  and  there are an infinite amount of numbers in that set so given any number x between  and  there are an infinite amount of numbers below x and an infinite amount of numbers above xHowever in this case you can make a good argument for why  should be the median of this set its pretty intuitive that it should be and this can be defined in a mathematically rigorous way alsoLikewise with a more complicated probability distribution say the weight of all people ever born we have to consider every real number between  and say  lbs as possible since a persons weight changes over their life lets consider their maximum weight Thus we have an infinite amount of weights to consider were pretending we have a scale thats accurate to an infinite precision Nonetheless we can still talk about the median of this set its just the number such that exactly half the people to ever live weighed less than this and the other half weighed more than this,0,cdhfxf0,1qwsmr,askscience,hot,8.0,8
rlee,gtBasically if there are an infinite amount of numbers then isnt any number technically the median of that infinite set since there are is an infinite amount of numbers above and below that numberI believe that the issue with that lies more in that you are attempting to run statistics on an unbounded uniform probability set than an issue with the definition of median  Such a set breaks several statistical measure primarily as a consequence of the probability measure of any bounded subset of elements being measure zerohttpenwikipediaorgwikiNullsetIf we wish to generalize the notion of a median to an infinite set the most intuitive way to do so would be to call the median the point at which the integral of the probability density of the regions below and above that point are equal  This works well for any set in which the elements can be assigned nonzero probabilities or probability densities  There are some minor technical complications with integration in the case of discrete sets because you end up integrating over Dirac deltas but this issue is not that hard to handle,0,cdhfpeb,1qwsmr,askscience,hot,4.0,4
protocol,The notion of a median is a property of probability distributionshttpsenwikipediaorgwikiProbabilitydistribution not of sets of real numbers This gets conflated with finite sets because theres a natural choice of probability distribution namely the uniform distribution Theres no uniform probability distribution on the set of integers so the integers dont have a natural choice of probability distributionAs a result it doesnt even make sense to talk about the median of the set of integers To elaborate what if you were to ask for the sum of a set of five integers Well the question doesnt quite make sense because some key information  which five integers are being summed  is missing Likewise given any probability measure on the real numbers you can talk about the median but it doesnt make sense to talk about the median if theres no probability measure,0,cdhu9ik,1qwsmr,askscience,hot,2.0,2

Spiralofourdiv,I believe you are knocking on the door of measure theoryhttpenwikipediaorgwikiMeasuremathematicsIf you are defining the median to be the element on an ordered set such that there an an equal number of elements on each side of it then no a median cannot be defined on an infinite setHowever thats not necessarily what median means in what we call a metric space All a metric space is is a space that has a notion of distance What that means can be ignored for the most part aside from exactly what you think it means you can take two points in the space elements in the set and there exists the idea of a unit and that we can count how many units their are between two points That is a definition of distance exists and thus we can use numbers as measurement of this distanceThe real line is a metric space Take the set  Its an infinite ordered set right But we know that the median is  How can that be The reason is because weve kinda redefined median within a metric space to mean something different now a median is the value such that there is equal distance between it and the endpoints of the set A median now describes equal distance and NOT equal number of terms  isnt the median even though there are infinitely many elements between it and either of the endpoints of the ordered set the metric is NOT the same its  on one side and  on the other If the set isnt infinite we care not whether it exists in a metric space and as long as the set is ordered we can use the element definition of medianNow consider inf inf Well thats a metric space too but all points are equally distant from the endpoints so no median We thus have one more stipulationThe metric space must be finite That is since we have a metric the endpoints of the set must have a finite measure between them if they dont then the measure between a point and at least one endpoint will be infinite and thus meaninglessSo finally Yes you can have a median on an infinite set if its a finite ordered metric space and perhaps other structures but you are right that the notion of infinity does mess up defining a median for certain sets,0,cdkxla1,1qwsmr,askscience,hot,2.0,2

cdstephens,p  mv is not true in a modern context The momentum of light is written as p  hfc p  mv is just an approximation Depending on who you ask you can also say photons have a relativistic mass where the relativistic mass is defined as Ec and for an object with a nonzero rest mass m  gamma the same gamma used in special relativity This in part gives rise to the suggestion that energy and mass are directly connected that an increase in energy in something should increase its apparent mass I think theres some minor controversy though about whether it should be taught,2,cdhd8ii,1qwtsc,askscience,hot,9.0,7
brwbck,I figure Ill add to this by explaining why light can impart momentum even under the classical EM wave theoryIt has to do with the fact that light has both electrical and magnetic components When a light wave interacts with a charged particle the electric field exerts a force on the particle and the particle moves Now that the particle is moving the magnetic component of the wave will affect it The force of a magnetic field on a moving particle is perpendicular to both the motion of the particle and the direction of the magnetic field This produces a force in the same direction as the wave is traveling Thus the light pushes on the objectThe question of where the momentum is stored before the wave interacts with something is hard to explain and is one of the weaknesses of the pure wave theory,3,cdhlqfj,1qwtsc,askscience,hot,7.0,4
GimlisAxes,Photons have no mass I thought that a black hole is black because its gravitational attraction is stronger than the speed of light and does not allow any light out So I figured light must be subject to gravity and therefore have mass Or am I as usual making an ass of myself ,3,cdhktqb,1qwtsc,askscience,hot,6.0,3
mc,A good rule of thumb is that light travels as a wave but interacts with matter as a particle This means that any interaction with matter  absorption and emission  must occur in discrete chunks of energy  which we call photons  For all other cases its often simpler to think of light in terms of EM wavesLight is an electromagnetic wave  it is a changing electric and magnetic field that move through space together  Waves are fundamentally a way that energy moves through the universe  Waves are often always associated with some type of field like the electric field  A wave has the ability to move objects that come in its path for example a water wave will move a boat up and down or a wave in the electric field will cause an electron to move  Since waves can exert a force on an object and move that object this means they must also have momentum,3,cdhdtow,1qwtsc,askscience,hot,5.0,2
circleget,you are correct in both assumptions of energy and momentum in relation to its mass However through experiments regarding the photoelectric effect one has to consider the particle property of light whose energy is no longer associated with the intensity of the light source and instead is proportional to its frequency Ehf when you substitute this into Epc you find that the momentum of light is now P hfc no longer requiring mass to define momentum,0,cdhhued,1qwtsc,askscience,hot,3.0,3
carlinco,Another way to look at it is through pure wave mechanics When something creates light it basically stirs up vibrations not unlike a stone thrown into a pond Those vibrations spread out not through momentum but through exciting whatever is around them The next excited place around will again excite everything around it in any direction  so no real momentum only an apparent momentum at the circular front of the excited area And when those waves hit something that thing might get moved around  like a stone lying in the water Which is pretty close to what happens when light is absorbed for instance by a solar cell and moves electronsThis is also why laser rays gets weaker the farther they go  more and more light goes off in different directions due to lack of momentumHowever the word momentum can still be used in a meaningful way with waves  to describe the intensity of the wave making in certain contexts or the amount of momentum which they can transfer to matterThe water analogy does not go too far however as there is no real equivalent in space like an ether,1,cdhka14,1qwtsc,askscience,hot,3.0,2
mrbeanbag,The bottom line is that if you hit something with a photon it will move We can either choose to say that photons have momentum or we can throw conservation of momentum out not such a great idea So we say photons have momentum and then derive equations that accurately describe their momentumWhile it may feel more intuitive there is no good reason that massive objects should carry momentum either except that we would like something to have momentum so that we can actually do physics,2,cdhkdhk,1qwtsc,askscience,hot,6.0,4

Mackerie,Memory research is such a hot topic in PsychologyNeuroscience right now Theres so much research out there because its so easily testable  Theres  stages of memory encoding storage and retrieval and changes in any of these stages will affect how a memory is stored and subsequently how it is recalled For normal people ie people without lesions in their brains the encoding phase is I think usually the most important in memory consolidation There is a theory that elaborative rehearsal will aid memory For example when you see a stimulus you can shallowly process it ie just look at it or you can make more connections with other systems in your brain ie I saw this yesterday too or this other time it was blue etc Elaborative rehearsal will always help encode memories better This is why teachers and profs suggest finding a way to personalize the information you study or new ways to synthesize information Another factor is what type of memory youre trying to recall Episodic memories memory of personal events  what we usually consider memory will always be easier to recall than semantic facts and feel more poignant because theres a lot of details associated One theory that might explain why is that semantic memories are more generalized and abstract version of episodic memories to allow for application across different contexts and thus less details  Emotional impact is also a large factor as well Events that are more emotionally salient will be remembered better than nonemotional events There are various studies of this and if you want I can suggest a few  Also you cant forget about learned associations this is more into the realm of implicit memory ie skill memory and priming etc For example if I always associate a certain classroom with a time when I failed a test then I will always activate certain negative stereotypes when entering the room a context and end up activating other associated memories and thought about failing tests or times when Ive failed  If you have strong associations between a context and a certain stimulus you will have stronger activation scripts for activation of memories of that stimulus  Hopefully this will satiate your interest in memory research slightly until someone else can come along with a more detailed answer cTLDR the brain is mfing confusing ,0,cdhe2fe,1qwuy1,askscience,hot,3.0,3

Clack,Hey Im just a lowly microbio student but I might be able to help out some until someone more educated comes along Just dont take anything I say as verified truthSo a big part of figuring out when specific traits came into existence is looking at the genetic code of different populations We can look at different populations and see ok this trait only developed after this group became separate from this other group The ability to digest lactase actually had multiple origins we have determined because there are multiple genes which allow this which occur in different places in the genome So for example and this is just me talking say we found the gene allowing for lactase digestion on chromosome four in  northern Europeans but a different gene allowing for it on chromosome ten in Mongolian people And say Southern Europeans didnt have either gene This tells us the trait developed in Northern Europeans after they split off from the Southern Europeans And that Mongolians probably evolved their gene separately and we could look at related populations to determine when that came about We can tell when these splits occurred by looking at other genes and by comparing what we see genetically with historical and archeological dataI recommend Dawkins book The Selfish Gene where he does a much better job of explaining how genes are actually the driving force behind evolution and how events like this happenWikipedia has a decent article to serve as a starting point if youre interested in learning more about the spread of lactase tolerance,2,cdhg2tv,1qx8oq,askscience,hot,7.0,5
vegetablehater,As evolution proceeds certain mutations are selected for or against depending if they are helpful or hurtful to the survival of an organism in the current environment  The individuals who have the good mutations will do a better job of accumulating resources throughout their lifetime or simply not die thus have more offspring than the individuals without the beneficial mutation and thus be a larger percentage of the next generation  The thing is that evolution doesnt just pick out a winner and make sure everyone in a population has that adaptation  Evolution doesnt engineer a solution it has to work with the variation that already exists in nature and optimize it  That means that not everyone has exactly the same DNA sequence and you can make comparisons between individuals to see what is different  If you look for the specific mutation that expands the expression of lactase to the entire life vs just as a baby  You can see that it is centered in Europe and populations outside Europe have a much smaller percentage of the population with that specific mutation that allows them to do that  There are some complicated statistical tests that you can do based on how much of an advantage it provides to be able to drink milk and the generation time of humans to try and get an idea about when a mutation like that might have arisen given how prevalent in a population it is now  In this case they also combine it with some archeological data about how long ago they know humans invented dairy production and kind of put the two together to get that  year old estimate  There are also other ways to calculate how old a mutation is based on specific signatures that evolution leaves in DNA sequence as time passes  Not every mutation is an important one  Unimportant changes often get accumulated at a standard rate and you can kind of count up those around a change you care about up to get an idea about how long selection has been acting on a specific gene or region of the chromosome  This can also tell you if a mutation has been selected for positive selection against negative selection removed from a population purifying selection or a bunch of other stuff depending on how crazy you want to get with your modeling and statistics  It is kinda cool that DNA is both the blueprint for building every thing that is alive on earth as well as a history of what has happened to arrive at that specific version of an organism all at the same time  The primary article about the milk drinking in Europe is here and open access free to read in case you want to read it for yourselfhttpwwwploscompbiolorgarticleinfoAdoiFFjournalpcbiTLDR  They combined archeological data population genetic data and some statistical models to get the  to  year estimate  ,1,cdhodwl,1qx8oq,askscience,hot,3.0,2
FizixPhun,The heart of your question lies in solid state physics  This is a subset of quantum mechanics aimed at understanding why solids behave the way they do  On a quantum level current is still just the amount of charge that moves through some space in a given time  The only difference is that the charge is now packaged up into discrete units electrons protons and other charged fundamental particlesTo understand how current flows in a material you first have to understand electrons behave in a material  The key feature of solid state physics is that many materials are crystals  This means that the atoms are spaced periodically  As you mention band structures are the way that we summarize the effect of this periodic potential  Basically a band structure just relates an electrons momentum pmvhbar k to its energy  The momentum can be positive or negative the sign only denotes direction  In free space this is very boring Energym v   p mhbar k m  When you throw in a periodic potential this becomes modified and results in bands   Actually calculating band structures is quite difficult  The key idea is that there are ranges of energy where the electron can live and ranges of energy where the electron cannot live  The electrons in a crystal live in the band structure  Each atom of the crystal brings a certain number of electrons with it  They fill the states in the bands starting from the lowest energy  Each of these states has a specific momentum associated with it  When a band is filled the next electron has to be placed in a state in the next highest band   Applying a voltage to a material is the same as applying an electric field to the material EVl where l is the length of the material  In the semiclassical picture electrons with charge e feel a force FeE in the applied electric field  This force accelerates the electrons from lower voltage to higher voltage they are negatively charged so lower voltage is actually higher energy for them as EnergyVq where q is the charge including the sign  These moving electrons constitute your current  A caveat to this is that electrons really live in quantum states and no two electrons can live in the same statePauli exclusion principle as electrons are Fermions  The electric field really moves electrons from states with one momentum to states with a momentum that is in the direction of the electric field  If the band is full all the states are full and the electric field cannot change the electrons state so no current flows  This is an insulator  When a band is partway filled there are states that the electric field can move the electrons to  This allows a current to flowTransistors are a little more complicated  The main thing you have to understand is p doping and n doping semiconductors  Imagine you have a crystal of silicon  If you take out a silicon atom and put a phosphorus atom in its place you suddenly have an extra electron  A single phosphorus atom wont change your band structure as you still have  silicon atoms so its like you just added an extra electron to your system  Semiconductors have a filled band with another band with only slightly more energy ish eV  This extra electron from the phosphorus cant live in our filled band called the valence band because there are no more states  It must live in the next band the conduction band  If you apply an electric field this electron in the conduction band can flow because pretty much all the states in its band are empty  This is called n doping because we added an extra negative charge the extra electron  If instead of a phosphorus atom we add an aluminum atom we have one less electron  If the aluminum steals an electron from a neighbor this neighbor now is missing an electron  Instead of thinking of the aluminum as stealing an electron you can think of the aluminum as giving the neighboring atom an empty state  This empty state is called a hole in solid state physics  A hole is basically a missing electron and it behaves like a particle with charge e  If you apply an electric field to it it can move around by trading places with an electron  Again you get a current  We call this p doping a material as it is now missing an electron or you can think of it as having positively charged particles holes  Transistors are semiconductors with a p doped region surrounded on both sides by an n doped region or vice versa  Honestly I study physics and not material science or electrical engineering so Im not super familiar with the details of how a transistor works  I hope this helps  Sorry its so long windededitI explain how to find band structures in two limits down in the commentsedit Paragraphs,61,cdho5j8,1qx8zd,askscience,hot,368.0,307
akanthos,Conduction band electrons arent treated discretely and arent part of any particular orbital in general Rather they are said to be delocalized with probability distributions that are spread out over the entire lattice instead of atomic or molecular orbitals This is usually modeled as a sea of electrons around cations One model if this you can look up is the Drude model A more quantum phenomenon is the promotion of electrons from the valence band into the conduction band Electrons can tunnel across this potential barrier,20,cdhg6x3,1qx8zd,askscience,hot,100.0,80

wbeaty,gt would current moving through a regular metal be like each electron appearing in the closest neighboring orbital as a chain reaction when a voltage is applied to the metalIt might help you to visualize the Classical Physics version first  Then add in all the QM weird stuff on top   Start with Newton and Maxwell   Theres lots of justification for this since electric currents certainly arent inherently QM   The QM becomes significant when the carriers are very low mass and in periodic potential wells electrons in crystals   But this doesnt apply to electric current in oceans and electrophorisis and sparks and in human tissue where the moving carriers are enormous ions and in some cases are even directly visible  To get a visual gutlevel feel for the physics behind electronic components assume that conductors are hoses full of salt water rather than metalsOK first all conductors are always full of positive and negative charged particles with one or both being mobile  Whenever a conductive material is disconnected or sitting on a shelf unpowered its charge carriers will be in constant highspeed thermal motion same as with any liquid or gas  This motion is required since without it all the opposite particles would fall together and become electrically immobile  For example in sea water if the positive sodium and negative chloride atoms all paired up and stuck together then conductivity would vanish  Any applied voltage wouldnt cause any carrier flow   Thermal motion keeps the carriers free to respond to an efieldSo a conductor is like a container of gas with the gas composed of two populations of particles  positive charges and negative charges  Overall the conductor starts out neutral yet its still extremely electrical since the positives and negatives can flow along separately in different directions  Thats a Classical model of electrolytic conductorsIn Classical metals the positive particles are much more massive than the negative and the positives are connected to the container and can only move as it moves  So a Classical Physics model of a metal would be a positivelycharged sponge wetted with a fluid of mobile negative particlesWhat happens when we apply a difference in potential to the ends of a long conductor   Well all conductors are electromagnetic shields  If we try to create an internal efield along the length of a long conductor this field will not instantly appear inside the material  Instead mobile charges at the surface of the conductor will try to flow so as to produce zero field inside the conductor   For a perfect zeroohms wire the applied efield would only cause the mobile charges on the surface to start flowing   So close a switch and all the mobile charges within the surface of the wire all suddenly begin flowing at about the same time  They flow quite slowly   But they all start up at once like turning on a conveyor belt  Next quite rapidly the outer layer of flowing charges interacts with inner layers of movable carriers and the deeper layers begin flowing as well  The surface current sags inside the wire and within a fraction of a second the entire chargecloud inside the conductor is in slow motion  In metals the positive stays still and the negative cloud moves along   During currents in electrolytes and in unrefined semiconductors and in intrinsic semis thered be two populations of carriers moving slow in opposite directions interpenetrating clouds of positives and negatives both flowing through each otherNote that this slow avearage motion is added to the constant highspeed thermal vibration of all the chargecarriers  The random dance of carriers is always there and the momentary velocity of individual carriers is on average immensely fast  In salt water the charges are wiggling at the speed of sound in metals the electrons fly around at nearly the speed of light   An electric current happens when the entire dance floor then moves along very slowly   I like to visualize this as a screen full of television whitenoise inside the conductor where electric currents exist whenever the fastsparkling screen starts moving along at about a tenth of a MPH  This velocity is proportional to amperes double the drift velocity and you double the value of currentHow about Classic Physics bandgapsThats easy   In our above model of metal as postive sponge containing a negative fluid  lets imagine that the negative particles can either be stuck to the sponge surface or they can be flowing freely around inside the pockets of the sponge   Let those stuck particles move along the sponge surface without breaking free   That gives us some lowenergy particles on the sponge  Low energy because theyve been attracted in and trapped  It takes electrical energy to pull them away against the electrical attraction between positive sponge versus negative particle   Also we then have a population of high energy particles which havent fallen down to the sponge surface and they remain wandering around in the material at a higher level   If a free highenergy particle should fall down and crash into the positive sponge this gives out energy it produces a significant EMP a ripple of EM waves   And large impulses of EM waves are able to occasionally free one of the negative particles sliding around against the positive sponge surface  If a particle breaks free it momentairly casts a shadow and absorbs the EM waves which knocked it looseThats raw silicon with heavy p n doping   Should I do intrinsic semis   PN

novayazemlya,At its core the existence of a band gap in a semiconductor is a quantum phenomenon Lets say you have a semiconductor with a large band gap  electron Volt at  Kelvin You apply a voltage difference of  electron Volts and still the electrons dont go anywhere because there isnt enough voltage or thermal energy to excite the electrons across the band gap But what IS a band gap Its not a vacuum its just a bunch of quantum states that our wouldbe conduction electrons cannot occupy due to selection rules Other things bonded electrons etc are occupying those states so our Valence band electrons cant go thereThere are some phenomena where current is carried in discreet quanta eg single electrons that can be measured However this does not really apply to normal conductors such as metals under normal conditions such as ambient temperature and pressure As others have said current in a normal wire can be described by a sea of delocalized electrons which are free to move with an external electric field without being constrained by the localized electric potential of the individual atoms in the wireBUT when you start looking at nanoscaled low dimensional systems such as carbon nanotubes graphene lattice or quantum dots especially at low temperatures conduction becomes quantized very quickly In these special cases instead of a sea of free electrons participating in conduction you can have just a few sometimes just ONE electron that is able to move from its current energy state to another available energy state You start observing things like Coulomb BlockadehttpenwikipediaorgwikiCoulombblockade and measuring discreet quanta of conductancehttpenwikipediaorgwikiConductancequantum,1,cdhqie4,1qx8zd,askscience,hot,4.0,3
drwho,You can end up with band structure via tight binding or nearly free models of electrons in a solid I feel like you are asking are the electrons really bound tightly or are they freeI think you could generalize your question even further what does anything look like at the quantum level We pick wave and particle models because those classical systems share properties of the quantum world but neither is really correct Transport in a solid can take place in all sorts of ways There are electrons which are highly localized in some materials These often create bands with low mobilities In simple metals say Na the nearly free picture works well But what does it look like Well you have your normal uncertainty principle tradeoffs but you really are asking I feel is what is the coherence length of the wavefunction Over how many lattice points is the wavefunction spread out Vanilla quantum statics you learn on the undergraduate level does not treat dissipation or inelastic scattering If you presume atoms are localized and you have some scattering and you have a voltage applied the big spread out wavefunction occasionally actually all the time should collapse and localize at an atomic site If it scatters without collapse it would be just entangled with the state of the atom and that process is hard to get see quantum computing so we can pretty safely say in the transistors you are studying that it is very particley at each scattering and wavey between them This is all very handwavy but they are reasonably useful toy models I thinkSome real models of transport in metals httpenwikipediaorgwikiDrudemodel httpenwikipediaorgwikiFreeelectronmodel httpenwikipediaorgwikiFermiliquidtheory httpenwikipediaorgwikiBCStheoryOverall transport is often modeled with the Boltzmann equation httpenwikipediaorgwikiBoltzmannequationMost of this stuff is graduate level solidstate physics ,1,cdht6ni,1qx8zd,askscience,hot,4.0,3

CoolStoryJohn,A less detailednuanced answer for those curious about the basics of these questionsP Current is merely the aggregate motion of electrons  So if one were to watch current one would be viewing the displacement of a large batch of electrons from point to point in an electrical circuit  In a standard metal remember that electrons can be viewed as pooled together almost like a special type of bonding mechanism  That pool would be the group of electrons that compose the current  Naturally though a circular or rectangular bar ie a complete circuit doesnt just inherently have a current  A voltage needs to be applied to the circuit in order to excite if you will the group of electrons into motionthus producing the current  P Voltage is really just the electric analog to gravitys potential energy  You have an object raised some distance h off of the ground which well define as our reference pointh  m and that object has a potential energy of mgh massgravitational accelerationh  There is no physical indication of the object having that potential energy but it merely contains it as a result of being displaced from the reference point the ground in this case while in the presence of a gravitational field  Voltage can be viewed almost exactly the same except the object is a point in an active electrical circuit and the physical ground is the electrical ground defined as  Volts  ,1,cdif07s,1qx8zd,askscience,hot,3.0,2
imsowitty,Of course there are many ways to think of this sort of thing but one that may be useful is simple electrostatic attractionrepulsion  If you can convince yourself that like charges repel then flowing current ends up as positive or negative charges trying to get away from each other  An electric potential is set up by pumping extra charge into one section on a conductor and letting electrostatics push the remaining charges away  If youre getting into transistors you may be dealing with depletion regions and work functions but the same idea applies  A lower work function material simply has less affinity for its electrons so its more likely to give them up to another material with more affinity for electrons call it a lower energy state until enough charges build up on the high work function material that the built up charge prevents further current flow  ,0,cdhoh83,1qx8zd,askscience,hot,1.0,1
venikk,A voltage is defined to be the potential of a coulumb of charge in an electric field This is synonymous to gravitational potential of an object More mass means more gravitational potential and more charge means more voltage Likewise the closer two charges are the higher the voltage and the closer two massive objects are the more they attract They also are both attracted by the inverse square law relationship The attraction increases exponentially as they approach eachotherVoltage is a manmade abstract quantity that is anywhere and everywhere there is a difference in charge An Ampere is defined as one coulumb of charge passing through one Ohm of resistance per second So current is literally electrons passing through a conductor It should be noted that these electrons behave like wind or gases Not all electrons are going in the direction of the current but on a per charge basis most are It should also be noted that the electrons arent necessarily traveling at the speed of light or at the speed of the current In a circuit electrons are pushing on eachother and it is the speed of which the first and last electrons push on eachother that gives us the lightning fast speed of electricity The physical drift velocity of a electron is generally less than a cm per second,0,cdhpelk,1qx8zd,askscience,hot,1.0,1

BoxAMu,Power delivered by the source is P  VI  The question is what the power is going to be used for  For a resistive element in a circuit VIR so Pres  I R  This shows that the power lost to resistance goes like the square of the current so to cut down on resistive loses one wants to minimize the current  If voltage is made very high and current is made very low then the total power PVI can stay the same but less of it will be wasted on resistance which simply heats the wires  This means that for high voltage transmission more of the power is spent on doing useful work,0,cdho6z2,1qxtyn,askscience,hot,5.0,5
selfification,uBoxAMu has a relevant answer but it in my opinion it doesnt quite address why there is different amounts of power loss when you vary voltageIll try  Power  voltage  amperage  Correct  Consider for a moment a power generator that produces a certain constant amount of power from burning coal or splitting atoms or whatever  You cant change this amount  You goal is to get as much power to your customers desired power loss as possible and to reduce as power loss in your circuit undesired power loss as possible  After all  all the power must be consumedlost at some pointLets consider a simple series circuits of  resistors  Pretend that one of these is the load resistor the customers toaster and the other is the resistance of the power line  From the above constraints you cant actually change the voltage at all  The voltage you can apply is entirely determined by the max power you can dissipate  The only way you can change the amount of power on the load is by varying the resistance of the power line  If you can reduce the resistance of the power line to  then all power will be delivered to the load resistance  In a purely resistive circuit you cant vary voltage while keeping the total power output constantSo clearly all this voltage updown conversion has to do with circuits that arent purely resistive  Power transformers are coupled inductive circuits  It uses Faradays law to exploit the fact that a changing magnetic field inside a closed loop with generate a nonzero voltage more technically a nonvanishing line integral of the electric field along the closed loop  You can read about this at httpenwikipediaorgwikiTransformer  The trick here is as follows  there are  circuits the circuit from the power source through one side of the transformer windings and the circuit with the load through the other side of the windings  If these two windings were isolated from each other no power would flow from one to the other  The power supply im assuming an AC power source would see some selfinductance from the windings that would act like an antenna but thats about itIf we coupled the two circuits things change  The impedance seen by the power supply now changes impedance is the fancy word for resistance with capacitance and inductance worked into it  The power supply now sees the load resistor but doesnt directly see it  Because of the way the transformer is structured it sees the load resistor as a multiple of what the loads impedance actually is  This ratio of what the power source sees and what the impedance actually is is determined by the square of the ratio of windings on either side of the transformer  You can see the trick weve done here  Instead of simply lowering the resistance of the wire we instead found a way to cheat and increase the impedance of the load helping us proportionally deliver more power to it not necessarily true when dealing with impedances but it happens to be so in this caseThe voltage balance on either side of the windings is an outcome of this cheat that we performed  Since the actual load expects a certain voltage to satisfy its power requirement the apparent load that the power source sees through the coupled circuit now requires a much much higher voltages based on the square of the ratio of windings to deliver the same power  Therefore the power source increases its voltage to account for this decreasing the total current in the circuit to remain at the same power level  This circuit does not obey Ohms law  at least not the naive formulation of it  The apparent load seen by the circuit is not a resistor but has inductive elements to it  More advanced treatment of this has to deal with the impedance matching of the circuits so that power actually makes it to the other side of a transformer  In a circuit is not correctly impedance matched power never actually makes it through to the coupled circuit and is returned to the source which is very very bad,0,cdi0f5w,1qxtyn,askscience,hot,2.0,2

ssjsonic,The effect that uveganakos mentioned is not a strong effect  The dominating mechanism is as followsAs you turn up the temperature the composition in the atmosphere changes  Cool stars have many transition lines because the atmosphere has molecules and they have many ways of absorbing photons  Heat up the atmosphere and the molecules break into single atoms  Single atoms also have lines due to the transition between electron states  However turn up the heat more and the electrons begin to be stripped away from the atom  More heat means less electrons bound to atoms and less possible transitions  Hydrogen and Helium transitions require a good chunk of energy so hotter stars will produce deeper absorption features here  However for the hottest stars the fraction of ionized H and He increases and the lines become weaker once againHere are some ionization energies ordered from the outermost electron to the innermost electron remember H and He only have  and  electronshttpdeptastrolsaumicheducowleyionenhtmEdit Notice that most elements have a small requirement to remove the first electron but a much larger requirement for the second electron H and He are an exception to this where the first electron requires a medium amount of energy,0,cdia12v,1qygpc,askscience,hot,2.0,2

Astromike,Unlike solidbody rotation gravity decreases in force as the distance squared Two coins on a turntable make a full orbit in exactly the same amount of time Two planets around the Sun do notIn order to keep an object moving in a circle there must be an acceleration acting on that object By acceleration I dont mean that its speeding up but rather that its velocity is constantly changing direction There will be a balance between the tangential velocity always trying to propel the object away from the circle and the acceleration keeping it on the circle This careful balance can be written in equation form asa  vr        where a is the acceleration v is the velocity and r is the radius of the circle In the case of gravitational acceleration Newton taught us thats its equal toa  GMr           where G is the gravitational constant M is the mass of the central body and r is again the radius We can set these two things equal and solve for vvr  GMrv  sqrtGMr    So the velocity of an orbit decreases as  as one over the square root of the size of the circle In other words if a planet is  times as far from the Sun as Earth its velocity will be half that of Earths to stay in a circular orbit This is simply because gravity weakens as one gets further from the source and so the velocity must also decrease to stay in a circle  otherwise it would go flying offNow in the case of a turntable the velocity increases with increasing distance The coin at the edge of the turntable traces out a larger circle than the coin near the center even though they both must make a full circle in the same amount of time so the edgecoin must be moving more quickly In fact the equation for how quickly a coin must move will bevωrwhere ω is how fast the turntable is spinning We can substitute that v into equation  to find the accelerationa  ωrr  ωrr  ωr   So in the turntable case the acceleration to stay in a circle actually increases with increasing distance very different from gravity This makes sense  imagine you were sitting on a giant rotating turntable the size of city block It would be easy to sit still if your were close to the centerbut at the edge youd have to hold on for dear lifeTLDR Because gravity decreases with increasing distance ,1,cdhtklg,1qykuu,askscience,hot,2.0,1

Goeatabagofdicks,Believe it or not gravity is actually considered a weak force  With response to the question you asked like the others have said you are referring to cetripetal force  With gravity you are creating a warp in space time depending on the mass of the object  So when astronaughts are weightless in space truly they are not  The are constantly falling towards the earth  Idk if you are from America but here in various malls and such we have a concave coin donation object where you place a quarter in and it spins around and around going faster and faster until its ultimately deposited into the hole in the center  This is a great representation of space time  The more concave it is the greater the mass of the object  Size really doesnt matter its mass  If I had a cotton ball the size of the earth it would warp space time significantly less than a lead ball the size of the earth  Further the falling of the object is independant of the rotation of the earth  Now lets speak of centripetal force  Lets say I attach a pole of infinite strength to Pluto  It takes something like  years for Pluto to have one rotation around the sun  If its orbit in the solar system was directly related and fixed to the rotation of the earth it would be hauling butt around the sun  Much like if I put you on rollerscates in a parking lot  Im in the center holding a pole that you are whipping you around  Depending on the length of the pole the faster you go  Gravity is a warp in time space what you suggest is centripetal force,3,cdhuhyx,1qykuu,askscience,hot,1.0,-2

coloroftheskye,There are particles which we call Force carriers These particles are used to explain how forces act on a distance For instance in the sense of magnetic attraction and repulsion we explain it by an exchange of virtual photons As you may know photons are massless and thus the distance they can travel is infinite other forces such as the strong and weak nuclear force are mediated by other particles which do have mass That is why these forces get much more weaker over a distance than the electromagnetic force On very small distance scales these forces are stronger than the electromagnetic force and thus protons can exist protons are positively charged and thus repel each other but on the small scale in the nucleus the nuclear force is stronger For the very same reason fusion is so hard to achieve We first need to overcome the electromagnetic repulsion from the electrons and nuclei before the nuclear force can take overwikipedia is quite helpful with this httpenwikipediaorgwikiForcecarrier,1,cdhtyt4,1qymea,askscience,hot,3.0,2

afcagroo,It is really hard to address this without knowing what is meant by memory performance If it means the speed or bandwidth of the memory then the answer is fairly simple Most of the Moores Law improvements in memory are used to put more bits onto a die rather than to increase how fast bits can be accessed  The former is simply more valuable in general than the latter since as someone else mentioned the bandwidth is somewhat constrained by other factors such as the PCB traces and number of IOs available in a given space    There is a tradeoff to be made  You can keep the bit cell capacitance fairly high so that the charge transfer settles quickly and you can read the cell faster or you can reduce the bit cell capacitance and make a smaller cell but take a penalty for longer settling times   It is possible to instead make the memory faster but not much more dense and to some extent that has been done in the past on SRAMs But at some point you get two where making the chip faster is nonsensical since you cant get the information inout any faster in a reasonably practical system    If you look for charts of DRAM density as a function of time I think you will find it improving at a similar rate to processor performance At one time it was actually improving a bit faster but I dont know if thats true today     Some of the manufacturing technologies are different too Processors tend to use straight CMOS logic DRAMs need to maximize the capacitance of the bit cell so they have gone to some trench technologies and vertical stacking that require unusual processes  ,0,cdi1els,1qypga,askscience,hot,4.0,4

FizixPhun,I dont know the exact answer but here is my guess given my knowledge of Bose Einstein condensates and radioactive decayFirst lets talk about radioactive decay  Basically this is when an atom has a nucleus that is too large to be stable and a chunk flies off to make it more stable   The result is an atom with a different atomic number hence a different element from our original atom and some other decay productsNow lets discuss Bose Einstein condensates  This is a phenomenon that occurs when many bosons occupy the lowest energy state the ground state  The wave function for our system must include information about all the particles  Bosons are identical particles that are required to have a wave function that is even under the interchange of any two labels for our particles  The key nugget is that changing the state of even one of the bosons changes the wave function for all particles and is therefore energetically unfavorableNow lets combine these aspects  To get a Bose Einstein condensate we must first have atoms that are bosons  Now we also need these atoms to be radioactive which pretty much limits us to very heavy elements  Now cool them to a sufficiently low temperature that they are all in the ground state and behave as a condensate  If an atom radioactively decays it is no longer the same type of identical particle and it can no longer be part of the condensate  The Bose Einstein condensate only occurs when the bosons are indistinguishable  Clearly atoms of different elements are distinguishable  This would cause the wave function to change as it goes from n identical bosons to n identical bosons and one other atom  Basically we just have one less atom in our condensate  Im almost  confident that being in a condensate would not cause all atoms to radioactively decay if one does  Im less certain but suspect that being in a condensate would not prevent an atom from radioactively decaying  In reality this would be pretty difficult to measure as the critical temperature below which a condensate occurs scales as mass  As previously stated radioactivity occurs mostly in very massive elements which means that the condensates would be very hard to achieve because they would require exceptionally low temperaturesMaybe some atomic and ultracold experts can comment on this ,1,cdih7an,1qypjq,askscience,hot,2.0,1

Whisket,To start there is a distinction between temperature and heat In a given amount of water the temperature of water is the average energy level amongst all of the molecules of water However heat is the quantity of energy that the amount of water has in total As an example the ocean has a lot more heat than a boiling cup of tea but the cup of tea has a higher temperature The quantity of heat in the ocean is greater than the tea but the average temperature in the cup of tea is greater than the oceanAt room temperature the average energy levels in the water is not great enough to cause it to evaporate However individual water molecules do not all have the same quantity of heat and some can gain enough energy to evaporate This amount of energy is then lost from the source of water evaporative cooling but it will soon be replaced from the ambient air at room temperature Thus the average temperature will remain constant but individual water molecules are capable of evaporating if they gain more energyThis is also why things will dry faster with higher temperature even below boiling The average temperature of the water molecules is higher and a molecule takes less deviation from the average to gain enough energy to evaporate,9,cdi3e43,1qzdx1,askscience,hot,37.0,28

owaisofspades,because viruses have RNA when they replicate their genetic material the RNA polymerase can replicate the entire strand whereas DNA replication cuts a tiny bit off the end of the strand every time therefore they can replicate their RNA a virtually unlimited number of times Because of this unrestrained replication the probability of mistakes arising during replication increases and these mistakes can occasionally lead to beneficial mutations As mentioned earlier other organisms can only replicate a limited number of times in most cells so the probability of having a mutation let  alone a beneficial one is relatively lowThe second question is beyond the scope of my knowledge,3,cdicdri,1r0dir,askscience,hot,1.0,-2

SqueakyGate,We cant know for sure but here are some interesting dates  years ago it is postulated that humans reached a point known as behavioural modernityhttpenwikipediaorgwikiBehavioralmodernity One hypothesis holds that behavioral modernity occurred as a sudden event some  kya  years ago in prehistory possibly as a result of a major genetic mutation or as a result of a biological reorganization of the brain that led to the emergence of modern human natural languages These humans were like us in every way so it is very very likely that you could mate with and produce viable offspring with these humans Moreover these humans could be brought up in a modern society and would be able to blend in perfectly from both a physical and behavioural perspective  Anatomically modern humans arose about  years ago It is very likely that you could mate and produce viable offspring with these humans as well Although the evidence is less clear that these individuals behaved like us For example we are unsure if they could have developed the same level of language complexity as ourselves These anatomically modern humans could be brought up in a modern society and would be able to blend in perfectly from a physical perspective however they may not be able to blend in from a behavioural perspective It is worth noting that he second hypothesis holds that there was never any single technological or cognitive revolution Proponents of this view argue that modern human behavior is the result of the gradual accumulation of knowledge skills and culture occurring over hundreds of thousands of years of human evolution Therefore the dates for  to  kya may not be so hard and fast Other homo species We know that about  of human DNA is NeanderthalhttpenwikipediaorgwikiNeanderthalCoexistencewithHsapienssapiens in origin We know that early humans and neanderthals could interbreed and produce viable offspring Since it is very likely that modern humans could reproduce with ancient humans living  years ago than it stands to reason that modern humans and neanderthals could interbreed and produce viable offspring A few important caveats are worth mentioning  DNA can be explained by a small number of interbreeding events This means that interbreeding events were probably uncommon Human and Neanderthal populations did not overlap completely therefore not all humans encountered neanderthals or vice versa This means any interbreeding that occurred was not widespread Neanderthals evolved about  years ago in Europe conversely humans evolved about  years ago in Africa Humans migrated out of Africa and into Asia about  years ago Humans and neanderthals only encountered each other in Europe from about  years ago Thus neanderthals and humans had been evolving independently for thousands of years Behaviourally Neanderthals and Humans were very different even more so around the time when they first began to encounter one another Humans were better communicators better innovators engaged in long distance trade and were expanding into new environments as well as exploiting them in novel ways In contrast Neanderthals were somewhat limited they had a relatively stagnant tool culture and and their cultural expressions were not as complex as humans Humans at the time were beginning to express themselves symbolically whereas neanderthals seemed only to be able to make jewellery possibly some cave art and possibly engaged in symbolic burials We know nothing about the context in which the exchange of DNA took placewe dont know if it was consensual or not This has important implications for how the two populations viewed each other Were they hostile friendly did they compete over resources archeological evidence suggests yes they did or did they cooperate with each other These questions help us better understand the complexity of their social worlds and how we might delineate these two populations separate species subspecies or the same species We know that flow of DNA was in one direction While modern humans share some nuclear DNA with the extinct Neanderthals the two species do not share any mitochondrial DNA which in primates is always maternally transmitted This observation has prompted the hypothesis that whereas female humans interbreeding with male Neanderthals were able to generate fertile offspring the progeny of female Neanderthals who mated with male humans were either rare absent or sterile This raises questions about hybrid vigour and questions the assumption that we were the same species At the very least it appears as if we were speciating given the level of behavioural separation which had already taken placeWhat does this mean for other hominin species like H erectus We cant know with  certainty if modern humans or even ancient humans could mate with these other extinct species However given the low levels of breeding with Neanderthals the extensive evidence which suggests we were very different behaviourally and the lack of support for strong hybrid vigour I would come to the conclusion that it is unlikely that humans ancient or modern could produce viable offspring with any other hominin species other than neanderthalsMore on our coexistence with

BoxAMu,This had th century physicists stumped too  It used to be believed that a medium for EM wave propagation called the luminiferous ether pervaded all space  However this should change the properties of EM interactions namely wave speed for observers moving relative to the ether just as motion with respect to still air changes the effective properties of soundLong story short this change of wave properties is not seen  Light always travels at c   x  ms in free space regardless of the relative motion of observer and source  Moreover based on the theory of relativity it is meaningless to even try to define some absolute space in which the ether could be located  No medium for the propagation of EM waves existsSo what IS an EM wave  The question is hard to pin down  The laws of physics correctly explain all observed EM phenomena so it seems that this question is not directly relevant to experimental science  But indeed the idea of a wave without a medium is hard to visualize,1,cdijd5s,1r15bm,askscience,hot,15.0,14

bmg,As i understand it EM radiation is a wave created through self propogating electric and magnetic fields That means there is no medium necessary for the wave to move through it  just the capability for empty space to have a quantifiable magneticelectric field which can be zero at any point so its not exactly a medium like water or air The quantized form of this wave is a particle the photon Sometimes it is easier to picture radiation as photons traveling through space ,0,cditcon,1r15bm,askscience,hot,3.0,3
RoarofTime,Sound can be recorded into a microphone where it is converted into electrical energy and stored in a computer hard drive The electrical energy can then be converted into a radio wave using an antenna Radio waves are really small particleswaves called photons and are a form of electromagnetic radiation Visible light is exactly the same thing just at a smaller wavelength as are XRays Gamma Rays Ultraviolet Rays etc Photons require no atomic medium to travel so they can travel through space They travel at the Speed of Light through space Photons can be picked up by other antennas and converted into electrical energy again and then be converted into mechanical energy by a vibrating magnet or a speaker This mechanical energy is transferred through the air by the atoms in the air colliding with each other in a wave pattern I suppose you could see them as a sort of atom sized photon some people call them phonons The colliding atom chain reaction enters your ear canal where it is converted back into electrical energy and processed by your brain which you perceive as sound By changing the electrical energy that vibrates the magnet the vibration can be faster or slower making different sounds by changing the force applied to the atoms Heres a nifty chart for the electromagnetic radiation spectrum if youre interested httpmynasadatalarcnasagovimagesEMSpectrumnewjpgAnd heres a rather cool video I found that shows that sound waves are simply moving atomic matterhttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvwvJAgrUBFw,0,cdinc4m,1r15bm,askscience,hot,1.0,1
CoolStoryJohn,A very simplistic answer is that sound is essentially a sequence of vibrations that travel through a region molecules in the environment being the vehicles for vibration ie molecules in the environment are responsible for the transportation of the sound whereas a radio wave can be viewed as its own transport vehicle selfsufficient  Space has no atmosphere and thus no molecules so sound cannot travel  However as mentioned radio waves arent dependent on their environment in that way so they are able to travel in space  ,1,cdiy9vv,1r15bm,askscience,hot,2.0,1

RationalAnimal,This is a good question   And the posters above are not wrong as far as their answers go but there is a sense in which the original question is not answered As others have pointed out contemporary physics has it that light exhibits a waveparticle duality  The sense in which light is a wave is in modern physics only a metaphorical sense In the literal sense a wave is a higherorder property of some physical substrate   Waves in water are the more voluminous sections of water in a pattern of more wave and less trough voluminous sections of water   Waves of sound are patterns of sections of air with greater and then lesser air pressure   Light waves however are not now believed to be real waves in any other physical substrate  For a very long time it has been known that light exhibits behaviors that waves exhibit  Light diffracts through thin slits for example into fanshaped patterns of different colors of light  Light exhibits interference behaviors like water waves do  This evidence led scientists to believe for a very long time that light too was a wave  So they reasoned if light were a wave there must be some physical substrate of which it is a wave   Aether was posited as the substance patterned variations in which were light waves It turns out however that there is no other evidence for aether other than the fact that light seems wavelike   There is no detectable drag on moving objects in the vacuum of space  There are no relativemotion effects exhibited by light relative to the direction of earths motion around the sun as one would expect if earth were traveling with respect to aether  And so on  So the notion that there is aether was dropped but we were still left with the awkward exhibition of wavelike behavior of light   Thats pretty much where we are now as far as a comprehensible physical model of light is concerned  The claims that light is a selfpropogating wave or that light is the kind of wave that is not a wave in anything else are not really meant to explain the puzzling sounding claim that light is a wave of nothing  That is these claims are not meant as ways of thinking of waves in a literal sense as a physical model of what light really is  They are just ways of saying that light exhibits wavelike behaviors sometimes and that a representation of light as a wave permits one to predict the behaviors of real light accurately   Even the claim sometimes made that we can think of light waves as probability waves isnt meant to offer a description of a physical model of light  It is a shorthand way of saying that there are higher probabilities of detecting photons at certain places in beams of light and that the pattern of these probabilities has a formal resemblance to physical waves So the question of how light can be a wave without being a wave of something isnt really answered by modern physics  Its better to think of modern physics as telling us that that macrolevel real waves are not a physical model of real light but that light nevertheless exhibits wavelike properties   What light really is is something modern physics tells us that has no analogue in our direct macrolevel experience  But we know it travels through a vacuum  So there you go  ,0,cdjj6kf,1r15bm,askscience,hot,1.0,1

DanielSank,A relative of mine does this stuff for a living so I can tell you what Ive learned by asking the same question Note that this is a combination of what Ive heard and what makes senseIssues that you have to worry about when sending electronics to space Radiation Without the atmosphere as a shield there is more radiation in space When a circuit gets hit by this radiation a variety of things can go wrong A digital memory element may change state This could lead to errors in CPU or FPGA controller chips This is particularly a problem if the physical features are really small so you have to get old parts that dont use current lithography scales Analog parts may have problems too but Im not sure Parts that are qualified to not have errors when exposed to space levels of radiation are called radiation hard or rad hard Vibration During launch the payload is subjected to vibrations Why is this a problem I think its because the connections to the chip can break Microchips are usually fabricated on a substrate of silicon and the contact pads for wires going in and out are pretty small in cases where many wires are needed You cant just solder to that A common way to connect to the pads is with wire bondshttpenwikipediaorgwikiWirebonding essentially very thin threads of metal that are sort of mashed onto the contact pads Packaging Consumer electronics are packaged in plastic If you look inside your keyboard youll see a variety of black square or rectangular things with metal pins sticking out The black is plastic and the silicon die is inside Plastic absorbs water from the air When you send that into space it gets cold and I think the problem is that the water freezes expands and cracks the package This would probably rip off some of the wire bonds Now having said that a guy in my lab put a consumer FPGA into a  Kelvin cryostat and it worked so I could be completely wrong about thisAs for the cost there are two factors The first is that making something with the right packaging and robustness against radiation means you arent using your standard fabrication line That means the price is higher just because of supplydemand That aside an enormous cost is testing When NASA builds a satellite they require not only that the parts in principle deal with the things listed above but also that they are actually tested by Vibrating them Operating them under irradiation Thermal cycling and moreThat means you need extra test equipment people and time when you buy a mouse for your computer thats just a part off of a fab line that makes a million of em a day Maybe a small number of parts from each batch are tested for quality control When you build a satellite you test every single partEDIT I think a lot of contemporary parts use degenerately doped silicon so I guess carrier freezeout isnt a problem Does anyone know if this was a problem  years ago,0,cdilxiv,1r1bka,askscience,hot,11.0,11

DevinTheGrand,The menstrual cycle is a primate only means of female reproduction  The reason why female primates have a period is because they shed the lining of the uterus when pregnancy does not occur  Most other mammals use an estrus cycle which results in the reabsorption of the uterine lining by the uterus  As an aside rats can actually reabsorb miscarried young through their uterus as well which is pretty awesomeAnimals that use estrus also are usually only sexually active during their period of ovulation  This is called being in heat which Im sure youve heard before even if you didnt know the context  Occasionally bloody vaginal discharge will occur but it is not necessary and it does not contain uterine lining,2,cditwrk,1r1jah,askscience,hot,11.0,9

MyNipplesAreOnFire,Your question actually touches on a great deal of pharmacological principles Classical pharmacology assumes that a drugs therapeutictoxic effects are directly related to concentration achieved at the site of action ie the tissuecells that the drugs are effecting This concentration is directly correlated to the concentration achieved in the blood since this is essentially how much drug will be distributed to the site of action This assumption leads to the conclusion that taking more of a drug will ellicit a greater effect Greater drug concentration administered gt greater blood concentration achieved gt greater distribution to site of action gt stronger elicited effectThis principle has essentially dictated pharmacology for a long time and has had good resultsHowever I think this is what others are getting at this does not mean that greater dose necessarily means more therapeutic effect This simply means greater dose produces greater effect After a point this effect leads to a toxic effect rather than a therapeutic one As you increase concentration you will reach a point where  of respondents are experiencing the drug effect but you enter a concentration where toxic effects are produced So to answer your question classical pharmacology actually pharmacokinetics to be specific would say in terms of effect no Greater concentration of drug will elicit greater effect up to a point but this does not necessarily equal the desired therapeutic effect Just the drugs chemical effectThis is the distinction that must be made Because some drugs such as those listed by uYoYoDingDongYo will have some idea therapeutic dose but prescribing a dose greater than that could lead to a greater drug effect that inhibits its therapeutic effect,2,cdj4v6k,1r1xxt,askscience,hot,4.0,2

oliverisyourdaddy,Im an evolutionary anthropologistThey compared the genomes of humans and chimps estimating the total number of divergences changes  Then they calculated the average number of mutations changes in one generation by comparing the genes of parents and children  Then they performed the following calculation Number of total divergencesmutations per generationto determine how many generations have passed since the divergence of humans and chimps  They divide the total number by two because the divergences represent changes accumulated in both the chimp genome AND the human genome whereas you want the number of generations for just one species since theyre happening simultaneouslyNow that they have the number of generations they convert that to a time by multiplying that number by the average generation time  that is the age at which a parent has a child the average child not first or last So basically find out how different the genomes are find out how many mutations happen per generation and calculate how many generations have passed  Then multiply by the number of years a generation isFinally they corroborate it with fossil evidence  We can date fossils using isotope dating so if we have fossils for all the intermediate species dating back to a common ancestor for two species we can get a good timeframe for their divergence  The problem with fossil evidence is that its actually very limited for nonhuman apes  We have a good fossil record for the human lineage but not for the chimp gorilla or orangutan lineage  The next closest primate that has a really good fossil record is actually macaques a type of monkey so calculations are often checked against the macaque record  For a long time our ape calculations actually didnt jive so well with the macaque recordSomething interesting happened in  I could be misremembering the year  Scholars named Scally and Durbin proposed that the calculations had all been incorrect because they had used generation time for current apes  Larger animals tend to have larger generation times bigger animals have kids later take longer to mature and extant modern apes are generally larger than their ancestors  Therefore the generation time variable was decreased a little and these guys new calculations fit better with the macaque evidence Edit wording,14,cdiub9d,1r1z4w,askscience,hot,82.0,68

SRnG,This question is highly dependent on what you have inside the room measuring the temperatureIf you are taking a person inside and using their sense of temperature as a measurement then yes they would feel cooler as a result of normal sweat evaporation on the skinIf you are taking a thermometer in the sealed room then it will always read the ambient temperature of the room as it is uninhibited by the effects of wind chillhttpenwikipediaorgwikiWindchillExplanationSo with a dry thermometer at the stable room temperature the effect of adding a ceiling fan to the room would not change its reading However because you state that the room would be warmer than the ambient temperature around the room the effect would be just as you specify it would increase the rate by which it cooled to the ambient temperature,0,cdiyfx5,1r2n13,askscience,hot,5.0,5
InternalEnergy,Chemical engineer herelots of training in thermodynamic analysisLets make some assumptions First the room is completely sealed off to flux of matter Not a single atom passes through the doors walls etcSecond the room is wellinsulated so an adiabatic assumption is valid No heat is transferred through the boundaries of the roomThird the boundarieswalls are completely rigid They will not move at all even if the pressure inside the room increasesOk Now lets do some thermodynamics First law of thermo states that matter and energy is conserved neither created nor destroyed With no heat flux adiabatic mattermaterial flux or pressurevolume work rigid boundary the only input to the room is the electrical energy required to power the fan Moving stuff takes energyair is no exception and certainly the blades of the fan have mass too So we have energy coming in in the form of electricityEver feel the heat coming off of your computer or smart phone during use Electrical energy converts easily to heatBut we insulated the room remember And we sealed it too so no hot air leaves to take that energy away So the end result is the room gets warmer In fact the only reason why a fan might make you perceive the room as cooler is because you sweat The moving air evaporates that sweat which requires heat energy which your body supplies Yay thermodynamics,0,cdj4a4m,1r2n13,askscience,hot,3.0,3

nosignificanceatall,It is common to describe the creep rate of a material by an empirical power law of the applied stress ie  dεdt  kσn where k is a constant determined by the creep mechanism temperature etc  If we substitute εσE then we have a simple differential equation for the timedependence of the stress  It can be solved to yield  σt   σn  Ektn nThis model predicts that the stress never reaches zero so there will always be some expansion when the load is removed but that the expansion becomes arbitrarily small as time increases  If you run experimentslook up tabulated values to determine E k and n then you can use the above equation to predict how much your material will expand when you remove the applied load after some time tAdjustments can be made to the differential equation to better suit the particular material that you are working with  For example when the dominant mechanism of deformation is dislocation creep as is probably the case for your example of a spring it is common to replace σn with σσn  that is the material ceases to creep once the stress drops below some threshold σ  In this situation the material will still expand by σE even if you leave it under stress for an indefinite amount of time,2,cdje1vg,1r35c8,askscience,hot,5.0,3

FlyingSagittarius,Springs are usually made of metal which has already been discussed  Ceramics act similarly within the elastic limit at least  Polymers on the other hand can have both a strain and a strain rate so if you apply a constant strain to most plastics they will eventually flow to relieve the stressThe basic equation for this behavior is e  S  E  T  Vt  e is the normal strain S is the normal stress in the material E is the tensile modulus T is the shear stress in the material which always exists even if only normal force or stress is applied and V is the viscosity  If you set a value for e and you know everything else you can solve for the time  E and V are material properties T can be calculated from S and S can be calculated from e  The resulting expression is a differential equation that shows the stress in the material asymptotically approaches zero and the strain rate asymptotically reaches zero  The time constant depends on the material propertiesThis is for a constant strain though  What about for a constant stress  This would be like suspending a weight with a polymer rope  As the polymer rope supports the weight the polymer flows to relieve the stress  But the weight responds by dropping down and reapplying the stress  So the stress stays constant and the rope would respond with a constant strain plus a constant strain rate  So itll stretch initially as the weight is applied and will stretch even more as time goes on  Eventually itll stretch too much and snap though,0,cdjij1v,1r35c8,askscience,hot,3.0,3

IAmMe,The key difference here is between force and acceleration You wont really be able to get away with avoiding inertia to explain thisSee the gravitational force is indeed stronger for an object with more mass However that object also has more mass and thus more inertia This means that it takes a larger force to reach the same acceleration for that object It just so happens that the dependence on mass cancels out for gravity every object experiences the same acceleration due to gravityHowever the force of air resistance does not depend on mass it depends on the shape of the object and its speed The result is that while all objects of the same shape moving at the same speed experience the same force of air resistance due to different amounts of inertia mass they experience different accelerations due to air resistance In particular since the heavy object has more inertia the same force produces less acceleration than on a light objectTo summarize gravity produces more force on a heavier object than a light one but the same acceleration while air resistance produces the same force on each but less acceleration for the heavy one,1,cdj7jf3,1r37tg,askscience,hot,7.0,6
WeedOWhirler,So to answer this you have to understand the difference between force and acceleration I know youre thinking of course I do But your explanation shows a misunderstanding between them Gravity attempts to accelerate everything at the same rate and it does this by pulling on heavier things with more force A nine year old might not be able to fully understand Newtons second law F  ma if you need a refresher but you can probably explain it to him pretty well Tell him to imagine a rocket hooked up to a car and how that rocket can make the car go fast Now imagine that instead of a car it is a big truck The rocket which puts out the same force regardless will push the truck slower than the car And now hook that rocket up to a train and the train might not move at all Or if it does it will move slowly This is the basics of Newtons second law if you apply the same force to objects the heavier ones will move slower than the light ones You can do this experiment by trying to push a book across the table or a stack of books youll have to push harder for the stack OK so gravity isnt a rocket Gravity pulls harder on things which are heavier In fact if you double the mass of the object gravity will pull twice as hard So that is like if you made a car twice as heavy but also attached two rockets the acceleration would be the same regardless So gravity provides twice the force on an object twice as heavy but due to Newtons second law that is the same accelerationSo now add in air Air resistance comes from the object having to move air molecules out of the way as it falls So it makes sense that the force of air resistance would be dependent on two things the surface area or shape of the object in the direction it is falling and the speed at which it falls The larger the surface area again only in the direction of falling a book turned up on its spine would have less air resistance than a book lying flat the more air molecules it has to move out of the way Also the faster it is falling it will hit more air molecules it has to move So the larger those things are the larger the force of air resistance Thus as you might expect a book and a single sheet of paper should have the same air resistance at least when it first starts to fall eventually the book will have more because it is moving faster So they have the same force pushing up on them but that force causes more acceleration on the lighter object the sheet of paper than the heavy one the book Playing with some numbers well choose easy ones Imagine you have a  kg book and a  kg book and well say the acceleration due to gravity is  ms The using Newtons nd law we can see that the force due to gravity on the first book is  Newtons A Newton is the SI equivalent to a pound it has units of force and the second book at a force of  N But now imagine each of them have  Newtons of air resistance acting on them So the total force acting on book  is  N and the total force acting on book  in  N Forces add and since they are in opposite directions you are getting  and  So now we can use Newtons second law to calculate their accelerationgt a  Fm just rearranged gt a  Nkg   msgt a  Nkg   msSo the book that weighs more but has the same air resistance accelerates faster ,0,cdj932w,1r37tg,askscience,hot,4.0,4

baloothebear,Electronegativity is how strongly a particular atom attracts electrons To understand what that means you need to know what attracts electrons and what factors can affect thatElectron orbitals have very specific shapes in  dimensions and can be thought of as a waveform These waveforms are most stable when filled with an appropriate number of electrons The first valence shell is s and the first level of the s orbital prefers  electrons this makes it most stable Hydrogen is nothing more than a proton and an electron but it is very stable when it can fill its valence shell with  electrons hence a high electronegativity and why it is so weird Helium has  protons and  electrons and  neutrons but they dont matter for the moment so its valence shell is full at  electrons and it does not attract electrons to fill and sort of void and therefore has a low electronegativity Now we talk about ionic forcesElectrons are negatively charged and as such they are attracted to positive charges such as the nucleus of an atom The force of ionic attraction is proportional to the charges of the two objects and inverse of the square of the distance between them The higher the positive charge of an atomic nucleus the stronger the force of attraction and the smaller the distance between those charges the stronger the force of attractionAs you move from the left to the right of the periodic table you have more and more protons which means an increasing positive charge in the nucleus This increasing positive charge exerts an increasing force of attraction on the electron orbitals This causes the size of the orbital to decrease as you move across the periodic table This is why the electronegativity increases going from left to right Now to add another conceptValence shells exist in orbitals that have different levels of energy The fact that energy is discrete dividable down to quanta means that the orbitals have discrete levels or layers Not only do more layers increase the distance between the nucleus and the electron it is attracting but those layers are all negatively charged and will act to repel another negatively charged electron This is why as you move down the periodic table increasing levels of valence shells the electronegativity reducesNow remember that we talked about valence shells being most stable with certain numbers of electrons The next magic number of valence electrons that make the orbitals stable is  Now count over from left to right on the table Florine has electrons in its valance shell just one short It strongly attracts that last electron not only because it is small and has a large charge in its nucleus but because gaining another electron makes it have a more stable valence structure OK so weve talked about what electronegativity means and what factors have an affect on it but why do we careWe stated that a stable valence shell has  electrons This is why Carbon with  electrons in its valence shell will make  covalent bonds Covalent bonds as their name suggests are when  atoms share an electron so that both atoms can have a stable valence shell in the case of a covalent bond between atoms that are the same the electron is shared equally because the electronegativity of each atom is the same However if one atom in the covalent bond has a higher electronegativity the electron is attracted more to that side of the bond What happens when youre attracted to something You want to spend more time there Because of this unequal sharing the bond becomes polar in that one side of the bond has a slightly negative charge and one side has a slightly positive charge This matters in incredibly significant ways Water for example is a polar molecule Because of this water is liquid at room temperature held together by hydrogen bonds a consequence of polar molecules DNA is also held together to their complementary strands by hydrogen bonds edit the stability of  valence shell electrons are also why the noble gases are very unreactive They do not need to share electrons to be stable The low reactivity of this group of elements is why they are called noble as nobility kept to themselves,27,cdjc2e8,1r3wa9,askscience,hot,126.0,99

haikuginger,I can talk about two things that were factors in the long development process of color TV backwards compatibility and display technologyThese two topics are heavily linked together For example during the early days of color TV development one system CBS Color was a filter that spun in front of the screen sequentially showing red green and blue With that system each frame was transmitted three times sequentially one time each as red green and blue The TV would time the spinning of the disk to its reception of each colored frame the red frame would be drawn on the screen while the red filter was in front and so onHowever to see why that wouldnt work very well we need to take a step backwards to see how black and white TV worked Reduced to a basic level a stream of electrons was fired at the inside of a glass screen coated in phosphorus When electrons struck the phosphorus it lit up By using electromagnets that single beam of electrons could be moved to point at any part of the screen So to form a picture on the screen the electron beam would sweep across the screen line by line with the intensity of the beam determined by the amplitude of the TV signal arriving in the set at any given momentSo if you fed a CBS color signal into a blackandwhite TV it simply wouldnt work TV at that point relied on the signals coming down exactly as the set expected them to and on being able to line up those signals so that the first bit of a frame arrived at the TV when the electron beam was pointing at the topleft corner of the screen CBS color just couldnt do thatSo an alternate route needed to be taken Color TV couldnt use an additive color space composed of separate red green and blue signals it needed a subtractive color space one that started out as a complete monochrome picture with equal amounts of red green and blue that any blackandwhite TV could read but that had bits of extra information carried alongside it that could be used to turn that monochrome picture into colorThis introduced a new challenge though TVs at that point in time didnt have any memory they were sending the signal from an antenna or cable directly to the picture tube If what was coming in didnt get drawn on the screen immediately it wasnt getting drawn at all And with a subtractive color space all the color was coming in at once Unlike with CBS color a TV couldnt use a mechanical trick like a spinning wheel to alternate between colors being drawn by a single electron beam it needed to draw all the colors at onceSo the logical answer to that problem was to go from using one vacuum tube producing an electron beam to three one for each of red green and blue Each tube would fire only when aimed at a bit of phosophor designated specially for it each bit of phosphor would have a tiny filter in front of it so that from the front it would appear to glow red green or blueAs you might guess this arrangement introduced a new problem Before it didnt matter if your electron beam was aligned exactly right or if it was particularly fine the entire tube of your TV was coated in phosphor and the picture would show up no matter what even if the electron beam was angled over to the left a bitWith the new arrangement the problem was that the electron beams werent fine enough and couldnt be aligned exactly right  of the time This meant that blue phosphor dots were being lit up by the red electron beam and the same for every other color A reliable color picture wasnt being producedThats where Werner Flechsigs shadow mask comes in The concept is simple but brilliant Take a metal sheet and poke thousands of tiny holes in it Then put it directly behind the screen which has your pattern of differentlycolored phosphor dots on it Now because youre using three different electron beams theyre each coming from a different location and each will enter any particular hole in the shadow mask as the metal sheet is called at a different angle This allows you to restrict where the electrons from each beam land on the screenYou can try it yourself Take a sheet of paper and poke a hole in it Then holding the paper still look through that hole from different angles Youll see different things through it Similarly even if the electron beams were too big to focus and align down to the sizes they needed to be shooting them through a tiny hole from slightly different places resulted in precise control over which points on the screen they struckThose are the things that were necessary for color TV to take off We needed a way to send a color TV signal that could be viewed by people with blackandwhite TVs We needed a way to put each component color of that color signal on the screen simultaneously And we needed a way to  keep each color at the point on the screen it needed to be,0,cdjv089,1r4qud,askscience,hot,11.0,11

zmil,Think of the human genome like a really long set of beads on a string About  billion beads give or take The beads come in four colors Well call them bases When we sequence a genome were finding out the sequence of those bases on that string Now in any given person the sequence of bases will in fact be unique but unique doesnt mean completely different In fact if you lined up the sequences from any two people on the planet something like  of the bases would be the same You would see long stretches of identical bases but every once in a while youd see a mismatch where one person has one color and one person has another In some spots you might see bigger regions that dont match at all sometimes hundreds or thousands of bases long but in a  billion base sequence they dont add up to much edit  I was wrong it aint a consensus its a mosaic I had always assumed that when they said the reference genome was a combination of sequences from multiple people that they made a consensus sequence but in fact any given stretch of DNA sequence in the reference comes from a single person They combined stretches form different people to make the whole genome TIL the reference genome is even crappier than I thought They are planning to change it to something closer to a real consensus in the very near future My explanation of consensus sequences below was just ahead of its time But its definitely not how they produced the original genome sequenceIf you line up a bunch of different peoples genome sequences you can compare them all to each other Youll find that the vast majority of beads in each sequence will be the same in everybody but as when we just compared two sequences well see differences Some of those differences will be unique to a single person everybody else has one color of bead at a certain position but this guy has a different color Some of the differences will be more widespread sometimes half the people will have a bead of one color and the other half will have a bead of another color What we can do with this set of lined up sequences is create a consensus sequence which is just the most frequent base at every position in that  billion base sequence alignment And that is basically what they did in the initial mapping of the human genome That consensus sequence is known as the reference genome When other peoples genomes are sequenced we line them up to the reference genome to see all the differences in the hope that those differences will tell us something interesting As you can see however the reference genome is just an average genome it doesnt tell us anything about all the differences between people Thats the job of a lot of other projects many of them ongoing to sequence lots and lots of people so we can know more about what differences are present in people and how frequent those differences are One of those studies is the  Genomes Project which as you might guess is sequencing the genomes of a thousand well more like two thousand now I think people of diverse ethnic backgrounds Its not even a very good average honestly They only used  people edit  originally and the current reference uses  and there are spots where the reference genome sequence doesnt actually have the most common base in a given position Also there are spots in the genome that are extra hard to sequence long stretches where the sequence repeats itself over and over many of those stretches have not yet been fully mapped and possibly never will beedit  I should also add that once they made the reference sequence there was still work to be done a lot of analysis was performed on that sequence to figure out where genes are and what those genes do We already knew the sequence of many human genes and often had a rough idea of their position on the genome but sequencing the entire thing allowed us to see exactly where each gene was on each chromosome whats nearby and so on In addition to confirming known sequences it allowed scientists to predict the presence of many previously unknown genes which could then be studied in more detail Of course  of the genome isnt genes and they sequenced that as well some scientists thought this was a waste of time but Im grateful the genome folks ignored them because that  is what I study and theres all sorts of cool stuff in there like ancient viral sequences and whatnotedit  Thanks for the gold Funny this is the second time Ive gotten gold and both times its been for a post that turned out to be wrong or partly wrong anywayoh well,198,cdjoort,1r54d1,askscience,hot,1053.0,855

TrainerGary,The concept is called proprioceptionhttpenwikipediaorgwikiProprioception Im sure someone will give a more in depth answer but essentially there are multiple body maps in your brain and these maps are used in conjunction with your peripheral nervous system in order to determine body position For example proprioceptors are found in skeletal muscles The relative stretchingcompression of these proprioreceptors gives information about the position of the limb,3,cdju34l,1r5l7s,askscience,hot,26.0,23
Lillelyse,As already mentioned this is called proprioception To expand a bit on how sensors in the muscles tell you about limb position The bodys sense of its position in space is determined by stretch receptors in the muscles joints and tendons Muscle stretch receptors or muscle spindles are specialised muscle fibres in a fibrous capsule These detect changes in muscle lengthJoint receptors are mechanosensitive axons in the connective tissue of joints They are good at detecting the movement of the joint but not so useful when the joint is kept still Finally at the junction of a muscle and a tendon we find Golgi tendon organs These register muscle tension or force of contraction The information from all of these sensors come together to tell us where our limbs are ,1,cdjxdl4,1r5l7s,askscience,hot,9.0,8
SpacemanSpiff,Without getting too in depth your body will use proprioceptive sense organs to obtain this information In the muscle itself your muscle spindles will pick up how fast and how intense a contraction Muscle spindles exist all throughout the muscles and in different numbers in different muscles For example the sub occipital muscles have a much higher amount of muscle spindles than say the biceps femoris Inside the tendonous attachments to the bones you have Golgi Tendon Organs which will pick up information regarding tension The information will then travel to the spinal cord through peripheral sensory nerves in to the spinal cord in the medial lemniscal system From here it will travel up through the medulla and decussate cross at the nuclei gracilis and cuneatus as internal arcuate fibers The tracts will then head on up to the thalamus VPM and VPL and out to the post central gyrus in the cortex of the cerebrum Skipping a lot of stuff but that is the basics of it ninja edit This is purely proprioceptive Your body will also use the vestibular system to track the position of the head Also as simple as it sounds your body will keep track of your segments using your vision as well ,0,cdk15wc,1r5l7s,askscience,hot,2.0,2

jvsnz,There are a few reasons why multicopters have not been brought to life size yet I can see it being feasible one day but improbable Most multicopters you see  and  rotors control their pitch altitude and yaw by varying the speed of the blades They can do this because the inertia of the blades is quite small so the motors dont have a big job of changing the speed This wouldnt be the case for full size blades needed to lift a multiton craft This can however be offset by using variable pitch blades much the same as on a normal helicopter  this obviously increases complexity however and also the number of components that can fail  rotor crafts will crash if a prop fails All  are fundemental to having controlled lift  and  rotor crafts can survive quite easily if  prop or motor fails provided the failure doesnt take any of the other motors out like a blade flying through neighbouring motors  The electronics and systems needed to keep multicopters afloat are still very new  only in the past  years has the technology matured enough to make such a thing feasible  Cost A single engine single rotor heli is expensive enough Now times that by   and for what There are very few scenarios where a traditional helicopter cant do a job a multi could Now times the running costs by  as well I say  because you wouldnt build a  rotor due to above mentioned safetyredundancy reasonsThe reason multi rotors have taken off in the hobby and small scale world is because traditional single rotor model helicopters have been very difficult to control and learn to use  as well as horribly dangerous Because multi rotors are controlled by software  its easy enough to make that software user friendly so it doesnt take much to pick up and learn They are also cheaper in a lot of the cases  you can build a multi rotor for a couple of hundred  They can also be quieter I wouldnt rule out full size multis in the future I just dont think itll be very common for a long time if not ever,2,cdk2y6y,1r5tcm,askscience,hot,9.0,7

Hiddencamper,Nuclear engineer hereThe RBMK is graphite moderated This means that the cooling medium and the moderation medium are separated Under normal operation water enters the bottom of the reactor and flows upward The water heats up on its way through the core and the amount of steam voids by volume increases on your way up through the core Steam is drastically less dense than liquid water and is virtually transparent to neutrons when compared to liquid water As such an increase in voids means that my water is absorbing less neutrons It also means that my neutrons will have a longer mean free path length and ultimately means more neutrons will be able to get to my moderator tldr Increase in steam voids  increase in moderation  increase in powerInherently this has stability issues As I increase my heat output Im going to increase the amount of voiding I have This will then increase power which further increases voiding Active control systems which adjust control rods can come down to compensate for this The control rods for this reactor design drop in from the top which makes sense as the top is where the highest neutron flux is likely to be seen Active control rod motion suppresses any power excursions and maintains the reactor in a stable operating stateAt high power levels you are producing a lot of steam flow and as a result you have a high flow of water through the reactor With high flow rates through a reactor your boiling boundary remains fairly constant and it takes quite a bit to have a runaway excursion as the forced flow of water into your reactor tends to push voids out quickly and ensure cooling water gets to where it needs to be Additionally at high flow high power conditions the voids do not have a dominiant contribution to reactivity meaning small changes in voids have small changes in reactivityWhen you are at low power you are in a situation where you have low flow Your boiling boundary is higher Your voids have a much larger contribution to reactivity in the reactor At low flow conditions with low control rod density conditions in boiling reactors we observe the boiling boundary is somewhat unstable Steam voids take longer to get out of the reactor and they begin to have a stronger impact on reactivity As such anything that changes your boiling boundary even a little bit is going to have an amplified effect on your neutorn flux and power output Little things like random noise in your pump flow can start these oscillations causing the boiling boundary to move which starts causing power oscillations In the RBMK to respond to the power oscillations the control rods will start moving in and out to try and stabilize this Having graphite tipped rods combined with having a control system with a response time constant in seconds which is similar to the fuels thermal time constant just means that the control rods are going to be trying to catch a power change but will have trouble keping up because it will be causing some of its own problems All of these things together will drive power oscillations in the core Under a worst case condition it can drive a runaway condition requiring a reactor scram When operated appropriately the reactor scram even with the graphite tips will have sufficient margin to preclude a steam explosion When not operated appropriately with nearly all control rods out a power excursion can occur which leads to a steam explosion and loss of the unitThe reason this is an issue at low power is due to the way the boiling boundary behaves at low flow conditions with low control rod density The voids have too much contribution to the cores reactivity under these conditions and small changes in voids drive large changes in flux Because the voids contribute so much to reactivity under these conditions and the possibility of an instability can occur RBMKs have a safety limit which requires a minimum number of control rods to be inserted at all times to ensure that the voids do not carry enough reactivity to drive a core damaging power excursion At Chernobyl they removed these rods past the safety limit because they were in the xenon pit and trying to reach a specific power level on their reactorIm more familiar with BWRs for instabilities Standard BWRs like those in the US have stability issues as well at low flow low control rod density conditions however the because the moderator and coolant are the same they tend to be self limiting and are not capable of undergoing a power excursionsteam explosion Most BWRs also have a system called OPRM that detects core stability issues and initiates an automatic reactor scram What we see in BWRs is an oscillation with a time constant that is usually  seconds We will start seeing small oscillations then the oscillations will start growing Oscillations in a BWR grow slowly If the plant has an OPRM it will scram the reactor prior to it increasing past certain limits If the plant does not have an OPRM it will grow over several minutes until the reactor hits either the high or low flux scram setpoints The main danger in BWR type reactors is that you can cause localized thermal stress and plastic strain on the fuel localized fuel cladding damage but no power excursionFor BWR light water reactors that have it equipped all US BWRs have this the OPRM Oscillation Power Range Monitor looks for counts how many oscillations am I getting in a row period are the oscillations in the right time constant that is indicative of thermalhydraulic instabililty or is it just random noise and growth is my oscillation diverging with a gt decay ratio There is also a confirmation density algorithm which uses a factor that looks at the above factors across the core to anticipate these factors before they start If the OPRM gets enough counts on the right period with growth it will initiate a scram immediately US BWRs are forbidden from entering the region where core thermalhydraulic oscillations exist and are required to insert an immediate reactor scram if they enter the regionGenerally the only time a BWR enters the instability region is if they have an inadvertent loss of their reactor cooling pumps Another poster mentions xenon Xenon can cause long term issues which force you into a low rod density low flow situation however xenon will not cause the instabilities that created the chernobyl event Xenon does not respond fast enough hours while the boiling boundary response is in seconds Hes not entirely wrong xenon transients can force you into an instable core operating region but they do not cause the instability Proper reactivity management can ensure that you pass around the instability region without going into it RBMK reactors have a very tough time with the xenon pit and are more likely to put themselves into an instability while other BWR type reactors can deal with it just fineI hope this helps If you have any other questions

grillkohle,Are you referring to the Chernobyl incident I will try to explain the problems without looking at that incident  Controlling nuclear reactors is all about controlling slow neutrons The slow neutrons basically are the chain reaction  A big problem with reactors in low power mode is Xenon  It is known as a neutron poison because it has a high probability for absorbing neutrons and thereby reacting to the stable Xenon  It is formed by decay of Iodine with a half life of  hours When the reactor is running in normal operation mode there is a balance between the production and the reduction of Xenon   If you lower the power output there is more production of Xenon  because of the delay decay from Iodine Hence it is more difficult to control the reactor you cant increase the reactivity because the Xenon will absorb your neutrons Usually you have to shut it down and wait until most of the Xenon is decayed itself half life  hours  But if you try to increase the reactivity by pulling out control rods for example you increase the reduction of Xenon obviously the production stays at a lower level for some time because it takes some time for the production of the Iodine and its decay which further increases your reactivity because you have more slow neutrons because less neutrons are absorbed by the Xenon This happens to all nuclear reactors   The next problem is the positive void coefficient which basically means more thermal activity more reactivity gt less cooling water because more steam much lower density more bubbles gt more thermal activity because of the void coefficient because of the graphite still moderating at higher temperatures  These  effects support each other and make controlling the reactor in a low power state quite difficult  In a water moderated reactor negative Void coefficient for example the chain reaction stops or slows down if the water vaporizes too quickly because there is less moderator to slow neutrons down It is sort of self stabilizing  I dont know how much you know about reactors but I hope I could explain it to you I know that stuff because I took a course at the university about nuclear reactorsThere are some other factors regarding the Chernobyl incident which lead to the explosion,0,cdkehwb,1r6hig,askscience,hot,2.0,2

ripitupandstartagain,You cant state that hydraulic fracturing only creates small earthquakes just that it seems to be responsible for increased seismic activity and that the events attributed to this cause have so far been small The frequency of different magnitudes of earthquakes in a set area obeys the principles of chaos theory ie the frequency of the event is inversely proportional to the energy released There will be a stress point reached that will trigger a quake but the size of the quake produced is pretty random based on the odds of a certain amount of energy being released For example a magnitude  earthquake releases approximately  times the energy of a magnitude  so over a set area you would expect magnitude  earthquake to be about  times more frequent than a magnitude  quake Rather than causing small quakes fracing can be said to be loading an area with stress past its trigger point The earthquakes recorded at hydraulic fracturing sites tend to be on the order of about  So one could reasonably expect a magnitude  quake to occur within the time taken to create  magnitude  quakes xx for average Now if a mag  quake is happening once a week which seems to be very unlikely that would mean a mag  would be expected after around  years obviously it could happen at any tipping point but the cumulative odd suggest about then or about  years for a mag This is based on fracing being the major cause of the earthquakes which would be the case for the majority of sites as they are away from active faults such as with the Blackpool quakes which halted UK fracing the other year ,1,cdkhvgu,1r6u2f,askscience,hot,5.0,4

hideousbike,A differential allows for the driving wheels to spin at different rotations per minute therefore allowing a car to turn corners This is because the inside wheel in a turn has less distance to cover than the oudside wheel on the vehicle in the same turn Think plastic coffe cup on its side It will roll in a circle  turn because the bottom is narrower than the dinking end of the cup What a differential essentially does is give power to the wheel with the least resistance This is a desirable trait in wheels on a road surface because otherwise the driving wheels start to squirm and bounce In mud however this is not because when a drive wheel looses traction and starts to spin the power of the engine will just be sent to the spinning wheel and therefore not adding to the traction of the vehicle To overcome this some cars can lock their differentials to ensure that both wheels will start churning at the same speed giving a lot more traction to the vehicleOn a side note dont lock your diffs on a road surface if your car has the option That is unless you really like your mechanic and like to give him or her fist fulls of money     ,3,cdkdzw6,1r7e4c,askscience,hot,24.0,21

ArmyOfFluoride,This is a really big question youre asking but Ill try to give a bit of a foundation for you   If youve ever taken a class in the life sciences youve likely heard the phrase structure determines function  I first learned this in the context of proteins the amino acid structure of a protein determines its biochemical function  This is also true for tissues however  The way cells are organized in your heart is what allows it to work as the core of your circulatory system  Your brain is no different  The structure of the tissue in your brain is as far as we know what determines its functioning    You also likely know that the structure of your body is determined by both your environment and your genetics  Instinct then can be thought of as the behavior that arises from the brain structure that can be attributed to genetics as opposed to the environment  This is where things get messy as ascribing any trait as complex as behavior to entirely a genetic or environmental cause is impossible because we all have both environmental and genetic histories  Does that help,3,cdklzjv,1r7q41,askscience,hot,18.0,15
bagsofgeckos,I think its easier to use the term innate behavior rather than instincts because the latter has a lot of more metaphysical connotations in humans at least I can describe an innate behavior in a simpler organism like a fly Fly mating behavior is what we call stereotyped given certain stimuli like a young female fly or something that smells like one a male fly will initiate a series of behaviors that are pretty much the same every time a little wing dance an attempt to mount her etc The neurons that sense the odor of the female fly connect to a few parts of the fly brain including an area called the lateral horn Its a little oversimplified but neurons in that region connect with downstream neurons that control the flys muscle movements that cause them to do the dance and more complex series of movements that include mounting Its a circuit of neurons that starts with a sensory stimulus and ends in a behavior with a little processing in the middle So where to genes come in Genes are what tell the brain how to structure itself in the first place In each neuron there are a series of genes transcribed that tell the neuron how to develop what kind of neuron to be where to migrate to in the brain during development The neurons in the lateral horn that bridge the gap between the smell of a female sensory stimulus and the mating behavior are where they are and fire when they fire because of the history of genetic switches that got them there I should add there is no one gene for this behavior or that every single cell is the product of thousands of genes turned on or off throughout the organisms development Cells such as neurons are the sum of their genetic history and behaviors are the sum of the neural activity that was elicited by a stimulus You can check out the work of Vanessa RutahttpwwwrockefellereduresearchfacultylabheadsVanessaRuta for a more indepth explanation I am probably butchering my description her work but you might find more of what you are looking for thereMost of human behavior is learned though we can suck as infants and grasp things most of what we do during the day we had to learn at some point We dont have a specific brain structure devoted to drinking coffee that is the same for all humans Less complex organisms tend to have a much greater percentage of their brains devoted to innate behaviors than we do,2,cdknup8,1r7q41,askscience,hot,15.0,13

richardwoodhouse,Its a bit of a long process but there were  major breakthroughs associated with the discovery of the Ozone Hole  The Fate of CFCs  Mario Molina was a postdoc working with Professor Sherwood Rowland at UC Riverside in the s  His project was to determine the fate of CFCs in the atmosphere  CFCs were used as refrigerants for a lot of industrial processes because they were incredibly stable  They happen to be so stable that nothing in the troposphere can break them down so no one really knew what happened to them when they were released  Molina eventually discovered that the CFCs would finally break down high in the stratosphere km when they absorb highenergy UV light nm  This releases Cl radicals into the stratosphere  Their famous Science paper herehttpwwwnaturecomnaturejournalvnabsahtml with a great typo in the title see the pdfhttpwwwnaturecomnaturejournalvnpdfapdf presented this initial warning that CFCs could deplete ozone  However this reaction needed observational evidence now Observations of enhanced ClO  In  James Anderson of Harvard lead a field campaign to the south pole and made in situ observations of enhanced ClO  This confirmed that chlorine was present in the stratosphere and verified Molinas proposed CFC fate Observations of the Ozone Hole  This ones kinda funny in hindsight in  Joe Farman published a paper in Nature herehttpwwwnaturecomnaturejournalvnabsahtml showing dramatic ozone loss in the austral spring  This was in direct contrast to satellite observations over the south pole at the time  It turns out that the satellite data was being filtered out because concentrations were so low  Essentially the scientists had assumed the satellite measurements must have been noisy and were throwing out data that was unrealistic Clouds and Crazy Chemistry  The original chemical reaction chain that Molina proposed was not the cause of the ozone hole the source of chlorine was right but the catalytic reaction mechanism was not  The ozone depletion that Farman noticed occurred in the spring at first light in the south pole  Theres three reasons for this depletion   the polar vortex keeps the south pole somewhat isolated from the surrounding regions  typically the chlorine can be locked up in reservoir species such as chlorinenitrate however Susan Soloman discovered that polar stratospheric cloudshttpenwikipediaorgwikiPolarstratosphericcloud can form due to the extremely cold temperatures and provide a surface for heterogeneous chemistry to occur  The chlorine nitrate can react with HCl to yield Cl  HNO and the HNO will dry deposit over the winter  So in the spring theres a lot of Cl that will photolyze and no nitrogen to lock it up    In  Luisa and Mario Molina discoveredhttppubsacsorgdoiabsja that ClO can self react ClOClO gt ClOOCl and that the dimer will break at the ClO bond not the weaker OO bond  This means that ClO self reactions can produce radical chlorine and deplete ozone without radical oxygen atoms  In summary Mario Molina proposed that CFCs could deplete ozone in the stratosphere  His original paper correctly pointed out the source of chlorine in the stratosphere but didnt identify the actual reaction that would cause the ozone hole   years later Jim Anderson then verified that enhanced chlorine was present in the stratosphere   years later Joe Farman noticed the ozone hole   years later Susan Soloman Luisa Molina and Mario Molina discovered the crazy set of chemical reactions that lead to the ozone holeEdit  Added a note about the typo in the Science paper title,0,cdm3m9e,1r7s9w,askscience,hot,3.0,3
SonofThomas,The different blood types refer to the different types of antigens on the surface of our red blood cells There are  main ones A B and D A and B determine the type of blood you have A B AB or O type and D determines whether your blood is positive or negative the presence of the D antigen also known as the Rh factor mentioned in another comment means you are positive For example having the antigens A and D make your blood A If you have A and B but no D your blood is AB Having only the D antigen without A or B means you have O blood and a lack of all  antigens means you have O blood The reason this is a problem during blood transfusions is because if you have a certain antigen it means you have an antibody for the other antigens you dont have For example if you have type A blood meaning you have the A and D antigens you have a B antibody If your A blood were to come into contact with a B type blood the B antibodies in your blood would react with the B antigens in the B blood causing the B blood to coagulate and virtually be unusable This is why type O is the universal donor because it has no antigens for anybody elses antibodies to react with This is also why AB is the universal acceptor because it has no antibodies to coagulate any type of donor blood also I do not know why we have different types EDIT clarificationEDIT  gold success thank you kind stranger ,541,cdkkjeh,1r7v5g,askscience,hot,2024.0,1483
YesThatGuy,Have had this saved after answering this question a few times  Much better summary than I could write up with the time I have this morning  Edited for content  Credit to uItsthebeeskneesIf you have any other specific questions after reading this please let me know  I feel this should satisfy most if not all of your questionsAntigen The tag that identifies something These antigens exist to help our body distinguish molecules as self or nonself Our immune system will recognize these antigens and react or wont react When there is an antigenantibody reaction that is what causes the destruction of these cells and a massive clot formsEdited expansion In my analogy The antigens are the Locks And the Antibodies are the keys When your body encounters a Lock that doesnt belong to you it tries to destroy it open it Once your body encounters this lock it has now seen it and has now seen its design After encountering a foreign lock your body will now make keys to open and destroy these locks Some of these locks are small ABO blood group and the keys can be made immediately and the reaction occurs immediately However the locks of Blood type of  explained more detailed below are relatively big and can take a while for the appropriate keys to be made So you constantly have these keys floating around in your blood constantly looking for a compatible lock When a key matches a lock thats what activates your immune response destroys the lock and in turn causes all the negative effects of a transfusion reaction explained more belowWhy are there different types of antigens This boils down to their molecular structure All blood types have the same core structure but what differentiates the types is a Polysaccharide molecule that sticks out from the molecule This polysaccharide or Sugar in simpler terms is what is the antigen and helps our body identify them as different blood typesAntibodies The main part of our immune system Antigenantibody interactions follow a lock antigen and key antibody When the key fits the lock thats what causes and immune reaction which ends up destroying the Red Blood Cell RBCThe locks are predetermined due to the sugar tag Now one thing people dont realize is that certain blood types will have the specific antigen but WILL HAVE THE OPPOSITE ANTIBODYWhat does that meanBlood Type A Has A Antigen and B AntibodyBlood Type B Has B Antigen and A AntibodyBlood Type AB Has A and B antigens No antibodiesBlood Type O Doesnt have A and B Has both A and B antibodies edit as pointed out by nearquincy below Blood Type O actually contains H antigen which is the precursor antigen to both antigen A and antigen BThere are other antigens that is present on the surface of the blood type O itself although they are not significant in ABO systemWhat does that translate into the real worldBlood Type A They only have  antibodyType B so if that antibody finds its partner antigen found in Type B or type AB transfusion then it will cause a reaction and essentially selfdestructBlood Type B They only have  antibodyType A so if that antibody finds its partner antigen found in Type A or type AB transfusion then it will cause a reaction and essentially selfdestructBlood Type AB Has both antigens but no Antibodies Because if it had any antibodies to either A or B the person wouldnt exist in the first place because the Antibodies would keep finding their Locks and selfdestructing the RBCs Because blood type AB has no Antibodies they are known as Universal Recipients Meaning that because there are no keys there will never be keys to correspond with the locksBlood type O Has no antigens but does have both types of antibodies Because of the lack of antigens they are known as universal donors meaning their blood can be transfusedmixed with any other blood type and there will not be a reactionBelow an even simpler version of what this meansType A blood Can Receive type A or Type O Blood Will react with type B or type ABType B blood Can receive Type B or Type O Blood Will react with type A or type ABType AB blood Can receive all types of blood Type A B AB or O Will not react with anyType O blood Can only receive type O blood But can be donated to any blood type person Will react with types A AB and B when type O is the type of the receipientedit cheat sheet for blood types httpiimgurcomfTwAIjpngWhat is Positive and Negative BloodWell this refers to the presence or the lack of another type of antigen known as the Rh Factor or also known as the D antigenWhy is being positive or negative importantWell this is most important for pregnancies Specifically a mothers second pregnancy It occurs in a Rh Mother and an RhBaby What does being Rh  or  mean Well like I said it depends on whether or not you have the Antigen or you dont During the st pregnancy the fetal blood will mix with the mothers blood Because the mother has no Rh factor but the fetal blood does the immune system will recognize these particles as foreign and will in turn start making antibodies to it Anything your immune system recognizes as foreign it assumes its an enemy and will start to attack itWhy did you mention nd pregnancy and not firstWell these antibodies belong to a different class than the ones that react with blood typing These antibodies take MUCH longer to form Hence it wont affect the first pregnancy but can affect the second pregnancyAlso can a A receive A bloodA can receive blood from a A Negative donor or A donorA can only receive blood from AIts the antigens that make up the difference Negative means you have no antigen so even if  donor blood present inside of a  persons body the body doesnt recognize it as foreign so its okayThe problem exists when  person receives  blood  Blood does contain the antigen so when  Persons body sees the  blood it sees the antigen recognizes it as foreign and attacks it So this blood transfusion is incompatibleWhat happens when you have an incompatible blood type You getFeverJaundiceDecreased blood pressureIncreased heart rateIncreased breathing rateAcute kidney failure if severe enoughBlood in urine after it reaches the kidney failure stageShock  if severe and untreatedDeath  if severe and untreated due to the sudden loss of blood pressure and the shockBasically I described it as self destruct because the host antibodies attack the foreign antigens and cause these red blood cells to be destroyed When your red blood cells are destroyed they release a molecule know as hemoglobin Hemoglobin is normally a good molecule which is responsible for oxygen transport but that is only of its attached toinside of the Red blood cell When there is too much free floating hemoglobin in the blood that is what causes all of the above symptomsCan transfusion reactions be treated And is it symptomatic treatment or does it require another full transfusionYeah its basically sympomatic treatmentBut remember that symptoms that appear are really variable and dependent on how severe the reaction is But for a complete overall treatment of the above symptoms you would requireTreating and anticipating the Shock Which would also treat the low blood pressure and fast heart rateTreating the kidney failure Dialysis to filter out the hemoglobin If the reaction is severe enough it may require a complete retransfusionTreat the subsequent clot that will form When there is a transfusion reaction there will also be a massive blood clot that forms due to all of the now destroyed Red Blood cellsCertain blood types have shown greater incidence with certain diseasesinfections But there is no increased susceptibilityBlood Type A Hepatitis Small PoxBlood Type O Black Plague other digestive system infections Autoimmune disorderswhen your body attacks itselfBlood Types A B AB Clots in your veinsAlso some other interesting things to note is thatABO  Blood typing will fit and categorize about  of the worlds population But there is still that  whos blood has neither AB Antigens nor the AB AntibodiesFor these special people we have to to EXTREMELY careful when transfusing any type of blood also we have to use other systems to typecategorize their bloodWhen a Blood Type O patient receives blood from a blood type A patient This causes the most severe of the transfusion reactionsAbout  of the population is Type O Type AB is the rarestAbout  of the population is  So being AB is the rarest of blood typesAre there any benefits to having either A B AB or O blood typesType O can donate to all types of bloodType AB can receive all types of bloodTypes A AB B dont have a distinct advantage over the other edit as pointed out by uhammurarbisan  both A and B types routinely have elevated platelet counts versus the other blood types  most especially female A types  and thus more frequently tested for platelet counts and targeted for apheresis collection Platelets are commonly used for transfusion during surgeryBeing  however is an advantage over being negative  Can receive from  or  people Negative people however can only receive from Negative peopleedit Type AB can donate PLASMA to all people since

Chleeeeeee,Differences in blood types arise from different protein expression on the red blood cell So first with the Rh factor named so because it was first discovered in Rhesus monkeys You can be Rh  or  which means that your red blood cells have or dont have this certain protein on the surface Problems can arise when a mother is Rh  and is carrying a child who is Rh as an immune reaction can occur because the mothers body sees the Rh proteins as being foreign if there is blood exchange between the two  Usually the first child is fine but when theres blood exchange in child birth the mother builds up antiRh antibodies To help with this all Rh mothers are treated with Rhogam to suppress that response Now on to the ABO blood type Again this is code for the type of proteins that are on the surface of the blood cell The differences arise from genetic inheritance with one gene determining ABO inheritance So without making it too complicated The presence of at least one A allele will cause the body to make specific glycoproteins while the absence causes antiA antibodies The same goes for the B allele If a person has one A and one B then they are type AB Because they are AB they dont produce either antibodies If they have two As they are type A and likewise for B In this gene both the A and B genes are codominant Type O arises when the person has neither an A allele nor a B allele and instead has two recessive alleles This person would not have any glycoproteins on the cell and would produce antiA and antiB antibodies This is why they are the universal donor transfusion of blood wont set off an immune reaction especially if they are O AB blood types are considered the universal receiver because they dont have the antibodies for any of the blood types and thus can receive any blood Hope this helps,2,cdklo01,1r7v5g,askscience,hot,11.0,9

billyvnilly,ABABO are designations for cells that express antigens  D is also an antigen and its significance is that its reactive with antibodies as much as A and BWe have evolved to develop these blood groups  When Red Blood Cells RBCs are made they express a carbohydrate chain millions which is called H  We have evolved over time to have different enzymes that modify this carbohydrate chain  Most people believe B was the original enzyme  A is speculated to happen afterwards  So enzyme A or B act on the carbohydrate chain H and modify it  The modified chain is thus termed A or B  If neither enzyme acted on the H chain its termed O  The enzyme A and B behave totally differently enzyme activity and thus amount of H chains they convert so if you have enzymes A and B its not an equal split thats a minor point doesnt matter for this  So these are just two examples of antigens on RBCs  D is a third antigen that is clinically significant and very common that is why people know about it  What they dont know is D is a combo of many antigens  DCcE and e  but we always say if youre D then your blood is positive  there is no d antigen  What most people dont know is that there are tons of antigens s on red blood cells  Some are there from the development of the RBCs nucleus and some are adsorbed from secreted antigens circulating in the blood stream  Why are all these important  Well as your body makes antigens it is also recognizing those antigens as self  our bodies have the ability to then recognize notself  So if you only have enzyme A and not make any RBCs with B on their surface you make antibodies to B but not to A  People with type A blood cant receive type B or AB blood because they have antibodies to B  Why do we have different blood types  Well a good example is a blood group called Duffy  The blood group has two antigens Fya and Fyb  And again these antigens come from two enzymes  If you lack both enzymes you lack the antigens  And if you lack both antigens youre termed Fyab  Why is this evolutionary  Well because Plasmodium vivax malaria uses the antigen site to enter cells  So if you lack the antigen malaria cannot enter the cell evolutionary  This is why the majority of AfricanAmericans are Fyab,2,cdkm1ad,1r7v5g,askscience,hot,9.0,7

Jetamors,Marsdreams does a great job of answering the Why Oxygen question You also asked Why Not Nitrogen the answer is because most nitrogenases enzymes that break down N are inhibited by oxygen if theres any oxygen around they wont work If youre a bacterium or a plant with roots in the soil you have areas where you can use those enzymes but if youre an animal living in the air theres no way to avoid oxygen so nitrogenases arent going to be useful for you,1,cdklcvn,1r7w97,askscience,hot,6.0,5
proule,Many organisms actually use nitrogen as a terminal electron acceptor essentially breathing it in the same way we breath oxygen The difference is that these organisms are very small and can live on significantly less energy than higher multicellular organismsOxygen is significantly more electronegative than nitrogen especially considering nitrogen in the atmospheric form N is already satisfied with its electron configuration and wont accept more electrons This difference in electronegativity results in a significant increase in energy liberated from giving oxygen electrons You can think of giving oxygen electrons as a starting point and an end point your electron donor and your electron acceptor which is oxygen If you simply give oxygen the electron right away then youre losing a bunch of energy to heat So between the oxygen and the electron you essentially put up walls for the electron to push walls being an analogy for cellular work Oxygen is so powerfully attracting the electron that it pulls it in despite these walls with the movement of the walls performing work in the cellNitrogen is less electronegative than oxygen meaning that nitrogen cant pull electrons through as many walls Giving an electron to nitrogen just doesnt result in as much energy because its not pulling on the electron as hardHigher organisms mammals especially have tremendous energy consumption From a single glucose molecule a fermenting organism like yeast will produce two molecules of ATP the energy currency of any cell The only way for complex multicellular organisms to evolve was to get more energy out of a single molecule of glucose With oxygen and the electron transport chain we get more like  molecules of ATP If multicellular organisms extracted energy from glucose as inefficiently as fermenting organisms wed have to very simplified basically consume  times more food to get the same energyAnimals are all nitrogen dependent but luckily consuming other organisms yields plenty of nitrogen because its the base of amino acids that make up proteins Trees fix nitrogen in their roots with the help of symbiotic relationships to bacteria they dont do this themselves because they get their energy from the sun and light obviously cant provide the tree with nitrogen,1,cdkm17n,1r7w97,askscience,hot,5.0,4

shavera,Okay so imagine you have the simplest circuit Current flows around a simple loop of wire Now you cut the wire The electrons are still in motion so one end of the cut gets a little bit depleted of electrons and the other one gets an electron pileup But this wont last too long since the depleted end now has a positive charge and the pileup end is negatively charged the electrons will be pulled in the opposite direction somewhatA simple analogy is like a circular pipe of water thats got water flowing around through it Imagine you were to cut the pipe and seal the ends simultaneously There would be a back pressure at one end and a low pressure at the other end causing the flow to slow down and stop neglecting some other effects well get to in a bit like ringingSo what if you wanted the effect to last longer to take a bit longer before the circuit slowed to a halt what could you do Well you could take the ends of each wire and add more and more metal to them giving the electrons more space to spread out on the pileup end and more electrons to draw from on the depletion end well call the pileup end the negative plate and the depletion end the positive plate from now on And if those plates were closer together the electrons would see the opposite plate more easily and so not feel the effect as strongly ie electrons travelling toward the negative plate and being repelled would also be attracted to the positive plate just slightly beyond it and so the overall repulsion would be relatively less So that describes our basic parallel plate capacitor The amount of charge you can store in the capacitor its capacitance is proportional to the area and inversely proportional to the distance between the plates C  k A  d where k is just a constant to show proportionalityNow lets look at the next step We have these plates of charge one positive and one negative The current has stopped well since we have a potential difference thats going to drive a current in the opposite direction no The electrons on the negative plate are going to be pushed off of it and pulled onto the positive plate But since they cant cross the gap between the plates deal with this a bit later they have to go the opposite way of the current that charged the plates up they are dischargingSo now lets put a little more into it Clearly if you just pushed the electrons harder you could push more electrons onto the plate so we can also make a new equation QCV where the charge Q is given by the structure of the capacitor itself how it distributes charges and the Voltage how strongly charges are being pushed onto the plateFurthermore wed like to see how these plates change over time right Well the amount of charge being added or removed from the plates is going to relate to how much charge is already on the plates right If theyre really charged up there are going to be very few new charges added to them if were charging or a lot of charges leaving them if were discharging And if we want something where the rate of change is proportional to the value at that moment we want an exponential Some kind of et function Well lets consider discharging full plates They start with some charge Q and get rid of a lot quickly But as time goes on theres less pressure to push new charges out so they lose less charge So if we look at et we see that it goes from  at tinfinity passes through  at t and then climbs high after that What wed like to do is flip that graph around the t axis right So that it starts with some value and trends toward  after very long times Flipping about that axis takes t to t So we can say that Qt  Q  et  Now lets think of charging Again we know that to start theres no charge so we want rapid change But we also want it to level off to some constant value where the backpressure from the charge on the plates is equal to the forwardpressure were using to charge it with So we look at our et again Well that wont work since it goes up to infinity which isnt reality We try flipping it about the t axis again et  since that at least levels off But this graph is decreasing charge and we want increasing So we multiply the whole thing by a  giving us et  Well the charge is increasing from a negative  to zero thats not right either since it starts at  and goes to some steady value So lets add  to it and we get   et  It starts at  and increases to  in a way thats proportional to the amount thats on the plate Thats nearly what were looking for If we just multiply the whole thing by its steady constant charge Q then well have it Qt  Q    et  ,5,cdkkfxd,1r841l,askscience,hot,45.0,40

ToThink,Im only in my rd year studying genetics so I hope I can get this through properly First we have to establish the fact that within a gene there are alleles of that trait Alleles are just different forms of a gene so for eye colour there is a green eye allele and there is a blue eye allele I put the quotations there because eye colour isnt due to a specialised pigment which reflects that colour of light eg blue eyes arent due to a pigment which reflects blue lights rather eye colour is dependent on the amount of melanin in the eye So blue eyes  very low melaninSimilarly with skin colour the amount of melanin in your skin determines how dark you areCurrently one of the explanations behind why a parent with blue eyes and a parent with green eyes dont make a turquoise eye baby is because of dominance of alleles The child will most likely have green eyes because the green eye allele is dominant to the blue eye allele This isnt completely true but eye colour works in a dominancerecessiveness sort of mannerThere are new studies which reveal this may not be the case rather some new studies reveal eye colour is dependent on many different genes I tried looking for them couldnt find them,3,cdkkf68,1r847u,askscience,hot,6.0,3

NAGLT,Well almost all D stuff that is made today is Stereoscopic D It means that two images are created with a slight offset in camera position When one image is shown to one eye while the other eye sees the slightly different picture we perceive it as a single D image So to display such D content your TV must be capable to display two different images to the two eyes at the same timeYour standard TV is likely an LCD panel with  or  Hz refresh rate Your both eyes see the same image on TV which is slightly shifted between eyes and you perceive it at the same distance as the TV is To allow your eyes to see different images you need some additional tricks The simplest solution is to use special glasses with filters capable of filtering different stuff There is one type of D your TV can show with no issues  those  colour Anaglyph imageshttpenwikipediaorgwikiAnaglyphD You then use glasses with red and cyan filters or other colour combo and one eye sees only red and other only the cyan image The main issue of this method is colour reproduction which is awful so it works best with black and white content Some colour choices are less bad but there is no perfect choice for this method Another type of D that normal TV can display is active shutter D httpenwikipediaorgwikiActiveshutterDsystem You use a glasses with LCD shutters which show  frame to right eye while covering the left second to the left and so on TV meanwhile displays frames in pairs RLRL  which you also perceive as a D view The refresh rate you see is effectively halved and the smaller it is the more perceptible the flickering is Using it on a  Hz display is possible but far from comfortable so TVs using it have  Hz or higher refresh rates to get  Hz of more perceived D refresh rate Another interesting property of light used for D displays but mostly with projectors is the polarisation The light can come in two different polarisations like linear vertical and linear horizontal or CW circular and CCW circular These are just some of possible combinations but what is important that they are exclusive You can use a special polariser to pass only CW polarisation while completely blocking CCW Polarisation is also independent from colour and can be filtered by a passive filter making glasses with polarised filters relatively cheap So by showing image for one eye in CW polarisation and other image in CCW glasses with corresponding filters can allow you to see a D film This technique simply requires the special hardware to show different polarisations and wont work on a normal TV BTW all LCD displays emit a linearly polarised light but only in one polarisation If you dont want to use glasses there are some solutions but they are less reliable so far and less used Some TVs use micro lenses to show some pixels only from a specific angle of view This allows them to show different images to your eyes which look at TV with a slight difference in angle Their main problem is the fact that you can only view them from specific spots otherwise the D effect breaks down There are other methods as well but all of them still require you to have additional hardware to show separate images to each eye The methods with the highest quality require hardware solutions that normal nonD TVs almost always lack,0,cdkn5i6,1r8ayj,askscience,hot,5.0,5

bohrexciton,Thats actually a tricky question The most direct explanation is that ice is slippery because it behaves as being wet ie that there is liquid water between the bulk of the ice and an object gliding on the surface However what causes ice to be wet with respect to objects moving on it is still under debate There was a Physics Today articlehttpscitationaiporgcontentaipmagazinephysicstodayarticle that came out a few years ago that neatly describes possible explanations To briefly summarize them they are as follows Pressure melting Due to the fact that ice at least the common form is less dense than water applying pressure reduces the melting point of the ice To apply this example to say a skater the idea is that a skate bay locally increase the pressure to a sufficient extent that the ice can melt making it slippery locally and the water then refreezes after the skate passes This is the most common explanation that has been invoked historically but the problem is that its not clear whether this additional pressure can be enough to melt the ice Frictional heating When objects move across a surface there is virtually always some friction which results in local heating Again this heat may be enough to melt the ice  This explanation however cant really explain why ice is slippery even for stationary objects immediately before moving  Ice may be intrinsically wet In describing solids we often tend to ignore surfaces to a first approximation because this simplifies the description but surfaces can behave very differently from the bulk In the case of ice its been speculated that the different local environment of the first few layers of water molecules may result in this molecules being less strongly bound to the bulk than is the case for molecules within the body of this crystal Because of this these surface layers may behave as being liquid which would then cause the ice to be slippery under all circumstances ,1,cdl7ngd,1ra493,askscience,hot,8.0,7
stillealles,Because either a a thin amount of water is on top in the case of ice skating and suchOr B when you apply pressure to ice it causes it to melt because of properties of water this also applies to ice skating and such but is easier to think about if you have a piece of ice on the floor and step on it and slip Veritasium has a good video on it ,0,cdl8vq4,1ra493,askscience,hot,1.0,1

nowyoulistenhere,Im going to start by explaining it very simply and then if you want more details I can expand on itAs far as the part about being nonreactive to CMV cytomegalovirus that simply means that you do not have antibodies to the virus  This means that you have not been exposed to CMV before  It doesnt mean that your blood type is nonreactive we dont speak in terms of blood types being reactive or nonreactive to a virusAs far as your O status Im afraid she gave you some misinformation  That does not mean that your blood is good for newborns  It doesnt mean it is bad either  The  or  as you probably know is referring to the presence or absence of Rh factor which is a protein on the outside of red blood cells you are either Rh or Rh  You DONT have it  Therefore if your blood was exposed to blood that DID have it your immune system could form antibodies against it because it is recognized as something that is foreign to your bodyThe importance of this would be if you would become impregnated by a male who is Rh  In that case the baby might inherit the gene from the father and also be Rh  Therefore if your blood which is Rh was exposed to the babys blood whether during birth or some event during the pregnancy where bleeding occurred your immune system could recognize the Rh factor on the babys red blood cells and form antibodies which would allow for an immune response at sometime in the future  Your first baby would be just fine the immune response takes too long that first time for it to put that baby in danger but any babies you have after that are also Rh would be at risk of your immune system attacking their red blood cells something we call hemolytic disease of the newbornhttpenwikipediaorgwikiErythroblastosisfetalis There is good news though  We have developed something called Rhogam which can prevent all this  Its an injection that basically suppresses the mothers immune response to the Rh factor  We can give it to pregnant women during their pregnancy and prevent the bad stuff that might have happened otherwise  Science is great isnt it,0,cdl8582,1ra6bd,askscience,hot,6.0,6
abbenormal,Im going to expand on unowyoulistenhere since there are a few points I believe they didnt explain as well as could be  CMV nonreactive as previously stated means you havent been exposed to CMV  The reason this is important is because CMV while causing a relatively minor infection in healthy adults is considerably more worrisome for immunocompromised individuals and babies  See more information herehttpwwwmayocliniccomhealthcmvDSDSECTIONsymptoms  The reason your blood is good for these individuals is that you can transmit the virus to them through a blood transfusion  See herehttpwwwmayomedicallaboratoriescomtestcatalogClinicalandInterpretive again for more informationAs for O again as stated previously you lack the Rh factor that can cause an immune response in a recipient of a blood transfusion  Your blood isnt just good for babies thats the CMV part you are actually known as the universal donor  Your blood can be given to anyone regardless of blood type because you not only lack the Rh factor but you also wont react with A or B blood because you being O lack those antigens as well  Therefore your blood can be given to anyone A B AB or O without a life threatening reaction from their body  In an emergency O is given to a patient when there isnt time to check their blood type or until cross matched blood is available  Also others with your blood type can only receive O so blood is harder to get because it is rarer  TLDR  GIVE BLOOD  O blood is always in need and you would do a great service by regularly donating your blood to help others ,0,cdl8f7o,1ra6bd,askscience,hot,3.0,3

lowrads,The way a substance or in this case a fluid behaves is due to intermolecular forces  Water molecules tend to like stick together under a certain range of conditions which is why only a tiny portion of them volatilizes and goes zinging off at room temperature and pressureSand becomes silt and then becomes clay  Clay has interesting properties owing to its crystalline structure  If you poured some of each of those differentiated silicates into water the sand would settle out first followed by the clay  The middle group silt would actually stay in suspension for longerThe reason for this is charged surfaces  The silicate materials form in sheets  The sheet as a whole tend to have a charge especially as components of the repeating structure are often displaced by differently charged metal ions  Consequently the tiny fragments of sheets tend to stick together due to opposing charges  Ordinarily the charges are too weak between larger particles  The surface area to mass ratio isnt favorable  As the surface area ratio shifts surface charge starts to be more significant whether as an aggregate or a solution  Additionally as the material is ground down the rate of disintegration slows down exponentially  You would think this was odd or inverted given that surface area ratio seems to approach infinity as particle size becomes vanishingly small  The force of mass available for collisions changes in a nonlinear fashion with the diameter of the particle  ,1,cdlavot,1raftj,askscience,hot,4.0,3

SirJohannvonRocktown,Assuming the particles that make up the substance are sphere the short answer is it depends on the mass volume and number of particles in the substance So how do you determine if its valid to disregard the discrete particles that make up the fluid and model a substance as if its infinitely divisible This is referred to as the continuum approximation and there are mathematical ways to determine if its a valid assumptionThe whole idea behind this is that we can average the random thermal motion of the molecules if the number of molecules are large and close enough Theres a lot that goes into this but heres the gistIf we have a fluid and we take a small enough volume of that fluid say Vl for lower bound well notice that at that volume of the substance the statistical average or any property is meaningless because there is an insufficient number of particles contained in that substance at any given time see httppillarschepittedufilescoursefiguresdensityoscillategifsimilarly there is an upper bound Vu due to non trivial spatial variation in the fluid properties In other words the density will increase nonlinearlyAssuming Vl ltlt Vu we can define the continuum limit of the mass density at a point in a fluid is defined asrho  lim as V gt Vl mVlThis is a good place to say that the density of a fluid can also be modeled asrho  mnwere m is the mass of the molecule and n is the number of molecules for a given volumeThe interesting thing here is that its pretty much meaningless until you look at its geometric context Are these particles inside of a pipe flowing past a wing or doing something elseThe reason this is important is because fluids might or might not behave differently when a property or two are changed For example it might be turbulent or laminar It might be very efficient on imparting and transferring energy to its surroundings or it might act as a damping mechanism This is getting way too long so Ill just try to finish up hereSince we cant know how a particles behaves at all times and under all conditions we have to determine whether the statistical mean is significant or not A dust particle  miles above the earth cant be treated as if its in a fluid where as a baseball in a wind tunnel can,2,cdl8n5d,1raftj,askscience,hot,4.0,2

redmeansTGA,Im only going to discuss the fungi because youve asked a really complicated fascinating question that touches on a lot of different fields Firstly a quick note on fungi Most people think of fungi as things like mushrooms and bracket fungi which belong to a phylum called the Basidiomycota The other major group of fungi most people are aware of are the Ascomycota which includes molds like aspergillus the yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a weird assortment of other things you might recognize from the forest floor The fungi also contain a bunch of other less familiar things as well such as  the microsporidiahttpenwikipediaorgwikiMicrosporidia and ChytridiomycotahttpenwikipediaorgwikiChytridiomycota Some of these are really fascinating and truly push the envelope when it comes to eukaryote biology The oldest described fungi is a filamentous microfossil called Tappania  which was dated to Ma Butterfield  This unicellular fungi likely lived in shallow water Butterfield  The oldest ascomycete has been dated from mya and interestingly was found in association with an early lycopod plant Taylor et al  More modern fossilized fungi have been found from the Cretaceous which resemble yeasts Aside from this there is scant fossil evidence fungi dont have hard parts that readily fossilize Using molecular clocks is another way to measure the age of a taxon Berbee et al did this and found an estimate date of divergence between the fungi and animals around Ma Molecular clocks have dated the origin of the hemiascomycetous yeasts to around Ma which was probably due to coevolution between fermenting yeasts and fruiting plants Piškur et al  The fungi are a part of a large group of eukaryotes called the Opisthokonts which includes the animals as well as a couple of smaller groups of unicellular organisms The opisthokonts and their relatives part of a larger group of eukaryotes called the Unikonts diverged from the rest of the eukaryotes a very long time ago and possibly represent the earliest divergence Stechmann amp CavalierSmith  The lifestyle morphology and genome architecture of these earliest eukaryotes is a contentious though fascinating subject that I dont have time to go into Plants evolution is just as fascinating Very briefly the earliest plants entered the land around  million years ago Probably around the same time as the earliest fungi came onto land Plants and fungi likely coevolved very early on the earliest ascomycota fungi was found together with a lycopod plant Ever since plants and fungi have been doing interesting things together and earlier remembering lichens Anyway to sum up fungi as a traditional kingdom are much older than plants being perhaps some  billion years old Plants date back perhaps  billion years older if you count some related algae that I didnt discuss Recognizably modern groups of both fungi and plants didnt arise until much later however RefsBerbee ML Taylor JWDating the molecular clock in fungi  how close are we Fungal Biology Reviews   pp Taylor TN Hass H Kerp HThe oldest fossil ascomycetes  Nature   p Piškur J Rozpedowska E Polakova S Merico A Compagno CHow did Saccharomyces evolve to become a good brewer Trends in Genetics   pp Butterfield NJProbable proterozoic fungi Paleobiology   pp Stechmann A CavalierSmith TThe root of the eukaryote tree pinpointed Current Biology   pp RR,2,cdls0u3,1ravg2,askscience,hot,8.0,6
Sunscorch,OkFor a second forget that the Earth and Moon are orbiting and picture the Earth falling straight down towards a stationary Moon At the very start of our thoughtexperiment the Earth is also stationary and its oceans are equally spread out across the entire surfaceThe Earth then begins to accelerate towards the Moon as is begins to fall The ocean nearest the Moon experiences the greatest acceleration because it is closer and therefore is exposed to the greatest force Likewise the ocean furthest from the Moon experiences the lowest acceleration for opposite reasons The Earth itself of course experiences an average accelerationSo The Moonside ocean begins to move away from the surface of the Earth as it is accelerating faster than everything else creating the bulge that is easiest to understand The ocean on the other side however gets left behind because it is accelerating slower than the Earth Essentially the Earth is moving away from it which creates the opposing bulge on the far side from the MoonThat is how it works in our thoughtexperiment but exactly the same thing happens in orbit because the Earth and Moon are essentially falling towards each other and are constantly accelerating because of the constant change in direction That is why there is a tide on each side of the Earth,2,cdlgab2,1ravmk,askscience,hot,12.0,10

onyablock,People can become immunocompromised through various ways including pregnancy viral infection steroid treatment etc etcThe reason it is important when considering vaccinations is that being immunocompromised can increase your risk of obtaining the infection to which youre being immunized against if the vaccine is live virus or being vaccinated can be pointless as no immunity will actually be gained from the vaccineThe effects of an immune deficiency on vaccines varies greatly depending on the vaccine and its application regiment For example it could be recommended that you receive multiple booster shoots or dont receive the vaccine at all if you are immunocompromised In the case of the flu shot obtaining the killedvirus vaccine wont allow you to actually contract the flu however the chances of you generating good and long lasting immunity to the flu is reduced if you are immunocompromised Obtaining the live attenuated vaccine would not be recommended for immunocompromised patients as there is potential for infection hence why the box is thereI hope that makes senseSource th year immunology student,2,cdlcf5d,1rawff,askscience,hot,17.0,15
tthershey,Live vaccines are generally contraindicated in immunosuppressed patients because these patients will not be able to mount a sufficient immune response to the vaccine  Consequently the live vaccine could induce an infectionInactivated or component vaccines wont put immunosuppressed patients at risk but the patients might not gain much protection from the vaccine  This is because immunosuppressed patients wont be able to generate antibodies to help fight off future infectionsImmunosuppressed patients most certainly need to get vaccinated because they are at greater risk for getting serious complications from infections  Its important for health care providers to know a patients immune state in order to deliver the right kind of vaccine,0,cdlk7wj,1rawff,askscience,hot,3.0,3
Chandley,Therere three reasons why you need to be immunocompetent when vaccinated  It is rare nowadays for a vaccination to be live amp pose a direct threat some of them may revert to being harmful for example attenuated vaccines commonly have a harmful gene removed before they are given to the host so they can be dealt with by the immune system without any significant risk In some cases the process may not be perfect and so some live unattenuated virus may get into the vaccines so although in theory the virus should not be able to establish itself and replicate it sometimes can and is therefore much more hazardous to immunocompromised patients The same is true for killed virus vaccines  in theory all of the virus should be dead but whatever process they use to kill the virus eg exposure to UV light may be ineffective so again live virus may end up being present in the vaccine and lead to an active viral infection If a patient is immunocompromised there is a possibility that the body will not be able to respond effectively and generate the necessary memory lymphocytes for the vaccine to be effective This would mean that should the person then encounter a live version of the virus the vaccine would not have provided them with any protection at all as the memory cells were not generated at the initial vaccination so are not available to respond Although the vaccine you received was killed the form you filled out was probably written by some legal team at some point in history when they were using a different type of vaccine so theyre basically just covering their own backs and if may be expensive for them to change the documentationI would imagine it is likely a combination of the above  reasonsHope this was helpfulSource Veterinary SurgeonAnatomical Pathologist,2,cdlcbxz,1rawff,askscience,hot,3.0,1
Urgullibl,The point of a vaccine is to stimulate your immune system into producing antibodies against whatever it is youre being vaccinated against If your immune system is suppressed there is no point in vaccinating as the reaction would not result in protection from infectionIn case of the flu vaccine were talking about a dead vaccine ie there are no attenuated whole viruses in it hence there is no risk of getting the flu from it In case of vaccines containing whole attenuated viruses an immunosuppressed patient might get sick from such a vaccine,1,cdlk4zy,1rawff,askscience,hot,2.0,1

iCookBaconShirtless,The issue is not which direction that the limit is approached as you conjecture  While approaching  from above assures divergence approaching from below does not assure convergence  A simple example is the harmonic seriesThey key to understanding the ratio test is to more precisely understand this statement that you made  gt I understand what happens when the limit is smaller than  every element of the series is smaller than the previous by a factor L hence the series tend to stabilize and convergeThe fact that every element of the sequence is smaller than the previous by a factor of L at least in an asymptotic sense implies that the sequence converges to zero exponentially fast  Basically it looks like a geometric series at large n  This exponential convergence of terms is enough to ensure that the series converges but its strictly stronger than what is needed  Plenty of series have terms that converge more slowly than exponentially but still converge as a series  Any pseries with pgt for example eg n tldr Ratio test determines exponential convergence of terms which is more than is needed for convergence of series,0,cdlv91r,1rawis,askscience,hot,4.0,4
wgunther,In order to understand the ratio test you have to understand the proof The proof is if the ratio anan goes to Llt then eventually the of consecutive terms is less than epsilon for some small but positive epsilon and therefore the series is smaller than the geometric series aepsilonn for some suitable a Thus it converges by direct comparison If Lgt then you can do the same thing but with epsilon The problem is this proof doesnt work if L The ratio test will only work when the sequence of the summand of the series converges faster than something geometric whose series converges or slower than something geometric whose series diverges In the case when L one can not compare the series to a geometric series that converges or diverges ,0,cdmmc8x,1rawis,askscience,hot,2.0,2

miczajkj,In fact this is something that can happen but not for electrons You may know that there are three generations of quarks and leptons while our universe consists mostly from the first generation up and downquarks  electrons and electronneutrinos But there are certain natural processes that produce particles from higher generation for example the cosmic radiation in the earths athmosphere The electron equivalent in the second generation is the muon  and if you construct muonatoms your question gets importantLike the others already mentioned orbiting electrons or muons dont really orbit the nukleus their position gets described by a probability density those densities are the absolute squares of the particles wave function If you calculate those wave functions you find that the probability density of the ground state has its maximum at the classical Bohr radius that can be calculated by using a semiclassical force approach for muonic hydrogenium Let the CoulombForce ℏαcr equal the centripetal force pmr Also keep in mind the the uncertainty principle pr  ℏ It followsℏαcr  ℏ mr r  ℏαmcNow because the mass of the muon is  times bigger than the mass of the electron therefore its Bohr Radius is  times smaller and if you also consider the finite circumference of the proton it is possible that the muon may have finite probability to be found inside of the nukleus especially if you talk about heavier nuklei The main consequence is a displacement of the energy niveaus This fact was used to find the much used formular   fm  A for the radius of the nukleus depending on the Mass number Another consequence is the increased probability of decays like the Kcapture where a muon from the Kshell reacts with a protonµ  p gt n  νµ,0,cdlsooe,1rb1wp,askscience,hot,1.0,1

abstrusey,Normal is usually defined by sampling lots of apparently healthy individuals and then using statistics to calculate an expected range into which the large majority will fall This range is often referred to as a reference interval For aspects of physiology eg heart rate respiratory rate temperature blood pressure etc these ranges are typically set as a standard that you read in a book andor memorize For test values eg sodiumpotassiumpH value of the blood red blood cell count etc they are often established individually by the testing facility and they typically print that range next to the value of the sample they analyzed A reference interval can be established by collecting test results from at least  healthy adult animalshumans In this example therefore the range would only represents adults At least  juveniles and youd have to define the age range would have to be collected to have a new normal range determined Two statistical analysis techniques are used based on the distribution of the data For normal distribution also called gaussian distribution there is a bell curve The data has variance which is a representation of how widely scattered most of the animals are when compared to the average of all of them eg they may all be tightly clustered near the average low variance or they could be very high and very low away from the average high variance This variance is represented by a number called the standard deviation In gaussian and nongaussian distributions you can use the average   standard deviations to select for the middle  of the data The lowest and highest numbers that you collected are now your range and putting a dash between them makes it a reference interval In vet med we have reference intervals for most parameters for dogs cats horses cattle goats and alpacas and many exotic species as well It is very important to remember though that if the range only represents  of the samples   of which were apparently healthy  then you should expect about  of  individuals to have values outside of the range and still be okay,0,cdlm8h3,1rbtd9,askscience,hot,10.0,10

laika,There are many immunological components that exist in the areas of our bodies that are constantly exposed to microbes  respiratory surfaces and gut mucosa which in a way includes everything from the mouth to the anus  There are specialized immune structures in back of the mouth and form what is called Waldeyers Ring consisting of adenoids palatine and lingual tonsils that are believed to be sampling antigens and serving as a sentinel system for immune response  In the lower gut there are Peyers patches which like the tonsils are essentially unencapsulated lymphnodes that sample the gut environment for antigensHowever thats only part of the story  Sampling for antigens is important to initiate a response but the true magic of immunology is that the cells of the adaptive immune response B and Tlymphocytes are selected in a fashion similar to evolution  In the bone marrow Blymphocytes and thymus Tlymphocytes the cells are trained  There they learn through the processes of positive and negative selection how to distinguish self from nonself antigens  Those lymphocytes that can recognize yet not severely react against selfcells go on to progress eventually into immature lymphocytes who then wait to be activated when an appropriate antigen interaction  costimulatory event occursSo essentially theres this system where the body can modulate what it reacts to through selection of lymphocytes and I would think its within the realm of possibility that the lymphocytes learn to not react against commensal bacteria  There are other pieces that come into play as well  The innate immunity reacts to antigenic determinants that are common to many invasiveparasitic microbes and not commensal bacteria  Their receptors are encoded in our DNA and do not recombine like the adaptive immunity so they react the same time every way a given antigen is encountered  These include Tolllike receptors Nodlike receptors the alternative complement activation pathway scavenger receptors etc  The take home message from this is that these mechanisms are quickly recruited due to the lymph nodelike structures that can initiate an innate immune response which then goes on to set the stage for the adaptive response  I believe defensins fall into thisThen you get your specialized antibody classes for mucosal surfaces IgA and many other things that we dont even know that essentially due a balancing act of defending us from microbes that we dont want while not being activated by those we need ,0,cdlthyi,1rbu6q,askscience,hot,10.0,10

Ruiner,This is a cool question with a complicated answer simply because there is no framework in which you can actually sit down and calculate an answer for this questionThe reason why know that photons travel at c is because they are massless Well but a photon is not really a particle in the classical sense like a billiard ball A photon is actually a quantized excitation of the electromagnetic field its like a ripple that propagates in the EM fieldWhen we say that a field excitation is massless it means that if you remove all the interactions the propagation is described by a wave equation in which the flux is conserved  this is something that you dont understand now but you will once you learn further mathematics And once the field excitation obeys this wave equation you can immediately derive the speed of propagation  which in this case is cIf you add a mass then the speed of propagation chances with the energy that you put in But what happens if you add interactions The answer is this classically you could in principle try to compute it and for sure the interaction would change the speed of propagation But quantum mechanically its impossible to say exactly what happens during an interaction since the framework we have for calculating processes can only give us perturbative answers ie you start with states that are noninteracting and you treat interactions as a perturbation on top of these And all the answers we get are those relating the in with the out states they never tell us anything about the intermediate states of the theory  when the interaction is switched on,209,cdlyfi3,1rccq1,askscience,hot,1149.0,940

Thalesian,The simple answer is that it leaves the photon source and reaches its destination at the same time But lets walk through itEinstein said a couple of funny things with his theory of relativity First that E  MC E is energy M is mass and C is the speed of light He also said that space and time were the same thing  they could be characterized as a spacetime continuum The implication of this was that if you have mass then for you to cross a distance you would also have to cross time Look around you  for you to walk to a wall or a chair would require you to travel both space and time But he didnt call it relativity for nothing The concepts of distance and space are not universals Pretend that you get in a spaceship that can travel  the speed of light You cant go the speed of light because you have mass and with mass comes a speed limit But lets pretend Apple built a fancy spaceship then Samsung made a copy called the Galaxy SS and you get to take it for a drive You hop in and journey for the stars traveling  the speed of light Your twin brothersister stays on worth to watch over things However after a year you realize that you cant live without reddit because ಠಠ and turn back for Earth again at  the speed of light How much time has passed for you Easy answer  years But much more time has passed on earth hundreds to thousands of years depending on how close to light speed you approach Your twin brothersister is either old or long gone The effect is known as Time Dilation This phenomenon is weird The faster you go relative to another person your respective perceptions of time diverge But you cant go the speed of light because you have mass For a photon which is massless the speed of light is possible But if time slows down for you relative to folks on Earth as you move in a spaceship how much time passes for a massless photon  In Einsteins view of physics the speed of light is a constant both space and time are relative experiences for particles with massThis is a profoundly weird view of the world We describe light as traveling at a set velocity of  meters per second We even define distances by the amount of time it takes for light to travel at this speed Proxima Centauri is  light years from Earth meaning light takes that long to reach your eyes But to light no time passes and no distance is crossed A photon leaves the star and enters your eye at the same time There is no acceleration to the speed of light it is the speed that exists when you have no mass  Incidentally this is why the wavelength idea of light while useful for mathematical predictions is incorrect A wavelength requires a length and photons dont have a length anymore than they have an experience like time You may hear about folks who have slowed lights to almost a stop but all they have done is change the speed of light relative to us by adding obstacles like cooled Rubidium atoms As photons take a long path in our frame of reference through multiple electron shells between atoms it seems to take longer for them to cross a distance But at the end of the day they move at the speed of lightWe can create photons and when you see them you are destroying them in your eye In fact the very detector destroys the photons it measures Strictly speaking and if Im wrong on this correct me a photon has yet to be observed before its point of annihilation The idea of acceleration doesnt work right because that assumes there was a position of rest Rather think about photons as constantly in motion at the speed of light until annihilation Without M there is only E  C ,9,cdlyunp,1rccq1,askscience,hot,13.0,4

bloonail,A photon can be modeled in the classical sense somewhat like a kink in the electric field that has become detached from its source as the source retreated So a rotating electric charge can emit photons because the electric field cannot collapse back on the moving charge as the charge recedes That portion of the field that is withheld from collapsing by relativity is released as a photon However more accurately the electromagnetic field is maintained by photons It only exists through them as a mediating particle The field measured at any point in an electromagnetic field is measured in photons In the situation of a static nonmoving charge the photons are in a r relationship through radio waves to their point of origin but those photons do spread out infinitely at the speed of light from that pointThe kink idea is an unsatisfying s modelhttpmeetcommediafpdf but it hints to some degree how the photon is released at the speed of light It is by nature at the speed of light at least in this model because it is energy that has separated away due to kinda getting lost in space and unable to retreat back onto its charge It is lost because the electric field is expanding at the speed of light Its a weak model Its useful mostly for showing how high energy photons are created by sudden acceleration changes It explains antennas at a very basic level The photons exist as a field at all times they become higher energy photons through accelerationsI like the notion that all photons are the same It is really only our reference frame that changes their energyAs for the question of whether they accelerate Its sort of related to the permittivity and permeability of free space These can be complex numbers or tensors and as they compose the speed of light the speed of light varies The speed of light in some crystals httpwwwsciencedailycomreleaseshtm is different for different directions and all are different from what it is in free spaceHowever in no sense do they accelerate to light speed in the way a Mercedes might accelerate on the autobahn like I know Theyre at the speed of light in that medium always Their acceleration is more akin to their changing wavelengths They gain energy by becoming associated with a reference frame that is different So for example gamma rays hitting us from gamma ray bursts in the old style classical viewpoint somewhere that gamma ray was a radio wave emitted from something that is going very close to the speed of light relative to us Its not an accurate description  but the truer descriptions are moderately dense tensor calculus and quantum theory,9,cdm4wev,1rccq1,askscience,hot,12.0,3

cromonolith,The only thing stopping this from being intuitive to you is what bigger means Youre used to judging the sizes of things by counting each of them and comparing the numbers That is if I gave you two bunches of apples you might count and see that there are  apples in the first bunch and  in the second and conclude that the second bunch is bigger Thats fine but its not a good way of measuring the size of infinite collections So heres a better way of comparing the size of two collections make a pairing between the collections and the one that has stuff left over is bigger As an example lets say we had a huge auditorium and a huge crowd of people who want to see a show there Whats the best way to see if we have the same number of seats as people You can count the seats and the people but thats dumb The smart thing to do is to tell everyone to sit down As long as no one sits down stupidly two people in the same chair then you can easily check If there are empty seats left over there are more seats than people If there are people left standing there are more people than seats What does this have to do with infinities Well this kind of pairing like pairing people with seats is a function If no two people sit in the same seat the function is called injective or onetoone If no seats are left unoccupied the function is called surjective or onto If a function is both injective and surjective one person to a seat and all the seats are filled the function is called bijective Bijective functions are what we use to compare the sizes of all sets including infinite ones Two sets are defined to be the same size if there exists a bijective function between them So for example the set of all natural numbers N       is the same size as the set of even numbers N       because as you can check multiplication by two is a bijective function from the former to the latter That is the function f where fn  n hits every even number and never sends two numbers to the same even number On the other hand you might want to compare the set of natural numbers as above to the set R of real numbers the whole number line This isnt obvious but theres a relatively straightforward proofhttpwwwmathpagescomhomekmathhtm that no matter how you try its impossible to make a bijective function from N to R so they cant have the same size Since N is actually a subset of R we say the size of N is smaller than the size of R ,1,cdlzcjv,1rcjr9,askscience,hot,18.0,17

protocol,Heres another way of thinking about it Any natural number can be represented by a finite amount of information For example you can write it down in base  as a finite string of s and sHowever a real number has an infinite string of digits past the decimal point so theres no guarantee that any particular real number can be expressed using a finite amount of information And in fact most real numbers cannot be uniquely identified by any finite amount of informationSo intuitively its the difference between finitely many versus infinitely many degrees of freedom Since specifying a single real number can involve an infinite number of choices of digit there are vastly more real numbers than natural numbersThis is just a vague intuition though You can make it precise using information theoryhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiInformationtheory but thats rather technical Instead heres how to see very quickly that some infinite sets are larger than others  in particular that given any set finite or infinite theres another set thats largerBy definition two sets have the same cardinalityhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiCardinality basically size if they can be put into onetoone correspondencehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiBijection with each other  that is if you can pair up elements of the sets so that each element of one set is paired up with a unique element of the other setTheorem CantorhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiCantorstheorem Let S be any set and let PS be the set of all subsets of ShttpsenwikipediaorgwikiPowerset Then S and PS do not have the same cardinalityProof Let f be any function from S to PS that is for each element x in S we assign a unique element fx in PS Since each fx is a subset of S we can ask whether x is an element of fx In particular let T be the set of all elements x of S such that x is not an element of fxNow we can ask is there some element y in S such that fy  T Suppose there was then we can ask whether y is an element of T If it is then y is an element of fy so by the definition of T y is not an element of fy  a contradiction If it isnt then y is not an element of fy so by the definition of T y is an element of fy  again a contradiction Therefore its impossible for such an element y to exist So no element of S is paired up with TThus any attempt to pair up elements of S and elements of PS fails which means that S and PS dont have the same cardinality But we can embed S inside PS by sending each element x in S to the singleton sethttpsenwikipediaorgwikiSingletonmathematics x a subset of PS So in fact S is strictly smaller than PSNotice that theres no mention of whether S is finite or infinite If S is finite with n elements then PS has n elements So the proof is valid regardless meaning that its true for infinite sets tooFor instance if we denote the set of natural numbers by N then PN is strictly bigger than N Actually it turns out to be the same size as the set of real numbers And the set PPN is bigger than that and so on,1,cdlzsre,1rcjr9,askscience,hot,2.0,1

KerSan,Energy is a consequence of a symmetry in the laws of physics This is a deep point so let me try to explainIt is first worth explaining probably the most important concept in physics momentum Early on in your education you are told that it is simply mass times velocity This turns out not to be true generally because momentum is really what is called the generator of translationsConsider a point particle that has a definite position in space That position is actually an arbitrary label since it refers to your chosen coordinate system rather than some actual property of the universe You could just as easily switch coordinate systems by say moving the origin of your coordinates somewhere else This action of shifting coordinates is called translationNow let us suppose that the particle is moving relative to you the observer No matter which coordinates you chose you will notice that the position of the particle is changing over time If you want to predict where you will see the particle next you need to translate the last known coordinates of the particle by some amount That translation is determined by the momentum of the particle Keep in mind that the momentum is not changed when you translate your coordinate system The momentum is in a technical sense dual to positionWhat does this have to do with energy Well energy happens to be the generator of translations in time This is because energy is defined to be that quantity which remains invariant under translations in time much as momentum is that quantity which is invariant under translations in position Your coordinates for time are just as arbitrary as your coordinates for position because your choice of starting time is your choice and not some property of the universeEnergy therefore tells you something about how quickly the properties of an object change over time The more energy the faster changes can happen I could write essays explaining this further but I dont want to lose youWork is the addition or subtraction of energy from a system That energy can be added in a variety of ways but it is common in early physics education to think in terms of force rather than energy Energy is actually more fundamental than force so Ill explain the force times displacement rule by first explaining force in terms of energyForce is the derivative of potential energy with respect to position If you think of the potential energy of a particle as a function of the position of the particle for instance gravitational potential varies linearly in the height of the object then force experience by the particle at a given position is the slope of the potential function at that position In other words force is the negative change in potential energy ie the work divided by displacement in an infinitesimal sense Multiply both sides by displacement and you have the relation work  force  displacementHope that helps,2,cdlzluj,1rcojz,askscience,hot,7.0,5
miczajkj,What is energyThis is a very interesting question  but we we dont have an answer to this We formulate physics in equations and stuff and there is this certain quantity that shows up in some of them and seems to be conserved under certain circumstances The first kinds of energy you encounter when you start to think about physics are the kinetic energy and the potential energyAssume a body at the position x that is exposed to a force Fx Following Newton you get the differential equationmx  Fx The second derivative of the bodies displacement with respect to time times its mass is equal to the force on the particle  If it is possible to write the force as the derivative of a potential namely Fx  Vx you see that the following quantity is conserved for every solution of the mentioned equation E   mx  Vx If you take its derivative you see E  mxx  Vxx  xmxFxSo if the differential equation is fulfilled then E   follows directly You can see because of the form of the differential equation that describes the movement there is a certain quantity that wont change  we call it a conserved quantity If you dive deeper into the mathematical foundament of physics you find that symmetries are responsible for the most conserved quantities The energy for example is only conserved if the physical laws describing the process are time independent All in all energy is just a number A phrase like pure energy is nonsense Energy is just a quantity that appears in our equations Work is defined as the change in energy you need to apply to a system to move it from one state to another In most cases this movement is a spatial movement from one place to another  then work is just the difference in potential energies W  V  Vor because Vx  Fx W  integral Fx dxFor forces that dont depend on position you get W  FxI guess that was a whole lot of different concepts  maybe youve never heard of differentation integration or newtons nd law but I cant come up with an easier way to describe energy that is not too simplified or wrong ,0,cdlztxi,1rcojz,askscience,hot,2.0,2

therationalpi,Sound waves definitely are affected by the wind Since sound waves travel through a medium and wind is a bulk flow of the medium the sound speed in a windy environment which is normally the same in all directions suddenly becomes direction dependent Specifically the speed of the wave becomes the speed of the wind in that direction plus the speed of sound at rest Moreover since wind tends to move faster the higher you move up from the ground there is usually an effective sound speed gradient as well In the presence of a sound speed gradient sound waves tend to refract towards regions of lower sound speed As a result sounds sent out against the wind will tend to refract upwards and sounds made with the wind will tend to refract downwards Sounds made crosswind will tend to refract downwind and up And since your listeners tend to be near the ground relatively speaking the net effect is that sounds carry further with the wind than against itAs for electromagnetic waves lightradio I dont believe there is any notable effect but I would wait for verification from someone with more experience in the field,0,cdlz4kd,1rcooj,askscience,hot,7.0,7

ofeykk,I am going to attempt to translate as best as I can your problem into a mathematical question I suspect you are making a bunch of assumptions here which I will try to make more formalFirst with the view of simplifying as much as possible yet retaining the crux of the original problem you can make the following assumptions removing each would yield a slightly different problem to solve Look for curves not in space but in space Simplify curvature of earth to be flat  seek planar curves Simplify sun to be on this flat plane as a point Simplify yourself to be a point on the sought curve  degrees view is equivalent to dividing the plane by the tangent to the curve at your location point Choose an orientation for the curve This helps fix what it means for a point to be in your field of view or equivalently to be in the correct half space of the tangent to the point you on the curve Parametrize looping around the curve to be traveling along the unit interval   with the end points  and  identified  essentially a fancy way of saying that the end points of the interval are glued Assume that the sun is fixed relative to the time taken to loop around the curve once Finally is the curve sought smooth or not  A circle is a smooth curve whereas a triangle isnt one I believe its easier at least for me to imagine smooth curves Also will exclude wild curves like space filling curves simply because I am not comfortable dealing with those Now the question is to find a curve that maximizes the view of the sun when you loop around onceIt appears to me that solution would depend on whether you would wish to make a further assumption about whether your plane is unbounded or not If the plane is unbounded the answer is simple  any straight line not through the point representing the sun would doIf the domain on which the curve is sought is compact or technically if its closure is compact  think finite if you wish like a square plot or a circular plot of land  then it depends on where the sun is located relative to this domain Some examples that come off the top of my mind are as follows Circular region with the sun in the center Take any diameter and take a tube around the diameter This tubular region would have a boundary curve composed of two straight lines chords of the circle with a small part of the circulars plots boundary two of these actually You can make this tubular region as small as you please and would provide you with a curve for which the sun is visible for as long as you please In other words give me a number for which you wish the sun to be visible say  and I can give you a width of this tubular region for which it would be realized Make it  and Ill give you a different number for the width and so on A circle with the sun not in the center Use the same idea as in example  Drop a radius from the center of the circular plot to the boundary that passes through the sun Measure the distance say r from the sun to the boundary of the circle Draw a smaller circle within the larger circular plot with radius r and centered at the sun Repeat example  A square with the sun at the intersection of the diagonals Repeat example  with the a circle of length equal to the distance from the sun to any one of the vertices of the square A square with the sun not at the intersection of the diagonals Easier to say that one should fall back to example  but rather simply draw a circle centered at the sun with a radius equal to the shortest distance from the sun to the boundary of the squareCan go on but would stop here I have to say that I did this as a fun Sunday morning exercise and tried to reason mathematically which may or may not have been what you were looking for  I enjoyed it though  ,0,cdlztop,1rctma,askscience,hot,4.0,4

UnquietTinkerer,If the solid object is a parked car then the two collisions are essentially the same  In the headon case the two cars end up at rest at higher speeds they might disintegrate and send debris flying everywhere but mph is slow enough that the cars could just crumple  In the other case the mph car would hit the parked car and the combined wreckage would continue moving at approximately mph down the road until friction or some other force stopped it  In both cases the change in momentum for the passengers and the total kinetic energy released in the collision would be identicalIf the solid object is something like a brick wall then it could stop the car abruptly resulting in a much greater change in momentum and release of kinetic energy  This would be much more damaging to the car and its passengers  I dont see the profit in this comparison though  A more interesting question is whether its whether its better to hit a car headon both traveling at mph vs a solid wall  In both cases the you would end up stopping abruptly but hitting the wall releases less kinetic energy and so would be less damaging,0,cdmijd2,1rd53a,askscience,hot,1.0,1

tthershey,gt Dr Harper explained in her presentation that the cervical cancer risk in the US is already extremely low and that vaccinations are unlikely to have any effect upon the rate of cervical cancer in the United States  In fact  of all HPV infections resolve themselves without treatment in a year and the number rises to well over  in two yearsWhile it is true that the chances of getting cervical cancer are low the vaccine does prevent a cancer which is amazing   Very few cancers have the potential of being eradicated like this  Not all strains of HPV are covered by the vaccine and not all strains of HPV cause cancer  So on the plus side those scary statistics about how prevalent HPV infections are can be misleading because the actual incidence of cervical cancer is low even among those who get infected with HPVAnogenital warts are mostly caused by HPV  and   This lesion is usually benign not cancerous  Most cervical cancer is caused by HPV  and  but there are some other less common strains of HPV that can also cause cervical cancer  Gardasil protects against HPV  and  which prevents  of cervical cancersgt All trials of the vaccines were done on children aged  and above despite them currently being marketed for yearoldsNot true heres an example httpwwwncbinlmnihgovpubmedgt So far  girls have reported adverse side effects from Gardasil alone to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS and this number only reflects parents who underwent the hurdles required for reporting adverse reactions  At the time of writing  girls are officially known to have died from these vaccines  The reported side effects include Guillian Barré Syndrome paralysis lasting for years or permanently  sometimes eventually causing suffocation lupus seizures blood clots and brain inflammationI would have to see the source for this claim to make any specific comments but in general I can say vaccines are tested very vigorously for their safety  It has to be expected that some people will suffer health consequences after receiving a vaccine  Many of these people might have suffered those consequences whether or not they had received the vaccine because they had some preexisting conditions and some might have rare diseases that make them more susceptible to complications  But serious complications from the vaccine are raregt Studies have proven there is no demonstrated relationship between the condition being vaccinated for and the rare cancers that the vaccine might prevent but it is marketed to do that nonetheless  In fact there is no actual evidence that the vaccine can prevent any cancer  From the manufacturers own admissions the vaccine only works on  strains out of  for a specific venereal disease that dies on its own in a relatively short period so the chance of it actually helping an individual is about about the same as the chance of her being struck by a meteoriteThis is simply not true  The vaccine has been proven to prevent HPV  and  which prevents  of cervical cancers  The CDC is a reputable source for information on this httpwwwcdcgovSTDHPVSome more info key genes in HPV  and  are E E and E  E and E when activated disrupt cellular defense mechanisms that kill off cells that might become cancerous  E and E are normally repressed by E  HPV infects cells by integrating the viral DNA into the host cell human DNA  HPV can insert itself into the human DNA in many different positions and where it inserts itself is as far as we know random  If HPV inserts itself in a way that disrupts the E gene then E and E are free to disrupt the host cells defense mechanisms leading to cancerSo if you get an HPV infection you might get a strain that doesnt cause cancer  Or you might get a strain that does cause cancer but the HPV inserts itself in a way that does not result in cancer  But you could be one of the unlucky people who gets HPV  or  that integrates in such a way that causes the cancer  So yes getting cervical cancer from HPV is rare but you dont know if you are going to be one of the unlucky ones or not,7,cdm2tjm,1rd56j,askscience,hot,44.0,37

patchgrabber,Well kelp are basically algae so they are quite different from land plants in pretty much every way except photosynthesis Although their holdfasts resemble and may be a primitive form of plant roots kelp are fundamentally different In most land plants while very limited photosynthesis may occur in the stalk of the plant most of its photosynthetic activity is in the leaves Kelp in contrast photosynthesize in every part of the organism although different parts have different levels of photosynthetic ability depending on age allowing for more and making light less of a limitation than it is in land plantsThe environment the kelp lives in is also a big factor Since it is under water light is attenuated differently than above water Due to the large amount of particulates blue light is attenuated rapidly in coastal waters and blue light is much more valuable than red light that can penetrate deeper at a higher intensityWhile there are products out there that purport to use kelp in them to make plants grow faster Im thinking this is only because of the nutrients not any special property that is linked to kelp growth I cannot think of any way at present to genetically transfer this quality to land plants their limitations are different their environments are different and they are just fundamentally different organisms Kelp would be much better used as fertilizer as you suggest than as a source of genetic information although in the future that may change,0,cdmahyq,1rd7fs,askscience,hot,2.0,2
MarineLife,As upatchgrabber said Algae are very different from plants  Here the main difference is that higher plants grow ie create new tissue only at specific regions on their body Usually this is at the tip of the plant or leaf the apex In grasses grains it happens at the nodes too  Kelp on the other hand creates new tissue along the entire length of its thallus the big leaf which is why in grows so fast  Another big difference is that the thallus doesnt have much if any speciation it is composed of more or less the same kind of cell Higher plants in contrast have an internal structure of xylem phloem bark etc that requires many different specialized cell types  Both these differences work together to prevent us from simply transplanting this ability into our crop plants BTW  some bamboo species can also grow very fast up to cm a day or so but there is trickery involved In fact the plant tissue has been created at the usual speed beforehand but compressed During the elongation phase the plant sucks up much water and fills the cells so it telescopes upwards ,0,cdn4dss,1rd7fs,askscience,hot,1.0,1
therationalpi,Basically its because multiple sources together are louder than a single source You are probably familiar with constructive and deconstructive wave interference where two waves on top of each other can either add or subtract based on phase As it turns out if you have sounds at different frequencies or if the phase relationship varies randomly over time as it would when you have two people yelling then you get interference which is mostly positive The math would be that the squares of the pressure addA good rule of thumb is that the sound pressure goes up by  dB every time you double the number of people Likewise if the distance to the source is much greater than the size of the source then the loudness will drop by  dB for every doubling of distance Additionally there is also sound damping that becomes important at long distances This is highly dependent on temperature humidity and frequency but lets just ballpark it at about  dB per kilometerSo lets suppose you could clearly hear someone yelling  meters away when its fairly quiet If I went  mile away approximately  meters then that sound would need to be  dB louder  dB from doubling the distance  times   dB from  m worth of sound absorption From here we simply solve to see how many people we would need in the soccer stadium to increase the source strength by  dB In this case we would need to double the crowd  times which means you need about  people Naturally the more people beyond that you have the louder it will be when it reaches youHope that answers your question,64,cdm1wqf,1rd7qj,askscience,hot,414.0,350

ratpoison,This is the distilled wisdom of my Microwave Networks experience regarding impedanceThe most important defining feature of the transmission line is its characteristic impedance It is affected by the shape of the transmission line and materials that make it up Generally for a TL extending to the z direction we can divide the whole length in small parts of length Δz Τhose parts can be arbitrarily small so much so that we can ignore any radiating properties within that Δz We can therefore make a lumpedcircuit equivalent of that Δz length of the tramsission lineMovement along the length of the transmission line will mean some ohmic resistance R and some inductance L The neighboring of metal surfaces will cause capacitance C and the material between them will cause dielectric losses based on a conductance GAs the electromagnetic wave travels through the transmission line along direction of propagation J we can generally define functions Iz  Iz  Iz and Vz  Vz  VzSo current and voltage are made up of two constituents the first  representing movement along the direction of propagation and the second  representing the part of the current and voltage that are caused by reflection and therefore are moving opposite the direction of propagationCharacteristic Impedance is the ratio Zz  Vz  Izfor the length of Δz I have described earlier it is calculated as Z  sqrtRjωLGjωC j  sqrtIn most cases trasmission lines are uniform in the z direction or they are made up of a cascade of uniform parts Either way for every uniform TL the characteristic impedance is the same no matter which Δz I choose within it as long as its small so thats why its such a defining property of a TLWe can then define another quantity ΓzVzVz called the reflection coefficient This tells us what is the ratio of reflected and forward waves Its amplitude is  if there are no reflections  if the reflections and the forward waves have the same energy therefore leading to standing waves not able to propagate energy or aninbetween state for the other values in betweenIf zl then we have calculated that ΓLoad  ΖLZΖLZ For a lossless transmission line this will have constant amplitude throughout its lengthNow we want to minimize energy lost in reflections So Γ should be If you look closely at my last equation youll see that this can only be true if ZL  ZRegarding the part about the return lineWhen dealing with high frequency circuits a return line is not necessary BUT NOT because of impedance matching If the outer shell or the inner wire of a coaxial cable didnt exist it wouldnt posses the geometrical properties that induce the field to operate in the desired way There wouldnt be two points with different potentials along the direction of propagation around which the EM energy could oscillate back and forth In fact the concepts I have just described break down BUT there are transmission lines that dont have a return wire these are waveguides The wave DOES oscillate back and forth but the points are not as strictly defined as in twowire TLs or coaxial cables Instead we have modes depending on the ratio of the wavelength and the dimensions of the waveguide there are possibly several nulls and peaks at the transversal plane that are defined by how many halfwaves fit into that dimension These nulls and peaks are now the places around which the energy fluctuates in order to propagate forward Waveguides are the reason you should be careful when using current and voltage concepts on microwave circuits Therefore you should just stop thinking about TLs in terms of a phase line and a return line but a single structure which guides the waves along a direction and maybe causes reflections along the opposite direction,0,cdmbm4q,1rdd6o,askscience,hot,2.0,2

masiakasaurus,StringOfLights hit the most important points but Id like to stress that every animal is a different case and the more you look into a particular species youll see different or additional reasons for the size they had While an old source  Björn Kurténs Pleistocene Mammals of Europe and I guess its companion New World book Pleistocene Mammals of North America by the same author though I have not read it makes a good recap on ice age mammals Lets see some of the animals you citedFirst of all mammoths There were different species of mammoths and they have been cursed with being described as gigantic in popular literature but they were really not that big The biggest species was the Eurasian steppe mammoth Mammuthus trogontherii followed by Mammuthus columbi its North American descendant whose males topped at  meters  feet tall The biggest African elephants are about  meters tall or a little more M trogontherii and M columbi didnt live in the tundra however but in temperate grasslands to the south Whats more M trogontherii wasnt an ice animal proper as it was common during the Cromerian or GunzMindel interglatial  years ago a warm period between glatiations M trogontheriis Eurasian descendant the more famous woolly mammoth M primigenius was adapted to the glatial steppetundra and thrived during the cold periods It was a smaller animal than its ancestor no bigger than modern elephants Kurtén gives a height at the shoulder for the Late Pleistocene mammoths who lived through one of the coldest periods of the Pleistocene as  feet or less There is no doubt however that the woolly mammoth was the biggest animal of the tundra but it wasnt the giant mountain it is made out to be in popular imagination and it is plausible that its decrease in size from its predecessor is a result of living in a poorer environment with less foodDire wolves despite popular image as well were no bigger than grey wolves either This confusion stems from the fact that dire wolf jaws and teeth were larger and more adapted to bonecrushing than grey wolves making them ecologically analogous to Old World hyenas Indeed while hyenas inhabited Eurasia and Africa during the Pleistocene and coexisted with wolves they never reached America so the direwolves occupied their niche here and in fact coexisted with grey wolves who looked after different prey than them The grey wolf of Late Pleistocene Europe is slightly bigger than modern European wolves but then again modern wolves in North America are also on average larger than EuropesGiant Sloths are rather weird as they have no living equivalents and Im not as familiar with them but once again the biggest ones ever dont come from colder areas Wikipedia yes I know has Eremotherium Georgia Texas Mexico and Megatherium subtropical South America as  meters long The ones that lived in colder areas were smaller Mylodon Patagonia and Megalonyx Central America to Alaska and Yukon peak both at  meters half the lenght of the othersCave Bears were not particularly related to brown bears if anything they were closer to black bears and coexisted briefly with brown bears who originated in Asia cave bears are exclusive to Europe Cave bears were mainly vegetarians and didnt live in tundra either but in temperate forests and became extinct as the continent became colder about  years ago almost like the neanderthals I dont have size data right now but from what I recall they arent that big compared to brown or polar bears someone correct me if Im wrong please and once again this seems to be a confusion born of the fact that they are more robust and massive looking Brown bears in cold periods of the Pleistocene are on average bigger than brown bears in warm periods including modern brown bears howeverCave lions were indeed on average bigger than modern lions but still the same species While cave lions lived in the Pleistocene in Eurasia and Alaska modern looking lions who are not descendants of the former according to DNA were in Africa and probably the Middle East The American cave lion was bigger than both but its taxonomy is in discussion and could have been a whole different beast altogether hehe more related to the jaguar Like mammoths and unlike wolves and bears however Eurasian cave lions are biggest in the Cromerian and become their smallest in colder periods especially near the end of the Pleistocene Some European lions get so small that it has even been suggested that the cave lion became extinct before it is commonly assumed to and was replaced by modern lions from the Middle East belonging to or closely related to the modern Indian subspecies one of the smallest living lions by the way On the issue of cats leopards which lived in Europe through the Pleistocene and cheetahs are also bigger in warm periods and get smaller in colder periods while lynxes and wildcats do the opposite Im not sure why I have to say though that the European wildcat of Late Pleistocene Europe is similar in size to the modern wildcats of southern Spain which are bigger than other wildcats in the continent yet are more southernly distributed than them Confusing ehAurochs were like cave bears temperate animals that didnt live in the tundrasteppe where they were replaced by bison and are most common in interglatials Wild aurochs dont seem to have been any smaller than they were in the Pleistocene Julius Caesar said that aurochs were the size of elephants Mind you this is the extinct North African Elephant which was smaller than an Asian elephant and closer in size to a very big horse but it gives an idea of how massive they were compared to its living descendant domestic cattle Thats a key as to why they became smaller domestication Humans selected the smaller better manageable aurochs and this is why the species decreased in size with no relation to climate Had cattle not been domesticated or aurochs not been hunted to extinction just like we have wolves and dogs living side by side today wed have aurochs bulls of  meters at the shoulders The biggest living bovine the gaur Bos gaurus of southeast Asia not a descendant of the aurochs can surpass  metershttpwwwultimateungulatecomartiodactylabosfrontalishtmlSo it seems that in a lot of cases your hunch is actually right and lack of food and other factors

drzowie,A superadiabatic gradient is what drives convection  the free energy that gets converted to mechanical flow comes from the positive difference between the gradient and the adiabatic lapse rate  Convection will happen at some level with any nonzero excess in the lapse rate above the adiabatic rate since the material is a fluidIn practice the actual lapse rate doesnt get driven exactly to the adiabatic rate but its pretty darned close  The actual offset is driven by the balance between heat flux and effective turbulent viscosity in the fluid  Since stellar plasmas arent known for their high viscosity and the scales are large the offset turns out to miniscule negligible by orders of magnitude in nearly all cases  so you can treat the adiabatic lapse rate as a strict limit and be good to goLets apply your example of  superadiabaticity to the Sun   The convection zone spans about  orders of magnitude or about  scale heights in densityhttpsolarphysicslivingreviewsorgopenpubNolrspampamppagearticlesehtml  If the lapse rate differs from adiabatic by  part in  that corresponds to a temperature differential factor of exx compared to ex across the whole convection zone  so if you assumed the lapse rate was exactly adiabatic but it was really x times the adiabatic rate and you knew the photospheric temperature exactly your calculation of the temperature at the base of the convection zone would be off by a factor or x  Other effects like convective overshoot and dynamo action enter at the  level so the superadiabaticity is negligible,0,cdmo4bd,1reh81,askscience,hot,1.0,1
LoyalSol,There isnt really one universal answer since different materials will react differently with acidsbases but a large majority of them dissolve because of either oxidation like in the case of metals or through catalyzed reactions the acidbase speeds up a reaction that normally would occur slowlyOxidation is pretty straight forward  The metals have electrons taken away by the acid and once that happens they form stable ions which can be freely dissolved into solution  In catalytic reactions the acidbase comes in and binds to a functional group on a molecule usually organic molecules and stabilizes the molecule in a way that it can undergo further reactions  httpwwworganicchemistryorgnamedreactionsfischeresterificationshtmThats an example of the forward reaction but the reverse reaction is similar    In large scale a organic molecules such as proteins each peptide in the chain is linked together by an functional ground amide group for proteins OCN and the acidbase will attack these links causes the chain to break apart  Which is why they are generally detrimental to biological organisms ,0,cdmm2e5,1rehln,askscience,hot,2.0,2

paolog,The crisscross distance between two points is called the Manhattan distance between the points while the straightline distance is called the Euclidean distance What youre asking is whether the limit of the Manhattan distance as the grid gets finer is equal to the Euclidean distance Its easy to show that this is not the caseLets take a  x  square The Manhattan distance from one corner to the other is  length of bottom edge  length of right edge for example while the Euclidean distance is by Pythogoras theorem Now subdivide the square into a  x  grid of four squares To get from one corner to another we have to zigzag along four edges of the small squares each of which is  a unit long So the total distance is  x  or Its not hard to show that however we subdivide the square into smaller squares or even rectangles the shortest cornertocorner distance measured along the edges of these squares will always be  and will never get anywhere near  Hence no matter how many turns we make the Manhattan distance never equals the Euclidean distanceSo no nothing changes as the resolution of the grid becomes finer Furthermore a diagonal is not imaginary  it is just different from walking along the edgesEDIT removed repetition,1,cdml7vm,1reu8x,askscience,hot,21.0,20

DimensionalNet,The answer is probably not Directions like up and down are relative to gravity so without gravity you cant have a rising action Also I dont think you can have heat without at least a tiny amount of gravity since a temperature gradient requires a material medium which will then have mass  If this mass is continuous throughout with a high enough density to interact the hottest stuff will probably rise compared to the cooler matter and form a spherical gradient assuming theres enough gravity to hold it together at all  This particulate matter will probably behave like a fluid and that combined with enough gravity for observable effects gives you at least a gas giant or quite possibly a star  At this point you have to deal with much more variability than temperatureBack to the original question consider why there is a rising effect with heat A hotter form of the same substance is going to be lower density and then has a higher probability to diffuse upward compared to the more dense form since theres less mass per unit of volume  The heavier cold air sinks compared to the hot air but without gravity theres no weight difference so the fluid would diffuse into each other and likely average out to the same temperature,9,cdmo9dv,1rf2b3,askscience,hot,11.0,2

JSArrakis,Some things need to be defined here first The thing you are defining as heat is the convection of atomic excitement from the air molecules around you to the molecules that make up your skinbody Everything has gravity There is no such thing as a zerogravity environment It is a misnomer and a buzz word that the media likes to propagate There are gravitational environments that are diminished or strengthened based on your location of adjacency and current escape velocity in relation to the object in question For example when you see astronauts in space that seem to appear weightless this is just a scientific trick that scientists devised by means of calculating the speed a person or a ship needs to be to be able to move both sideways and down at a speed that allows the personship to fall sideways around the object This constant freefall around the object or orbit allows the person to seem weightless If you slowed down your sideways velocity youd start falling toward the earth if you increased it youd reach an escape velocity and no longer be in orbit If you stopped your lateral velocity entirely youd fall like a rock The same goes for the sun and all other bodies within the solarsystem If there was no Earth and you suddenly stopped orbiting the sun youd fall like a rock toward the sun If the Earth was still there and you and the earth both stopped lateral velocity first youd fall toward the earth because of its closer proximity and then the earth would fall toward the sun Every piece of matter in the universe has some level of gravitational pull If it has mass even very very small mass it has gravity and pulls on all the things around it  Im going to assume youre talking about heat in the form of convection in gassesThe answer Barring there are no outside influences both gravitational and not and in a vacuum the gas will form a sphere due to all of the gas molecules acting upon each other The within the sphere the more excited molecules the hottest will travel toward the surface while the least excited molecules will sink toward the middle Consequently the friction of the molecules interacting each other in the core of the gas bubble will heat them while the molecules that rose to the surface will see less interaction and cause them to reduce their excitement and become cool again which will make a circular flow within the gas sphere This same mechanic is what causes wind and high and low pressure systems in weather here on earthEdit formatting,2,cdmw6gb,1rf2b3,askscience,hot,4.0,2

callmecooper,No heat would not rise Heat rises through a process called Free Convection The classical example of free convection is a heated wire in completely still air Heat rises from the wire in a sort of wake just like a boat through water but instead this wake consists of heated air flowing through cooler airThe reason that free convection results in hot air rising is because of the density difference between hot and cool air Hot air is less dense than cool air so gravity pulls more on the cool air than hot air and the hot air floats to the top of the cool air In space the gravity that pulls more on cool air would not be present so the heat would slowly expand from the surface in all directions away from the source of heat This obviously has practical implications in that the heat collects around the source and can cause the source to overheat Therefore it is necessary to mechanically push the air across the source of heat in order to generate the type of air flow that would normally be present when there were gravitational forces at workGravitational forces are always at work in orbit but can be assumed negligible due to the control volume being in constant freefallconstant accelerationdue to the frame of referenceEDIT Source  Purdue University BSME ,0,cdn0nh7,1rf2b3,askscience,hot,2.0,2

MasterDefibrillator,well its not exactly heat that is rising is it Its excited air molecules that are being heated up the more heated they become the less dense and so we see that the less dense air rises above the more dense air This is what we mean when we say that heat rises and no it would not occur in a zero g environment What you would see is a general expansion in all directions due to the expansion of air you can see this happening in videos such as thishttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvQlayAB,0,cdn7tyb,1rf2b3,askscience,hot,2.0,2
BiggerJ,Heat rises because things tend to expand when they heat up Hot air is less dense than cold air As a result it floats Inronically however things float because of gravity pulling down on denser things because the resultant downward force on the denser objects is greater When theres no gravity or rather when there is negligible gravity aka microgravity  all mass has gravity this doesnt happen The upward force is a reaction to a downward force In order for there to be up there must also be down,1,cdna4y1,1rf2b3,askscience,hot,3.0,2

Osymandius,Contrary to the answers below ATP is produced within the chloroplast ATP synthase is located in the thylakoid membranespace and does make use of the proton motive force generated by either cyclic or non cyclic photophosphorylation But  the ATP produced in the chloroplast just isnt enough to compared to the amount produced in the mitochondria We move relatively minimal numbers of protons across the membrane during photosynthesis  the really important product of noncyclic photophosphorylation is the generation of reducing equivalents NADPH This can then be used to fuel the Calvin cycle and the production of triose phosphates and sugar derivativesOnce we have produced TPsugars these can be metabolised to produce NADH in the mitochondria The proton motive force produced by the electron transport chain is considerably greater and much more ATP can be generated than relying on chloroplasts alone,0,cdmrffo,1rf3cf,askscience,hot,3.0,3

drzowie,It all boils down to a mathematical concept called Fourier transformation  This guy named Fourier figured out how to turn any series of values like the pressure in air at subsequent points in time into a collection of pitches  That turns out to be extremely useful for many things  One of the cool things about Fourier transformation is that any repeating waveform is just the sum of several pure tones at integer multiples of the base frequency  A flute makes a pureish tone but a horn making the same note sounds quite different  The difference is that the horn sound has the main tone mixed in with overtones at integer harmonics x the base frequency x x etc   Its worth repeating  any complex waveform a pitch with timbre is just the sum of pure pitches at integer multiples of a base frequencySo your auditory system has adapted to treat multiple frequencies separated by an integer factor as parts of the same complex tone  Thats good since its usually true  if you have a bunch of random noises around you most of them wont happen to share any integer harmonics  two notes that are exactly an integer multiple apart are almost certainly part of the same toneThere are some exceptions to that rule  In particular some devilish fellow might be playing a chord on a musical instrument  Chords are auditory puns  For example a C major chord is middleC middleE and middleG  Those notes happen to have the frequency ratio       Multiply all those numbers by  and you get the sequence   all the notes in the C chord happen to be multiples of another note with a much lower tone  Whoah In this case the lower tone happens to be C two octaves down  Your auditory system identifies the chord as part of a single complex sound at the much lower pitch  even if that pitch doesnt actually exist in the musicThats the basic theory of chords and pitches mixing  The pitch scale is a logarithmic scale  each step up or down the scale multiplies frequency by a certain amount  Going up or down an octave multiplies or divides by   The reason that notes an octave apart sound like the same note is that they are so closely harmonically related  practically every sound around you contains a base pitch and its second harmonic  If you listen carefully you can also get that same sameness from a note and the fifthinterval an octave up  A fifth interval is a ratio of  in frequency so a fifth and an octave gives you a ratio of   Since its an integer ratio not a fraction the two notes say Cbelowmiddle and middleG have a little of the sameness that you normally associate with octaves only  But octaves have so much of that same sound that we give notes an octave apart the same nameNow  why are octaves octaves and why are there exactly  halfsteps in an octave  Thats because of something called the circle of fifths which musicians frequently mutter about and which you can google for more information if youre not one  The easiest way to construct a scale is by starting with a base note somewhere say A but any frequency will do and then constructing third harmonics of it  Each time you go up in frequency a factor of  you get a nice harmony the octaveandafifth  Then you fold the new note downward by octaves until it is within a factor of  of the original frequency and start over  If you do that  times youll create  separate notes and arrive almost back where you started   higher in pitch than the original note  Thats really discordant if you play it next to the original note but if you tweak each of your derived notes ever so slightly you can sort of smooth things out so that all the frequencies work right to form new chords with one another  Youl find that you created exactly  notes and defined the halfstep scale  But you had to fudge the frequencies because you had to sweep the discord under the sonic rug somewhere  This is reasonable not just for aesthetic reasons but because if you didnt know the math you might think youd just screwed up the tripling step a tiny bit each time  When people say the Western scale is based on a lie this is the lie they mean the circle of fifths cannot work perfectly because no matter how many times you multiply your original frequency by  you will never arrive at a power of   but you can fudge it if youre close enough Through the ages there have been several different temperaments used in which people tweaked the notes of the  tone circle of fifths in various different ways to try to make particular chords sound particularly good  at the expense of other chords  These days we use an equaltempered scale where each half step is exactly a factor of  above the previous one  If youre playing a bendable instrument like the flute the trombone the violin or the human voice and you are a good musician you will unconsciously tune each note slightly higher or lower depending on the chordal context of your particular note to harmonize better with the rest of the orchestra  You cant bend the notes on a piano which is why pianos have multiple strings singing each note  it fuzzes out the resonance of each note so its harder for your ears to pick out the harmonic discrepancies  There are three strings so you cant hear the slightlydetuned strings beating as you could if there were just two  The bass bridge usually has two strings per note but by the time you get down there the resonances are so cruddy that you cant really hear the beating anywayThe  primary notes AG you can get by stepping once forward on the circle of fifths and and once backward to get three notes separated by fifth intervals for example Fbelowmiddle middleC and middleG  If you create major chords for each of those three notes and fold all those new notes into a single octave youll find that there are  unique pitches which are the pitches of the major scale  Thats why we call it an octave  oct for   Since going down a fifth and folding into the main octave is the same as going up a fourth interval you can immediately see why IVVI and similar chord progressions are so common in Western music  theyre the very basis of our musical scaleIncidentally not everyone agrees on that scale  The equaltempered Western scale can generate harmonic sequences up to  of the original if you play a C chord with the low G and two lower Cs you are playing the       and  harmonics of the lowest C  But any higher harmonics fall between the notes  Middleeastern and Indian music uses higher harmonics and therefore has lots of quarterstep or smaller intervals that sound strange to our ears  The German tradition calls that  harmonic of C by its own special name  H as the next note after G a fact Johann Sebastian Bach exploited by working his own name BACH into a counterpoint line in his last great

neverdonebefore,There is a bit more to it than that  In FWD cars the front wheels are doing both the steering and applying the engine torque to the road  And RWD the rear wheels are only applying that torque to the road  Essentially your fwd cars are pulling while rwd are pushing  As you drive down a straight road you are applying longitudinal force to the road to propel you forward  As you enter a curve in the road you add a rotational component to your travel  The center of mass of the vehicle has to move laterally through the curve while the vehicle itself has to rotate about that center of mass in order to be pointed straight as you exit the curve  With a fwd vehicle the direction of the force applied to the road by the tires changes as you turn your steering wheel and the back wheels will follow in that path Fwd vehicles have a tendency to understeer  An object in motion wants to stay in motion the inertia of the car in the longitudinal direction makes it want to keep going straight  The tires want to follow the path on which they are pointed  If the lateral acceleration into the curve cannot overcome the forward inertia the car will understeer or take a path with a larger radius than the curve  In a rwd vehicle the the tendency is to oversteer or turn at a smaller radius than the curve  This is because the force on the road by the rear wheels is along the path of the vehicles inertia  The front wheels will want to follow their path around the curve but the rear wheels will want to keep going straight  This means it is easier to rotate about the center of mass  This is how fish tailing and drifting and spin outs occur,1,cdn5t9m,1rgew2,askscience,hot,8.0,7

generalelectrix,This is a very vague questionFor digital signals yes this does matter  Digital audio signals require significantly higher bandwidth and run at higher frequencies than the audio content they encode so transmission line effects become important  If the characteristic impedance of the cable you use to transmit a digital signal is not matched to the source and destination you can get partial reflections or standing waves on the cable which can definitely cause errors in the reconstructed signal at the destination  This becomes more important with longer cablesFor analog signals the frequency is low enough that the characteristic impedance isnt really important  So long as the conductors youre using are lowresistance copper is great coat hangers should work just as well as fancy cable  Shielding in cables is important for linelevel interconnects to prevent the cables from picking up noise from the environment though this usually isnt too big of a problem in a home environmentThe only real exception to this is for speaker cables carrying postamplifier level signals for electrostatic speakers as the load they present to the driving amplifier is largely capacative  Then the details of the impedance of the cable driving the speaker become a bit more importantIm a physics PhD in quantum electronics with a minor hifi addictionEdit I give an indepth and accurate answer and get a ton of downvotes  SCIENCE,19,cdn89ly,1rgzbv,askscience,hot,5.0,-14

ThePsuedoMonkey,Clothes dryers function by evaporating the water in the clothes and the rate of evaporation of a liquid is directly related to its vapor pressure  The vapor pressure of water is an exponential function of temperaturehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiVaporpressureBoilingpointofwater roughly kPa at room temperature and kPa when it boils  An electrical heating element in a dryer will create heat by electrical resistance and Ohms LawhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiResistorPowerdissipation states that the power dissipated by a resistor is the product of its resistance and the voltage that is applied to itIf the amount of water in the clothes were sufficiently small this would mean that it would be more efficient to dry them at high heat in an enclosed space do not do this it is fire hazard  However there is likelyhttpwwwverbercommarkoutdoorsgearclothingwaterabsorptionhtml a significant amount of water remaining in the clothes and based on the room temperature vapor pressure each kilogram of water will need  liters of completely dry air in order to fully evaporate in which could become a corrosion or electrical hazard when it condenses after the dryer coolsBecause of this air is vented through the dryer to expel the watersaturated air  This additional air that must be heated and there is no guarantee that all of it will be watersaturated by the time it is expelled but the act of venting air can also help promote evaporation  The amount of energy lost due to venting is proportional to the dryers temperature and the flow rate of the air and the amount of energy lost due to thermal radiation is also proportional to the dryers temperature difference with the ambient air due to the first law of thermodynamics  Reducing the temperature setting would reduce both of theses losses for any given moment though the drying period would significantly increase due to the associated drop in vapor pressure  However without a better understanding of the effects of ambient humidity on evaporation or of the efficiency of the electronic components at low output I am reluctant to say for certain,18,cdnb7zo,1rh9np,askscience,hot,84.0,66
BigWiggly,There are a lot of factors brought up by ThePsuedoMonkeys comment and I recommend reading through his comment as wellIm going to go with a bit of gut instinct and tell you no I will proceed by first explaining relative humidity followed by how the dryer is working and finally returning to the answer of your questionFor water to evaporate the air its in contact with needs to be able to hold it The airs ability to hold it is measured as its Relative Humidity RH As heat is added to the air its relative humidity decreases and it can hold more waterAdditionally the lower the RH of the air is the more quickly the water is able to evaporate As water vapour saturates the air the RH goes up and it becomes more and more difficult for that volume of air to pick up more water Imagine its arms are full and the more full they get the more stuff they drop each time they bend over to pick up something new Eventually it drops water just as fast as it picks it upDryers work by taking air from the outside ambient air raising its temperature and circulating it through the dryer before sending it back out through the lint screen The dryer would work albeit rather slowly without heating the air Ambient air is usually not at  RH so it can still hold more water Lets say you put your clothes in for  minutes At high heat thats enough to dry them to your liking At no heat tumble only they may still feel damp Lets rule that out as not an option because youve got somewhere to be in an hour and your favourite pants just got out of the washerBy heating the air the RH of the inlet air to the dryer is lowered as its temperature rises giving it the ability to hold more water I guess it has bigger arms This means that for every volume of air that goes through the dryer more water comes out with it Additionally this helps to speed up the last bits of drying where there isnt much water left Warmer air will also heat the clothes giving the water some extra energy to boost themselves into the vapour state so it can be carried off Without heat the last bits of water are simply too cold to evaporate quickly enoughTo address the energy efficiencyHeating requires a lot of energy Any heating process is a fairly inefficient process Resistor heating elements are good at what they do but nobody ever claims for them to be efficient Moving air on the other hand is relatively easy to do as long as you clean your lint screen Its much more efficient to pump a volume of fluid air than it is to heat that same volumeIn the first stages of drying there is so much water on the clothes that regardless of how warm the air is it will saturate with water Theres simply an excess of water This may make you say So lets heat it even more and itll take more out with each chunk of air right Yes you are right Instead though we know its cheaper to move air than it is to heat it so lets be patient and let the moving air do its work In fact dryers would be more efficient if they increased the air flowrate in the early stages of the drying cycle and decreased the heating requirementsAs mentioned earlier in the last stages of drying when there isnt much water warmer air is able to force water out of its little microscopic nooks and crannies by giving it more energy At this point air circulation isnt as important because there isnt enough water in the clothes to saturate the air thats in there anyways Now air circulation is only to prevent overheating that could cause a fire hazard Still every bit of air that gets heated and then vented too soon is a waste of energySo now that weve covered what is good at the early and late stages of drying we can make general statements on what the most efficient dryer would do Start out on low heat with high circulation followed by a steady increase of heat until finishing while the air flowrate is decreased proportionally to the temperature but always above a minimum flowrate to prevent overheatingSince I dont know about any of these fancy dryers on the market and most people are tempted to use the timed dry options rather than an autodry option which uses an RH or moisture sensor to determine when to stop drying I will say that it is most efficient to stick to the least amount of heat necessary to get your clothes to a satisfactory level of dryness because heating is the most inefficient process in your dryerAs a good compromise between length of cycle and heating required use medium heat Ive noticed that medium heat often doesnt take noticeably longer than a high heat cycle and does the job well enoughAlternatively if youre looking to be the most efficient you could dry on low and manually increase the temperature every  minutes or soIf youre a dryer manufacturer and reading this consider making the autodry cycle adjust airflow and temperature based on the RH leaving the dryer based on the sensor already in the installation ,2,cdne9bx,1rh9np,askscience,hot,13.0,11
RabidRabbt,This all depends on what you mean by efficient  Since I can just hang my clothes up and watch them dry although it takes some time the application of any extra heat that I then shunt outdoors is clearly wastefulIf by efficient you mean in terms of the product your time waiting and cost of drying economic efficiency thats a slightly more interesting question  There are two things to consider first that the energy required to vaporize the water in your clothes from room temperature is essentially a constant  Secondly the rate of energy transfer is related to the temperature difference between the air and the clothes by an exponential function  Now if you keep running hot air over your clothes at a constant rate relying on the efficiency of energy transfer we can now figure out the function form of our economic efficiency  Assuming you charge an hourly rate the opportunity cost to you is simply your rate R times the amount of time time that it takes to dry your clothes  The cost to you on your electric bill is the time it takes to dry your clothes multiplied by your power companys rate P and the rate of energy usage E  Since resistive heating is  were going to make the approximation that E proportional to the amount you heated your clothing up  The only thing left is how much time it takes as a function of temperature exponentialSo youre left withcost  R  expE  P  Ewhere time is expESince this function goes to zero very fast the short answer is that yes higher temperatures are good for your wallet  Please note that I did leave out a massive fudge factor namely that the amount of waste heat is also going to increase in this model since I did not actually bother to take the integral of the exponential however the point remains ,0,cdnh7l7,1rh9np,askscience,hot,2.0,2
LWRellim,Per this study see page httpwwwaceeeorgfilesproceedingsdatapaperspdf a low heat setting is more efficient than higher heat settings However the energy usage difference is not as large as most may think  what the high heat setting mostly achieves is apparently just a slightly shorter drying time  and the additional energy expended to heat is offset by the fact that the machine itself and thus the fanairflow runs for a shorter timeThe study includes the following recommendationsgtAdvice to ConsumersgtConsumers can dry clothes with less energy by using in order of energy savings    gt Outdoor clothes lines get clothes dry using no energy and with no HVAC impacts    gt Indoor drying racks use no direct energy but do have an HVAC impact The total energy impact is lower than any currently available dryer    gt A natural gas dryer is cheaper to operate and has lower environmental impacts than anelectric dryer    gt High washer spin speeds are more energy efficient than evaporating the water in the dryer    gt Drying full loads is more energy efficient than a larger number of partial loads    gt A low heat setting is more energy efficient than higher heat settings    gt A less dry setting is more energy efficient than normal or more dry Note that I added the energy in there in a few points because it is obvious from the context that is what they mean by the use of the word efficient  which by itself is otherwise an ambiguous word ie something can said to be more efficient if it gets the job done faster  so to a consumer a machine that lets them do  full loads within  hours will be more efficient than one that only does  loads in the same time periodOne of the things that they fail to note  probably THE easiest way people can reduce laundry energy use  is to just do LESS laundry  Most clothing doesnt need to be tossed into the laundry bin every time you touchedwore it,1,cdnislo,1rh9np,askscience,hot,3.0,2
c,I would say the high heat would be more efficient Drying clothes is just a phase change from liquid to gas The total energy required to evaporate the water would be the same regardless of the setting The energy required would just depend on the initial temperature of the clothes the amount of water in the clothes the specific heat of water  kJkg K and the heat of vaporization for water  kJkg Lets say we have m kg of water in our clothes close to room temp ToK We need to heat the water to TbK the boiling point of water at STP since we are in an open system to the atmosphere We need  kJKgK x m x TbTo KJ to raise the temp up to boiling point of water Now we need  kJkg x m kJ to vaporize the water In total  kJ or  kWh of energy is needed to evaporate the waterIf you assume that the dryer for both cycles is able to heat the water to the boiling point and the  rate of heat absorption to be the same for both cycles the only thing that matters is the duration of which the motors run to spin the drum and blower Therefore the high heat setting would be more efficientWhat really would save energy reducing the amount of water in your clothes A high speed spin cycle or a centrifugal dryer thats extracts a higher percentage of the water out would save much more energy than selecting a heat setting ,2,cdnev36,1rh9np,askscience,hot,2.0,0

whosaidmaybe,I dont think your question has been truly answered yetAs stated on wikipediahttpenwikipediaorgwikiDVD here are your various sizes for DVD Discs   GB singlesided singlelayer  common GB singlesided doublelayer GB doublesided singlelayer GB doublesided doublelayer  rareThe unit of measurement however is in decimal metric  which has base units of   bytes   kilobyte  kilobytes   megabyte  megabytes   gigabyteComputers count in binary and have base units of  So  bytes   kilobyte  so on an so forthTherefore the capacity of a  gigabyte DVD is  bytes in decimal But when divided by  kilobytes  megabytes and  gigabytes the capacity is  gigabytes Once the disk is formatted you may lose a few more megabytesThis same principle can be applied to the other sizes of DVDs as well as hard drives  which are sold with the same confusing capacity claims A  terabyte hard drive  gigabytes  megabytes  kilobytes  bytes as labeled by the manufacturer A computer will see it as the binary capacity of  kilobytes  megabytes  gigabytesOnce you format the hard drive disk you lose a few more kilomegabytes but essentially you have  gigabytesThe reason why your DVD has a capacity of  gigabytes is because it started off as a  GB singlesided doublelayer disc and once the data was burned  copied to the disc  the disc was mastered  finalized This process completes the disc and does not allow any more data to be written to the disc The DVD will now report to the computer the total size of the data written to the discedit typos grammar etc,0,cdnf2ri,1rhdi6,askscience,hot,8.0,8

PastryBlender,As with most things in quantum mechanics you cant really know exactly what spin is nor imagine it in your head There are ways to represent it in classical terms like the vector model httphyperphysicsphyastrgsueduhbasequantumvecmodhtml however I myself dont really like this model and take spin to just exist as whatever numerical value it is in my headSpin is essentially the magnetic property of a particle or collection of particles its made up of spin angular momentum component and a magnetic moment component Magnetic Moment  Gyromagnetic Ratio x Spin Angular Momentum The spin angular momentum value is derived from quantum mechanics and the Gyromagnetic ratio is specific for each particleatom As the name implies the magnetic moment is a moment and if you want help imagining it think of it as the moment at which the particleoverall atom is actually spinning and is usually the quantity used for calculations to do with how much things affectchange spin The spin angular momentum component of this is limited quantum mechanically to a specific number of orientations depending on the amount of nuclear particles in question This means that the magnetic properties can have a quantised number of states for an atom and this is proven in the SternGerlach experiment This experiment fired nuclei of something spin  I think so with  allowed spin orientations through a magnetic field and onto a detector Only two spots were detected implying that the field only had nuclei of two sets of magnetic properties pass through it with one spot above the altitude at which the nuclei were fired horizontally and one below indicating a positive and negative spin both nuclei were displaced by the same amount but in different directions If you put nuclei in a magnetic field and fire electromagnetic waves at them their overall spin will change when certain frequencies are used This is the basis of NMR chemistry and the frequency Larmor frequency that causes these transitions depends on the magnetic moment of the species in question the Gyromagnetic ratio and the strength if the applied magnetic field Many complicated extra effects arise from doing NMR and it can be used to figure out the chemical structure of many chemicals using quantitative methods in both organic and inorganic chemistry Even now the field is continuously being improved as the sample quantities required to carry out NMR are too high because of sensitivity issues caused by radio waves used in NMR being of low energy compared to waves used in other methods of spectroscopy these low sample qualities mean that biologists studying cells always wine about not being able to NMR the little things they find etc Sorry if its long I got a bit carried away haha,0,cdnibzj,1rhpj0,askscience,hot,2.0,2

santa,BA in Astrophysics here  Your question involves how galaxies and star systems are formed and why they typically stay in the same plane  Since it seems like no one has answered yet Ill try and help you out  To answer Im going to do a little background first on galaxies then on stars and then Ill explain why there should not be as much matter above and below the plane of the Milky Way and our Solar System  Youre correct in assuming that space is infinite but from the sound of it you are implicitly also assuming that it is isotropic on any level  Essentially the reason flat diagrams are bewildering is because youre thinking of space as completely evenly spread out with stars planets and other matter like Hydrogen clouds and black holes and white dwarfs etc roughly taking up the same spacial distance away from one another  Space isnt like a D grid however especially on smaller scales  Astronomers recognize that on a very very very large scalehttpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsbbEarthsLocationintheUniverseJPEGjpg above the scale of the local superclusters of galaxies even the isotropy of the universe can be assumed as true  As you can see in the picture this is not true on the scale of our Milky Way Galaxy  Isotropy means that no matter where you look everything appears similar and theres no distinguishing point of reference  In the image we can see that matter is pretty much equally spread out only on the observable universe levelThat being said now we should consider how galaxies form  There are four basic different structures to galaxies spiral elliptical lenticular and irregular  These were proposed as a sort of evolution by Edwin Hubble and called the Hubble SequencehttpenwikipediaorgwikiHubblesequence  First the Hubble Sequence doesnt take into account irregular galaxies which formed as you can assume from there name in a very strange way mostly in the beginning stages of the universe where matter interactions were really hectic  Im going to put irregular galaxies aside because they arent really what were focusing on here but theres not much more to say about them anyway  Whats left are spiral elliptical and lenticular galaxies  They have different characteristics and form in different conditions  Long story short your question only involved star formation and spiral galaxies so Im going to get into that specifically  Spoiler there is a more equal spacing of stars and matter in elliptical galaxies because they formed from galaxies merging together and are shaped you guessed it like an ellipseFinally  Onto the good stuff  Star formation and spiral galaxieshttpenwikipediaorgwikiSpiralgalaxyOriginofthespiralstructure  Our Milky Way and Solar System  Both are surprisingly similar actually so lets get down to it  First off spiral galaxies are classified by two things whether they have a bar in the middle of them or not  This is shown in the Hubble sequence as the fork separating SBa from Sa  As you can imagine spiral galaxies are shaped in a spiral way with a group of stars in the middle surrounding the center  Much like a sprinkler that is shooting water and spinning for a long time the water or arms in this case appear to be curved due to the rotation of the center  The spinning of the center is very important and will play a part in answering your questionStar formation will actually explain both processes so Im going to jump out of galaxies for a minute  Imagine a cloud of Hydrogen and other dust just floating around in space  If the conditions are right maybe perhaps in the spiral arm of a galaxy where lots of new stars are formed the cloud might be heated up and have the right pressure to start clumping Hydrogen molecules together  Obviously we know that the more mass something has the more gravitational pull it has  Even you and I have a slight gravitational pull  The Hydrogen and other dust starts clumping together at a certain point as more and more matter is pulled toward it  As more matter is pulled in the center of the cloud where its being pulled starts to rotate from being hit with particles  Fast forward to lots of matter pulled in and gravity of the matter causing immense amounts of pressure down on itself and you have a cloud with a protostarhttpenwikipediaorgwikiProtostar  Fast forward some more  More and more matter is being gravitationally pulled into the protostar and more matter on top means more pressure at the core from matter pushing down on it  It also means more rotation done by the protostar  In the cloud matter starts to orbit around the protostar because it is too far from the protostar to be pulled in and the spinning of the protostar has caused the matter to achieve a tangential velocity creating an orbit  Now were at the point of the cloud looking like a rough haze of particles around a really hot ball  As the particles in the cloud orbit they too clump together to form planets asteroids comets meteoroids etc  Heres where we get to the crux of your question  Why do the planets form on a similar plane of the star system  The reason is actually because of the spinning protostar  The protostars spin causes the particles of dust and Hydrogen in the cloud to orbit in a specific direction  Thats all well and good so now everything is orbiting around in the same direction as the protostar is spinning  Back to another analogy  If you have a rubber ball and you decide you want to spin it while throwing it in the air straight up what should happen  If you spin it like a pizza the rubber balls top and bottom actually sinks into the middle part because of the spinning acting upon the particles in the rest of the ball  The top and bottom contract in to the middle plane of the ball where you spun it  Same concept but on a much larger scale  Spin the protostar fast enough and the particles in the upper and lower parts of the system not on the same plane as the spin want to sink down into the plane forming a sort of CDlike shape with the protostar in the middle and everything else orbiting the same way  Eventually the star gets big enough hot enough and has enough pressure to start Hydrogen fusion in the corehttpenwikipediaorgwikiStarformation when it explodes with energy and blows off a lot of the remaining dust and cloud in the system leaving planets comets asteroids and moons behind  The planets are still orbiting the star in the same rotational way also rotating themselves and their moons as well  The system looks like a CD and there is little matter above or below the CD plane because of the rotation of the star enacting a force to push and pull everything into the plane itself  You can actually apply the same principal to the formation of a spiral galaxy although the formation is a little different  I hope this answers your question  Let me know if it doesnt and Ill try and clear it up a little better  TLDR The starsupermassive black hole in the center pushes and pulls matter as the systemspiral galaxy is forming into a disk  It pulls the matter into the disk by spinning and applying a force into the plane that acts on the matter  When the matter is in the disk the rotationforce around the still spinning starsupermassive black hole doesnt allow it to leave  Thats why theres not as much stuff above and below the plane of the systemspiral galaxy,34,cdnfpuh,1rhu7r,askscience,hot,203.0,169

EvOllj,solar systems form from clouds condensing while gas condenses it transfers angular momentum from the inside to the outside where the center has no angular momentum left angular momentum can not be destroyed only transferred added and subtracted but things spin around multiple axis until they cease to rotate around common axes after a collision resulting from rotating differently The result of condensing gas clouds are a few rings of condensed matter on a plane where the total angular momentum along  axes more or less added up to  while the angular momentum around the rd axis keeps stuff rotating locally around nearly parallel axes This state has the least collisions and the least rotational energy,0,cdnm1pl,1rhu7r,askscience,hot,2.0,2

severoon,I thought you might find this interesting httpcuriousastrocornelleduquestionphpnumber  which basically explains why accretion discs are flatThe basic idea is if you release a bunch of particles of matter in empty space and theyre all stationary relative to each other theyll just fall directly toward the center of mass of the whole system and crunch into a sphere But this never happens Things are always moving aroundNow you can imagine that if everything is moving directly toward that center of mass of the whole system theyll all just accelerate and crunch even harder But once again this never happens Things in the universe that get caught up in a system never happen to be flying directly toward the center of mass of the systemOk so theyre coming in from all directions If its going fast enough a particle wont get captured by that system its path will bend but it will ultimately fly on through But if its not going fast enough to escape and it gets trapped then it will start a spiraling orbit toward the center of mass of the systemNow we have a bunch of stuff randomly spiraling in toward the center of mass This still isnt a disc though so why do we only see discs Shouldnt it be a big swirling spherical mass Seems like it shouldBut if you think a little more and give this system a long long time to settle down into a stable situation youll see that it isnt the case This is because every system has a net angular momentum In other words from all these random things falling in you can add up the linear momentum and that will tell you how the system as a whole is flying through space in a straight line About that point though everything is also rotating and thats the angular momentumOver time all these different things will collide with each other and all the momentum that is moving perpendicular to the accretion disc plane will start to cancel Furthermore the gravitational effect of all that mass in that accretion disc plane tends to pull things into it From there this matter all starts to compress together into local chunks and you get planets You may get a bunch of matter that happens to not settle down before it gets close together and collapses into a local chunk and you have Neptune the planet in our system that doesnt fall in our accretion disc or some theories say it formed and get ejected from some other place and got captured by our sunAlong comes a meteor and nails a planet hard enough to spew a bit of its molten core into orbit around it and you have the rings of Saturn,1,cdnsbp7,1rhu7r,askscience,hot,3.0,2

chrisbaird,To get to the core of your question which no seems to have addressed yetMany materials cloth paper cement have a microscopic structure which provides multiple reflecting surfaces For instance a solid chunk of ice is mostly transparent but snow is white They are both made out of the same substance but the microscopic structures in the snow flake and not in the ice provide multiple surfaces for light to reflect off of Optical reflection takes place at the interface between one material and another material with different optical properties such as at the surface separating air and ice Creating a microscopic structure scratching up a surface weaving a fabric injecting air bubbles introduces more reflecting surfaces so the incident light has a higher chance of getting reflected rather than transmitted A solid pure chunk of salt is transparent put a pile of table salt granules is white because of all the reflecting surfacesWhich brings us to your question If we get rid of the microscopic structure we can make white material clear again Melt pure white sand down and let it harden as a solid piece of glass or quartz and it will be transparent Melt snow flakes into a homogenous pot of water and it becomes transparent again Another way to optically get rid of microscopic structures is to add water Water behaves optically similar to many materials such as cloth ice glass or snow Pour water on a material with microscopic structures and the water will fill most of the cracks scratches pores holes and bubbles that used to be filled with air Once this happens the material now acts optically like a homogenous slab of material without microstucturing The many reflecting surfaces go away and you are left with a mostly transparent material just by adding water The index of refraction of water does not exactly match that of cloth or paper or cement etc so the effect is not complete The material only becomes more transparent upon getting wet but it not completely transparentAs others have mentioned if there is no light source behind the material a material that has suddenly become more transparent will look darker,7,cdnix8z,1rhuln,askscience,hot,34.0,27

egalitaian,The reason non transparent things become darker when they are wet is because the surface becomes smoother Table tops counters most floors and plenty of other things have no noticeable difference on their brightness when you get them wet but some things are obviously different Thats because their surfaces are rough compared to the things mentioned aboveThe water acts as a layer that helps smooth out this surface and reduces the amount of diffuse reflection that is occuring If you look at it from the correct angle it should become brighter because the reflection is more cohesive From other angles than this one it should like dimmer because the diffuse scattering you would see normally is no longer there,0,cdnsr0i,1rhuln,askscience,hot,1.0,1
nomamsir,The direction of the torque vector is only significant once an arbitrary convention ie the right hand rule has been chosen  Really I think it make more sense to think of toques and angular momenta as defined by a plane plus a direction of circulation than it does a vector However theres a nice property in three dimensions that each plane has exactly one direction perpendicular to it and we can define a directionmagnitude of circulation by specifying a given vector along the direction of that normalFrom this point of view the direction in or out is just a stand in for the direction of circulation of the plane In some ways the plane picture is better however most of the math you would have developed is better at using vectors and since this one to one correspondence between the two exists we can jump back and forth between the twothat was a bit rushed by I hope its clearAs for the second question radians are dimensionless so the units of metersradian are the same as the units of meters  Radians are the ratio between the arclength distance around the circumference and the radius ratios of two things with the same units are dimensionless ,0,cdngftu,1rhwdb,askscience,hot,15.0,15
abowow,the in or out direction comes from the right hand rule which is where you put your right hand on r and then curl your fingers towards the direction of the force so lets say that r is going to the right and the force is upwards then the torque would be out of the page so basically the in our out direction doesnt mean anything all by itself you have to use the right hand rule to break it downi dont really have a good explanation for your second question but i can say this radians are kind of weird because they dont really have a unit the calculation for a radian ends up with a lengthlength so the units cancel out  radian is the angle that is made from an arc length of  radius thats why there are pi radians in a circle because the circumference of a circle is pi,1,cdnfssi,1rhwdb,askscience,hot,3.0,2

Geser,For the planar problem you described a disk in the plane of the page the direction vector specifies the direction of the angular acceleration of that disk Using your right hands thumb to point in the direction of the torque vector your fingers will curl in the direction of the angular acceleration So for a vector out of the page the disk will accelerate counterclockwise Related answer Since r is a distance its units that of distance so meters The units of angular acceleration are radtime  multiplying by a distance will give you rad  distancetime  rad  distance is the arc length circumscribed by the radius r in angle rad So the arc length that is circumscribed by the r in  deg   pi is   pi  r which is the circumference of a circle of radius r ,1,cdnfv97,1rhwdb,askscience,hot,2.0,1
ColinDavies,The information you need for torque is the plane in which it acts or equivalently the normal vector to that plane and whether it is clockwise or counterclockwise  But clockwise with respect to what reference  Using the cross product builds in the point of reference automatically  Instead of having to describe where you are standing and what you mean by clockwise that information is incorporated into the direction of the vector  You just have to choose a convention to say whether clockwise corresponds to the normal or antinormal direction and apply that convention consistently all the time hence the right hand rule  Theres nothing going into or out of the page the direction is just a sort of translation of clockwise or not into positive or negative so you can use it in an equation,0,cdngock,1rhwdb,askscience,hot,1.0,1

ratpoison,Torque is a cross product therefore it needs to be perpendicular to the plane of the vectors that produce it But which way should a cross product point Its point of origin is on the plane but its end point can be on either side of the plane We can choose a plane arbitrarily but because we want our calculations to be consistent with the calculations of others mathematicians have devised the righthand rule which is a common standard everyone can use in order to judge which way is up and which way is downThe fact that torque in the clockwise direction points downward and torque in the counterclockwise direction points up is a mathematical convention We could have been using the left hand rule if we liked We would just have to be consistent with our choiceWe choose the right hand rule because it resembles a screw by applying clockwise torque to the screw it goes down and again by applying CCW torque it goes up So we have defined torques vector to point there just because it was an easy thing,0,cdnh6tt,1rhwdb,askscience,hot,1.0,1
Manhigh,The direction of torque is significant because in many instances you want to know what torque to apply to give an object a certain angular velocity or angular momentumTake a spacecraft for instance  Its tumbling spinning on a certain axis and you want to null out that spin rate  To do so you need to apply torque with thrusters or gyros in the appropriate directionThe direction of the torque vector just tells you whether the applied torque is clockwise or counterclockwise in a given frame of reference,0,cdnjdow,1rhwdb,askscience,hot,1.0,1
etherteeth,The significance of the direction of the torque vector is that it indicates the direction of the torque By an alternate version of the right hand rule if you point your thumb along the vector your fingers curl in the direction or torquerotation That is if the torque vector points out of the page the torque is acting in the counterclockwise direction Any further significance than this comes down to convention As for your second question radians are technically unitless so multiplying angular acceleration by distance gives radsec  m  mradsec which is dimensionally the same as just msec  ,0,cdnlrii,1rhwdb,askscience,hot,1.0,1
chcampb,Torques are to force what rotation is to translation Moment of inertia is to mass what rotation is to translation They are analogous conceptsSo what happens when we try to represent the addition of torques like we add forces This is just vector math So we need a way to represent torque as a vector You have torque in one direction which is represented by a vector in a perpendicular direction and whose sign represents the direction of the torque It turns out that the direction is arbitrary as long as the sign is consistent ,0,cdnqaas,1rhwdb,askscience,hot,1.0,1
drzowie,Torque isnt actually a vector it just looks like one  As a cross product its an antisymmetric tensor a linear combination of two vectors which in three dimensions just happens to have three componentsThe direction of the torque vector is the direction of the axis around which the torque is being applied  Its very important for example that when you step on the gas in your car the torque vector applied to the wheels goes off to the left of the car and that the brakes apply torque that goes off to the right unless youre reversing  The reason torque and rotational pseudovectors in general are confusing is that you have to combine them with a vector to get another vector  For example if ahead is Z and left is X then the displacement from the contact patch of the tire to the axle is in the Y direction  Since the tire spins around the X axis the motion is in the third direction Z  The axis has the nice property that its perpendicular to both of the important directions in the systemIncidentally in D cross products are pseudoscalars since theres only one way to rotate  and in D cross products have six components so theres no clean way to represent them other than as the full antisymmetric tensor  Just draw a x matrix and demand that it be antisymmetric  There are  elements in the diagonal they have to be   That leaves  elements but the symmetry relationship reduces them to  independent numbers,0,cdnypcj,1rhwdb,askscience,hot,1.0,1
BlazeOrangeDeer,Think of the direction as the direction of the axis of rotation So if youre applying torque into the page youre increasing the angular momentum around that direction which means clockwise in the plane of the page For example you can think of the total angular momentum of the Earth as a big arrow along its axis of rotation pointing north so to slow it down youd have to apply a torque pointing south in other words increase the spin around the south pole same as decreasing the spin around the north pole,0,cdo0wav,1rhwdb,askscience,hot,1.0,1

DangerOnion,Assuming an enclosed space with no open windows or anything youd be right  The fan is producing a negligible amount of heat energy through friction but it certainly cant reduce the temperature of the room  He may be conflating the use of fans with the reason we use fans in the summer which is that  moving air makes our skin feel cooler through evaporative cooling but doesnt actually reduce the air temperature or  by circulating fresh outside air into a stuffy building which doesnt apply here  The temperature in one place might rise slower but its not reducing the amount of heat added to the room,0,cdnuz1w,1ri6wl,askscience,hot,1.0,1

gredders,What makes a neutron stick to a protonNeutrons and protons collectively known as nucleons when discussing their role in nuclear physics are bound in the nucleus by the strong nuclear force This interaction is a powerful attractive force which acts over a range of only a few femtometres which is roughly the diameter of a nucleon Beyond that the force quickly drops to zero What determines the number of neutrons and protonsAs you increase the number of protons in a nucleus you increase the repulsive electrostatic Coulomb force due to their positive charge Now this Coulomb force is weaker than the nuclear force but it also acts over a long range That means that as the size of the nucleus increases the strong force saturates while the coulomb repulsion just keeps getting bigger and causes the nucleus to become unstableAdding neutrons however contributes to the strong force but does not increase the coulomb repulsion since the have neutral charge therefore heavier nuclei typically need more neutrons than protons for it to remain stable See on this plot of proton number vs neutron number how the line of stable nuclei tends to bend round to the neutronrich side of the charthttpnuclearpowertrainingtpubcomhvimghvjpgHowever it is obvious that this isnt the whole story since too many neutrons makes a nucleus unstable too This is due to the Pauli exclusion principle which forbids two particles from occupying the same quantum state Protons and neutrons differ by their isospin quantum number and can therefore share the same energy state without violating the exclusion principle Two neutrons or two protons are indistinguishable from each other and cannot share the same energy state Therefore when you add only one kind of nucleon to a nucleus they are forced to stack up more quickly than adding both neutrons and protons which is to say they have to occupy increasingly higher energy states In this case it isnt long until one of the nucleons is forced to occupy a state of higher energy than the binding energy of the nucleus and it cannot form a bound system In reality the situation is more complex than this and is very difficult to model The best so far is the nuclear shell modelhttphyperphysicsphyastrgsueduhbasenuclearshellhtml Nuclear structure is an active area of research and one in which I am doing a PhD and we do not have a complete picture of what goes on inside the nucleus at this point ,3,cdnrwhp,1rivmw,askscience,hot,8.0,5

Platypuskeeper,Well theres no consensus on what atomic radius means in the first place Atoms have a diffuse cloud of electrons around them and its fairly arbitrary where you consider the end of to be Eg the Bohr radius is the most probable radius for the electrons note not the same thing as the most probable location Another possible definition but seldom used would be the radius that encloses a certain percent of the electron density Or you could take half the bond distance when two identical atoms have a single bond the covalent radius Then theres the ionic radius which exists in two different definitions by Shannon and Pauling Or you could use the effective radius as determined from their interactions in the gas phase read the van der Waals gas law which is the vdW radiusNow since noble gases dont bond you cant really use ionic or covalent radii Van der Waals radii work well because noble gases have close to idealgas behavior but the vdW radii for anything is substantially larger than other measures so you cant make a comparison that way But the most concrete measure here would probably be the Bohr radius as its more directly related to the electron density And from that perspective adding electrons does increase repulsion but it doesnt do so by an extra amount when you complete the shell The effect of electronelectron repulsion on the radius is actually pretty small This is illustrated pretty well by comparing hydrogen to helium Hydrogen has a Bohr radius of  Bohr Since helium has twice the charge it would have exactly half of that  if the electrons didnt repel each other at all The actual radial densityhttpwwwrscorgejCPbkbkfgif upper curve has its peak only a slight above that In fact its hard to tell the difference in the radial density distribution between reality and the situation where they dont repel at allhttpwikichemeddlorgmediawikiimagesHandHeorbitalsgif leftmost curve squashed a bit by a different horizontal scaleThis is not as dramatic for heavier elements where the relative increase in nuclear charge isnt as large but it still tends to outweigh the increased ee repulsion By just about any measure related to the electron density the noble gases will have a radius somewhat smaller than the preceding halogenThe exception to this and perhaps the reason why some people think the radius is bigger is the van der Waals radius which for noble gases is indeed larger than for the preceding halogen But this goes to how the vdW radius is defined by the effective interactions its more a result of noble gases having much less mutual attraction than any other atoms ,0,cdo18bs,1rji79,askscience,hot,4.0,4

duckdoodoo,So the important thing to know here is that the thyroid gland produces hormones which regulate metabolism in the body The vital thing about these hormones is that they contain lots of iodine When we take iodine up into the body it concentrates in the thyroid gland because this is where the majority of iodine is used in the bodyRadioactive iodine will concentrate in the thyroid gland but will not concentrate anywhere else sparing the rest of the body from damageOnce the radioactive iodine concentrates in the thyroid gland it releases beta radiation within the gland which attacks cells within a small radius Only cells within the thyroid gland are killed because beta radiation cannot penetrate through our tissues well enough to damage any neighbouring structures It also releases some gamma radiation tooRadiation kills cells by damaging the DNA molecules If enough of the DNA is damaged the cell will no longer be able to function and will dieI hope this helps,0,cdox42g,1rjsmy,askscience,hot,1.0,1

iCookBaconShirtless,The problem with addressing this question is that there is no natural and intrinsic way to decide whether a nonzero number is close to zero or far from zero  The constants you listed are closer to zero than  but further from zero than    Who is to say where we should place to cutoff between numbers that are close to or far from from zeroThey may strike you as being close to zero but this is a question of psychology not mathematics  Perhaps we deal with numbers that are further from zero than pi more often than numbers that are closer to zero than pi so pi seems close to zeroIll add that the precise values of those constants might not be as fundamental as you think  The ratio of the surface area to the diameter of a sphere in n dimensions for example is only pi when n  However it can be written in terms of pi for other dimensions  In fact many people argue that taupi should be thought of as more fundamental than pi  I personally believe that any rational multiple of pi is equally fundamental whatever that means  We just settled on one of them out of convenience and for historical reasonsAs for your second question the reason that small primes are denser than large primes is fairly well understood  See the prime number theoremhttpenwikipediaorgwikiPrimenumbertheoremEdit Think about it this way OP is intrigued that so many constants are smaller than  in magnitude But any finite list of numbers has an upper bound  The list given by OP happens to have  as an upper bound  So what is so surprising about  versus some other upper bound Its tempting to answer that a number smaller than  is unlikely to occur if you uniformly draw a random positive number But there is actually no mathematical way to make sense of drawing a real number uniformly The lack of scale is the real culprit You cannot claim that a number is intrinsically large or small in any meaningful way without choosing something to compare that number toEDIT  To anyone who still thinks that the list of constants given by OP or any other finite list of numbers is intrinsically small in magnitude please provide a list of number that you think is not small in magnitudeI am spending a lot of time responding to commenters that might be glossing over some subtleties of my argument  If you wish to debate my comment please first answer the question I posed in EDIT   I think the doomed effort to answer this question will reveal some of the subtleties of the point I am makingEDIT  I am in no way trying to discredit OPs question  I agree with OP that the fact that so many named constants are less than  is surprising in a psychological sense  But I contend that there is no way to answer the question of whether it is surprising mathematically  The reasons for this are actually a bit more subtle than they first appear  The problem is that every finite list of numbers has an upper bound  So how surprising is it that there are upper bounds on OPs list that are less than   Answering this would require defining some sense of a probability distribution on the positive real numbers  But every probability distribution on the positive real numbers artificially imposes a scale because there is no uniform distribution on the positive reals  So you can only really ask whether a list of numbers is surprisingly close to zero with respect to some arbitrarily chosen scale ,508,cdooolp,1rlfdu,askscience,hot,1622.0,1114
Vietoris,I will try to give a different point of view on this question It will be more geometrical and not exactly answering the question but that might still give some insightI will talk about Constructible numbershttpenwikipediaorgwikiConstructiblenumber The principle is the following You start with the two points at distance  on a plane and you have a compass and a straightedge At each step of the process you will get new points as follows Imagine you are at step n and you have already constructed N points You draw all possible lines passing through two of your N points  You also draw all the circles centered at one of your N points with a radius equal to the distance between two of your N points You mark all the intersections created between lines circles or both and add all these points to your list of N points For convenience I will see the points in the plane as complex numbers A number is constructible if it can be obtained by this process Lets give the first examples   From the first two points  and  I can draw the line passing though these two points the two circles of radius  centered on  and  respectively This gives me  new points     eipi  eipi From this new set of six points I can draw  different lines And I have four possible radius for my circles sqrt and  possible centers which gives me more or less  new circles So I get more than  new points see the picturehttpimgurcombEdlfG  And so on  the number of points explodes very quicklyOk what was the point of all this  Well it is interesting to note that all the nonzero numbers we can construct in  steps all have norm between  and  And more importantly most like  may be I didnt compute it have norm between  and  see the picturehttpimgurcombEdlfG When I go on with the steps I see that there is always a lower bound and an upper bound obvious and that most of the numbers have norm between  and  less obvious but its because when you draw all the circles around your existing points most of them will stay in the same range Now that we understand that what next  Well suppose we could see the property of being interesting as a random occurence among numbers this is my hypothesis I am not exactly proving that this means anything And to construct interesting numbers we have to do a certain number of steps Equivalently I construct all possible points in n steps and pick randomly some of them  to say that they are interesting With the arguments above this would prove that  a majority I have no idea how to exactly compute it of the interesting numbers constructible in n steps lie in a rather restricted range between  and   a few will be larger or smaller than that   And no interesting number constructible in n steps will have norm smaller than n or be bigger than n because no  number constructible in n steps can be that biggt Tl DR  If I randomly pick numbers that could be defined in a certain number of steps then most of the numbers I picked will be in the    rangeNow back to mathematical constant How are they defined  Well we have to do several steps Much more complicated steps than for constructible numbers but still a certain number of steps I could look at the numbers that can be defined in a certain number of words to get an idea even if this definition is problematicSo I would guess and this is wishful thinking that the principle stay the same Of all the numbers that can be defined in a certain number of steps most of them should in the zone around  and  So the same should be true for interesting numbers Thank you for your attention I hope this was not too confusingEDIT  I changed the phrasing of the sentence defining constructible numbers,42,cdolc72,1rlfdu,askscience,hot,195.0,153

turtle,Most people on this thread refer to an arbitrary definition of close as an explanation for OPs question but I find this unsatisfying From a mathematical perspective while the real numbers are uncountable and so closeness is somewhat arbitrary it doesnt address the fact that  for example is a value that explains how much longer one line is than another These numbers express a relative scaling between two things and so rescaling these values to a different number system would only change our impression of them not the absolute ratio For the constants that you mentioned I suspect their small values result from our tendency to compare things on the same order of magnitude It would be ridiculous for example for us to compare area of a circle to a millionth of its diameter This would in fact change our fundamental value for pi but it would make no sense So we choose to compare things that we can relate to each other visually or conceptually  a circles area to the line that bisects it for example,0,cdoxczg,1rlfdu,askscience,hot,2.0,2

CuriousMetaphor,The number line is a way to graph the real numbers while highlighting their properties as a field with the operation of addition  It goes from negative infinity to positive infinity   is the additive identity so it is in the middle  Each number and its additive inverse are equal distances from But there are other ways to do it  You could graph the positive real numbers while emphasizing their properties as a field with the operation of multiplication  This alternate number line would go from  to infinity  The number  being the multiplicative identity would be in the middle and each number and its multiplicative inverse would be equal distances from Neither of these number lines is more correct than the other  They are both graphical representations of an abstract conceptIf graphed on the second number line all the constants you mention are on the right side so are closer to infinity than they are to Usually there is some latitude when choosing a mathematical constant  The constants you mentioned could all be replaced by their multiplicative inverses without becoming less fundamental  For example  is the ratio between a circles circumference and its diameter but  is the ratio between a circles diameter and its circumference  The reason we choose numbers greater than  rather than numbers less than  as constants probably has to do with the fact that most of the numbers we are most familiar with the natural numbers are greater than   Also positive numbers are easier to work with than negative numbersAnother point close doesnt mean anything unless you are comparing it to something else  Number lines are onedimensional objects and so they look exactly the same when zoomed in or out  If you draw an additive number line with tick marks every  units then yes those constants seem close to   But if you draw the same number line with tick marks every  units those constants suddenly seem very far from   There are equal numbers of real numbers in any two segments of the number line  You can draw a onetoone correspondence between them  For example there are exactly the same number of real numbers between  and  as there are between  and infinity,1,cdoosdu,1rlfdu,askscience,hot,2.0,1

SquirrelSoul,I assume you are referring to the fact that birdsreptiles and amphibians expel fecal matter and urine through a single opening  the cloaca while mammals with the exception of the monotremes and some marsupials have separate openings Interestingly the cloaca is also used for fertilization during sexual reproduction in most birdsIn biology we distinguish between elimination which is for substances that never cross a membrane and are expelled as feces and excretion which is for substances that do cross a membrane and are expelled as a nitrogenous waste such as urineReptiles which includes birds actually do have an excretory system They have kidneys which direct uric acid to the intestinal tract via ureters That waste then exits through the cloaca along with the feces  so effectively reptiles practice elimination and excretion simultaneouslyWhy do they do this instead of the way we do it Essentially the answer is evolution Mutations for the creation of two exits occurred by chance in mammals were passed on to offspring and were selected for The cloaca still worked just fine for birds and reptiles though so it wouldnt disappear entirely,2,cdp5cr4,1rmyt8,askscience,hot,5.0,3

gababa,Ok  I hope this isnt too much I kinda got carried away with this answer but I just cant stop myself when Im writing about math PFirst I would like to point out that infinity is not a number it is a concept used in math to describe mathematical objects that are ascending without an upper limit For example the following series of numbers   is ascending and it has no upper limit because for any number you may choose lets say m i can find one in this series that is bigger lets say m rounded up   and as such it is defined that its limit is infinityNotice now that properties you listed of infinity are actually derived from its definition For example it is not changed because of multiplication by a finite numbers because if you take the series from before   and divide each number by a finite number lets call it r it still holds that for any numberm you can through at me I can still find a number in the series that is bigger now its m rounded up   divided by r and as such the limit remains the same And because this is true for any such mathematical object with no upper limit we say that infinity divided by any number remains infinityNow although infinity is not a number it has an intuitive concept for humans as something very very large and this intuitive concept is on par with the mathematical definition for example  The universe is infinite because no matter how far you go you can still go farther Just like in the series where for any number you choose you can find a bigger one in the seriesTo proceed let us explore now what inf actually means If we take our example of the ever ascending series   we said that its limit is infinity so inf is what limits the series      This series is limited by  because for any number you can give me be it close to zero as youd like by going down the series I can find a number in this series that is closer to zero Notice how inf isnt actually zero this thing we just calculated is not nothing at all and it is not exactly a number Just like infinity we calculated a concept of something very very small this is called an infinitesimalhttpenwikipediaorgwikiInfinitesimal Or at least its close enough It is the concept of something so small it can not be measured so small that no matter what number you give me it is always smaller but still not nothing And this infinitesimal displays some of the same properties infinity does because they are the same kind of concept and are mathematically defined similarly,0,cdpg8yw,1rn3pg,askscience,hot,3.0,3

NotFreeAdvice,The answer has to do with the idea of bubble nucleationSo it turns out that the release of carbonation ie the bubbles is thermodynamcally favorable  This means that the CO would like to exit as bubbles  There is just one problem to get a bubble you must first form a bubble  The start of bubble formation what we call nucleation is not thermodyanmically favorableThe reason is entropic  There is much more ordering at the surface of a bubble than inside the bulk bubble or the bulk water  This presents a barrier to bubble formation that is related to the surface area of the bubbleAt the same time there is a enthalpic reason to form bubbles and this related to the volume of the bubble The end result is this when the bubbles are quite small the effects from the surface area of the bubble dominate the effects from the bulk of the bubble  And the bubble will not form  or forms very slowly  Once a bubble forms then it will grow more easily  So the bottleneck if you will is the initial formation of the bubble  By shaking the beverage you introduce a bunch of gas bubbles into the beverage and this provides sites for bubble growth  and an increase in released carbonation  Essentially you are providing the mean by which to skip the slow nucleation stepHope that makes sense,0,cdppqxy,1rofgc,askscience,hot,2.0,2

gingerkid,I dont know if that shape has a name  However shapes whose volume formula is unknown can have it calculated by integrating over the volume of the shape  All thats required is knowing equations that describe the boundaries of that shape  Its worth mentioning that this is how the volume equations of shapes youre familiar with are generally derived  The following may be a bit confusing if you dont know calculus  In case you dont the basic principle of integrating a function is that you add the infinitesimally small heights under a curve to get an area or the areas under a curve to get a volumeIll use the xy plane for the cross section with the flat surface along x and z for the length dimension of the shape and assume that the rate of flattening is linear and that it tapers to a point  The easiest way to integrate it it seems to me is to break it up into triangles in the yz plane and integrate along zIll use r as the radius at the unsquished end and L as the length  Ill also put the center of the unsquished crosssection at the origin  Now on the xy plane a y coordinate along the boundary can be expressed as ysqrtr  x   If the squishing of the shape is linear the yz sections will be triangles with height   sqrtr  x  and length L  The area of each will be L  sqrtr  x   A brief sanity check shows that the areas are  at xr where the height tapers from zero to zeroBy integrating these areas along x the volume can be determined  The integral in question is the integral of L  sqrtr  x  with respect to x as x goes from r to r which is equal to VThis integral isnt terribly easy to solve but theres a way around actually doing it out  By inspection sqrtr  x is just the y coordinate of a circle  The integral of this from r to r should just be the area of a semicircle pi  r   And plugging the definite integral into wolframalpha it isPlugging that back in and cancelling the  V    L  pi  r or half the area of a cylinder  And intuitively that makes senseeach crosssection of it is a triangle with the same base and height as full rectangle  And that shape made of rectangles is a cylinder  So the volume will be half thatAn important practical note is that squishing a reallife cylinder will result in something significantly different because just squishing the end wont produce a constant taper throughout the cylindertldr it can be determined by summing all the arbitrarily thin crosssectional volumes of the shape each of which is an area times an arbitrarily small increment in the direction were slicing  By doing out this calculus the area is A    L  pi  r  or half the volume of a cylinder  This makes sense when you think about how a cylinder and this shape differ,36,cdpdfg9,1rokpj,askscience,hot,176.0,140

ElDentistador,So far all the other comments are spot on  The cells that form the enamel and dentin in teeth are ameleoblasts and odontoblasts respectively  The ameleoblasts work from the DEJ out while the odontoblasts work from the DEJ in  The cell bodies of the odontoblasts are mostly at the edge of the pulp only extending processes through tubules within the dentin and your ameleoblasts are long gone once they finish forming the enamel This leaves enamel and dentin without any significant intrinsic method of healing and your immune system has no access to these two tissues either as they are avascularBy the time your immune system gets to see the infection the bacteria have breached the pulp chamber Much like the brain pulpal tissue  cannot handle inflammation well since its completely encased by hard tissue  Your own inflammatory response increases the intrapulpal pressure dramatically and it hurts  The pulpal tissue will necrose and the bacteria now have an easy path through the canals to the periapical tissues which can lead to more serious infections like cellulitis and osteomyelitis  There have actually been cases where odontogenic infections have led to fatalities which should never happen  The most famous case is Deamonte Driver ,1,cdpgs6c,1ronxr,askscience,hot,13.0,12

DanielSank,This excellent question is at the root of many other questions that show up on raskscienceThere are aspects of this question that nobody really understands yet However we understand a lot more than popular science and even some physicists will lead you to believe This will be a somewhat long post but possibly worth your time to readBefore I say anything else I want to say that your statementgt How does it know it was observed By its interaction with surrounding particles of courseis absolutely essential I hope to explain why belowStructure of physical theoryAny theory of physics has two parts  The first part is a representation of the natural system under consideration For example if you are making a theory of balls rolling down hills you represent each ball with three numbers xyz indicating the balls position in space You may also have Vx Vy Vz representing its velocity in all three directions  The second part is some way of predicting how this representation changes as time goes by  For the case of rolling balls this could just be Newtons laws of motionhttpenwikipediaorgwikiNewtonslawsofmotionIn classical physics these two parts were all we needed to go happily about our scientific lives However theres actually a crucially important third part  We have to have a prescription for how the representation put forth in part  relates to our personalhumancognitive observations of the natural system In other words what does a group of numbers xyz have to do with my observation of the systemIn the case of rolling balls this is pretty simple I might use Newtons laws to compute that my ball should be at position meter  meters  meters at time minutesand we all just know that this means that we should see a ball at the specified location and time This works just fine and indeed in classical mechanics the link between part  and  is usually pretty straightforward Note that we never mentioned anything about what we meant by see a ball because in classical physics we implicitly assume that it doesnt matter In quantum mechanics it does matter and Ill now try to explain whyQuantum mechanicsThe first two parts of quantum mechanics are   We represent the natural world with a wave functionhttpenwikipediaorgwikiWavefunction or state vectorhttpenwikipediaorgwikiQuantumstate  The wave function evolves according to Schrodingers equationhttpenwikipediaorgwikiSchrCBdingerequation or Heisenbergs equationhttpenwikipediaorgwikiHeisenbergpictureThese two together are just as good as xyz coordinates and Newtons laws The place where everyone gets confused is in what the wave function means in terms of what we observe in experiments To answer this question you hear people say things like when you make a measurement the wave function collapses into a definite position chosen at random and thats what you see The crucial thing to understand is that this statement modifies part  It says that Schrodingers equation determines the evolution until some vaguely defined observation happens at which time Schrodingers equation stops being correct the state collapses probabilistically and then Schrodingers equation goes back into effect This breaks the theorys selfconsistency Suppose I make a measurement and say that the atoms state collapsed Now suppose that me and my experiment are in a box which is actually the experiment of some greater alien For the theory to be true for the alien there cant be any state collapse until he does the observation Thus we see that state collapse as stated above cant workThe issue is that as stated above state collapse modifies part  of the theory whereas we should have been looking for a part  type statement It turns out that if we leave part  alone and make an extra statement like this  When a humans brain collects information about a physical system that information will be randomly distributed according to the square of the wave function and that system will henceforth appear to have collapsed in accordance with the result of the humans informationthen we have a selfconsistent theory I emphasize that it is both falsifiable and selfconsistent and therefore must be admissible as a theory of Nature That said its not very satisfying because of this bizarrely anthropocentric rule  which seems much more weird than the sort of obvious equivalent rule  in classical physics DecoherenceAmazingly we can almost get the quantum rule  to be as obvious as the classical one The trick is to really consider what happens when we make measurements In fact whenever you measure something you are connecting that thing to many extra physical elements If I measure the position of an atom with a CCD camera I am coupling the wave function of the atom to an enormous number of electrons etc in the cameras inner workings Certainly I do not know the wave functions of all those electrons This is the crux of the entire story It turns out that if you actually compute what happens to the wave function of the atom in the case that it couples to a bunch of extra stuff whose wave functions you dont know then from your perspective the wave function of the atom becomes a classical probability distribution I emphasize that this comes about entirely from Schrodingers equation and nothing else From the perspective in which the wave functions of the electrons are known the atoms wave function does not collapse Therefore collapse can be understood as an apparent phenomenon predicted by pure quantum mechanics that shows up with only part of the information in a systems wave function is available This is always the applicable case for humans because our measurement apparatuses contain many uncontrollable degrees of freedomWhen the wave function appears to have collapsed for one observer it may not appear that way for another one who has more informationThis is really interesting because it gets us really really close to being able to explain rule  via rule  We know that when only some information of a system is available that information appears probabilistic What we havent explained is why humans see only one of those possible results Nobody knows the answer to thatAnswer to the original questionSo how does a particle know when it has definite position It doesnt It never does Definite position is just an apparent property of things that comes up when we dont have complete information about the systemConclusionWe have a selfconsistent theory of quantum mechanics using wave functions and Schrodingers equation Part of the theory is the statement that when humans have access to the prabability distributions furnished by partial access to a complete system wave function they perceive one particular value for some reason that we dont know For the physicists out there Id say more generally equations of motion are constraints on how the representation at one point in spacetime is related to the representation at other points in spacetime However I challenge anyone to state a truly selfconsistent theory of physics without such a ruleEDIT For down voters If you could express what you think is unscientific wrong or irrelevant

DanielSank,Since my other post was so longgt If none of the particles around it have definite positions either how does any particle in the universe know for sure that it was observedThey dont Particles dont do anything special when theyre observed We can propose a selfconsistent theory of quantum mechanics in which the wave functions dont actually collapse and take on a definite position The appearance of definite position only happens for in cases where only subsets of the systems information is available which happens to be the case relevant when humans are involved From the perspective of someone with fuller information about the system the collapse that you see may not happenThe falsifiability of this theory described more fully in my other post is definitely open for discussion Id love to have that discussion with anyone else whos interested,0,cdppng9,1rpid6,askscience,hot,5.0,5

FromAshesRize,The answer is sort of You can not create an extremely small flame from a source such as a traditional candle But there is a way to create micro flames  This is called microcombustion and they are flames smaller than the width of a millimeter  They are typically made in small hard ceramic combustors such as alumina oxide and they burn at temperatures of up to  C The combustors have small channels through which the fuel flows and the flame burns They are typically fueled by hydrocarbons and oxygen Methane butane propane etcThe two inlet flows of the fuels meet and combine at some point and then you have your combustible gas The point at which the two flows meet exhibits turbulent flow and this is the limiting factor at ignition for the combustor due to wall conditions and fluid dynamics not worth explaining here Turbulent flow tends towards extinction for a flame Typically a large candle type flame will be seen at the end of the exhaust channelAs the combustor ramps up to its max temp steady state the walls of the exhaust channel heat up and begin to provide the thermal energy necessary for the gases within the channel to ignite You will hear loud pops as ignition events begin to occur within the channel As the temperature of the wall increases due to the heat seen from the exhaust flame the ignition events begin occurring closer to the mixing points of the  fuelsFinally at steady state the walls of the combustor at the mixing point of the fuels is so hot that the gases ignite immediately upon mixing Due to the turbulent nature of the flow they go out almost immediately  They are also almost immediately replaced by fresh uncombusted fuel which them ignites This cycle repeats itself many times per second and you end up with a sustained micro flame The ratio of gases determines how many times per second ignition occurs and you can actually say that the flame has a frequency Ie You can hear the flame buzz while it is litSo in short yes micro flames are possible just not from a candleTldrTeeny candles dont work Burn hydrocarbons in a ceramic combustor for super hot buzzing micro flames Science is awesome,106,cdplrw5,1rpive,askscience,hot,596.0,490

dizekat,If we are speaking of a steady hot flame in the air at room temperature and atmospheric pressure there is a limit because the energy loss at a given temperature would be proportional to the surface area size squared while the output power is proportional to the volume Consequently very small flames lose more heat at the combustion temperature than they produce Unless of course you use a gas mix that combusts at a very low temperature in which case the flame could be arbitrarily small but it will be cold and it is not clear if you should call that a flame Personally the smallest actual inair flame that I have seen was smaller than  mm at the end of a hypodermic needle feed oxygen and hydrogen mixture You can probably go somewhat smaller with hydrocarbons and oxygen eg acetylene and oxygen Maybe smaller still with chlorine trifluoride or something similar as an oxidizer but it would be difficult to make a nozzle that can withstand itIt should be possible to make a smaller flame at higher temperature or in a less thermally conductive environment than air,0,cdpqfsu,1rpive,askscience,hot,12.0,12

rocketgolfer,The answer to this is that air has viscosity One of the simplest explanations for how wings generate lift is that they are magical air deflectors In other words wings are able to generate lift because they can change the direction of the airflow and take advantage of momentum conservation For an ideal fluid there is no viscosity and the notion that maximum lift would occur at a higher angle of attack would be correct though there is still debate over whether any lift at all is possible in the absence of viscosity but this is beyond the scope of this discussion Unfortuately air is not ideal and the viscous stresses both laminar and turbulent resist the ability of the pressure field to turn the flow and generate the lift When the air is no longer able to turn along the surface of the wing the flow separates and decreases the lift ie its not turned as much as it could be At some point typically in the angle of attack range you describe the increase in lift due to increasing angle of attack the ideal flow behavior is exactly canceled by the decrease due to flow separation the viscous behavior Further increases in angle of attack tend to cause viscosity to win out even more decreasing the liftSource Im a soontobe PhD aerodynamicist currently holding an MS at a major research university,0,cdpzrle,1rq4wf,askscience,hot,5.0,5

Platypuskeeper,Two atoms or more that are bound to each other can vibrate back and forth because of the chemical bond which is due to the energy and motion of the electrons The two nuclei have an equilibrium point which minimizes the electronic energy so pushing them farther together or pulling them apart from that position will result in a restoring force pulling the nuclei back They act a bit like two balls connected by a spring where the nuclei are the balls and the electrons are what make up the spring If you pull hard enough the spring chemical bond will break thoughTo give a simplified rationale for why this is you can imagine that a chemical bond is a situation where you have electrons spending time between the nuclei of the atoms By pulling the nuclei apart the electrons will be farther away from one or both of the positivelycharged nuclei which increases their potential energy But if you push the atoms too closely together the electrical repulsion between the two nuclei increase From this perspective its a classical and not a quantum mechanical thing even if the electrons behavior giving rise to bonding is quantummechanical Quantum mechanics does manifest itself in how the vibrations work though First in the fact that the atoms can only vibrate with certain specific frequencies and second in that the lowestenergy state is not entirely stationary Theyre always vibrating at least a little bit while a pair of classical balls with a spring have no problems being stationary A single atom cant vibrate any more than a single hand cant clap an object in motion will remain in motion an atom cant spontaneously reverse its direction There needs to be two atoms attracting each other read chemically bonded In fact the technical definitionhttpgoldbookiupacorgMhtml of what constitutes a molecule is that two or more atoms attract strongly enough to be able to vibrateWhen it comes to heat all forms of energy in the system are actually included  such as the translational linear motion and rotational kinetic energy of the molecules in addition to the vibrational energy The electronic energy and other things can be included as well but at temperatures around room temperature more or less all the thermal energy is bound up in the kinetic energy and for atoms in solids which cannot rotate or fly off all the kinetic energy is bound up in the vibrations Which is why one often encounters a bit oversimplified statements saying heat is the vibrational motion of atoms ,0,cdptid6,1rq9vh,askscience,hot,4.0,4
Ursusmisanthropicus,While not necessarily a cause individuals with PTSD seem to show a reduced amount of GABA in the insula  sourcehttponlinelibrarywileycomdoidaabstractjsessionidFEAEEDECCDDFBDEft The insula among many other things is used heavily in emotional responses and is associated with a wide array of disgust reactions both to real sensory input sight smell etc as well as imagined events  sourcehttpwwwcellcomneuronretrievepiiS and sourcehttpwwwplosoneorgarticleinfoAdoiFFjournalponeSo how does it matterIf youve ever imbibed with alcohol youre probably well aware of GABAs role as neurological depressant It slows things down When you have a higherthannormal release or availability of GABA it makes it generally harder for neurons to fire and communicate slowing down processes GABA is the depressant counterpart to glutamate which is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain If there were no GABA the brain would essentially die from excitotoxicity overfiring of neurons death via electricity So given a reduced presence or function of GABA in the insula you might expect to see less suppression of the emotionaldisgust response that the region is known for This could result in disgustfear being triggered in situations that probably might not be triggered in a normally functioning person especially given the past history of traumatic events As for why some people get PTSD and others do not the verdict is still out There appears to be a genetic component and twin studies have shown if one twin gets PTSD after a traumatic event then their twin is also at an increased risk for getting PTSD after a traumatic event Genetic factors may account for  of PTSD heritability  sourcehttpwwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed,0,cdq10g6,1rq9wj,askscience,hot,2.0,2

joca,There is only one way to absorb light That is for a molecule to absorb the energy and for one of its energy levels to increaseTo deal with all wavelengths of light not just visible light which already has an answer one must examine all energy systems of the moleculeThere are three main energy systems that are a molecule can absorb with Vibrational energy rotational energy and electronic energy The rotational energy of a molecule can be increased by specific increments which are calculable and the size of the increments depends mainly on the mass and the radius of the molecule in question These energy levels tend to be very closely spaced and do not take very much energy to jump from one level to the next These are generally probed at the far IR wavelengthsVibrational energy levels depend on the strength of the bond and the masses of the atoms Again there is not a continous spectrum of allowed states So the difference in energy of the allowed states is measureable These are probed in the near IR In organic chemistry IR is useful for determining functional groups such as aromatics or carbonyls as they have a characteristic absorbanceElectronic energy levels are more largely spaced and have to be probed in the visible or UV spectrum Molecules usually only absorb in this area if they are either a transition metal complex or are a conjugated pi system Drawing molecular orbitals isnt an easy process to explain but the general idea is the same as the previous systems There are only a limited number of allowed states and the difference between these states is what is being probed A key difference is that with the previous examples a more obvious property was changing Either the molecule spun faster or vibrated faster Easy enough to imagine With electronic absorbance it is the promotion of an electron from one orbital to another that causes the absorbanceNo proper molecule salts and metals can absorbs past the near UV range This would corresond still to an electronic absorption however the larger HOMOLUMO gaps are associated with moving an electron into an antibonding orbital and so in the far UV to xray and beyond the tendancy is for molecules to just simply break apart or ionize,0,cdq24y8,1rqd7b,askscience,hot,1.0,1
OnceReturned,A comprehensive answer to that question would have many components but in animals there are a few dominant factorsDNA  Cell division is not perfect and DNA damage occurs naturally due to environmental factors and normal cellular processes  Genomic robustness and DNA repair capacity is a huge factor in lifespan determination  DNA damage is generally considered the leading cause of aging  Species with more robust genomes and better DNA repair mechanisms tend to have greater lifespansPhysical fragility  There are many potentially fatal events which individuals have some probability of experiencing in any given time period  These include things like harsh environmental conditions ie a bad winter infectious diseases and encounters with predators  Every organism has some set of such events which are likely to be fatal and which occur with some probably such that the more time passes the more likely the organism is to have been exposed to such an event  The more sensitive an organism is to these things the shorter its lifespan is expected to be  For example small animals are particularly susceptible to predation so the odds that they have a fatal encounter with a predator in any time period are higher than the those same odds for larger animals that are higher on the food chain  Biological wear and tear  Tissue and organs get worn out through use  Small animals generally have higher metabolisms which amounts to something similar to more friction or wear and tear on all of their systems ie more heartbeats per minute  So they dont typically live as long as typical larger creatures with slower metabolisms Generally larger animals live longer  Dogs are something of an exception  Its not exactly clear why large dogs dont live as long but it likely has something to do with the fact that domesticated dogs are highly inbred  This means they have genetic risk factors that are much less common in wild animals  This manifests in a variety of ways  For example large dogs are more likely to get cancer and this is likely because they simply grow more cells throughout their lives,0,cdptcay,1rqeob,askscience,hot,2.0,2
