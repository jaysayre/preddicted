freedofcelestialhell,This was actually answered in the controversial book  Shades of Grey The clitoris is actually much bigger than the head that sticks out under the hood between the labia The bladder when full can be touching the part of the clitoris that is farther back in the body You can actually have stronger orgasms by not using the restroom before you engage in sexual activity for the same reason stimulation of more of the clitorisAs for your boyfriend hes basically right The prostate has a lot of nerve endings and the moving past of the excrement can rub against it giving a feeling of pleasurearousalFor more answers I suggest two youtube channels sexplanations with Dr Doe and sex with Laci Green The first is much more medically focused while the latter incorporates psychology and more practical advice,0,cdnsxlu,1rj3zd,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2

TheEditor,To expand on what usqueevey said a littleBroadly speaking  When fluid flows through a pipe or straw in this case the driving force is a pressure difference between one end and another from high pressure to low pressureWhen liquid is flowing vertically upwards the pressure difference between the two ends of the pipe high pressure at the bottom low pressure at the top has to work against the weight of the liquid in the pipe itself Thus for taller pipes the water flows more slowlyWhen you suck liquid up a straw you create a low pressure zone in your mouth The glass itself is open to the air so the pressure on the fluid there is atmospheric pressurehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiAtmosphericpressureThe problem is that atmospheric pressure isnt all that high for a high pressure zone and the very minimum pressure achievable is absolute  ak perfect vacuum The difference in pressure between atmospheric and a perfect vacuum is only enough to draw water up  feet Unless you supply more pressure at the base that is,0,cdns52a,1rj4n5,explainlikeimfive,new,4,4
squeevey,When you are sucking fluid up a straw its not actually you sucking UP the fluid but sucking out the air  The fluid goes up the straw because the outside air is pushing down on the fluid in the container Now if you have a ft straw there is only enough outside airpressure to push the liquid up the straw before the liquid is too heavy to go any higher  It will almost make it to your mouth  Edit im not sure if it is ft or ft Just going by the numbers you stated ,0,cdnrln6,1rj4n5,explainlikeimfive,new,3,3
robbak,It is possible to suck water up higher than  feet Trees do it all the time What you need is a very fine smooth tube that has never been empty This prevents the water from boiling even when the pressure goes negative Water is evaporated from the pores but the holes are so small that surface tension doesnt break maintaining several atmospheres of negative pressure This pulls water up to replace it over  meters  feet in the tallest treesNothing mysterious about negative pressures In solids it is just called tension If a liquid doesnt flash vaporize then it can be under tension too,0,cdnti31,1rj4n5,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1

jimktrains,A linux distribution is a linux kernel the lowest part of the operating system for lack of a better term along with lots of programs called the user land  Since the kernel is the same the same programs can run although any libraries the program uses need to be present as wellIn your specific example if you have a linux binary you need to make sure youre running on the same processor architecture and that all the same versions of all of the libraries are availableAs for hardware yes some distros support some hardware better than others but that has more to do with the things that people include in the distro the userland and no so much it being linux,0,cdnsz32,1rj5w5,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2

AyCarrumba,Stereoscopic vision is only one component of how we perceive depth and not even aparticularly good one Because our eyes are closely spaced its only really good for close depth perception Combined with convergence How much our eyes have to look towards one another to focus on a close object these binocular methods of depth perception are really only effective out to about  metresMonocular methods of depth perception that dont depend on having two eyes include Parallax  things move relative to one another as out point of view changes Relative size  smaller things are further away example in a field of cows Familiar size  Ships are big dogs are middle sized insects are small We know this Perspective Line converge to a point which indicates the size of an object Occlusion If one object passes in front of another blocking our vision of it we have perception of their relative size and so distance Defocus Blur As our point of focus shifts different depths are resolved in and out of focus by the eye This gives important depth information Distance to horizon In a natural landscape the closer something is to the horizontal horizon the further it is away This is a function of our elevation above ground levelThere are moreSo as you can see our depth perception is NOT limited to stereoscopic vision We use many subtle effects to judge depth One of the reasons D cinema can be nauseating or confusing is because it uses simple binocular effects to brute force our perception of D which is uncomfortable when other queues are  misplaced in the footage were viewing,5,cdnvtoc,1rj7gx,explainlikeimfive,new,29,24
nosessequasinanos,You cant really but your mind is interpreting distance based on its experience of the surroundings and the objects you see For example when you see a car you have a pretty good idea of how big a car is so your mind can estimate how far away it must be If you see something new or something without a standard size like a ball however your mind will have a harder time,6,cdnsbg5,1rj7gx,explainlikeimfive,new,12,6
robbak,We have many ways of judging depth The main one for relatively close things is the difference between both eyes But we also get cues from how much our eyes have to focus from perspective  that is the way distant things are smaller than near things and the way dust and smoke change the color of distant objects,0,cdnsebp,1rj7gx,explainlikeimfive,new,3,3
Rakaicius,Ill take a crack at this one  The brain uses several different cues for judging distance some of which only require one eye   if object A is partially covered by object B our brain assumes B is closer than A   the more detailed we see something the closer we think it is  This is why studies have shown people tend to underestimate distances in foggy conditions our brains already have an idea of the size of familiar objects due to past experiences   objects closer to the horizon appear bigger because we assume it is closer to the ground   Next time you see a lowhanging moon that looks big curl your hand into a very loose fist and look through it you should notice the moon now looks smaller  The brain will use these cues to give you an idea of the relative distance of an object but its not a perfect system  If you ever try to play a sport with one eye closed youll notice a huge difference  Nothing beats having two perspectives to compare differences  For an interesting example of using two perspectives check out how Napoleon was so accurate with his cannons  ,0,cdnvwax,1rj7gx,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1
xvyion,The comments here thus far are pretty good but I wanted to clarify a bit with a few links  Im a graduate student in computer engineering  I work tangentially with computer vision so I can speak from that perspectiveujustanaprilfool is correct that we can perceive distance with motion  It is called optic flow httpenwikipediaorgwikiOpticalflow which is where you determine distance based on how stationary objects move in your field of vision when you change perspective  For the ELI part pigeons do this when you corner them  They will bob their heads around while they watch you to get a better idea of how far away you are  The amount that you appear to move by will tell them how far away you areunosessequasinanos is talking about relative size comparisons and is also correct  If we know about how large something is we can gain some perspective on it based on how large it appears in our field of view  This is also one way that we can perceive depth in D images like drawings or paintings  ELI the closer something is the larger it will appearThere are other clues that we can use as well  Im not super sure about how our brains process all of this information but I do know that they have many different sources they use to compute the information we perceive  This wiki page httpenwikipediaorgwikiDepthperception is perhaps not well suited to ELI but it has some good information,0,cdnvwcg,1rj7gx,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1

justanaprilfool,By no means an expert here but I would assume we are able to perceive distance just like any animal with eyes on opposite sides of the head relative motion As we move closer objects will appear to move differently than ones further away Our brain can perceive this and translate it into a  dimensional image,2,cdnu2vr,1rj7gx,explainlikeimfive,new,2,0

Gerantos,Rather than just link to a wikipedia article cough cough Ill give this one a shot Well little Timmy just like you have muscles in your arms and legs to move you around you have two muscles inside your ear But these two muscles dont move anything you can see The muscles in your ear can actually block sounds and make them seem quieter to you For example when you hear a really loud sound they will tense up to help make the sound seem quieter This helps protect the insides of your ears when your sister sneaks up on you and screams as loud as she can Those muscles stretch tight and thats why you have trouble hearing out of that ear for a few seconds after The muscle that makes your ears rumble is called the tensor tympani muscle Mostly it makes your chewing sound quieter to you like when your mom and I tell you to stop crunching your cereal so loud and you have no idea what were talking about Now why does it make that sound when you flex it Because all muscles vibrate when you flex them Make a fist as tight as you can See your hand shaking The muscle in your ear does the same thing And because its inside your ear you can hear it vibrate Actually if you hold your clenched fist really close to your ear you should hear a similar sound,7,cdnvv2t,1rj86e,explainlikeimfive,new,98,91

Cogythea,Condenser microphones work by having a metal diaphragm right next to an electrical circuit httpwwwmediacollegecomaudiomicrophonescondenserhtml Put simply when the sound waves hit this diaphragm they push it back onto the circuit as sound is a vibration thereby completing the circuit This then sends an electrical signal down the wire the microphone is connected to or the sound card in the case of the camera and this signal is then interpreted and converted into its original form When a microphone is exposed to wind it is constantly pushing that diaphragm back onto the circuit so the signal is being sent when it ordinarily would not be This creates an anomalous sound The volume of this sound depends on the windspeed  a higher speed means that the signal is being sent more times per second I would assume that we dont hear wind as loud because we have evolved to filter some of it out Not  sure though but thats my explanation as to why microphones pick up wind very loudly If anybody has any corrections Id be more than happy to hear them ,1,cdnuv3t,1rj90z,explainlikeimfive,new,1,0

DashingDipper,Ill explain agriculture commodities markets because thats my area of knowledge but other commodities are traded similarly Futures contracts are essentially a document that says I Bob the Farmer agree to sell Paul the Processor x amount of corn soybeans etc These contracts are typically traded in set amounts  bushels is pretty standard for agriculture at an agreed upon price These futures contracts help to reduce price risk because the person can lock in a favorable price months or even years in the future The farmer knows what he will be paid ahead of time so he can plan his expenses accordingly and the processor will know what they are paying for inputs Most contracts are never actually settled through the physical commodity but rather in cash Because they can be settled in cash many investment firms speculate on these contracts almost as if they were stocks What most people find lucrative is the fact that when you purchase or short a contract you only have to post a percentage of the value of that contract Example  bushels of corn at bu but the buyer might only have to supply  when they buy the contract They can complete the payment when they sell the contract Substitute your preferred commodity for corn and the corresponding units and you have yourself a very basic overview of commodities markets ,0,cdnz6ln,1rjdm1,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2

mjcapples,Im going to take you up on your feel free to tell me this is an inaccurate documentary clause Listing all of the errors would take far too long but they were definitely biased in their presentationIll paste an excerpt from Monsantos FAQgtWhat is Monsantos standard policy if we discover a farmer is violating his or her seed contract gtIf there is evidence of seed piracy we work with the farmer to confirm the facts and discuss how to resolve the issue quickly amicably and professionally in accordance with our Commitment on Farmers and Patents This commitment clearly outlines a strict code of conduct we must operate under if we are investigating possible violations In particular we do not threaten farmers we respect their privacy we do not trespass and we do not pursue farmers for the accidental presence of our patented technology in their fields or cropsFrom my knowledge I worked on a farm for quite some time the vast majority of farmers sued by Monsanto and similar companies are for what is known as saving seed Under the contract for using the GM seeds the farmer promises not to save seeds from the harvested crop to plant the next year This is so that farmers cannot expand the seeds they bought earlier and is the farming equivalent of saying that you cannot pirate musicIn the case of Food Inc one of the main farmers interviewed claimed to run a small family farm to have been harassed by Monsanto unfairly Despite this his farm was worth several million I could be in the wrong range but it was by no means small and there was audio evidence of him trying to convince his neighbors to save seedThere is a reason why those in the farming community have a significantly more positive viewpoint on average than the average member of the public,5,cdnw33i,1rjkfk,explainlikeimfive,new,20,15

lobsterconspiracy,Most of the mathematics you learn once youve learned about fractions and decimals deals with values that can be fractional or even imaginary not just integers For example in trigonometry you can calculate the sine of  degrees but you can also do it for  degrees or  degrees Whether the values are fractional or integral doesnt really matter to what you are doing and since we often use mathematics with fractional values for example measured from the real world such methods must be equally applicable to any real number values to be usefulOn the other hand there are some things think not just mathematics but more generally that do not make sense with fractions For example how many ways are there to arrange the three letters A B C The answer is six and there are ways to figure out what the answer might be for any number of letters but the answer as well as the input the number of letters can only be an integer never fractional There are many areas of mathematics that deal with such things like if we have this many of something how many or if such and such then is so and so true The answer will be yes or no but never this much yes and this much no That is what discrete mathematics is,0,cdnzvwr,1rjpzk,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1

colinbroderick,Like most physics problems you solve it with a cleverly placed triangle  Theres a reason you spend so much time learning trig in school you knowBasically at some point in the year you measure the angle between where the sun is on the sky and where the star is in the sky  Exactly half a year later you measure the angle again  What you now have is a triangle where you know the length of the base twice the distance between the Earth and the Sun and you know both of the base angles  From this information it is very easy to calculate absolutely everything else about the triangle including the height which will be the distance from the Sun to the star  If you want you can also calculate the distance from the Earth to the star  Which distance you really want probably depends on what youre it using for and actually the timeaveraged distance between the Earth and the star will be the same as the distance between the Sun and the starIt looks something like this        X                      The dot at the centre of the base is the Sun the X is the star in question  As mentioned above we know the length of the base and the two base angles so we can calculate everything else about the triangle        Its called parallaxhttpenwikipediaorgwikiParallaxParallaxinastronomyThis is just one method and only works well for relatively nearby stars  For things that are further away we use the brightness  For certain types of star we know exactly how bright they really are at the source so by observing how bright they appear to be from here we can calculate how far away they are  Brightness decreases with distance in a wellunderstood wayEdit  By the way this is almost exactly the same principle that allows us to judge how far away things are  Because we have two eyes our brain gets two slightly different images from two slightly different angles and the two images together allow the brain to calculate how far away objects are  Again this only works for quite nearby objects up to about  feet for more distant things we have to rely on things like our knowledge of scale ie if it looks smaller its probably further away,1,cdnxvy6,1rjqro,explainlikeimfive,new,4,3

darkautumnhour,You should specify whether youre talking about melodic patterns or harmonic Melodic is a series of notes potentially in rhythm and harmonic would be notes in played simultaneously The former has few aesthetic boundaries Some people like complex experimental jazz where hundreds of notes are played seemingly at random some people like note pop music Harmonic patterns are slightly more easy to classify Smaller intervals half step whole step are generally HUGE generalization here less pleasing than larger intervals major  perfect fifth because larger intervals produce more even harmonics double or quadrupal the frequency that is to say the harmonic frequencies support each other rather than producing the beat frequency of uneven harmonics Think two guitar strings playing the same note one string slightly out of tune Another level to this question is the human perception factor The inner ear where sound is collected has tiny little hairs called cillia that vibrate when a sound reaches them These hairs are sorted by length into critical bands frequency ranges to which the ear is most sensitive People dont like hearing two notes very close together because it stresses the same critical band which is physically irritating Now a good question to ask is why our brains developed this way Since I have no concept of neuroscience I can barely spell it I am not the one to continue this explanation ,0,cdo1q63,1rjwjg,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2

aadhar,So a skeletal muscle cramp is a painful overshortening or contraction of a skeletal muscle  It can happen due to a variety of reasons  Some of the most common ones are fatigue and electrolyte imbalances  Many people who play sports or run experience a cramp from a fatigued muscle Ill explain this one  Basically your individual muscle cells run out of their energy source ATP as they become fatigued  This energy source is needed to actually detach the linked contracting fibers in your muscle cells  This would normally allow relaxation of the muscle  If the energy runs low they cant detach  So your muscle temporarily gets locked in a contracted state which causes the pain  So obviously it follows that resting the muscle is a good solution for this cause of crampsI can explain the electrolyte imbalance particularly calcium and potassium imbalances cause as well if youd like but it involves a much more indepth explanation of skeletal muscle physiology so Ill skip it for now  Suffice it to say that staying well hydrated can help prevent this cause of cramps  As for what most likely happened to cause you to wake up with a cramp in your calf heres my guessYour calf muscle was probably contracted in the position you were sleeping  That particular muscle helps you move your foot so that you point your toes down like youre standing on tiptoes  And basically because your foot was in that position for a long time while you were sleeping the muscle cramped due to the fatigue reason I explained above,1,cdo30cj,1rk6zy,explainlikeimfive,new,3,2

Faustroll,Basically notions of creativity skill and quality underwent drastic shifts beginning in the th centuryIt is imperative to understand the word master in historical context which at the time connoted skill but also crucially described an artist who had a studio in which he rarely she trained other artists Students had a fairly rigorous training in academic drawing for a few years before they learned painting This method created a kind of consistency and helped encourage the notion that artists with large studios were true masters The exceptions here are Michelangelo who was notorious for not having a studio and for berating assistants until they abandoned him and for Leonardo who worked in relative isolationSo master in the Renaissance more often implied individual skill but also skill as a teacher A notion of individuality plays a role in forming a notion of the master during the Renaissance and at this moment it meant the extent to which you could teach others to make art that looked so much like yours that it was indistinguishable Its interesting that you picked Michelangelo and Leonardo since neither of them had studiosAnother piece of this has to do with the Renaissance belief of where in the process creativity actually happened Drawing was the central node of intellect at this time it was why artists studied it for so long and it was why assistants generally carried out the majority of painting in the studios after which the master generally did touch up That was your entry into the grand style in which drawing was seen as the place where the real thinking happened So if you were good at drawing then theoretically you could be good at anything Drawing in Italy disegno implied that design the putting together of something occurred before the execution of it All of these ideas of creativity and individuality underwent a massive change in th century Europe with the decline of academies Artists gradually began pursuing the idea that real creativity did not hinge on excelling in an accepted style or having a studio in which you taught others So the word master changed drastically at the time and became a question of unique personalities The focus on personality and emotion was best seen in unique styles that shied away from the polish of the academic style Impressionism and turned quality into something that was way more granular So to ask whether an artist is a master the reply could be a master of what In determining a master there needs to be a comparative body of less talented artists With collective style dissolving art was no longer something that had a collective comparative premise Artists were judged by their sincerity to the motif which was a personal question Most importantly total emulation like the kind you would find in a studio system gradually vanished So while a young artist was inspired by Picasso actual copying was anathemaArtists today create in different media but judging mastery is based more on the taste of the viewer for different specific artists and everyone has an opinionSorry if this is kind of meandering but it is a complex issue with lots of aspects that feed into each otherA good source for how these ideas came about in the th century is Cezanne and the End of Impressionism by Richard Shiff and The Academy and French Painting in the th Century by Albert Boime,0,cdo8832,1rkau3,explainlikeimfive,new,9,9

FoolOfFools,I dont know if someone said this already so sorry if Im being repetitive From what I remember the three big names of the High Renaissance Da Vinci Michelangelo and Raphael only became famous after their names were propagated by Georgio Vasari who was from the same location as them but I dont remember where that was Florence perhaps The reason he was so successful at this propaganda was because he wrote one of the only surviving literature on art and great artists of that time periodbooks were just coming into popularity and books on art were rare Vasari didnt acknowledge other artists who were of the same calibre because they either werent from the same location or didnt suit his artistic preferenceThat being said there could have been other great artists and there can still be great artists now but nowadays its all about being different and selling the artist instead of the art This concept was first initiated by Marcel Duchamp I believe with his controversial urinal fountain his idea was that anything can be made into art if you believe in the artist The term art has become so subjective now that great artists are often passed over in favour of those who can produce something different and unique Even before the Renaissance when all you usually find are unrealistic illustrations by tribal people or eastern cultures the capacity for realistic art was still present but nobody believed in it due to religious beliefs They believed that portraits should emphasize specific traits Realistic art was considered offensiveI took two consecutive courses of ancient and modern art a couple of years ago so my memory is rusty and the details might be a bit off so I apologize for that,0,cdobr2h,1rkau3,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2

oechsph,Forgive my interpretation of this question but I think that its difficult to answer provided that your two examples had significantly different roles during the Renaissance Michelangelo would have been considered an artist during the Renaissance while Da Vincis role as an artist is only secondary to what made him so successful His name would have resonated more as a scientist and engineer than an artist In other words its like asking if there are any modern artists like Nikola Tesla and John Cage The problem is that one was an innovator while the other was an artist Im guessing you are looking for an artistAlso I would like to point out that Da Vinci DID NOT do many different art forms He did painting and drawing He never did ceramics sculptures glasswork etc So again and I know Im being a stickler it seems like your question doesnt even know what its askingThat being said I might take the liberty of revising your question then answering itAre there any contemporary artists like Michelangelo who are masters of several artistic mediumsSimple Answer Yes YES DEAR GOD YES Not only are there a few THERE ARE HUNDREDS The Renaissance popularize the sentiment that the artist does not need to stick to one medium Since the Renaissance you can find artists from pretty much every movement who were masters of their movements in painting and sculpture but not exclusive to those two mediums Looking to what we deem as modern art you could claim that Salvador Dali film photography sculpture painting Picasso sculpture painting costumes theater Boccioni literature painting sculpture Braque sculpture painting  Kollwitz woodblocks sketching sculpture THE ENTIRE BAUHAUS MOVEMENT textiles painting design architecture theater music the list goes on From the perspective of art history they were all masters of many different mediumsWe now live in the age of postmodernism and arguably postpost modernism where the idea or concept behind art is more important than the work itself you may know this as conceptual art In a sense this is now the norm An artist who does one thing and one thing only is easily swept under the carpet Why is this This is subjective but we have a tendency to want something new constantly eg iPhones Art is no different We want to experience new things making a demand for multiple mediumsAlso it should be noted that the living artists or masterswhom we consider celebrities today may very well be forgotten in a hundred years This is pretty common practice in art historyOh I also have a No answer to your question but that is definitely going to leave the ELI zone Is there a ELIBut the short short answer to your question is Yes and they are all over the place,0,cdomd4y,1rkau3,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2

SenorSuarez,A massively simplified answer would be cost of parts mass production and return on investment For example a top of the line gaming rig could cost you  just for the one graphics card and some of these rigs have two but these are not for the everyday person Consoles are designed for standardized performance with software built around their hardware which is decided with cost vs performance in mind where as with gaming pcs games are not optimized for one set of specs You just have to look at the Wii first gen to see how performance is not the only the deciding factor in a consoles popularity  I also forgot to add  Title exclusivity and content partnerships designed to benefit casual techonology users who prefer the living room experience and easy even if its paid access to content that may not be gaming related Xbox amp Netflix for example ,0,cdo3kjg,1rkblp,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1
GitOffMeLawn,Could they create consoles that compete with top of the line PCs  Sure but who could afford them  A console will last with acceptable performance for the next  years without needing to spend a ton of money on parts to try and future proof itConsoles get to hide the fact that they use inferior hardware over the life of their consoles by having the majority of that hardware available for developers to use to power their game  Through some sort of voodoo games like Skyrim are able to run on a PS that only has MB of system RAM and MB of graphics RAM  You cant build a PC to those specs and run Skyrim no matter how low you crank your visualsSame thing will happen in  years on these new consoles  Games will come out that still somehow look okay on hardware that cost   years ago and thats good enough for a lot of people,0,cdo5fy4,1rkblp,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1

dazfive,A collar is a method of attempting to make money on a purely options play It is used separate from any position on the stock There are many strategies like this and are often named other types of buzz words calender spread Iron Butterfly etc They are fancy names for taking a position on both puts and calls long andor short in an attempt to profit while mitigating risk  As for when to use options unless you are a sophisticated investor never The options game can be dangerous but as well lucrative I am an options trader  I use options to make money usually as a seller or writer  The best use of options for an average investor is to protect against downside or lock in a profit If you are long ABC and its has gone up sharply I would say just sell but if you want to participate in more upside while ensuring some profit you can buy and out of the money put This put give your the right but not the obligation to sell at that strike price regardless of where the stock is trading options can also be used as a cheap method to play in a stock  IF you think AAPL is going to rise you can buy an out of the money call which gives you the right to purchase the stock at that price regardless of where it trades Effectively if the stock goes up you can sell the call as opposed to exercising the option to purchase the stock  An out of the money call may only cost  per share rather than the  to buy the actual stock  WARNING  options have an expiry date and are subject to what is known as time decay  The closer the expiry without the equity moving towards your strike the faster the price of the option will drop This can be a tricky game to play I hope this helps   ,1,cdo6gha,1rkcbx,explainlikeimfive,new,2,1
ostifari,Options are best used by non professionals as a hedge against bets that they have already made on stocks and as a way to cheaply enter the market without a whole lot of riskPUTS gain value as its underlying stock goes DOWN in valueCALLS gain value as its underlying stock goes UP in valueOptions contracts are written aka bought and sold in the same bidoffer manner that stocks are traded One buyer one seller agreeing on one priceOptions expire weekly and monthly For learning purposes lets say Weekly options expire every Friday Monthly Options expire on the rd Friday of each Month Option are listed and are available to buy for up to  months before they expire depending on the corresponding Stock All Stocks have different and often confusing pricing and issuing for Options due to factors like volatility and time decay  things that youll have to look up more in depth independently and are the cause of the price fluctuation in my second example below Options are issued at what is called a Strike Price General Electric GE for example has  different Options for the month of December  at each Strike price ranging from    Strikes  One for the PUT one for the CALLGE stock is at  A few of the relevant Strike Prices and cost for that particular GE Options Call   cost  Call   cost  Call   cost  Put   cost  Put   cost  Put   cost When buying a Call Option you are essentially buying the RIGHT to own the Stock at the Strike Price So if you buy a  Call Option you are paying  for the right to exercise the Option which turns the Option into shares of Stock for an additional  or  or  depending on whatever the Strike Price is So it would be like paying      for a Stock worth  right now Why would you pay that extra  which is also refereed to as a Premium Because if the stock has bad news and plummets to  your Option would be worthless  and you will lose your  However if you had instead bought the Stock at  and NOT the option You wouldve lost    Now lets look at the change in Option Prices with such a dramatic drop in Stock Price Call   cost  Call   cost  Call   cost  Put   cost  Put   cost  Put   cost Notice now that the Puts have gained value and the Calls have lost value The  Put which is now in the money has increased almost  fold in value and will continue to gain a penny for every penny the Stock loses in value The Calls are almost worthless because the move hasnt gone in their favor A wise investor who owns a lot of Stock in GE would want to have bought many of the   and  Put Options when they just pennies each Now that his investment in the Stock has taken a blow he is covered on the downside by owning Puts which gain as much value as the stock loses once the Option is in the money If the Stock goes to  the  Put will then be worth  Now lets look at a completely different hypothetical situation Im looking at the  CALL options in each of the months of NOV DEC JAN and FEB The Stock is at  All the people that own these options believe that the stock will go above  at some point between now and the rd Friday of the Month that the option expires Obviously as time slowly moves on without any big move in the Stock investor confidence that the stock will hit that certain number go lower With that said the prices areNov  Option     Dec  Option     Jan  Option     Feb  Option    If you could SELL the DEC  Call for  and BUY the JAN for  it would cost  to complete the transaction Buy one sell one same price The Prices are at  and  respectively but in an open market there is room to barter Buy the better further out Call and sell the worse soon to expire Call for the same price Imagine doing this  times You own  Jan  Call and you are  short Dec  CallAs the stock moves all of these prices move And not only are the prices moving but people confidence steps up If the stock goes from  up to  suddenly it seems like it MIGHT get to  The person with the JAN  Call is going to be more sure of it than the guy with the DEC  Call because he has a whole extra Month to work with his Option So suddenly after a quick move the prices look like thisNov  Call     Dec  Call    Jan  Call     Feb  Call    So now we own  JAN and I need to buy back my short  DEC  Calls Lets review our position BUY  JAN  at  cost   SELL  DEC at  net  Balance  Later that same day after the Stock moved from    SELL  JAN at  net   BUY  DEC at  cost It costs us  cents per option that we buy or sell We bought  sold  then sold  then bought back    total contracts  feeCOSTS  to buy back DEC  cents per option x  options       NET  to SELL Jan    profitIf the Stock never makes a move all of our Options will be worth  once its their day to expire We let them all expire the positive position will eliminate the negative position and we do NOT exercise our right to buy the Stock Our cost is  for  contracts transacted at  each And we go home sad and frustrated ,1,cdo954q,1rkcbx,explainlikeimfive,new,3,2

SimonGn,It will be hard to get some research on this because it would be offensive and politically incorrect to look at it as a sort of genetic mutation as to oppose to just a difference in the grand scheme of diversityAlso generally speaking if looked at from a mental health perspective something is not a Disorder unless it is causing a problem for the patient For example someone who is feeling anxious hasnt necessarily got an anxiety disorder less the anxiety is getting in the way of their life For most people who are homosexual their homosexuality doesnt cause a problem for them and they have learnt how to accept or embrace it However there are also homosexuals where their sexuality does cause a problem eg Ignoring their true sexuality until they are older and then cheat on their spouse but because many homosexuals who dont have are problem are ridiculed so much from an early age that they do have a problem or disorder but clearly they dont they have making it politically incorrect to categorise it as a disorder which leads to very dangerous efforts by churches and the like to make a gay person straight instead of the person getting support on how to accept their sexualityIm sure if homosexuality was the more socially accepted form for sexuality then there would be plenty of people who are upset that they are hetrosexual when all their friends are gay and I would also call that a Disorder as they would not be accepting their straight sexualityHopefully in the future we get to the point where nobody cares whether someone is straight or gay and people are free to be whatever they want without judgement and anyone who has a problem with any part of their sexuality gay straight or in between can find suitable support to help them deal with it I can see that us as Western culture are moving towards that direction but there are other cultures like in Thailand where homosexuality is more accepted than in the West alreadyWhat I would be more interested in learning from ELI is what draws a homosexuals to take on a feminine and masculine role and what causes a lisp for a homosexual feminine man or deep voice for a homosexual masculine femaleAlso have a look at this httpenwikipediaorgwikiEgodystonicsexualorientation,2,cdo42kb,1rkdew,explainlikeimfive,new,4,2

Fairleee,The first thing to understand is the geography of the United Kingdom Ireland is an island lying off the coast of Great Britain which comprised England Scotland and Wales Historically Ireland was under British rule from  and subject to numerous invasions by the English prior to them establishing rule In the early s a successful Home Rule ie independence movement arose and Ireland became independent shortly after the end of WW with the exception of the top part of the country  Northern Ireland which opted to remain part of the United KingdomTo put it simply the main reason why Northern Ireland wanted to remain part of the UK was because much of the population were colonists from the UK and were predominantly protestant This group is known as the Unionists because they want to remain part of the Union of the United Kingdom There was a smaller native population that was predominantly Catholic that wanted to split from the UK so the whole country was part of the Republic of Ireland  this is known as nationalism as they are Irish nationalists or republicanism as they want to join the Irish republicSo the Unionists see themselves as British and the Nationalists see themselves as Irish However as the majority of Northern Irelands population are Unionists it is unlikely that Ireland will unify with Northern Ireland Because the two groups are also split along religious lines protestants and catholics this adds an extra element to the situationThe Troubles were at their worst from the late s onwards and numerous people were killed and injured The UK deployed part of its army to permanent duty in Northern Ireland and radical nationalist groups carried out a number of terrorist attacks in both Northern Ireland and the UK  in  the IRA a nationalist paramilitary group managed to kill the Queens cousin Lord Mountbatten with a bomb Both Unionists and Nationalists were responsible for a lot of awful violence in Northern Ireland itself and the British Army didnt always help matters  Bloody Sunday is a particularly notorious example where the army killed a number of unarmed protestors In recent years the Troubles have become less severe and the IRA has officially announced a ceasefire and no longer engages in bombings or terrorist attacks This is actually one of the lasting legacies of the last Labour government and Mo Mowlam a Labour politician is credited as being a major force behind the peace process she was the Secretary for Northern Ireland at the time The Republic of Ireland has largely acknowledged Northern Irelands existence and it has been established that if unification is to occur it has to be ratified by both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland However sectarian violence still does continue as there is a long long history of violence in Northern Ireland and feuds are still ongoingSo why is Catholicism and Protestantism relevant Well the fact that the two political positions unionism and nationalism were also largely split down religious lines was significant because it is an obvious marker of difference This is similar to how tribal affiliations in various other nations can be used to justify conflict Religion is often a very important part of a persons life as it can play a large role in how they define themselves so anyone who is not part of your religion is automatically an outsider In Northern Ireland the protestant and catholic communities have largely selfsegregated  in Belfast for example people know whether an area is Protestant or Catholic So it was not the primary cause of the Troubles but it was another complicating factorI hope this answer has been helpful please note that bearing in mind this is an ELI I have simplified a lot of the issues The fact is that the history of the Troubles in Northern Ireland is very very complex so if you are interested in finding out more the Wikipedia articlehttpenwikipediaorgwikiNorthernIreland on Northern Ireland would be a good place to startEdit added a bit more info,1,cdo6422,1rkebc,explainlikeimfive,new,7,6

WhoBdaB,This question is worded really badly I think what yorre getting at is police surveylance photograhs that are usually black and white I would guess that it is because before digital photography pictures had to be developed and it is cheaper and faster to do this in black and white instead of colour,0,cdo4t6c,1rkg5f,explainlikeimfive,new,6,6

redliness,Actually theres an inherent advantage to black and white film that made it a much more practical option its faster Fast in film terms means that the picture actually forms in the camera without needing as much light You could take a black and white photo from a distance at nighttime and it would come out clear where a colour photo would be an illdefined wash of browns and purples It also let you use much shorter exposure times which meant black and white film was more practical to use when moving or when shooting with a very long zoom lens Even today black and white film is still used in some cases for these reasons,0,cdo6t24,1rkg5f,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1

kultakala,For someone whose entire career depends upon ones voice its better to cancel some performances to ensure a full recovery rather than risk permanently damaging it  Source I trained to be a speech pathologist back in the day I also once trained to be a professional singer and due to pressure from a professor I went against everything I knew and started singing too soon after a minor vocal injury doctors accidentally nicked my vocal cords while intubating me for knee surgery and permanently lost my upper range,12,cdo55lh,1rkhbr,explainlikeimfive,new,102,90
obscuresamplegroup,One reason is as mentioned by ukultakala that you have take the risk of permanently damaging your voice if you start again too early The other reason is that concerts are a whole different level of exhaustion than your normal job A lot of artists run around jump dance and rock off all in bright light that significantly heats up the stage They sweat rivers and pretty much work out for something about  hours at least Even if you are back on the track after a week or two you just need more time to withstand that again So cancelling it is probably the only reasonable option,5,cdo5uwq,1rkhbr,explainlikeimfive,new,23,18
HexadecimalString,In addition to all of the good reasons already mentioned concerts are a big project and the decision horizon is surprisingly long That is to say there is a date at which you have to decide gonogo and it can be weeks ahead of the actual performance date Once its on all kinds of stuff happens from committing to venues to scheduling tractortrailers to haul gear across the country If a concert is scrubbed after that date the costs are enormousSo if theres any chance at all that the performer wont be good to go it just makes better business sense to kill the date rather than to try and go ahead on the hope that things will work out,1,cdo7toi,1rkhbr,explainlikeimfive,new,12,11

BassoonHero,SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS for The Avengers and ThorOn a surface level your summary is mostly correct Although Captain America not Thor is considered to be the leader of the Avengers The Avengers is at its heart a bigbudget action movie pitting a band of superheroes against an evil villain and his army Thats not to say that there isnt any more to it of courseLokis apparent motivation in the movie was simple to rule Earth A simple enough motivation and a very common one and the characters in the movie accepted it However many fans believe that Loki never really wanted to rule the Earth He wanted to rule Asgard and never really cared about the Earth When he sent the Destroyer to Earth in Thor it was to kill his brother heir to the throne of Asgard He didnt care one way or the other what happened to the Earths people But in The Avengers he suddenly wanted to rule the Earth Perhaps it was a consolation prize of sorts since he couldnt have Asgard but this didnt seem to be in character for himSo the fans speculated that Lokis scheme was some kind of ruse or diversion Like pretty much everything else hed ever done or said The postcredits scene implies that he was working with Thanos red face guy leader of the Chitauri the alien invaders When Loki is openly working with someone chances are he has already betrayed them and is already plotting to betray the next guy So what did Loki want from Thanos if not to rule the Earth Theres a lot of speculation We dont know what Loki had been doing between the end of Thor and The Avengers What we do know is that at the end of The Avengers Loki returned to the world he desired to rule If his plan was to rule the Earth then it failed but if it was to rule Asgard then the events he set into motion put him exactly where he wanted to be  just like his capture in front of the opera house put him in the helicarrier,0,cdod6wt,1rkhxo,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1

gamesterdude,A disk drive can tell the difference between a burnt disk something you made at home and a pressed disk something made in the factory because of the small differences in the disk Because of the differences the disks have a header that tells a computer what type of disk it is so it knows how to read it correctly Bonus  So when modding modern consoles like the  you had to load custom firmware onto the dvd drive that told it to not freak out if it noticed the disk was a burned disk ,4,cdo6iab,1rkigi,explainlikeimfive,new,19,15
Magnsum,The xbox and the ps both use headersspecial disks that can be checked for authenticity  When loading a game from the disc it checks to make sure that these sections which cannot be burned to using commerical tools are correct  It also checks region to make sure the disc is in the correct region idk why they even do this anymore  Just let me play whatever the hell I want  The gamecube was different because it used different discs those small ass ones and burned the data backwards I believe  The wii just burns the data backwards spins the disc the opposite way as everything else which means it is harder to create a replica of the disc  Also youd have to hack the firmware to bypass any checksregion locks still  They all do region checks so basically to get around the checks youd have to change the disc drive firmware  On the xbox some of them were easy because they stuck a samsung or liteon cant remember in there with special firmware and someone ended up finding the commercial driver for that disc drive and were able to put the firmware on there instead of the firmware that does auth checks  There were like  different drives that could have been in the xbox and I think only a couple of them had parallel drivers that could be put over the xbox   Also they had to modify the operating system youd have to format your drive with a special modified xbox  operating system on your hard drive that would bypass checking that the firmware was a valid firmwareThe playstation  didnt really allow you to update the disc drive firmware I dont think until someone found a way to flash the NAND chips on some of the playstation s not all of them could though I think there was an OS hack in there as well but I dont know much about modding the playstation  although I have been working on rpcs so I know quite a bit about the internals just not the operating systemhard ware exploits  Theres also some chips you can buy that you solder onto the motherboards  What these chips do is intercept these authenticity checks and then send back the correct data  Really not worth it and theyre detectable I think at the hardware level consoles can telldo stuff to discover them so its really a shot in the dark with those Ive never used hardware mods but rather just software mods  ,2,cdo6phx,1rkigi,explainlikeimfive,new,13,11
ampellang,Ok I will explain how copy protection works on PS and PS since thats what I am well versed on but I cant say definitively how it works on other consolesSo to start you have to understand that the tracks on CDDVDs are not a perfect spiral  There is a wobble which is that the track itself moves back and forth in a sine wave perpendicular to the direction of the track  This wobble is  kilohertz and some change IIRC  The tracks exist independently of the data which is to say when you buy a blank disc the track with its wobble is already there  A Playstation game changes the wobble slightly on the leadin the part of the track closest to the center where that the drive uses to orient itself prior to reading any data  So when the head is orienting itself on the leadin it follows the wobble of the track  By measuring voltage and impedance of the motor that runs the head the system is able to determine exactly how fast the head is moving back and forth and determine that it is different from a normal khz  If the wobble is exactly correct a analogtodigital converter circuit then sends the okay this depends on the region for America the chip sends hex the representation of SCEA to the CPU and allows the game to be playedThis is why it is still impossible to play burned games on a PS without modifying the console in some fashion,0,cdod1s9,1rkigi,explainlikeimfive,new,3,3
IntHatBar,Many methods of copy protection have been invented and cracked over the years  An example PlayStation  remember the black discs have a special CD Drive that can read data from a track on the disc that is not accessible using standard CD drives  The drive seeks to this special spot near the center of the disc and reads a special code from this track to verify game is legit  Hackers quickly found ways to get around this  The most prolific solution was to modify the PS to intercept the signal and respond with the appropriate code  This logic was built into a small integrated circuit and sold online as device allowing users to verify backup discs  If one has the mod chip installed in the PS heshe can simply copy an original black disc using a typical CD burner then play it on the modified PS  You know so you didnt damage your original game disc by playing it  And stuff,0,cdo771w,1rkigi,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2
EatDiveFly,one way is thisThis is how they did it back in the diskette days but is probably still interestingrelevantWhen you ask your operating system to make a copy of a disk you are essentially saying please take data from here and put it there in whatever way you pleaseWhen copying operating systems dont generally write to a specific track or sector on the disk Often the native copy command cant for instance write to track  sector  specifically So when the creator makes the disk he puts a code right in that spot  If that code is not there when the software starts up the sw checks with a low level command is there an X on track  sector  it knows its a copy  ,1,cdo78tx,1rkigi,explainlikeimfive,new,3,2

Schnutzel,Well yes thats exactly that When your browser tries to connect to the server if the server takes too long to respond then the browser will eventually give up and give you tell you that the connection timed outNote that when reddit says something like Ow We took too long then its a timeout that happened on the server side probably because of heavy load on the server So instead of making you wait for a long time the server just returns an error page so youll try again later,1,cdo5jfm,1rkjki,explainlikeimfive,new,2,1
kouhoutek,When you request a web page you are talking to a web server which in turn make a request to the back inIf that backend request is taking too long the web server gives up and gives you a polite message after a few seconds instead of letting you hang indefinitelySo if the cutoff is  seconds youll get the message the first time then the next time if it only takes  seconds youll get through,0,cdobi1r,1rkjki,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1
LondonPilot,E sharp is simply F And B sharp is CWhy Well the notes are based on the scale on C major And like all major scales C major has  notes and the intervals between those notes go tone tone semitone tone tone tone semitoneThe two semitones in a major scale are the intervals between the third and fourth notes and between the seventh and eighth notes In the case of C major this means the semitones are the intervals between E and F and between B and C,1,cdo5f4p,1rkjsr,explainlikeimfive,new,4,3

BassoonHero,As has been noted E and B do have sharps  F and C This really isnt any different than C sharp being the same note as D flatBut why are B and C closer together than C and D The answer is that there are twelve distinct pitch classes in western music but seven in a diatonic scale such as the C Major scale When notation was being standardized the C Major scale became the default and the seven pitch classes in that scale got simple names whereas the other five pitch classes have to be referred to via flatsharp namesBut why does the diatonic scale have seven notes You can arrange the pitch classes in the C Major scale or any diatonic scale so that each is separated from its neighbor by the interval of a fifth F C G D A E B This is in fact more or less how the scale was defined Why seven notes Because this is the smallest scale that will contain every interval Chop off a pitch class at either end and you cannot form the tritone six semitones Chop off one more and you cannot form a single semitoneFor a more complete explanation read thishttpwwwredditcomrexplainlikeimfivecommentsehsuaelithedifferencebetweenwesternandeasterncapko,0,cdocls0,1rkjsr,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1

alwaysdownvoted,Most people who are well off have investment income that is taxed at a lower rate than earned income  This includes some types of interest and capital gains  Many people are angry for some reason that the rich are not being taxed as much as everyone else but I look at it like this I work hard and save money so that when I retire I can invest my nest egg and retire without having to paying the higher earned income tax  This also benefits the people that are saving for retirement because that money is also taxed at the lower rateEdit Changed wording to reflect that only some interest is at a reduced tax rate Thanks InfiniteAmbiguity,0,cdo5pxf,1rkkst,explainlikeimfive,new,3,3
InfiniteAmbiguity,So everyone who receives income pays taxes on that income whether or not they work or make any which are actually very difficult things to define when you look at them closely and impossible to administer orpolice in a large scale But basically the tax code says that all money you receive is taxable unless something in the millions of pages of tax code regulations revenue letters court rulings and other sources  Essentially every rich person pays a lot in taxes on income that they actually receive with one glaring exception  municipalbond investment income is totally tax free regardless of amount received total income or wealth  So for example if I out  billion into municipal bonds that pay me an average of  per year then I keep my billion plus I received  million in income every single year  totally tax free   By contrast if instead of lending the billion to some localgovernment I lend that money to a local private company for  then I will still keep my billion assuming the company doesnt fail I will make my  million per year in interest income and I will pay about  of that  almost  million every single year  in federal taxes plus state taxes as high as an additional  or  million in some states  So municipal bond interest income is the only real total tax code scam that wealthy people can use to actually receivemuse and consume income while spying zero taxes If Americans were actually educated about this it would go away immediately  But both political parties tolerate this game while pointing out totally irrelevant stuff and meaningless but heated sloganeering  In addition to giving people a free ride this municipal bond income exemption also forces residents of fiscally sound states to subsidize the fiscally reckless states which just encourages the fiscally reckless states and their voters to tolerate fiscally reckless behavior  All forms of investment income rental income nonmunicipal interest income and corporate income are heavily taxed or where deductions exist they were consciously chosen for public policy reasons to encourage specific behavior such as research and development charitable giving expanding capital plant and equipment exploration construction and similar behavior  Id say that the mortgage interest deduction is alsoa scam but it primarily benefits existing home owners at the expense of renters and effectively subsidizes the realtors mortgage bankers and home builders  Edit  literally thousands of pages can be written about how horrible the tax system is and why a corrupt federal government  with both parties conspiring  refuses to make it simpler and only keeps making it more complicated But people should start thinking about the most glaring weaknesses  municipal bond interest income being totally exempt from all taxes and the overall complexity of the tax code as a whole  ,0,cdo77xm,1rkkst,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2

FellowConspirator,I presume that this question specifically relates to the GAO report on the purchase of  billion rounds of ammunition by the Department of Homeland Security in  That number of rounds is about  times what the US military used over the  years in Iraq DHS was also cited for purchasing a large number of hollowpoint rounds which cost almost twice as much as full metal jacket rounds That ammo was purchased specifically by and for the DHS without intent to share with other government agencies like the militaryThe official explanation for the purchase from the DHS was we need ammo and its cheaper to purchase in bulk No explanation for the purchase of hollowpoint ammunitions was given A spokesman said With more than  armed law enforcement personnel in DHS significant quantities of ammunition are used to support law enforcement operations quarterly qualifications and training to include advanced firearms training exercisesThe GAO is investigating Conspiracy theorists suggest that it may be a scheme to reduce gun violence by tying up the ammo manufacturers causing shortages and increasing prices there were shortages and increased prices that part was true However the most likely scenarios are someone did it just because they could or someone had a financial or political interest tied to the manufacturersHowever the answer so far is nobody knows why DHS is buying more ammo than the Department of Defense,2,cdocz8p,1rkm1p,explainlikeimfive,new,4,2

suspiciousface,In the s the world was entering a new ice age The USSR planned to reheat the world using love and communism based on research done by captured Nazi scientists shortly after the end of WWII If this plan failed the USSR was going to simply relocate to North America to escape the deadly coldThis was obviously unacceptable for a number of reasons America was already having huge problems with hippies the slang term for evil communist agents Free Love was promoted as microwave ovens were quite expensive so the communist plan would have less negative impact on the common man If the entire population of the USSR arrived in America as planned they could use democracys one weakness against it and simply vote a communist party into power abolishing democracy capitalism and the American dream Canada wasnt a big part of the cold war because we were democratic and had already massed our population on the US border in case things got too cold in the Great White North America had also captured Nazi scientists but instead of communism they intended to fix the global cooling problem by finding a way to turn on all the microwave ovens in the world at the same time with the doors open Due to the lack of microwave oven related information available in the world at the time this would be impossible until after the problem had been solvedThe Cuban Missile Crisis came about as several countries had turned to the communist side with the USSR Unfortunately love and communism had not yet caused the world to heat up and desperate times call for desperate measures Cuba determined that the moons reflected sunlight was outweighed by the sunlight blocked when the moon was between Earth and the Sun Their solutionBlow up the MoonAmerica had already been investigating methods of capturing moon heat and transporting it back to Earth Obviously this would be impossible if the moon was blown up and America wanted to use the Cuban missiles to launch giant microwave ray guns into space to better be able to microwave the planetThings were very tense for a while as blowing up the moon would mean disaster for coastal cities and the ice age was progressing faster than previously predicted The USSR was becoming increasingly aware that democracy and the microwavemethod was directly inhibiting their communist ideals The solution was to concentrate all the microwave emissions directly on democratic nations like the US warming the planet and frying their enemies simultaneously Getting wind of these plans the US had the rather unimaginative idea of doing the exact same thing to the USSR but firstVarious different interest groups in the USSR didnt really want to zap the US or get zapped for that matter They broke off and descended closer to the mantle a warmer section of the Earth This is also where Atlantis and Zion from the Matrix trilogy are located Anyways the whole thing was more or less wrapped up by teenagers who discovered that they could create aerosol flamethrowers that look totally badass In the process and rising popularity of this practice enough CFCs were released into the atmosphere to warm it up halting the impending ice ageUnfortunately this made the Earth into something of a greenhouse so now armies of trees advance on human civilization and we have to cut down vast forests daily just to protect ourselves There is a lot of tension in the Middle East because pieces of the moon were transported there in secret after the first moon landing Plants are allergic to moonrock which is why there are no plants on the moon and also why the Middle East has fewer and stranger plantsThe US maintains interest there currently due to towelheads a derogatory term meant to ridicule those still interested in blowing up the moon Being that these people still live on the surface and wear regular fabrics the term ridicules their lack of helmetsprotective gear other than turbans and ceremonial daggers which obviously would not protect one from falling moonbitsThe moon is also where heaven is so the US is still very vehemently opposed to blowing it up The rise of secular America has resulted in the beginnings of a process that will allow California to separate and sink to the Mantle where it will join Atlantis Zion and the USSR separatistsMany aspects of this have been criticized or explored through popular culture For example Star Wars A New Hope was a thinly veiled warning of what may come if we allowed the moonexploders to accomplish their goals Hope this helps and sheds some light on current events as well,1,cdod12b,1rknqj,explainlikeimfive,new,10,9
CoolStoryJohn,WWII ended with two primary power brokers the US and USSR  Both countries were inherently distrustful of each other for two reasons a their systems of government capitalistdemocratic and socialistcommunist were significantly different and b after having fought a bloody prolonged war together both countries knew what the other nation was capable of militarily  It really broke down to fear  The US wanted to cement its place in the world as the sole hyperpower but the USSR threatened that designation by being so powerful itself  While initially the USSR opposed the US on more ideological grounds the belief that capitalism was a true evil and the US was the greatest exporter of this evil that opposition grew less ideological by the end of WWII less about the evils of capitalism and more about also wanting to be the worlds sole hyperpower  As the postWWII th century rolled on a lot of the world took sides  Most of eastern Europe and some South American countries allied themselves with the USSR and generally all of the western Democracies allied themselves with the US all other countries taking a wait and see stanceneutrality  Both sides fought each other through what are now known as proxy conflicts  In other words the US and USSR would find a conflict often Democracy vs Communism themed in the world and each would support whichever side more favored their interests  The side that won added credibility and power to whichever country supported them  On top of these proxy conflicts espionage was incredibly common with USSRallied spies in the west and USallied spies in the east Eventually the west realized that the USSR had achieved a status that would result in mutually assured destruction MAD if they ever launched a nuclear strike at the east  The USSR long had nuclear weapons but MAD requires more than for both sides to just have atom bombsthere need to be nukes AND a delivery mechanism that cannot be disabled in the event of an attack for example the US has planes flying and submarines operating  armed with nuclear missiles in the event of a nuclear attack on US soilso if the US is attacked it will be able to offer a nuclear response regardless of how much damage it sustains  Once the west realized that the USSR had mastered this delivery mechanism and MAD took effect the chance of a direct armed conflict between the two sides which one could argue would have been very likely if MAD was never achieved diminished to about   The result was more proxy and more espionage until eventually the USSR moreorless collapsed itself in the s a very complicated issue itself and the USallies won the cold war    ,0,cdodwm2,1rknqj,explainlikeimfive,new,3,3
dalevywasbri,So before WW there were a multitude of competing powers The most important of them were reliant on their past economic dominance for their position ie France and England But the US is easily the largest economic power in the world before WW but has yet to be able to make in roads in to the rest of the world that is to become a global power And the USSR while faltering is a massive country with a lot of potential and tons of ideological prestige Communism both before and after WW was a potent ideological powerWW happensFrance UK Western Russia Germany Italy and Eastern europe are basically wastelands after the war None of the former powers Germany France UK or Italy are psyched about abolishing capitalism and are therefore natural allies of the US The US govt is looking around the world as all of these former colonies are falling  and obviously not all of them are naturally capitalistic and so it wants to keep the peace and make more money And The USSR at this time is under Stalin who is so paranoid he will kill anyone doing a good job So it seemed to Americans that if we simply contain Communism in the Soviet Bloc give it a few years and the Soviets will fall and there will be even more markets to sell our goodsSo the first generation of US military planners are pretty cynical about this  The Soviets arent close to taking over europe they can barely keep the lights onThe soviets basically completely despite Stalin start to recover and get some of their shit together And The Second Generation of US military planners in the s are scared shitless of communismAnd then the Cuban missile crisis happens and the US military planners realize that this is somethin that they have to tread very lightly on and so tensions resolve Money is great and all but if we kill all fauna on earth that would probably be bad for businessVietnam is just about making sure communism cant expand its market power and therefore its ability to make more military hardwareAnd then Reagans advisors were like you know what could make republicans win alot more electoral races If we got money from arms manufacturers and so they brought the Cold war back from the graveAnd all the while since Stalin died the Communist leadership is so cynical about communism there is very little real work in trying to turn the world revolutionary  and effectively the Soviets are slowly getting less powerfulTLDR The Cold War was a US strategy to make America more economically dominant that spiraled into something much darker and then imploded into itself,0,cdode3k,1rknqj,explainlikeimfive,new,3,3

shawnaroo,They dont but its very common During WWII the government instituted wage freezes as part of the war economy so companies offered potential employees various benefits in order to help hire good workers One of the big benefits offered was health insurance For better or worse probably worse it sort of stuck and health insurance via employment became pretty standard since then It even became subsidized because the government offers various tax breaks to companies that provide health insurance to their employeesOne result of this has been that the health insurance marketplace for individuals has been a huge mess Very complicated and very expensive The ACA attempts to try and make the marketplace work better for individuals but its still in its early days and its hard to say how well it will work in the long termtldr Companies dont legally have to offer health insurance to their workers but its often an important part of appealing to good employees ,0,cdo6tym,1rkour,explainlikeimfive,new,3,3

Salacious,Lets do this chronologicallyThere was a guy named Booker Dewitt He fought at the Battle of Wounded Knee killed a lot of indians and felt really bad about it After the battle he found people being baptized in the river At first he volunteered for the baptismHere the universe splits It becomes World A in which Booker does not go through with the Baptism and goes back to his life and becomes a strike buster In World B he becomes Zachary Comstock remains in the military and goes to Columbia Booker in World A eventually has a baby Anna Comstock in world B is unable to have a baby because of experiments done by Leteuce Comstock in world B wants to have a baby and Leteuce thinks that she can get him one from the world of her brother who is really her in the alternate universe similar to how ComstockBooker are the same person Booker has a ton of gambling debts but no way to pay off the debts so Male Leteuce says he can pay off the debts by giving them his baby He agrees to do that and they take the baby but Booker changes his mind and chases them Leteuece gets Anna through the rift but part of her pinky gets cut off and stays in Bookers world meaning she exists in both World A and World B at the same time This gives her the ability to open portals between worlds These rifts can also span across various times for example in one early scene Elizabeth opens a rift to NYC and the theater marquis shows Star Wars being played even though its only  in the gameBooker sinks into alcoholism and depression after losing his baby carves her initials AD into his hand and gets into more debt Leteuce again offers to wipe away the debts if he goes to this city and brings a certain girl to New York He agrees and they bring him out to Maine and pass through a rift at some point without him knowing He goes into the light house and goes up to Columbia rescues Elizabeth from her tower they flee the city etc Elizabeth is captured by Songbird and brought back to Comstocks house Future version of Elizabeth brings Booker to the future and shows him what happened as a result of not having stopped Songbird from taking her then sends him back to stop Songbird Elizabeth opens a tear to Rapture from Bioshock  and Songbird is killed by the water pressure Then they go up to the lighthouse Each lighthouse represents a World created by a choice like Bookers choice to get baptized or not Each world branches off from many different important choices Anna realizes that as long as there is a world in which Comstock exists there will be a world in which she ends up destroying everyone using Columbia So she opens a tear and they go back to the moment where Comstock began the baptism There the many versions of Elizabeth that had all reached the same conclusion meet up and drown Booker before he can become Comstock thus preventing that horrible future from ever happening and thats why they all disappear,16,cdo79rg,1rkq9z,explainlikeimfive,new,105,89

RexMundane,Since the whole story rather confuses itself a few times most of this is interpretation as much as anything so grain of saltThere was a man named Booker and during the battle at Wounded Knee he did some very bad things On his way home he stumbles on a baptism and participates But at the last minute he resists reasoning the bad things hes done cant be washed away in a moment and a prayer He grows older becomes bitter taking a series of jobs working for ever harder and crueler men He marries but his wife dies in childbirth and in time he sells his daughter Anna to a crime boss to pay for his gambling debts Despondent with grief cynicism and drink he loses himself in his misery and ultimately forgets any happy moment he ever knew and there he remains for some  years or soDesperate again with gambling debts he takes another job to rescue a young woman from a city called Columbia which is made of buildings that float among the clouds led by the prophet Zachary Hale Comstock The young woman in question is Elizabeth Comstocks daughter locked in a tower and is herself is a bit of a mystery missing part of her little finger uncommonly intelligent and posessiong supernatural powers Rescuing her avoiding the monstrous Songbird and getting through the political struggles of a class structure at war with itself Booker and Elizabeth in order to affect their escape Booker and Elizabeth ultimately destroy the tower where Elizabeth was kept releasing all the energy that had previously kept Elizabeths diminished and she becomes in effect a kind of goddess capable of exploring alternate universes past and present And it is here Booker learns the truth Comstock is in fact Booker and Elizabeth is actually Bookers Daughter AnnaAll those years ago at the Baptism in an alternate universe there was a version of Booker who decided that yes all his cruel misdeeds could be wiped away easily That by extension perhaps any cruelty can be mitigated by circumstance and ambition that any ends can justify all means And of that mindset he pursued the construction of Columbia using the bizarre science of a physicist named Rosalind Lutece which would allow not just for levitation but crossing planes of reality To accomplish his dream he needs a daughter of his own bloodline but the scientific experiments would render him sterile and so he along with Rosalind would conspire with Robert the version of Lutece from Bookers universe to take Bookers daughter Anna Knowing this and how much trouble is caused by it all Booker realizes the only way to stop the madness and evil Comstock would eventually become responsible for is to back yet again to the baptism to go under the water and never come up again sacrificing his life which he does with the help of various iterations of ElizabethAnnaAfter all of this Booker awakens on the day he would trade his daughter Anna to the mob boss Was all of it a dream A vision of a parallel universe and bad times to come Or all a memory of a reality undone by Elizabeth ,1,cdo8bud,1rkq9z,explainlikeimfive,new,5,4

NotMrPotatoDick,Assuming you are American as this issue gets tossed around every now and again the simplistic answer is Separation of Church and State in the st Amendment At the birth of our nation founding fathers like James Madison and Thomas Jefferson were influenced by Roger Williams who wrote there needs to be a hedge between the garden of the church and the wilderness of the world These men made sure that the US government respects all religions and wouldnt tax them to destruction  a phrase from the  Supreme Court Case  Walz v Tax Commission of the City of New York The ruling of this case said that grants of tax exemptions for religious institutionsJustice Burger stated in the ruling   the exemptions for religious organizations created only a minimal and remote involvement between church and state and far less of an involvement than would be created by taxation of churches and the effect of the exemptions was thus not an excessive government entanglement with religion The grant of a tax exemption was not sponsorship of the organizations because the government did not transfer part of its revenue to churches but simply abstained from demanding that the churches support the state The exemption created a more minimal and remote involvement between church and state than did taxation because it restricted the fiscal relationship between church and state and reinforced the desired separation insulating one from the otherHowever because they are exempt from paying taxes they cannot openly endorse any political partycandidate Johnson Amendment of  Sorry I wish I can wirte more,5,cdo984a,1rkvgc,explainlikeimfive,new,15,10

kouhoutek,Mutations are only good or bad in relation to the environment  If a trait no longer kills you you are no longer unfit for having itThat can actually improve the overall fitness of the species by allowing the beneficial aspects of that trait to spread  For example a trait might improve your immune system but at the cost of an increased chance fo appendicitis  Before modern medicine that would have been a very negative trait and would of been selected against  But with medicine it turns into a prositivie trait and makes the species better,0,cdo9qm2,1rkw3i,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1
entropydecreaser,Short answer yesEvolution occurs whenever the frequency of alleles in a population changes over time Alleles are essentially types of genes that code for specific traits For example theres an allele for black hair an allele for blonde hair and an allele for red hair The hair colour you get depends on which allele you have This is a huge oversimplification but it gives us a goodenough groundwork when talking about the theory behind evolutionThere are several things to keep in mind The first is that evolution is not only governed by natural selection There are four factors that result in evolution mutations gene flow genetic drift and natural selection Ill go through each one and discuss why humans are continuing to evolveMutations are the random introduction of new alleles in a population They arise as a result of errors in DNA replication or other factors So regardless of medicine mutations will always arise Mutations are not as significant of a factor as the other three so I wont go into detail hereGene flow is the introduction of alleles to a population because of immigration This is very significant when applied to humans Lets look at London for example A thousand years ago almost all Londoners had Caucasian alleles that coded for white skin light hair etc Now however there are people immigrating to London from around the world Im going to use India in this example So Indians move to London and are essentially adding new alleles to the population that code for brown skin black hair etc Assuming that there are whiteIndian couples their kids now have different set of alleles than Londoners would have had a thousand years ago If we go back to the initial definition of evolution regarding the change in allele frequencies in a population this clearly satisfies thatNext is genetic drift This is the random change in allele frequencies over time Though this does happen the population of humans is big enough that we can dismiss it as being not particularly influentialLastly natural selection I assume that you understand natural selection due to your question but Ill explain for any readers that might not Natural selection occurs when certain alleles are favoured over other ones in a particular environment For example in a cold environment dogs with thick fur will presumably live longer and have more offspring than those with thin fur Over time since those with thin fur die out and dont have as many kids the allele coding for thin fur disappears from the population The one coding for thick fur increases in frequency This is where medication comes in Historically diseases frequently killed many people and those that were resistant survived If we take the example of smallpox being introduced to the New World many Native Americans died but those that were resistant lived and continued to have kids and spread their alleles Thus alleles that caused a resistance to smallpox or overall better health increased in frequency Now medication erases many of these selective pressures Those with diabetes in the first world dont die as much anymore Previously alleles that caused people to be prone to diabetes would have been decreasing over time because those with that allele died young and didnt have kids Now they continue to live just like healthy people and they presumably have as kids that inherit these alleles So in a sense you have a valid point However there are plenty of diseases that we dont have easy cures for Cancer and AIDS are two examples Individuals who are resistant to HIVAIDS are presumably going to live longer and have more kids generally than those who are not resistant so we can expect certain alleles to increase in frequency over time and others to decreaseThere is one other point I want to make about natural selection There is a particular kind of natural selection called sexual selection This is when females pick their mates based on certain characteristics and those that are chosen have more kids than those who are not chosen By having more kids the alleles that coded for these characteristics are passed on Sexual selection is certainly existent in modern populations For example women often prefer men that are muscular over men that are fat Of course musculature and fat are hugely affected by lifestyle but genetics also plays a role Assuming that these muscular men have sex more and have more kids than fat men do on average then over a long period of time alleles coding for big muscles will increase and those coding for a predisposition to fat will decreaseThese are just a few of many ways in which humanity continues to evolve Thanks for the question,0,cdoa5cu,1rkw3i,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2
rupert,Youre thinking of evolution as if its a static phenomenon where the definition of fit never changes Thats how you get the idea of evolution stopping because everyone is now fitMedical advances simply means that the definition of fit has changed and that evolution in humans no longer involve selecting against those who wouldve perished if not for medical advances Rather human evolution is taking a new directionIts also important to note that survival of the fittest isnt all there is to the story  many traits we see arent selected for because its fit but it arises due to random chance,0,cdoa5qu,1rkw3i,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1
airor,Evolution is the change of allele frequencyhttpenwikipediaorgwikiAllelefrequency in a population  So even if your premise was true that more and more bad genes were remaining in the population and not getting selected out that would still be evolutionThe issue is whether or not having those now survivable alleles in the population is a bad thing and the answer is a definite no  With more combinations of genes there are more paths for evolution to take which means a larger search space for evolution to find beneficial combinations  Consider having that bad gene might be barely survivable in one person but maybe when combined in someone with a specific other gene the two cancel out the bad and produce a new feature  Without the new survivability of that bad gene the chances of the two being found together was very small but now that its survivable it gets a chance to find that other gene  Now the two genes together can be passed on and the new feature can change the population,0,cdoaauv,1rkw3i,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1

Darabo,I attended the  Expo in Shanghai multiple times for multiple reasons so perhaps I can shed some light about itThe major World Expos are every ten years usually lasts around six months or so and are a modern day variant of the Worlds Fair which brought us great monuments such as the Eiffel Tower and so forth  Each Expo has a theme the various countries and organizations have to follow in order to showcase it for the advancement of the future and blah blah  As with the Eiffel Tower in Paris I think electricity was revealed in an expo about  years ago as were other major inventions so its considered a big deal if a city hosts the expo  If I remember correctly the theme for  was Better City Better Life and the different countriesorganizations had items related to itNote how I also say organizations which range from CocaCola to the United Nations  In the end however due to the flux of tourists into the area for the expo most of the venues for these countriesorganizations will be nothing advertisementspropaganda highlighting their country and promoting tourism and so forth In regards to the economy there will be thousands of buildings venues and etc built just for this expo  This means thousands of construction jobs workers planners and etc  Then during the expo there will be hundreds of thousands if not millions of tourists which means even more revenue for the city  Plus the host country tries to one up everyone elses venue since its a sort of friendly competition and goes all out in a major fashion  For example Chinas booth during the Shanghai Expo in  was about ten stories tall and was easily the best building in the Expo  Heres a photo of the China Pavilion but its one of those buildings where it looks sort of small until you get close and then you see how huge it itwwwchinadecodedcomwpcontentuploadschinapavilionjpg,0,cdog6d9,1rkxby,explainlikeimfive,new,3,3

CoolKidBrigade,It is better to turn down your heat when you are not home tldr The amount of energy it takes to bring your house from cold to warm is less than the amount of energy required to keep it warm all dayTo answer your question you need to define better Ill take better to mean wastes the least amount of energy If each technique keeps your house the same temperature when you are home the energy inside is constant what we need to compare is how much energy gets leaked outsideWhen your house is hotter inside than outside the energy heat will move from areas of higher concentration to lower concentration The warmer your house is than the outside the faster this will happen Its the same reason why you can boil water faster on a stovetop set to high than a stovetop set to mediumhigh The hotter something is like the burner the faster heat will flow from the source to the surrounding environment like the water You can look up Newtons Law of Cooling for equations that describe this effectSo when you keep the house warm all day you leak heat outside at a constant rate The only way to leak heat faster is if you heat the house above room temperature If you turn down your heat when youre gone at first the heat leaks at the same rate as a heated house but as the house cools the rate of heat leaking will slow down simply because there is less of a temperature difference between outside and inside When you need to reheat the cold house it doesnt matter that it might feel like you are using a lot of energy as you bring the temperature of the house up you are always leaking heat at a slower rate than if you kept it that temperature the entire time,2,cdoa9lq,1rkxdj,explainlikeimfive,new,30,28

TimeTravellerSmith,TLDR  Its better to turn it down if no one is in the house  If youre not running the AC youre not using electricity and if youre not running heat youre not using gas  Not using those things means you spend less month to monthIt costs money to heat the house in the winter and AC the house in the summer and either case they sit around  degF  So if no one is in the house during work hours  hours a day then its not worth paying for  hours of heatingcooling which is what just about every modern thermostat does these days  They let the house heat up in the summer and not run the AC or it lets the temp drop in the winter by not running the heat  Then they usually are set to reactivate an hour or so before you get home so the house is at  when you pull in  ,1,cdo99am,1rkxdj,explainlikeimfive,new,3,2
brokengoose,Im going to assume that by better you mean cheaper Think about it this way is it better to turn the thermostat down if youre going out of town for a month Yes Obviously How about a week A day A few hoursIn other words whats the magic point at which it becomes better to leave the heat on The correct answer is usually Never Youll always use the least energy by turning down the heat when its not needed That usually means that its cheapest to turn down the heat whenever you leave the houseThe one exception would be if your heat comes from a source that charges different rates depending on the time of day Say an apartment with electric heat In that case if theres a huge difference in price it might make sense to keep the heat on during a cheap part of the day so that you can run the heat less during a more expensive part of the day Thats a really complicated problem to solve but fortunately it doesnt apply to most peopleA lot of people assume that when a multistage furnace kicks into high that its operating less efficiently Thats usually not true Usually a furnce churning away at full power is more efficient than one thats kicking on for a few minutes every hourEdit to add My experience is that people who argue that leaving the heat on is better are really more worried about how long it takes to heat the floors and cold corners They feel stupid arguing that turning the heat down when were gone makes it less comfortable to walk across the floor with my shoes off for a few hours so they concoct strange arguments that defy the laws of thermodynamics ,0,cdomzz0,1rkxdj,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2
DickEB,Depends on the house and the system yourre using to heat and the outside temperatureThe basic equation is thisHow long would your heater be running in order to bring the house back up to temp ltvsgt How long would your heater be running during the time you are gone  In my experience it is worth turning down the temp a bit  AC generally takes longer to cool a house a few degrees than a heater does to heat a house up a few degrees  So turning the temp up in the summer when the house is empty isnt as effective as turning down the heat in the winter  Although I think turning the temp up a few degrees is usually still economical,1,cdoa4qe,1rkxdj,explainlikeimfive,new,3,2
SoLongFall,TLDR It is better to keep the temperature closer to outside temperatures to decrease power consumption however the benefit decreases with better insulation Edit Dont drop the temperature below  or  F to keep the pipes from freezingAlright there are several ways that your house transfers temperature but basically we have discovered that the energy in heat must go somewhere  In this case we have four ways that the heat can transferRadiation this sort of heat transfer will happen through energy carrying electromagnetic waves This is solely based upon the temperature of the object and not the surroundings The higher the temperature of the object and the more surface area the more heatenergy it will radiateConvection This is the transfer of heat through flowing winds and water This one depends upon the temperature difference of the two objectshouseoutside and the bigger the difference the faster you try to heat up the windConduction The other types of heat transfer deal with the walls and roof of your house this one deals with the flooror earth if you like living one with nature and have dirt floors  In this case the earth stays ish degrees so some of your energy is going to heating up the the surface of the floorAdvection Some of the air inside of your house goes outside taking all of that precious heat with it and some air comes inside  You will need to reheat this air and the more you have to heat it the more energy it will useNow all of this depends on heat getting to the outside walls of your house See your house is essentially two cubes with one inside of the other  The inner cube is the floor you walk on and the drywall inside of your house with that sweet wallpaper while the outside is what you show to the world as well as the foundation of your houseThe heat will move from the inside to the outside through your walls based upon the first three ways of heat transfer listed above This is where insulation comes into play The better insulation you have the slower it will move through the walls and the less the inside of your house will heat up the outside of your houseHopefully I didnt get too specific for ELI on this one but I wanted to get a bit of info on what makes up the heat loss of your house  Hope this helps,0,cdouvne,1rkxdj,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1
Juanfro,If you turn it down while you are out the house will get cold so it will need some time to get it warm again The best option when you go out is to keep the thermostat on but maintainining a comfortable low temperature This way the house wont be freezing when you arrive and you wont spend too much energy and money,2,cdo9bjp,1rkxdj,explainlikeimfive,new,2,0
Xelopheris,For one you should never drop your house below a certain temperature All those pipes running in the walls of your house need to stay above freezing which means the area of your house that is actively heated needs to stay even further above thatGenerally speaking outside of a few weeks of the year your heater never turns off once it starts running If you let it drop a few degrees while youre away it saves slightly more energy during that drop as it costs to heat back up ,5,cdo9bu0,1rkxdj,explainlikeimfive,new,2,-3

criedley,Snow is a whole bunch of individual ice crystals arranged together When a light photon enters a layer of snow it goes through an ice crystal on the top which changes its direction slightly and sends it on to a new ice crystal which does the same thing Basically all the crystals bounce the light all around so that it comes right back out of the snow pile It does the same thing to all the different light frequencies so all colors of light are bounced back out The color of all the frequencies in the visible spectrum combined in equal measure is white so this is the color we see in snow while its not the color we see in the individual ice crystals that form snowBasically if you just had a big block of ice light can pass right through it where as with snow light is being reflected and bounced around many many times through many crystals of snow,1,cdoasge,1rl2xe,explainlikeimfive,new,39,38
Nickel,Expanding on criedleys comment as to give a bit more to the reason why  Atoms arent arranged so theyre right next to each other which makes sense since atoms arent REALLY round spheres  They form a crystal they have a pattern  This pattern repeats across the structure  When light waves enter a material certain wavelengths get lost within the structure others bounce back we see the wavelengths that bounce back  The crystal repeats across the entire material so the color is consistentCompare this to snow  Each snowflake is random  The snowflakes fall in a random pile  There is no order in a snowbank  Therefore all wavelengths get reflected eventually  Resulting in whiteCompare this to ice  When water freezes the water molecules have time to align themselves as to reach a the lowest energy possible  This alignment will be the same for each water molecule  It happens that at this arrangement light waves are able to be reflected in such a way to let us see throughtldr Ice has a pattern snow does not,0,cdot5mb,1rl2xe,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1

Hirodo,Well take a seat this post may take awhile  As states elsewhere each organization was originally created for a specific purposes  Sometimes these purposes could not be combined for legal reasons an issue Ill explain a little later onFirst the FBI was created as a solution to the pesky problem of gangsters and jurisdiction  During the s and s many bank robbers bootleggers and other mafioso types could keep away from the law by crossing state lines  Crossing into another state would effectively halt any chase and apprehension by the authorities in the state the crime was committed in  The FBI was created as a Federal Police like force that could continue the investigation and chase despite criminals crossing state lines  Needless to say the FBI has grown to be the go to investigative law enforcement agency dealing with high profile crimes and other federal level crimesCIA The CIA grew out of the WWII intelligence agency the OSSthink early Medal of Honor games  The CIA main goal was operational  intelligence and foreign intelligence aka spy stuff  This is still what they do  The CIA main goal is to find out what we dont know usually from the source such as agents inside the host countries and any contacts they have fostered  During the last fifty years or so the CIA has grown to not just include covert monitoring but covert action as well  The CIA Special Activities Division is very active in war zones and other countries forcing changes such as overthrows  In fact the first US forces into Afghanistan where CIA operatives from SAD  Of course any and all of this is subject to speculation  NSA This is actually a very simple agency from an overall perspective  The NSA provides intelligence both domestic and foreign by electronic means aka SIGINT  The NSA is a component of the DoDSecret Service  The Secret Service started as the law enforcement and criminal investigation arm of the Treasury Department  The Secret Service is one of the oldest forms of federal law dating back to the Civil War  Back then theyre role was slightly larger but for the purpose of being brief Ill skip that part  The Secret Service fell into the protection of the President and other VIPs after the assassination of William Henry  ATF Will talk about during Homeland SecurityHomeland Security  Now here is where everything ties together kinda  The Department of Homeland Security is just that a cabinet level Department that over sees many agencies including the Secret Service and FEMA  The main mission of Homeland Security is the internal protection of the United States by threats both domestic and foreign  Although not completely compromised of Law Enforcement Agencies Homeland Security does maintain a certain level of LE capabilities when these agencies have missions that correlate to actual security  For example the Coast Guard is now an agency of Homeland Security there main mission is domestic maritime policing or Customs and Border patrol whose main mission is security of the borders and entry points  Homeland Security agencies do not focus of the prosecution of criminals other then the ones stated above  The falls to the Department of Justice where the FBI and ATF reside  In essence the ATF is like the FBI but with a strong focus on you guessed it Alcohol Firearms and Tobacco  They do more then policing work as they also regulate the sales and transfer of such items         ,0,cdohcn1,1rl61p,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1

Koooooj, PM is one hour past noon  Similarly  AM is one hour past midnight  This is a justification for why we dont call noon  oclock which would make it go  am  am  am  pm noon  That would solve one problem but introduce a new oneThat sets us up with a system that should go  am  am  m noon  pm and so on   am is clearly before noon and  pm is clearly after noon so what do we do with noon itselfIf you just look at the even hour times then it would seem that noon ought to still be AM is more similar to  and  than it is to  and  so it should get the same suffix right  However ask yourself  is  before or after noon talking about the  that occurs near mid day   is clearly after noon and thus ought to be labeled as pm  The same is true of  or   Thus if  is to be AM then we would have  AM  PM  PM and so on  Now that seems out of placeIn fact if you continue that argument then we can look at seconds as well AM  PM  PM and so on  Since noon is only a single instant in time we find that for essentially the whole th hour the time is already pm  Therefore making noon be  AM is inconsistent more so than making it be  PM is inconsistentNow there is a completely consistent solution  We can still make  hour past noon be  oclock and we can make it so we dont have that weird discontinuity from  AM to  PM  We simply call noon and midnight  oclock pm and am respectively  This is actually the most consistent is more like  and  than it is like  and  so labeling noon as  oclock PM is consistent there and  PM conveys the idea that it is  minutes past noon while  PM would suggest that its  hours after noon  This is the most internally consistent  hour clock but the existing  hour clock going from  to  instead of  to  already has too much hold for this idea to gain much tractionusing the existing clock works just fineThe other consistent solution is to do away with a  hour clock in the first place and just call midnight  oclock and count up from there  We have  am  am  pm  pm  pm and so onthe break from am to pm happens at noon if its reported at allwe never have to specify which  oclock were talking about but we dont reset the numbering an hour later so theres no problem  This clock system is arguably better than my proposed  hour clock since it removes the ambiguity of a  hour clock being used for a  hour day and it sees widespread use around the world ,0,cdoh7pc,1rl8id,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1

Ifightdemons,I am someone that works and lives close to these issues and I still talk about this nearly dailyFirst tell me who is responsible for the meltdownIs it American consumers that live beyond their means in most instances and create a culture of debt particularly manifested in the early s when many many people bought homes that were hugely beyond their ability to actually afford and were subsequently abandoned outright and allowed to defaultWas it the developers the realtors or the local retail bankers that made the homes and pushed predatory adjustable mortgages with low teaser rates early on and completely unsustainable rising rates and shortened terms laterWas it the pseudogovernmental financial organizations like Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac that pooled these mortgages into large investment funds that could be purchased something like stocks on the open market or investment banks like Lehman Brothers GoldmanSachs and then Bear Stearns that at some point realized these assets were completely toxic and attempted to firesell them and took out bets against them  remember in the culture of Wall Street investment bankers or traders routinely sell stocks commodities and other assets and it is almost always because the asset is believed to no longer have value if it did have value the trader would keep itWas it the financial rating agencies like Moodys and SampP that accepted profit for ratings and had poor enough foresight and due diligence that they repeatedly rated these dangerous and unsustainable mortgage assets as AAA nearly riskless assets allowing the market to believe they were safe and steady sources of incomeWas in the investor funds and everyday people that bought into these funds of mortgages in order to turn a buck on other peoples house debtWas it the government that at various times mandated subprime lending Clinton or lowered interest rates radically to promote house purchases generally refused to step in Greenspan or even repealed important limitations on the market makers on Wall Street Congress like the GlassSteagall act investmentretail bank separation and leverage limits how much debt an investment bank is allowed to take out and reinvest to attempt to make a profit obviously the more debt that you take out to invest the less you can sustain even small shocksIt is easy to point fingers at greedy Wall Street because investment banks were at the center of the crisis but it is much harder to say throw them all in jail   Remember none of the people involved from homebuyers who walked out on to predatory lenders who put them there to the Wall Street guys that sold out assets they knew had turned sour to the asleep at the wheel credit raters to handsoff government regulators actually broke any lawsThe case can be made especially in the case of the investment bankers and realtors that lines were crossed and legal debate should continue  But the idea that you can round up those responsible for an epidemic that had its roots in so many factors across a decade and more is naive  Better questions are what are we doing to keep all these parties in check now who are we choosing to replace and force out and how are we making better choices in who we allow to be in these positions in the first place,0,cdofp58,1rlfxm,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2

mrkarlis,The government is connected to it in the way that they closed state construction oversight department in  transferring those duties to municipalities but without giving them sufficient power  basically they can only check documentation and issuedeny building permits but what happens afterwards is barely controlled  However it is probably a combination of many reasons such as      people are always complaining that cabinet ministers dont feel responsible for what happens in the country that they dont accept political accountability By resigning the Prime Minister has a chance of gaining huge popular support It might sound weird but the minds of people are easily influenced especially  in the wake of such tragedies I mean the President has always been seen as an exbanker with zero representative skills and questionable morality but when he called the roof collapse basically mass murder hes suddenly seen as some sort of hero who tells it like it is The Prime Minister on the other hand has always had both lovers and haters but more from the first group as hes won the last  elections he wouldnt win the th though as his party is increasingly unpopular His party is beyond salvation but he personally will now have enough support to pretty much go whatever path he chooses Has already confirmed not to lead the new government though   He is rumored to have good chances of becoming the new Chairman of European Commission Its no secret that he is liked in Brussels and that he likes working there as well Maybe this is in preparation of his return to European politics   The last half a year has been very hard for the government  constant conflicts between the coalition parties resignations of ministers etc A very serious problem has become the nationalistic party NA acting up and generally being a nuisance but without them the government doesnt have majority support and cant make any important decisions It would only make sense to create a new coalition but apparently the Prime Minister doesnt want to   Emotions The PM is known for being very introvert and emotionless I mean once he made a joke at a debate and it became local Youtube sensation due to its sheer unexpectedness However today when announcing stepping down the man was close to tears no one has ever seen him like that It is possible the supermarket tragedy did affect him emotionally i mean he did get to the location that night and probably saw dead bodies being excavated and the people waiting news about their loved ones behind the police tape In a way the tragedy did have an effect on nearly everyone in the country even those who were not harmed in it  Guilt tripping the Mayor of the capital city into resignation or at least seriously damaging his reputation as strictly speaking the Mayor has more political responsibility in this event as construction oversight is now up to municipalities The mayor is from the currently most popular political party However what would the PM gain by this now is not entirely clear The Mayor is pretty pissed though and was quite uncooperative today with the journalists    Although the actual reasons will probably be revealed in time theres no denying the roof collapse has had at least some impact on this decision and he states it as the main one as a new leader is necessary who could lead the government in these hard time Its a shame really This PM has set a record by having lead the government for nearly  years straight He took control during the economical crisis and managed to get the country back on its feet while no one else even dared to accept the challenge The fact that the country is joining Eurozone this January is also mainly thanks to the PM and his Minister of Finance On the other hand maybe its time for a new PM to come if not for other reason then just for the sake of change to see what it brings,0,cdom6qo,1rlji9,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2
ANewMachine,Do you mean actionable illegal discrimination or moral discrimination or literal discrimination Ill answer all Is it illegal No Its legal to discriminate on a bona fide qualification for a job You can discriminate against a blind man in hiring for truck drivers A black person cannot generally portray a white person in film without unreasonable steps to accommodate their physical difference probably CGIing their entire body or wearing crazy amounts of makeup and prosthesisIs it morally wrong discrimination Depends on the character IMO If whiteness is a part of the character its not a problem For instance CyclopsScott Summers is white in all incarnations that I know of Hes been white for fiftyodd years and its a big part of his character Refusing to cast a black man in the role isnt morally wrong because one of the qualities of the character is that hes a rich WASPy white kid If its a new character and theyre denied the part solely because they want a white guy thats a bit different A great example is Ellen Ripley who was originally just Ripley and written totally androgynous  that is the character had no gender in the script If thatd been the case and they turned Sigourney Weaver down just for being a woman then itd be a moral problem IMOIs it literal discrimination Certainly but we do that all the time Buy the namebrand ketchup instead of the generic Discrimination Any time youre making a choice between two fairly similar things thats dictionary discriminationgtthe power of making fine distinctions discriminating judgment She chose the colors with great discriminationFrom herehttpdictionaryreferencecombrowsediscrimination,3,cdog2hf,1rlk07,explainlikeimfive,new,17,14

shotgunscribe,TL DR Its the directors edit The standard theatrical version is the producersThere are always artistic differences between how the director wants the finished product to be and what the producers think will make them the most moneyFilm editors work with directors but for the producers This means the film can be shorter and simpler that what the director envisioned and without potentially controversial scenes as producers think that giving people a film that they can switch off to which wont offend them will earn them the biggest returnIf these artistic differences are significant or of the film is successful enough for producers to owe their director a favour theyll release a directors cut Usually this earns the producers even more money,0,cdogi4f,1rlkwj,explainlikeimfive,new,5,5
deepsea,Although the director is a key man in making the movie its the studio and the producers that are the top dogs  In the end they make the decisions of what they want and do not want in the movie  Where directors may be more focused on the artistic value of the film the studio and the producers may be more interested in the commercial value  Unfortunately artistic value and commercial value dont always mixIn many cases the directors cut contains a lot more footage  It includes stuff like more sideplots and extended scenes  However producers tend to like shorter movies  Producers are afraid that longer movies will bore the audiences especially the movie watchers that are not film buffs but are more interested in getting their bang for their buck  So producers tend to cut out a lot of scenes they dont think are necessary to keep the film nice and short and keep the audience entertained  Also some producers dont like the darker elements of a film  Most people like happy stories with happy endings  Dark and depressing movies can be very good artistically but it turns off a lot of people  So the producer might cut scenes where the films hero is shown to be an alcoholic that abuses his wifeAnother reason is censorship  Things like sex and violence might compliment the film artistically but it reduces the films target audience  A film that a has lower rating has more potential viewers than a film rated R because now younger children and teenagers can watch the movie as opposed to just adults,0,cdogol1,1rlkwj,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1

ltrain,Vegas betting is fairly simply the point spread will always apply to the home team so if the game is Pittsburgh v Baltimore and the spread is  that would mean Baltimore the home team would have to beat Pittsburgh the visiting team by more than  points to win the bet  Pittsburgh would win the bet if Baltimore won by less than  or they win or tie the game  The game would push if Baltimore wins by exactly  points and both sides would get their bets back as there is no winner  The  indicates the odds plus the vigorish or vig the money the casino charges to place a bet with them of the bet  In the US we always use odds in terms of  In Europe they use odds in terms of a fraction  If it is a minus like  you would need to bet  to make   If it is positive like  you would win  for every  bet  The overunder of a game refers to the total number of point of both teams being over or under a total  If for example the Pittsburgh v Baltimore game had a overunder of  and the final score was Pittsburgh  Baltimore  the total points scored is  and all people who bet the over win  Pushes also apply to over under bets  The vigorish will also apply to this kind of bet  Parlays are when you bet multiple games on the same ticket for enhanced odds  Basically the odds would stack on top of each other  If you picked two games both at   If both win your new odds become Finally lets talk about teasers  You can if you wish to you can change the lines of a game by  to  points in exchange for getting less odds  A typical two team teaser of six points is   You must win both bets to win the teaser  If a bet pushes the results will vary based on how much the bet is teased and where you placed the bet some sports books count a push as a loss on a three team teaser of  points     Hope that helps,0,cdogxno,1rlky3,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1
InfiniteAmbiguity,So you mention the minus sign next to the spread  First understand the purpose of a spread which one mechanism for equalizing teams that are mismatched from a talent perspective  So assume that the very worst NFL team is playing against the very best NFL team at the best teams stadium  Obviously everybody expects the best team to win and to win by a lot  And the best team will win this matchup  out of every  times this kind of game is played  If everyone could just best straightup on who will win risking only  juice then everyone will always bet on the best team everyone will win  out of  times lose only  out of  times while the sports book will lose big  out of  times and win only  out of  times  Obviously this will quickly bankrupt the sports book and will be too easy and no fun for the bettors  So one thing the sports book does to fix this problem is to set a point spread  The point spread says lookat the final score deduct the pointspread points from the favored teams final score and calculate who wins after that deduction  In our example above lets say the pint spread is  for the best team and the final score turns out  for the best team and  for the worst team So the best team won the game but did they win against the point spread  Subtract the  from the best teams  total points and you get  points for the best team which is till more than the worst teams  points and so the best teams bettors win while the worst teams bettors lose  Butassume that the finalscore turns out instead to be  for the best team and  for the worst team In this case we subtract the  from the best teams score and get  again but now were comparing that  points against the spread with the worst teams  points In this case the best team and its bettors lost against the spread and the worst team and its bettors won against the spread  Obviously if the team giving the points the one favored to win and so has the minus sign actually losesthe game outrightthen you dont even need to do the math because they already lost even before you subtract the point spread from their final score MYou can get the same result by leaving the favored teams final score alone and instead ADDING the pointspread number to the worst teams final score so that in the latter case you would leave the best teams score at  and add the  to the worst teams  points and get the worst team winning with  points over the best teams   This is just an alternative way of counting so dont be confused  The winnerloser result is the same under either calculation method The juice will apply here too and the samepossibilities and consequences of a push are also applicable here  But unlike the overunder here you dont care at all about total points scored You only care here about who wins and by how much  There are many variations on this but this is the general framework There re other ways to equalize the mismatched teams such as not using a pointspread but instead using a money line but maybe we can discuss that another time  ,1,cdoh5mv,1rlky3,explainlikeimfive,new,1,0
InfiniteAmbiguity,In general the overunder refers to a threshold of something and youre betting that this something will actually end up being over or under the established threshold  most commonly the threshold is the total points by both teams scored in the entire game but it could also be total points by one team in the game or total points by one or both teams in a half or quarter or total fumblesinterceptionsturnovers by one or both teams in the game or half or season or one teams total wins in a season or one teams total points in a season or anything at all For simplicity lets say that were dealing with the most common  the overunder for total points in lets say a late December game between the Green Bay Packers and the Kansas City Chiefs Its going to be cold the offenses have been performing poorly and the defenses have been playing well  So for these reasons and others the odds makers set the overunder at a relatively low number  lets say  So with a  overunder the odds makers are inviting you to guess whether the total number of points scored by both teams combined in the game will be over  or under  You dont care who wins who loses or by how much You only care how many total points are scored  So lets say you think it will be a very high scoring game with total points above  and so you bet  on the over  total points This means that if the total points go above the  overunder threshold then you get your  back plus  more from the sports book  But if youre mistaken and the total points stay under  then you lost by betting on the over so you just lose your  and get nothing back The converse is true if you bet the other way obviously  Notice that you risked  to win  This is because these straight wagers typically require you to risk  more than you stand to win You risk  to win   to win   to win  and so on This  extra you pay on losses is usually called the juice  Final point here  What happens if the total points scored in the game are exactly equal to   In that case its a tie  known as a push  and so you get only your risked money back minus the juice In this case you put  at risk to win  but the game pushed so you will get  back of your risked  and you will lose the  juice  So this is a quick summary There are many possible variations Feel free to ask any questions Illanswer your pointspread question separately  ,1,cdoglu4,1rlky3,explainlikeimfive,new,1,0

TimeTravellerSmith,You cant judge a modern CPU by its clock speed alone anymore  For example an old Pentium  was sitting around Ghz or so but the i GHz is orders of magnitude fasterYou can only use clock speed in comparisons between identical CPUs like two Ivy Bridge is or two AMD Zambezis  You cant just say well the AMD is sitting at Ghz and the i is only Ghz and come to the conclusion that the former is faster,0,cdoilez,1rlspc,explainlikeimfive,new,3,3
DiscIn,Ghz is a measure of cycles per second  A CPU executes instructions  Imagine that your CPU is an assembly line and an instruction is a product that is being manufactured in the assembly line  The Ghz or cycles per second is the speed it takes for the product to move from one stage in the assembly line to the next stage  Its up to the design of the processor to determine how much work is actually done in each stage  For example the Pentium  had something stages in its pipeline some of which I believe did no actual workAnyways there is more that goes into the quality of a CPU than just the speed  For example number of cores how many physical processors presence of hyper threading multiple hardware threads per core size of cache how much does the CPU hold in its fast memory before having to go to RAM etc,0,cdoj6r5,1rlspc,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2
TedTschopp,A processor that is a Ghz processor can perform  single step operations a second  However a processor doesnt complete most calculations in one operation  Many operations take more than one step  So the way you get speed increases is to decrease the number of steps it takes to do some unit of workTake long division for example  Most people learn math by starting with addition then subtraction then multiplication and finally division  The reason for this is that each of those skills build on each other  So in order to do a simple division problem you need to know how to do addition subtraction multiplication  So if you were building a computer to do math you would start with addition and it would take one step to add two numbers  Then when you did multiplication you would need to take more than one step to do that work because multiplication requires more than one unit of addition  Finally when you write your code to do division you would need to do both multiplication addition and subtraction  So you would get one request to divide two numbers done in say  steps where the addition of those two numbers would only take one step  Now lets say you learn some shortcuts in doing long division and you realize that you dont need to do so many steps  Thats what happens when you go from say an i processor to an i processor  That i has a lot more tricks up its sleeve in doing long divisionDoes that make sense,0,cdokk5q,1rlspc,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1

Koooooj,Sig figs is a measure of uncertainty  In science a number without any indication of uncertainty is essentially meaningless  For example say I tell you to prepare for a party and that therell be  people there  If you take that number as exact then you could have exactly  servings of beer goldfish crackers  However youll want to be prepared if that number wasnt exactmaybe I know that number is accurate to there could be between  and  people so you should really have  servings to be on the safe side  Perhaps though Im really bad at estimating and I only know the number of people to a factor of there could be between  and  people  These are three very different views that all would be reported as  people N just with different values of N  This is the importance of stating uncertainty in scienceNow for dealing with uncertainty properly you have to do whats called uncertainty propagation analysisyou know the uncertainty of each number you use and you use some math which is ultimately derived from some basic calculus to figure out what the limits are on your answer  This is a lot to deal with especially in early science classes so sig figs are usedThus sig figs are all about representing how certain you are with a number you state and it all comes down to how you write a number  For example if you write  then its clear that you didnt mean to write you had enough certainty to carry the decimal out to   However its also clear that you werent confident enough to give the answer as  or perhaps   Thus this is two significant figuresthe  and the   For some other numbers  is  sig figsyou included the   is only  sig figsyou didnt have any choice in including the zero here  is  sig figsthe explicit decimal after the zero indicates that the  is accurate There is no way to state  to  sig figs without scientific notation    is  sig figsthe   and   This is the only way to state the number  with  sig figs  is only  sig figs  The first zero is meaningless and should be omitted  is  sig figsthe zero is surrounded by nonzero digitsOnce you figure out how many sig figs your inputs have you have to figure out how many your output has  For example         Here each number has  sig figs  When you carry out the math treating each number as exact you get   How should this number be reported  Just as  random parenthetical comment to indicate the period is not a decimal point  For addition operations each number is only precise to a given place value ie ones tens hundreds etc  Whichever number is the least precise determines what the significance of the answer is  This makes senseif your first number is  then you cant suddenly know the sum of    to any precision more accurate than Another example         Here  has two sig figs while  has   If we carry out the math with exact values then you get   How should this be reported  It should be rounded to  sig figs regardless of place value  The most significant number is  so that number gets to stay  The nd is  so it gets to stay  The final  and  arent significant enough to stay so they get set to zero  However since were rounding the  causes the  to be increased ie weve rounded  to be just   The math here is       This becomes more clear in scientific notation          Here we can see that you can pull all of the  n out and deal with them separately then look at the remaining numbers on an even scale  The rule for multiplying numbers is that you count the sig figs of each number then round your result to that many sig figsA final thing to consider is the idea of exact values  For example in the formula for the area of a circle you have A  pi  r   How many sig figs does pi have  Infinity  Not because its irrational or anything like that  It has infinite sig figs because you dont measure pi at any pointits just a value you introduce  Similarly the number  in the exponent of that equation is an exact value and has infinite sig figs even though a  would normally be only  sig fig  When you add subtract multiply or divide an exact value you get no loss of precisionNote that when doing a combined operation you keep track of sig figs according to order of operations but never round until the end  For example        Here your first move is to multiply  by  which yields  with  sig figs both  and  have  sig figs and you were multiplying  You then add    and get   Where do you round this   was actually the number that determines the sig figs of the result since only the  and the  are significant in this intermediate result so you have to round to the nearest hundred  Your result is   Note that It would have been improper to round  to  before carrying out the additionthis would have caused the result of addition to be  which would then be rounded up to   The rule to remember here is that you never round intermediate values even if you are keeping track of how many sig figs they haveObviously sig figs are a cumbersome system that isnt perfect  For formal scientific papers it is expected that proper uncertainty analysis is performed  However for less formal approaches it is good to use the sig fig rules to remember that numbers are inherently uncertain  The rules to remember are Rules for determining number of sig figs All nonzero digits all zeroes to the right of the decimal no zeroes to the left of the first nonzero digit all zeroes in between nonzero digits all zeroes between the lowest nonzero digit and an explicitly stated decimal When adding or subtracting the result is only as precise as the number that has the largest place value of uncertainty When multiplying or dividing the result has as many significant figures as the number that has the fewest significant figures Intermediate values of a multistep piece of arithmetic should never be rounded,0,cdok03z,1rlu8t,explainlikeimfive,new,4,4
TimeTravellerSmith,Sig Figs are how many numbers that you actually want to look at when you write something downSo pi is something like and on and on  But we dont want to write all those down so we say were gonna use  sig figs which means that well call it   Then when you want to start using sig figs in math operations you have to keep track of what has what and how many you can carry over  So unless you have to track how many are used for operations for exams its best to try to keep as much as you can during operations in your calculator and then round at the end for the most accurate number  You would end up rounding to be as accurate as the numbers youre givenFor example if youre told to calculate how much time it takes a mass to fall to earth and youre told to use a mass of kg then youd round your answer to  sig figs in the end even though you might know that acceleration is mss and the distance is  cm,1,cdoiwhp,1rlu8t,explainlikeimfive,new,2,1

opensketchbook,ITT A horde of libertarians and a very narrow view Lemme balance that by giving a more leftist POVThe smallscale examples given in the other examples whereby rise in wages and rise in living expenses are directly correlated is true inside of a smallscale closed system However it fails to account for changes that occur at larger scalesFirst off you are absolutely right Just raising the minimum wage will do very little on its own However it is an important part of creating a demand side economy Youll also want to ensure business regulation will prevent monopolies from emerging in the new markets created by the new demand and you want to make sure your tax scheme is progressive enough to prevent the rich from getting so rich they flip it around again creating the situation you described So yes preventing an executive from making too much more than the workers can help but you have to be careful not to overdo it you still need investment capitalSo why have a demandside economySimply put the health of an economy is tied to the flow of money If money is changing hands it generally means things are getting done goods and services are trading hands and have good value associated with it and you have an example of the old saying A rising tide lifts all boats While the actual value of individual units of currency might change in an economy that is both growing and health purchasing power increases As growth is primarily fueled by technological innovation and doesnt really look to slow down increasing the value of labour to match is healthyThe next thing to understand is that poor people and rich people handle their money very differently Poor people they spend their money as soon as they get it on things like rent food clothes medical care etc They dont and cant hold on to very much By contrast rich people traditionally either save their money or shunt their money off into the financial sector where it is invested Ideally that money is invested in ways that enhance the economy by keeping the money flowing into businesses especially small businesses on a competitive stock market and into limited markets That dynamic of investiture is what forms the basis of the financial sector of the marketNow something interesting happens when the system gets top heavy when the richer portion of society has a disproportionately large chunk of the money compared to the poorer half like for example in a society which believes in supply side trickle down economics Essentially this causes the financial sector especially small portions of it to become bloated with capital Money is invested at a faster rate than growth can keep up with because money is not the only limiting factor on growthInvestment is rarely straightforward Oftentimes an investment is actually an investment into an investment ad nausium which is finally being invested in the actual market What happens is that large portions of the economy are segregated off circulating only in an incestuous subset of the financial industry chasing real value to be invested in for growth Other people usually middle class people who want to be rich take out loans in order to invest in these seeminglyvaluable markets Pretty soon there is more money being invested than the things are actually worth When people realize this has happened and they wont see a return on their investments the bubble popThis is known as a Bust and it involves the sudden loss of value in a market as everyone tries to get out as once This not only releases a bunch of money back into the wild leading to inflation but saddles a bunch of people with worthless investments they cant get rid of Booms and busts are commonplace in an economy without regulation they are extremely vicious creating periods of extreme growth followed by even worse depressionsSo why does this matter for minimum wageBecause the people making minimum wage dont invest in the financial market Money comes to them through their jobs and is immediately spent on stuff which pays other people their salaries so they can spend it on stuff and so on and so forth When you pay minimum wage workers more they still do that but they have more options They might be able to afford to eat out and eat better so new markets open up for restaurants and quality food They can buy electronics and entertainment so those markets expand Competition in these markets is no longer strictly a race to the bottom in terms of prices which creates a more diversified economy as luxury options move in You still have people who own those companies and make lots of money and are rich but they are not making quite as much as they were their profit margins are narrower further encouraging competition and reducing monopolization and less money is shunted off into the financial sector so booms are not so frantic and busts are not so drasticA demandside economy sees more regular stable growth in markets that are more in line with the longterm value of a market because most of the money is coming from consistent spenders the poor instead of investment chasers the rich The growth of the economy is seen directly by everyone instead of just to investors Rich people still exist and still invest providing the raw capital needed to break new ground into fresh markets and reaping the benefits but because the system is more bottomheavy investments are more metered and safer Less runaway booms and bustsEither way you get growth usually fairly comparable numbers when you look at it over long periods of time But in a supply side economy where minimum wage is low thus devaluing labour and massively increasing profits for the rich the economy spikes and drops harshly wasting capital and hurting the people at the bottom who cant afford to have their labour devalued any further In a demandside economy the growth is a steady line with little dips and rises Less money is squandered and prices are more stable so your money goes furtherSo everyone else here is absolutely right in a closed system raising the minimum wage would be meaningless But its not a closed system the economy of labour exists alongside things like financial sector like government and public spending and like the global marketTLDRHigher minimum wage and redistribution of the economy so poor people have a higher proportion of the money leads to steadier more stable economic growth with better competition by growing new markets in proportion to the consumer rather than the investor However this sort of economy also requires greater regulation and progressive taxation,3,cdott95,1rlx2u,explainlikeimfive,new,12,9

NeedAChainsaw,So the reason people want to raise minimum wage is because itll force the distribution of money to lower income people  You know how they talk about how  of Americans control  of the wealth or something like that  A higher minimum wage its argued would force employers to pay employees more and would cause less of a rift between upper and lower classes The other side of that coin though is that ultimately it devalues the dollar and its more expensive to hire employees  The result might end up being inflation dollar devaluation and fewer jobs although theyd pay more  Thats the basics as I see it Im not an economist but Im pretty sure Ive got a grasp on the general concept,5,cdojmeq,1rlx2u,explainlikeimfive,new,8,3

thab,In most cases it cant If under a free market your job is worth  then placing a minimum wage at  eliminates your job You dont get a pay raise it has become illegal for you to work at the wage that somebody is wiling to pay you and that you want to work atNot only that but the person down the hall making  who depended on your work also gets fired The person making  who can do his job without you but less efficiently gets a pay cutOf course now the company cant produce as much as it used to or at the same quality so it has to charge its customers a lot more and give them a lot less Basically you end up with a lot of slack in the economy it shows up on the supply and demand curves as two triangles that are wasted otherwise known as deadweight loss If the company has to raise its price and lower its quality beyond a certain point then no customer will buy its products and either it will close down firing everybody in town or move firingrelocating everybody in town Basically minimum wage is an almost entirely useless tool to improve standards of living and equality Thats important to note since improving standards of living and equality are extremely important things to doSo when can a minimum wage be useful Well in the case of a labour monopsony single employer a regulated wage can help prevent employee abuse Setting it too high will cause the problems described above but not setting it at all can cause the opposite problem so setting it as close to the right wage as possible helps to reduce the inefficiency Minimum wage also serves as a signal While perfectly efficient economies wouldnt need a signal for the ideal wage imperfect markets the kinds we have use all kinds of signals If I am a small entrepreneur and I want to know how much to pay an inexperienced parttime unskilled labourer in a nondangerous job I might not know how to look up industry statistics Instead I take the minimum wage as the indication as to what that person is worth If they have some skills I might take minimum wage as the signal and adjust upwards by a certain percentage While any level of minimum wage will prevent some people from working low enough minimum wages will cause almost no negative impact on the economy but also serve as a signal that avoids lowskilled workers getting abused out of ignorance In the information age we are finding better signals but the minimum wage is still a useful one Hopefully we will be able to completely do away with it in the near future but today it still serves a useful purpose The problem is that some people think its purpose is to raise general wages but in reality it can only serve to help prevent extreme cases of abuse There are other tools that must be used in order to bridge the income gap and help raise the standard of living for the most poor,4,cdorxzg,1rlx2u,explainlikeimfive,new,8,4

TheGreaterest,The issue of minimum wage is that it is not tied to the CPI Consumer Price Index as in the money made through minimum wage ISNT enough to pay for general living costs The point of minimum wage is to ensure that companies cant translate low wages into increased profits for the CEO shareholders etc In a perfect capitalist economy where everyone knows exactly how much their labor is worth and there is absolutely no question about how much you should get paid minimum wage is unecissary You would make whatever is fair and would allow you to provide for yourself as that wage would be tied to the price of goods given the fact that firms would pay their workers based on what they would make based on how much they sell Unfortunately in real life I have no idea how much people accross the country with the same job as myself make so I cant tell my employer exactly how much I am worth A minimum wage allows the goverment to help determine how much a persons labor can be worth at the bare minimum preventing exploitation of workers and ensuring that at the minimum people can survive when they have a jobThe current minimum wage is no longer sufficient to provide enough for basic survival needs I and many others believe it must be raised to ensure that workers are payed at very least enough to survive given the current CPI Living Wagetldr Minimum wage ensures workers arent exploited and no longer is high enough to allow people to maintain a reasonable standard of living Edit Typo,0,cdoslar,1rlx2u,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1

bjornartl,Minimum wage is a little bit like game theory Look at the climate debate The cold war This is why we have treaties Everyone wants to be the one that has cheaper production Or has more military force More whatever the conflict is about The solution to such conflicts are treaties where all parties decide they are better off if ALL parties involved reduce equally The reason why this is not always possible is because they cant always decide what is equal or who should be more equal than the others When it comes to minimum wage its a little easier Theres a higher power a government who can decide who what and when these treaties should count for A government could for instance enforce a minimum wage for the food industry only This would help avoid the outsourcing a lot of labor but its not like the fast food industry would stop selling food in the US Unlike a phonetech assistant these jobs require working hands on US soil Thing is that probably most work that can be done without being located in the US for less than  probably already is outsourced so you might as well not make it limited to say the food industry So wouldnt the prices go up on their products Not necessarily They dont pay people more if they make more revenue The price of labor is mostly decided by supply and demand This means that every time a nation is losing jobs and markets then there is a high demand for jobs that they can take advantage of These swings will always happen Nations change and then it takes time to adapt to new markets more suitable for their nation In the US this would probably mean a higher focus on better education towards tech and greater investment in tech development along with other particularly and less about manual labor but thats a way different discussion Point is that swings will happen and they always take time to adjust So basically it does two things  it helps reduces between classes in the US These classes are more or less made up by  stands of sociaty a people who have ownership in US companies who either succeeds in markets suitable for the US nation andor outsources b The people who work for these companies in the US because they make up a profession that is desirable to said companiesmarkets and c which is the last and lowest stand which are the people who are not desired by any of these marketscompanies but does jobs they cannot outsource Minimum wage helps the second classb but more importantly it prevents massive abuse against the third stand of society  It helps spreadread keep more money within the US Money spent towards thirdc class professions are money spent on services they more or less mustve spent money on anyways This again leads to less buyer force directed towards imported goods and pleasures Both these points are economically profitable for the US Being a first world country they are expected to have a certain amount of welfare although it is shit compared to the rest of the first worldwestern world Having more people be able to afford their daily lives through their own work is good And who pays for this The middle and upper class through the services they purchase Then less money goes overseas Now who want you to think this is a waste of money Well the upper classa first and foremost but also to a great extent class b Togather they make up a big enough voters pool so that they have a great chance and Id argue they have already to a great deal too steer politics in their own advantage through political campaigns and advertisement ,0,cdp3btr,1rlx2u,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1

Comicbookguy,A mixture of a few things  Massive supply lines took months for ships to cross over the pond back then  The French Spanish and Dutch all declared war on the British  they used the opportunity to stretch the British military the Royal Navy in particular in order to dilute the British influence over Europe etc  Remember the British Empire was rather big at the time  George Washington bolstered the US ranks by both using positive incentives for enlistment and by ensuring the troops took precautions against disease  Sickness claimed more lives than those taken in battle and although Washington lost a lot to the British he kept his troop numbers upBasically the Americans had to only prolong the conflict as the British couldnt affordmanage a lengthy war so far from home with more closer concerns bloody FrenchIm English btw and not in anyway bitter but I dont quite understand why you treasure the Statue of Liberty so much  Yes its a remindertribute to a well fought and hard earned independance but its also a reminder of the fact that the French aristocracy spend so much on aiding the Americans that its own people were literally starving to death which precipitated the French revolution  No offence but the French didnt give a flying fuck about the Americans at the time since for them it was all about the power struggle with the British,1,cdokdjf,1rlxz1,explainlikeimfive,new,2,1

DeletedByMods, Reddit handles far more data than Healthcaregov and its far more customized to the user than the data on Healthcaregov which makes the server load even more of a challenge for redditHeathcaregov does however need to integrate with many different systems whereas reddit has the benefit of not needing to integrate with anything  its all their own stuff from top to bottom  This creates some initial design issues but it shouldnt really create a load issue if the initial architecture of the software is saneThe real answer is that Healthcaregov was a trainwreck of extremely poor project management due to the cronyism exercised by the Obama administration in hiring CGI Its just a really shoddy terribly built piece of software because of poor business analysis poor design and poor project managementFor example healthcaregov is powered by a remarkably shitty and remarkably obscure xmlbased data tier  Not only does their chosen data tier not scale because of its bad tech it also drastically limited to talent pool they could hire from because it wasnt an industry standard technology Heathcaregov is a textbook example of cronyism in government contracting and why its a bad thing,4,cdoojar,1rly93,explainlikeimfive,new,7,3

thegreatgazoo,A big thing that reddit does is use the Amazon server cloud which is hosted in a couple data centers using similar technology used to host the amazon web site It has some magic in it that as server loads get greater it automatically turns on additional servers and when server loads slow down it starts to turn off excess servers you get charged by the hour based on how many are running Reddit involves posting cat and banana pictures vs health care information so it doesnt have the same security requirements that healthcaregov has so the amazon cloud might not be appropriate to host healthcaregov Another big difference is the chatter between the website and the browser Generally speaking the fewer back and forth messages between a website the faster it runs  A normal website might have say  or  messages going back and forth to display a page Iirc version  of healthcaregov had something like  messages which generally indicates sloppy programming and or gluing a bunch of rd party libraries together instead of writing your own code They also scaled it to handle the same traffic as Medicaregov not understanding that there are more people under age  than over  ,0,cdoov3i,1rly93,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1

japko,There is an interesting theory about that actually Do you know the Jesus illusionhttpfilesmyoperacomDavaalbumsJesusIllusionpngOur mind usually tries to adapt to things In the said illusion our mind notices that there is a big black blob in our sight that carries no information with it It makes no sense So its best to ignore it Our perception mechanisms start to create a counterreaction  something that would even out the nonsensical blob and make it one with the background The longer the blob is there not moving the stronger this counter reaction be After a couple of minutes when you stop looking on the blob and look on say a wall you will see the counterreaction of your brain  an image that happens to look like the face of Jesus It could be anything though Your nose for example is removed from your sight in a similar way only you never get to see the counterreaction because you always have a nose in its place hopefullyNow the same applies for all stimuli but there is an interesting glitch in some of them There was an interesting study about people who give blood When you do it for the first time its scary painful and takes some time to get back to feeling  good after the deed but your organism creates an antireaction  and when the pain wears off you actually feel pretty good physically The more you give blood the less scared you are the more used to the procedure you are and in effect the less pain you feel also thanks to the feelgood counterreactionBUT The major finding in this study is that with time the counterreaction does NOT fade like the initial painful stimulus does It stays on the same level making giving blood pleasant some even described is as addictiveIt is hypothesised that the same mechanism happens with other things like cold showers blue cheese wine and finally to the point beer Its not tasty at first but your brain creates a countermeasure to relieve you in your beerdrinking pain an antitaste if you will With time you get used to the taste but the magnitude of the positive antitaste stays the same so you end up enjoying the whole thingtldr its thanks to a counterreaction to negative stimuli that your brain createsI know this from a lecture on positive psychology but I managed to find some online sources httpwwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed  Its not exactly what I meant nothing about perception illusions in the abstract but it proves at least a part of what I said,10,cdonfbp,1rlzc3,explainlikeimfive,new,46,36

ArtP,The following is from a recent post on my weblog   httpeconomicswordpresscombitcoinsgoldandpyrite Bitcoins and gold may have some speculative value but as a solution to economic problems or as a form of money they are on a par with pyriteAs I understand bitcoins their main feature is that the supply of them is intended to be finite  This will make them great for speculators but as a form of money they come with the same problem as gold and that is that the amount of money in an economy needs to be flexible  Through history there have been a number of situations where authorities have tried to limit the money sometimes by trying to force a gold standard and the result has been serious depression  I wonder if bitcoins were invented in part because gold is in limited supplycircleBitcoinProbably the increasing interest in  bitcoins is a psychological reaction to economic uncertainty and fears of hyperinflation which would wipe out the savings and pensions of a lot of people  Given that the economic crisis is based on problems in the resource base gold and bitcoins may not be useful  A better hedge would be a market gardenAnother feature of bitcoins is that they can be used online anonymously   This makes them great for illegal transactions   No wonder some regulators are saying bitcoins should come under their jurisdictionSo far as I can see the main use of bitcoins is for speculationThe author of this comment has a web log on economics at httpseconomicswordpresscom,0,cdolcmf,1rm39g,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2

QuickSpore,Needless to say the facts in the matter are disputed Prior to WWI the area known as Palestine was controlled by the Ottoman Empire Around this time there was a group of Jews living in Palestine all across the Middle East really And the European Jews were tired of being treated like second class citizens Hitler was far from the first European leader to put blame on the Jews or to round them up and kill them He was pretty much the best at it though So these European Jews chose their old ancestral land as the one which would become a Jewish homeland Bit by bit Jews moved to Palestine buying land and setting up communities The Turks werent too happy about that The last thing they wanted was another strong ethnicity in the empire But they never cut off immigration completely And small numbers of Jews continued to move into the areaWhen WWI broke out the British made a lot of promises They promised the area to the Arabs They promised the area to the Jews And they promised to split it up and rule it with the French Of course the promise they kept was to rule it themselves as a protectorate Both the Jews and the Arabs there were no Palestinians yet took offense at this And both Jewish and Arab terrorist coups formed And a three way low level microwar broke out The British clamped down on Jewish migration incidentally dooming a lot of Jews but a small amount of illegal immigration continued to take placeBy the end of WWIi it was clear the British werent going to hold on to the area And frankly they didnt want it anymore more trouble than it was worth Step one was the area east of the Jordan river was spun off as TransJordan There were very few Jews and so it was clear that would be Arab regardless But dividing the area west of the Jordan was a mess And there was even a question of whether it should even be divided at all After a few years the British tossed the problem to the UN And in  the UN came up with a plan the area would be split About  would go to the Arabs in Palestine  would go to the Jews and Jerusalem would become an international city It wasnt clear exactly how that last part would work out Largely the Jews said absolutely we accept And largely the Arabs said we dont accept And the British said screw it were leavingThe day the British left the Jews declared the formation of the state of Israel And the Arab nations all declared war on Israel I the end when the fighting was over Israel had most of Palestine Egypt had Gaza And Jordan had the West Bank Hundreds of thousands of Jews were forced from their homes all across the Middle East And a lot of Palestinians fled from their homes in what became IsraelIsrael was established as a Jewish democratic nation But it should be mentioned at this time that there were a lot of Arabs living in the new Israeli state And they are citizens to this day with voting rights and everything It should also be mentioned that Jews and Arabs are not treated exactly the sameAfter this Israel and the Arab states fought other additional wars And Israel conquered Gaza the West Bank Sinai and the Golan Heights Originally Israel held these territories with a promise of land for peace They gave the Sinai back to Egypt for a peace treaty But neither Egypt or Jordan wanted Palestine back And the Palestinians didnt have anyone willing and capable of negotiating with IsraelSomewhere about this time the Israelis got the bright idea that settling Israelis in the occupied territories would both make them more secure and induce the Palestinians to the table That didnt exactly work And some Israeli extremists view them as a chance to grab more or even all of Palestine and create a Greater IsraelSo right now the two parties are disagreeing on most everything The extremists on both sides would love to see the others driven into the sea And even the moderates cant agree on where borders should be if Arabs should be allowed to return to their old lands in Israel who gets Jerusalem and which parts And both sides regularly kill innocents on the other side making it harder to compromise ,0,cdopvj3,1rm94a,explainlikeimfive,new,6,6

SnafuCoaxer,Theres a huge number of reasons for this and Ill try touch on a few but its very important to first recognize a few assumptions Firstly youre coming at this from the perspective of someone who exists postrise of the West so youre going to look at the world as being on a sort of linear progression of technology That isnt how anyone viewed technology prior to the point that it changed radically in the span of a single lifetime so around the late thearly th century Also note that to someone in the periods were talking about these sort of differences in technology might not appear to exist and technology the concept only really exists in the popular mind by the early modern ageAnyway the main reasons I can think of that Europe ended up with superior technology to much of the rest of the world Geographically Europe isnt particularly well suited to farming especially Northern Europe While there are some very productive regions theres nothing like the Mekong Delta and the continent is often too cold or the terrain too undulating to grow large quantities of crop This means that agriculture is often very difficult This has three effects firstly it means that the population is less content with an agrarianbased society secondly it facilitates trade within the region Lastly its a huge limit on the growth of urban areas So Europe is typified by very dense very small urban settlements Those geographical factors set up the perfect environment for huge economic growth If I need to buy Egyptian grain I need something Egyptians cant produce themselves like wine Using far more modern economic theory we know that the most productive trade is done between highly specialized economies with very different advantages and this leads to increased wealth for all economies involved This develops rapidly in Europe however its not going to develop as well in South East Asia or North America where food is abundant and so trade in these places becomes a largely diplomatic exercise rather than a vital force Trade is a source of imported luxury goods not a vital lifeline for the majority of the population So we know that Europe is going to be more interconnected and wealthier in the long run than many other places with abundant food and smaller trade flows  Greater trade flows means that ideas travel faster through Europe than through other locations For example if im in Peru and everything I consume is locally produced there is little need for new ideas and more importantly if i did have an innovative idea it would likely never reach say Mexico without generations of people physically migrating However an innovative farming idea in Baghdad is likely going to reach Vienna in less than a year So the research base the knowledge that youve building off is much greater in Europe especially if you view Europe as a monolithic entity Socially the Black Death creates a need to radically restructure society This leads to the Renaissance period which triggers renewed interest in the Classical world and things like philosophy This causes the Reformation which for a bunch of highly contentious reasons leads to Northern Europe developing at a very fast pace this is in a large part due to Protestantism removing much of the outerworldliness of Catholicism and much of the comfort it provided its practitioners in terms of the promise of heaven Coupled with a lack of agricultural land and an abundance of fuel sources the Industrial Revolution occurs first in the region,0,cdosar9,1rmmct,explainlikeimfive,new,4,4
whatIsThisBullCrap,This is my own theory and as far as I know not commonly supported But Ill share it anyways because I think its at least a contributing factor Basically trade Specifically information trade Europe was very connected to much of the world and they were in constant contact with Arabia India China North Africa etc This meant that information most importantly technology could be shared The result of this is that technology advances faster Consider this basic example ammunition arches and plows just three random things that popped into my head are complicated technology They might each take  years to invent and perfect For a single culture to invent all three would take  years Or three different cultures could invent one each That way the whole old world has them in  years plus a couple for the information to spread Obviously technology doesnt work like this First of all it can take s of years before someone realizes the need or potential for something and then in a year it could be complete Theres also no reason you cant work on more than one piece of technology at the same time However this does demonstrate that having more peoples to invent technology that can be shared does speed of up the process On the other hand the Americans and southern Africans were more isolated In America the natives had ni contact with other peoples and even amongst themselves wasnt that common except for with a few select tribes In southern Africa it was a similar story Isolated tribes and even when Europeans began exploring the rest of the continent there was little trade as it was mostly colonozation and resourcehunting This means Americans and southern Africans didnt get the benefit of other societies inventions ,0,cdos9ks,1rmmct,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1

skorps,Im not entirely sure the difference between semi auto and auto but there is a difference between single shot and semi autoauto Single shot you lock the action in place and fire and all the force as to go out the end of the barrel Semi auto and auto redirect some of the gas back to the action to blow it back which allows the next bullet to load Maybe semi auto doesnt let as much as out since the action has more time between shots Some guns also have muzzle breaks which redirect some of the gas straight up at the end of the barrel to help counteract the gun rising from recoil which you are shooting in auto ,0,cdow0cd,1rmnm1,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1

Iamtheonewhobawks,Until the recent advent of Black Friday and its subsequent bleedover into this thanksgivings Black Thursday Thanksgiving was uniquely difficult to commercialize Its not a giftgiving holiday there are no costumes there is no emphasis on any one specific subcultureThere are no specific religious connotations there is no epic origin story That means that thanksgiving movies and songs and so on are relatively rare You can only make so many about eating a large birdThanksgiving is traditionally a holiday from the usual US holiday experience Every other one is surrounded by massive commercialization Christmas decorations show up in stores in October right alongside miles of cheap Halloween candy and disposable costumes Easter is all about pastel colored everything and since it is specifically christian anything Easterthemed will sell Valentines day a lets eat chocolate and fuck pseudoholiday is filled with obligatory purchases Buy your SO some valentines day themed foodclothesjewelrytrip or its considered deeply insensitiveNew Years is an inescapable media storm Fewer products to buy directly a million special things on TVBut Thanksgiving is just so hard to capitalize on Its not a party holiday like St Patricks day or Cinco De Mayo no presents are given no trips are scheduled The best anyone could think of was some cheap turkeyandnativeamerican decorationsOf course now we have Black Friday which started being a thing sometime around the new millennium and seems to be attempting to change Thanksgiving into a new Presidents Day or MLK Day A holiday where you celebrate specifically by going shopping I guess well see how that goesTLDR Thanksgiving is special because it is traditionally the one holiday where nobody tries to sell you anything It was Consumer Relaxation Day,4,cdoxgym,1rn00b,explainlikeimfive,new,11,7

InfamousBrad,Odd that nobody is bringing up the fact that while having festivals of thanksgiving was a Puritan custom they werent held on a regular schedule or even every year until  the year that President Lincoln declared that the last Thursday of November would forever be a day of thanksgiving for the fact that the war was turning around that it was beginning to look like America would survive its war with the rebelsBut it was also a good time to make an annual festival a month out from Christmas because the s overlap the time that Christmas presents like everything else in the home were turning into something you bought that came from factories instead of being things that you made at home or that your servants made for youSo American Thanksgiving became as big and important as it is because it overlaps four themes meets four strong needs that are very very American Its a foundational religious holiday among people who are still pushing the myth that America was founded as a Christian nation  Its a celebration of what was until fairly recently Americas most important and profitable export industry agriculture and  Its a celebration of military victory most often in modern times taking the form or reminding people to pray for our troops abroad in foreign wars  Its a ceremony marking the official beginning of the Christmas season with the rise of Thanksgiving America switched its Christmas season calendar from the traditional December th through January th to our current fourth Thursday of November through December thOne holiday that meets all of these needs is so useful to us that part of me wonders what other countries do to meet the same needs,1,cdp0xrd,1rn00b,explainlikeimfive,new,4,3
phibber,I spoke to an anthropologist who specialises in the American family and he had the following explanationThe American family is caught between the myth and reality of their existence  The myth is that the family is a cosy cohesive unit but the reality is that the American Dream drives families apart as each generation tries to do better than their parents often moving far away across the country  As a result family events like thanksgiving take on an important role in supporting the myth of the family unit despite the reality that it has splintered and fragmented,1,cdp1bjn,1rn00b,explainlikeimfive,new,3,2

cc,Most of these answers suck so Im going to try to give another perspective hereThanksgiving is one of a handful of holidays that is celebrated primarily with family  As far as I can tell it is rarely seen as an actual harvest holiday my grandpas farm finishes harvest in October before the frost but rather as a time for reuniting with family and enjoying an elaborate delicious multicourse homecooked meal together  And pie thats important  It is also a time for appreciating what you have food and a family to share it with if nothing else  And despite what some here are saying it absolutely is a time to learn about and reflect on our history  The pilgrim story isnt a completely happy one but it reminds us of why people came to America to begin with and what they had to go through to survive here  It is also a time to reflect on the story of the Native Americans both how they helped the pilgrims initially and how they treated each other later  Thinking about these things helps us recognize what most of us have to be grateful for  It is also a tradition that is rooted in our history and helps preserve a sort of cultural identityIf Thanksgiving is just about football and parades to you Im sorry,0,cdp4w93,1rn00b,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2

Fairleee,It depends on the context of the filming and the laws in various nations So in the UK for example if you are filming in public for the purpose of news or reporting or current events then you do not need to obtain consent This is because it is assumed that by being in public you have waived your right to privacy  after all anyone in the street can see you However it is usually considered good practice for companies filming to put up signs or notices that filming will be going on in the area so people are aware This is partly because it would be impractical to obtain verbal or written consent from everyone in the area However if you notice that you are filmed you do have the right to ask them not to identify youIn a private residence you do have to get permission to film someone so that they can be identified because it is not assumed that they have waived their right to privacy they are in a private place That tends to cover people who are being filmed in the background  when it comes to people being interviewed you typically would try and get a consent form in place so they are aware that they are being interviewed and the interview might be used However it is also generally expected that the person should be told what they are being interviewed about For example it would be completely unethical to tell someone that you are filming them about Christmas and then use them saying I think its wonderful in a piece about child pornography Obviously thats an extreme example but something that is intentionally misleading like that will make you liable to a lawsuit and if you intentionally misrepresent someone then that is illegalWhen it comes to filming for commercial purposes ie the purpose is to make money then you would typically need a consent form because entertainment is different to newscurrent affairs Again in a large crowd scene you can just use a general announcement that filming will be going on but if you are going to film someone intentionally and directly as opposed to just a shot of them in the background you should get consent simply to cover your own assSource I did some research on this for a friend who was looking up laws on consent for a film he was making Im not a lawyer so cannot guarantee this is  accurate also it is worth noting that laws very from country to country,0,cdovrcd,1rn288,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2

Mephysteaux,Gifts are not typically exchanged on Thanksgiving Strangers do typically wish each other a happy Thanksgivingholiday While Thanksgiving is traditionally a family holiday some people do seecall friends In particular if a friend isnt spending Thanksgiving with someone often due to being separated from their family its fairly customary to invite them to spend Thanksgiving with your family Native Americans rarely get thanked Religious people often thank God but the feeling of gratitude generally isnt directed at anything or anyone in particular unless theyre directly involved Its considered a generally American holiday so its celebrated by people regardless of their race religion or political affiliations I wouldnt say there are people who express AntiThanksgiving views but there are some who say the story is watered down and that the Thanksgiving story everyone knows takes away from the fact that Native Americans were abused by white settlers Also the big controversy recently is that a lot of employers especially in retail make their employees work on Thanksgiving This is partly because Black Friday which is considered one of the busiest shopping days of the year is tomorrow Thanksgiving is only one public holiday but many employers also give employees the following day off so they can have a day weekend and schools might be closed as early as Tuesday or Wednesday,0,cdowsk9,1rn8ci,explainlikeimfive,new,4,4
GreenTea,The history as I understand it simplified a day of Thanksgiving including a feast to thank God for a fortunate event or blessing is a tradition that goes way back In America there was a famous Thanksgiving in the th century when English settlers in Massachusetts joined with Native Americans to celebrate a successful harvest It really happened although it has been mythologized over the yearsFlash forward to the th century days of Thanksgiving have continued but with no set date The Civil War has torn the country apart and president Abraham Lincoln inspired by a citizens letter decides to declare a national day of Thanksgiving on the fourth Thursday of November Thats how it became the national holiday that it is today For much more detail see WikipediaModern ThanksgivingPeople of all faiths and nonbelievers celebrate the holiday to give thanks to their deity to just be gratefulappreciativeor just to have a big meal Many families try to get together hence the driving large distances for people who have moved awayGifts are not a traditional part of the holiday Its all about food family and for many Americans football Also watching parades mostly on TVYes it is normal to say Happy Thanksgiving or Happy Holiday especially this year with Hanukkah overlapping itFriends certainly could be involved although the focus is on family for most people However the night before Thanksgiving many old high school friends reunite because they have all come back to their parents homes after being away at college or moving awayUnfortunately actual Native Americans are not a big part of most public Thanksgiving eventsalthough Im sure it happens somewhereAmazingly Thanksgiving seems to be equally enjoyed by liberal and conservative Americans Food is universal  Theres not much antiThanksgiving sentiment although you do see some from Native American activists Also vegans I guess since turkey is the traditional main dish although many vegetariansvegans celebrate happily with nonmeat dishesThe official public holiday is only Thanksgiving Day itself Some workplaces also close for the following day making a wonderful day weekend but others dont especially retailthe dreaded Black FridayHope that helped,1,cdox0d1,1rn8ci,explainlikeimfive,new,2,1

Lostsoul,Its actually referred to as Infantile Amnesia Its caused by the underdevelopment of the hippocampus area of the brain which is responsible for the storing and processing of memories It begins development between  years of age Although there are some rare instance when an individual can recall memories from an earlier age The cause of this is unknown and some argue its a false memory that may have been triggered by a cue which helps with recall memory ,17,cdp0kwc,1rnevl,explainlikeimfive,new,111,94
phillystix,The short answer is your brain is still developing and you are unaware of how to communicate your thoughtsA little more of an explanation movement is There are different types of memories that start at different times in a childs development Declarative memory Which is the memory youre referring to which allows us to consciously recall events and skills are still rapidly developing the first  to  years of a childs life Its not that a child doesnt have memories its that a child doesnt know how to communicate those thoughts or give them a proper language That develops by school age,3,cdoyhj9,1rnevl,explainlikeimfive,new,21,18
psychologythrill,theres another explanation also theres this thing called object permanence which is an infants ability to represent an object in its mind To get an idea of this think of playing with a baby and his toy and then hiding the toy under a blanket until a certain age the baby wouldnt look under the blanket for the toy because it doesnt yet have object permanence or  a symbol of the toy in its mind So the theory goes that until a child acquires object permanence it wont be able to represent objectsscenarios in its mind and so wont have that kind of memoryLanguage also uses symbols the idea that a word represents a concrete thing and so another idea is that using language throughout the day will aid memory formation and so before children begin speaking their memories will be weaker evidence of this was shown in the different social environments that north american vs asian children have Its more common for NA parents to discuss the events of the day with their children what happened today what did you learn etc and this is not so common in asian cultures Theyve found that NA children have stronger and earlier childhood memories Interesting stuff,0,cdp18x4,1rnevl,explainlikeimfive,new,8,8

SunAvatar,We dont really know exactly why but there are several proposed explanations Neurological immaturity The brain structures that form lasting personal memories are just not fully formed yet This is probably the most popular theory yet it has the problem of explaining why twoyearolds can frequently remember things that happened when they were one Emotional immaturity Emotion is heavily involved in recollection and during the first few years the brain structures that regulate emotion are still developing Supporting this theory is that the occurrence of deeply meaningful and emotional events in a young childs life such as the birth of a sibling can lead to earlier memories Repression The first few years of life are so traumatic that they are simply repressed Supporting this theory is the fact that adults who were abused or traumatized in childhood frequently have their first memories even later around  Lack of selfawareness Until a certain age toddlers dont really understand that they are a person with unique characteristics and separate from all others Until this happens toddlers can learn but they cannot construct memories that are autobiographical in the way you or I would understandThere are probably others but these are the ones I can recall from those old undergrad psych classes,0,cdpcohp,1rnevl,explainlikeimfive,new,4,4

mikelo,The US tried to bring Canada into the fold initially in their invasion of Quebec Wasnt smart though since it was during the winter Needless to say the expeditionary force sent to capture Quebec City failed and withdrew After that we never really tried again and focused on our own borders as the war soon shifted to the southLater however there were some diplomatic negotiations with the region later to be known as New Brunswick though this never panned out As someone else mentioned during the Revolutionary War many of the loyalists to the crown fled north into Canada Thus the loyalists had a very strong foothold in Canada politicallyCanada also wasnt anywhere near populated like the colonies were They were mostly military and trade outposts So its not like there could be an appeal to the common folk to instigate a revolution like in the colonies if a revolution was to come it would have to come through diplomatic and political meansIn the War of  the US did invade Canada though not really to colonize it since Canada didnt really exist at this time it was simply a British territory If I recall the Americans did gain some territory around Maine Vermont and New Hampshire while the British Canadians made excursions into the Ohio Valley At the end of the war lands gained were given back on both sides and returned to the status quo The War of  is commonly referred to as the nd Revolutionary War because it was the USs attempt to legitimize itself as an independent and autonomous country Before this the British held very little respect for Americas sovereignty especially on the high seas via trade While much cost came along with the war the end finally legitimized the US as a sovereign nation that Britain would be forced to respectIn the early s there was another border dispute by expansionist Democrats in the border dispute between Great BritainCanada over where the official border should be between the Oregon territory and British Columbia Americans wanted the  parallel leading to the slogan Fiftyfour Forty or Fight while the British demanded the nd parallel Instead of it leading to war they eventually compromised on the th parallel This officially gave the US the territory later to be incorporated as the state of WashingtonBy this point however America had turned its sights south into Mexico where it annexed Texas and other southwestern territories later to be known as New Mexico and Arizona,1,cdp4ucd,1rni9t,explainlikeimfive,new,4,3

imfineny,There were  attempts to do so but the biggest reason why this didnt happen was that Canada was not and is not strategically important enough to expend the resources for a successful invasion  In the meantime it does operate in a similar fashion to an incorporated territory of the United States toothless economically dependent and marginal national government that has no say in the most important decisions that affects their nation  In short Canada is a client state with not representation in our government which mens we get to abuse the hell out of them and we dont have to bother to listen to them  If Canadas political intelligence was very high they would ask for admission to the United States then  Canadians would enjoy a huge sway over global and national affairs  ,19,cdp1416,1rni9t,explainlikeimfive,new,3,-16
Kutulainen,Human brain has its own rewardpunishment systems Your brain rewards you for doing things that your instincts tell it are good things Example Eating fatty food rich in carbohydrates is very rare in natural condition think stone age people so your brain tells you damn this is good stuff eat as much as you can Same thing with grooming and playing with friends they are likely to enhance your social status and make you more likely to survive as part of a group Your brain also punishes you for doing things that it considers are bad for you This is why some things taste horrible or feel badPeople wit addiction to gambling or some other activity usually have their rewardpunishment systems slightly skewed the rewardpunishment doesnt work properly Such as giving rewards for activities that dont really benefit you or forgetting to give punishment for something that is harmful So in that way a gambler might remember only the winnings they make him feel good but forgets all the losses as these dont bring the correct punishmentreaction ,0,cdp1bjm,1rnjc0,explainlikeimfive,new,3,3

flamingmanny,This is copied from another thread i saved only this excerpt so unfortunately i dont know who the original writer of this is Very informative whoever posted thisTheres actually an international classification of headache disordershttpcepsagepubcomcontentlong that classifies the different types of headaches The brain itself has no pain receptors because all pain receptors send their signals to the brain Its the thing thats doing the feeling of the pain This is why awake brain surgery works as well as it does the neurosurgeon can go in an electrically stimulate the awake brain and remove brain tissue without the patient feeling anythingAs can be seen in the ICHD there are many kinds of headaches Some are caused by muscle tension in the head and neck Others by inflammation pressing against nerves Some even caused whats called referred pain which is when it feels like the pain is in one place but thats actually a phantom pain being caused somewhere elseThe classic examples are heart attacks and icecream headaches In icecream headaches the rapid cooling of blood vessels in the throat and mouth stimulate the trigeminal nerve which brings in pain information from the head making it feel like your head is in pain when the stimulation is actually happening in the mouthFor other headaches its good to know about the three protective layers called meninges that cover the brain thepia mater soft mother which adheres to the brain and is very fine the arachnoid layer which sort of provides a barrier between cerebrospinal fluid and the rest of the circulatory system and the dura mater hard mother which feels very leathery like bat wings and holds in the cerebrospinal fluidThese meninges also help form the blood brain barrier and cover a lot of the fine blood vessels that supply the brain with bloodBoth the blood vessels and meninges have pain receptors The pain receptors in these regions can be stimulated by a lot of things For example meningitis is when these become enflamed due to infection This inflammation is painful due to the stretching and pressure Similarly pressure changes brought about by dehydration or changes in blood salinity or what have you like in a hangover can also cause pain that we feel as headachesSo in short theres not one kind of headache and sometimes even though a headache feels like its located in one place its not really because of the phantom stimulation from referred pain,13,cdp2rr0,1rnl1h,explainlikeimfive,new,65,52

doctoranonymous,Headaches are basically pain referred outside from any damage or irritation to structures inside your head other than brain mostlyBecause brain itself is insensitive to pain and even if touched directly it can only cause funny sensations in the areas of the body represented by that portion that is touchedWhereas the layer covering the brain which holds the blood vessels are very sensitive As someone mentioned earlier hangover headaches are from hereToo much alcohol too much byproducts and even constipationcauses toxic products in the vesselsirritation of vesselsHeadacheIn Migraine too much emotion and tension will make the blood vessels go crazy which get tired and become flaccid and blood keeps gushing in causes it to stretch more including the layer covering brainHeadacheEmotional headaches are when muscles of scalp and neck spasmie when muscles get too stressed out lactic acid is produced which causes pain but still it feels like your head hurts from inside because all types of headaches are referred outside and feels the sameIcecream headache is just referred pain from your palateI dont know if I ve  put it right but thats all I know,0,cdp5y8t,1rnl1h,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2

docdaneeka,The underlying structure and vocabulary is still largely Germanic in origin All the most common words for example are of Old English derivation  English traces back to AngloSaxon which was beyond doubt a West Germanic language every bit as much as German or Dutch and their ancestral languages are Yes it has since received a massive infusion of terms borrowed from French and Latin but that doesnt change the fundamental nature of the language ,1,cdp0lwu,1rnmvx,explainlikeimfive,new,5,4
ubabar,Not a linguist but Ill try my bestIts Germanic because it is descended from parent languages that are Germanic Modern English is directly descended from Middle English which is directly descended from Old English Old English was made up of a few very similar dialects that all directly descend from ProtoGermanic This right here is the very simple reason linguists classify it as GermanicNow why isnt English considered a Romance language or Romancehybrid if Old French changed the language so much Thats because Old French didnt change it as much as most laymen think that it did The very simple answer here is that Old French contributed vocabulary and borrowed vocabulary by itself does not change languagesIf all that had happened was that Old English speakers started borrowing words from Old French then it would still have been Old English just with more French wordsThe actual transition from Old English to Middle English was in the grammar and these changes had already started before the Normans had even arrived And would still have happened regardless of the Norman invasion because all the pieces were still in placeThe most important change was the reduction of inflectional endings This might not seem like much but to understand it better you have to understand that with inflectional endings a language can have a pretty free word order That is it doesnt really matter where all the words are arranged in a sentence the words themselves are marked for their grammatical meaning so you could literally rearrange the words almost any way you want But modern English doesnt do this if words are out of order we cant understand whats going on We also have very few inflectional endings as well so You should probably guess when the inflectional endings went our word order had to change to pick up the slack No more I will the you store and to go but now it could only be You and I will go to the storeBut this reduction of endings didnt happen overnight nor did it happen over a few decades after the Norman invasion This change was actually about a thousand years in the making You see the ancestor of English ProtoGermanic had done something strange to the way words were spoken they fixed the stress of a word on the initial or root syllable Other IndoEuropean languages could and did switch the way they stressed their words Latin and Ancient Greek would usually put the stress towards the end of the word usually among the inflectional endings themselvesWhat this meant for all Germanic languages that inherited this feature was the very gradual degradation of all inflectional endings which now all occurred after the stressed syllable So for instance ProtoGermanic wulfaz the wolf would have become preOld English wulfa which became Old English wulf which became modern English wolf Now again this might not seem like much but it happened to almost all words and even by Old English these endings had already taken a beating After what few endings remained had become so similar to each other it wasnt really long before they lost their purpose and would have been dropped altogether A note here Old English didnt end in  it was actually spoken for another  years after the Norman invasion It just wasnt written down anymore as all the people who were in a position to write at this time were now speaking Norman French or were writing in LatinIf French had caused these changes say in a creole situation you would expect this all to have happened very fast with a near complete collapse of inflectional endings right off the bat which is what happens with creoles But you dont see this with English you see a very gradual reduction of endings Middle English still had them more reduced in nouns and adjectives and only slightly reduced with verbs before they were eventually dropped altogether in Modern English Well most of them anyway we kept a few Another final note While we borrowed an awful lot of words from OldNorman French into Middle English this number was dwarfed by the later borrowings of French and Latin words into Early Modern and Modern English during the Renaissance and Enlightenment periods,0,cdpab2f,1rnmvx,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2

RjoTTUbio,Vaccines do have side effects For live vaccines ones with living but damaged versions of a virus or bacteria the side effects tend to show a mild form of the disease for which you are being immunized against For dead vaccines you can get side effects simply due to an immune response against the antigens present in the vaccine Some people claim the flu shot gives them the flu which is half true You can get a mild version of the flu from the vaccine or just a mild immune response to the antigens in the dead flu vaccine Therefore some people associate a vaccine with feeling sick Like umrrandomman stated there was a study published that linked the MMR measles mumps rubella vaccine to autism This study was poorly designed and thoroughly debunked However the damage was done since there was a rise in measles and preventable diseases following this study httpnewsbbccoukhihealthstmThere is also an argument that vaccines drive huge revenue for the medical industry but most of the vaccines covered under Medicare part B amp D and Medicaid really dont drive much revenue for medical offices or big drug companies compared to medical treatment for these diseases that we are trying to protect againstEdit Basically people think vaccines are either or scam or outright dangerous This is due to a poor understanding of what a vaccine actually does I will edit again and explain that better as wellSo what does a vaccine actually doA vaccine introduces a live virusbacteria or dead components of these organisms Once these organisms enter the body via injection oral or nasal route fluMist vaccine your body collects these particles to present to your immune system There are cells that roam the body looking for bad things macrophages neutrophils dendritic cells These cells primarily dendritic cells gather up dead things and bring them to the lymph nodes Once in the lymph nodes B and T cells are exposed to these particles and begin to change B and T cells that recognize the antigen start to clone themselves and eventually form differentiated B amp T cells that hunt down more pathogens B cells produce antibodies T cells kill in other ways They also differentiate into memory cells which give you long lasting immunity to that antigen Once you have been given a shot it generally takes  days for this process to work You are now immune to some strains of that virus or bacteria that you could be exposed to in the future   ,0,cdp1qev,1rnpbq,explainlikeimfive,new,4,4

NightMaestro,Friction is made everywhere The results however can be neglible or very pronouncedWhat you have here on a molecular level is a bunch of liquid contacting liquid And Ill explain thisThe water molecules inside the bottle are already at a liquid state but when in contact with that ice cube the surface atoms at the state of energy to keep the ice cube a solid begin to break into a liquid The molecules of the ice cube are melting offThere still is some friction made between a liquid vs a liquid state but its pretty neglible Imagine the friction of air moving against air The molecules hardly ever get close enough to create a lot of friction And in water you just have the molecules actually move not resisting much change The friction is negated almost entirely when the molecules actually move about instead of resisting the force you are applyingNow imagine I filled that whole bottle with marbles covered in sand paper What you got now is two solids running up against eachother The state of these solids keep them a solid and when force is applied on a molecular level they will resist change along the whole structure This is called sliding friction and is the most resistantIn this picture you will see on a atomic level little ridges of the sand paper hit against eachother and the molecules staying in their solid to compensate this They dont all break off instead each solid object will move a little bit to compensate but the electromagnetic repulsion actual mathmatical friction creates energy in the form of heat what we expirience as friction You have huge sheaths full of millions of atoms the surface of the objects enacting this force so the net gain of friction is a lot bigger than the liquid or gaseous frictional return,0,cdp49p1,1rnpgx,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2

sirsri,Those questions are hard to answer  Partly because we dont know exactly what independence would mean  Scotland is a relatively poor part of the UK that has benefited quite a lot from payments from the central government over the centuries for things like health care and roads etc   But it has oil reserves well some anyway which have inflated GDP lately  So first thing  scotland only has about  million people of the UKs  ish  So if they leave in the grand scheme of things it wont make much differenceBut how oil revenues are carved up would be non trivial as would how the territory is split  There no answer here because it hasnt been decided  Presumably scotland would get most of the oil as most of it is close to scotlandgtstandard of living etcIn the long run its bad for scotland  It wont matter much to the UK  Unlike Ireland which was a rd world country caused by deliberate UK policy attached to europe when it got independence Scotland is overall well off  That would start to gradually erode as the practical realities of trying to do business in scotland sink in  Without oil they dont have anything and while they could try and set themselves up as an Ireland like english speaking tax haven how many more tax havens does europe need or want and if they cant be a tax haven what are they  There isnt a critical mass of people for any meaningful industry anymore and trying to use the Euro or the pound would turn them into a greece or spain   For a little while it would all seem rosy as the ship building and the IT sector seemed great and then the problems of goods and people across borders the currency imbalances etc would all sink ingtetcThe etc is really the main question  Unlike just about everyone else who has asked for and gotten independence scotland is not particularly culturally distinct from the UK on a day to day basis  At least not anymore  They all speak the same language albeit with an accent they go to similar jobs they live in similar houses they already have representation in government they go home and watch TV and play games and go to bars and pubs etc in much the same way as their english counter parts  The scottish are not particularly committed to one religion that is being oppressed by another or any of that  So what do they get  Somewhat like Canada and australia and new zealand they get to waste a pile of money having independent foreign policies which almost no one in the world cares about because theyre too small to matter and most of the serious important issues it will get to spend a pile of money to feel good about itself for agreeing to do what everyone else sane is doing anyway  Made worse is that scotland is never going to get much bigger  While Canada and Australia could conceivably pass England in population by the end of the century or so scotland is going to be well small  The UK has military bases in Scotland and Scotts serve in the  British military that would change and less money in one pot will make it a bit harder to have major military assets like aircraft carriers and airplane RampD and that sort of thing   That weakens the UK a little bit but makes scotland basically irrelevant in the world  If the EU got its act together into a single megastate it basically wouldnt matter at all  It would be like splitting New York state in half  You can or you cannot in the end it doesnt make much difference to anyone  Arbitrary lines on a map are arbitrary  NB Im in Canada we have our own separatists in Quebec who do seem to be culturally different from the rest of us in Canada  But on the whole Canadian independence hasnt actually gotten us much  It makes us feel good about ourselves but thats about it ,1,cdp3qp0,1rnq5q,explainlikeimfive,new,1,0

SCM,Locking your knees basically squeezes your veins shut in your legs Veins have a bunch of valves all over your body to create pressure to push blood through your body but when you lock your knees you basically compress these veins shut And eventually that leads to you losing blood supply to the rest of your body They also tell soldiers and guardsmen to wiggle their toes as the muscles contracting and relaxing helps push blood back up to your hearthead and so on From wikipediaThe return of blood to the heart is assisted by the action of the skeletalmuscle pump and by the thoracic pump action of breathing during respiration Standing or sitting for a prolonged period of time can cause low venous return from venous pooling vascular shock Fainting can occur but usually baroreceptors within the aortic sinuses initiate a baroreflex such angiotensin II and norepinephrine stimulate vasoconstriction and heart rate increases to return blood flow Neurogenic and hypovolaemic shock can also cause fainting In these cases the smooth muscles surrounding the veins become slack and the veins fill with the majority of the blood in the body keeping blood away from the brain and causing unconsciousness Jet pilots wear pressurized suits to help maintain their venous return and blood pressurehttpenwikipediaorgwikiVeinsFunction,2,cdpb8t6,1rnr8z,explainlikeimfive,new,3,1

BabyPunter,From a quick search online I could not find anything difinitive Many people say that it is due to an artery behind the knee that can get slightly pinched which impedes the flow of oxygen rich blood to the brain which slowly deprives the brain of oxygen Which could be why the common experience people express when they pass out while standing a long time is described as a slow darkening of your view around the edges of your vision and they dont even know it is happening until they wake upWhether any of this is true is suspect I was expecting to find something quickly but I cant and I dont know enough about the vascular system to know if it is viable,3,cdp4c8x,1rnr8z,explainlikeimfive,new,3,0

SirMorrak,I have very minimal experience with this topic but I would guess that because your processing capabilities are dulled upon waking up perception and shortterm memory follow suit It might be that the reason it seems faster because our brain is latching onto fewer individual details It has been documented that humans recall dangerous events in slow motion due to a reverse of this phenomenon  more details recalled to increase survival chance  slower overall recall because of a fixed recall speed The grogginess experienced upon waking might play a part  Thats a highly uneducated guess Do with it what you will ,1,cdp8fbg,1rnyw8,explainlikeimfive,new,2,1
tensorstrength,It might have to do with how your brain perceives sound The sampling rate or the precision with which you hear may be lower when you have just woken up giving you the feeling that things are faster than you perceive This sensor setting might be somehow coupled to the human circadian rhythm But you should wait till someone gives you the exact answer Im probably wrong,1,cdpara7,1rnyw8,explainlikeimfive,new,2,1

psychologythrill,think of it like the self fulfilling prophecy psychologically speaking people tend to live up to their expectations good and bad if someone is expected to act in a certain way other people base their attitudes towards that person accordingly and then the persons behaviour typically will change in accordance with the expectations in part due to the way people behaved towards them The famous example of this is a teacher who was told certain students in her class were tested and that some were bloomers and should be expected to do well while others were strugglers and should be expected to do worse the students were never tested this was all randomly made up but the teacher didnt know that At the end of the year the students were tested for real and the bloomers in fact excelled while the strugglers were worse off The teacher had expectations of these students and those expectations shaped her behaviour towards the kids which resulted in the expectations being metAnother example could be if society has a stereotype that a certain subgroup of people are mean So we treat them as if theyre mean and we dont like them because thats what we expectwell theyre likely to not like that and treat us poorly in return confirming the stereotype that theyre mean ,0,cdp9vy7,1rnzu4,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2

Drofmum,Well young moflugger as I am here avoiding real work I will try to explain Most smart people tend to agree that dinosaurs died because of a big disaster called the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event Probably because a big rock from space hit the earth and sent a lot of dust into the sky This dust blocked out the sun and made the world very cold Like the north poll where Santa lives As we all know only Santa and his helpers and reindeer live in the north poll That is because when it is cold and dark plants cant grow so the big animals that eat the plants die because they are hungry and cold Smaller animals can live with a lot less food and mammals have fur and warm blood to keep them alive in the cold This is why they survived the cold winter that lasted many years Eventually all the dinosaurs died except for some birds did you know birds used to be dinosaurs because they are small and some could dive under the water or make warm little burrows Mammals then took the place of dinosaurs when the world warmed up again They got bigger and bigger like elephants and whales The largest animal to ever live still exists it is the blue whale We call such animals megafauna For a long time these giant animals lived happily grazing on lush green pastures and making friends Then there came man Unlike other animals man is very sneaky He can work together to catch and eat really big animals even an animal as big as the blue whale I just told you about He can use weapons like spears and knives and even make traps That is why many of the big slow and delicious animals we used to have were all eaten upAnd that is why we dont have as many animals as big as dinosaurs anymore,8,cdp5oho,1ro239,explainlikeimfive,new,34,26
SirEbonwolf,Im not  sure but as Ive always understood it has to do with the concertration of oxygen in the atmosphere That in the prehistoric period there was more oxygen that let animals grow to extreme sizes and still be able to easily get enough oxygen out of breathing as the larger an animal is the more oxygen it needs to fuel its cells As far as I know whales can get around this by not having the same type of extremities like arms and legs They do not need these as they are suspended in the water getting air to these extremities is harder than getting it to central parts of the body so as the oxygen concertration has decreasedanimals with extremeties like arms and legs have become smaller over the generations,2,cdp8kyp,1ro239,explainlikeimfive,new,16,14
whyroby,As animals get proportionately larger ie picture a sixty foot tall human with the same relative dimensions as a normal six foot tall person their bodily functions become less efficient and need more oxygen and other things Ill get to why in a second There used to be more oxygen in the air than there currently is so thats one major factor for why extremely large animals have a hard time sustaining themselvesThe reason proportionately larger animals are less efficient is because mass is a function of the cube of height but the strength of bones and muscle are a function of the square of height because their strength is related to the size of the D cross sectionhttpenwikipediaorgwikiPhysicalstrengthOverview not due to the mass of the bone or muscle  picture trying to make a house out of paperA  foot man has x the height of a  foot man So he has x the bone and muscle strength But he has x the mass So he wouldnt be able to support himself unless his body had much stronger and less energy efficient bones and muscle,0,cdpbfg9,1ro239,explainlikeimfive,new,3,3

Bnni,The pressure an ideal gas exerts is directly proportional to its temperature If you plot pressure against temperature you will get a line that is declining with sinking temperature no matter the volume or amount of substance used those need to be constant though So if you keep following this line extrapolating it until you reach a pressure of  you will be at C or  Kelvin absolute zeroSince there can be no such thing as negative pressure as pressure is an expression of force and area both of which cannot be negative either we have effectively reached a point where it would be no longer logical to continue or simply something we cannot describe with our laws of nature Keep in mind that a pressure of  also implies that there is no movement of molecules and atoms anymore as to apply pressure a particle needs to collide with a surface A pressure of  means that no particle is moving to apply force to surfaces meaning that everything is standing still,0,cdp7zpa,1ro3rt,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1
yeahiworkout,Temperature is basically a measure of how much energy something has Energy is caused by the movement of atomsparticles that something is made of If something is hot it just means that the atoms of the substance you are measuring are vibratingmoving rapidly The faster they movevibrate the hotter something gets Obviously the slowest the particles could move is not moving at all Thus no movement means no energy which means no temperature This is why the coldest something can be is  no movementedit if you want to know why we can calculate this without actually being able to achieve it its just by using formulas that we have For example with the formula Fma if you wanted to know how much force was needed to accelerate a  kg object  ms you could just plug it in solve Even though theres no way we could actually achieve this we are still able to calculate it Hopefully this makes sense,2,cdp8zk5,1ro3rt,explainlikeimfive,new,4,2

syrhtalbot,This happens to me too Im only guessing based on some light reading Ive done on circadian rhythms but I think its related to the drop in body temperature you experience while sleeping Youre getting nice and toasty with a thermal then when youre drifting off your bodys internal temperature naturally drops to be its coolest during the second half of sleep and you suddenly feel a lot warmer than before Your body uses its core temperature as a baseline for your perception of temperature on your skin Probably why room temperature water can feel so cool after working out but so warm if youve been sedentary When we touch hotcold things were not feeling their temperature only the effect the temperature has on our skin so its very subjectiveYour thyroid has a lot to do with regulating your body temperature if theres an imbalance you can experience problems feeling too hot or too cold I wouldnt jump to that conclusion immediately as night sweats are incredibly common but its good to get your levels checked every couple years anyway I have an undiagnosed condition where my thyroid levels and internal body temperature are fine but Im constantly feverish anything above F and and I feel like Im overheating Ill be glad to have that explained one day,1,cdp9h3l,1ro46q,explainlikeimfive,new,2,1

MayContainNugat,Common Law is the law developed over generations by judges over a long period of time Its the law built up from long traditions and precedents that exists prior to legislative bodies passing specific statutes The English common law developed in the Middle Ages and forms the basis of law in England and its former colonies including the US Except for Louisiana whose common law derives from FranceFor instance under English common law a couple is married when they live together for a certain period of time and hold themselves out to the community as man and wife Legislatures in most jurisdictions however have overridden common law by passing statutes requiring a marriage license issued by the state to be considered married  ,0,cdpa7r1,1rodcd,explainlikeimfive,new,4,4

HashTagWaterFelon,Short answer is that it depends and serious deformities may or may not ever actually ariseThe thing is that if the initial two had perfect genomes with no mutations corresponding to serious defects there is no reason that their breeding or that of their descendants would necessarily give rise to a population with those defects If they arent there to begin with they wouldnt be created by inbreeding The founder effect is the formal name for how low diversity groups starting a population can lead to high incidences of genetic defects But that is only because the genes for those traits were brought by a founding member of the population Inbreeding NEVER creates a genetic mutation It only increases the chance that one already present will be expressedAnd anyways if the two people happened to carry in some serious problem traits as in serious to the point that they would kill off the affected person then natural selection would act to start pushing the genes prevalence downwards anyway Simulations with programs mathematically assigning fitness levels to mice show how when a given gene gives a higher probability of successfully breeding that the inferior gene is purged to a minimal level very quickly described in Reece and Campbell Biology th editionSo in short assuming that these two individuals were healthy to start with that pretty much guarantees that there are enough healthy genes in play to rebuild the population Situations like the Kentucky families that took on a blue skin tone was because that trait didnt really reduce fitness levels by much if it did the blue ones would die and that gene would fade out You would have a low level of genetic diversity yes which would leave humanity vulnerable to being ravaged by a disease or other pressure of that kind So you could very easily get some strange traits popping up but if they were serious deformities to the point that they mess with a persons ability to propagate themselves then no that trait wouldnt show up and stay around,6,cdpg3e8,1rootd,explainlikeimfive,new,25,19

BassoonHero,There is a lot of mythology about this so Ill try to post a complete answer This brushes on some old holy wars so please read the whole thing before leaving angry commentsThe first important point is that a virus is a specific type of malware A virus exploits holes in an operating system to spread itself from system to system You might get a virus from an infected disc or flash drive or from another system on your network If you install it yourself then its not a virus even if you were tricked into installing it A piece of malware disguised as something innocuous is called a trojan horse or just a trojan for shortThere is a variety of trojan horse malware out there for the Mac OS for Windows and even for Linux However there are few viruses that will infect modern Windows and none that affect the modern Mac OS For Windows this has not long been the case A decade ago Windows viruses abounded and users had to be very careful to keep up with software updates and to run antimalware programs At the same time there were still no Mac OS X viruses in the wildCommon internet wisdom holds that this is because the Mac OS was far less popular at the time so no one tried to write a virus for it While intuitively appealing this explanation is faulty for several reasonsFirst it strains ones credulity to suppose that this could explain a total lack of viruses for Mac OS X Surely someone somewhere would have seen that while the Mac market was smaller it was also ripe for subversion Mac users of the time were justifiably if irritatingly smug about not needing to run antivirus programs If there had been no additional hurdles to creating a Mac OS X virus then it should have been easier to infect Macs because their users were not accustomed to taking precautions Moreover surely some ambitious hacker must have realized the infamy that writing the first virus for OS X would bringSecond the prevalence of other types of malware such as trojan horse software has increased as the Macs market share waxes Its commonplace to hear that yet another Macbased trojan has been spotted in the wild yet still not a single virus If the Macs market share is sufficient to attract trojans then why not virusesThird the true cause is evinced by a decline in Windows viruses over the past several years True Windowss market share has declined somewhat but the number of true viruses has dropped precipitously The drop is all out of proportion to the fall in market share and crucially the prevalence of viruses for other platforms such as Mac OS X has not increased to make up for itSo if we can eliminate market share as the cause then what Well the answer is simple if sadly contentious During the dark ages of Windows viruses the Windows OS was far more vulnerable to viruses than either its contemporaries or the modern Windows OS The malware explosion that accompanied the rise of internet use among ordinary users hit Windows the hardest because Windows was the easiest OS to write a virus for The subsequent decline of true viruses came as Microsoft worked to close security holes retire old APIs and generally modernize their OSIn a way its only by happenstance that the Mac OS avoided this The classic Mac OS versions  predated Windows and by the late s it was showing its age It was designed for a world where a personal computer had a single trusted user Where this assumption was violated there were security holes And there were definitely viruses although in those days you were more likely to catch one from a friends floppy disk than from the internet There were also myriad technical limitations that are welldocumented elsewhere So Apple decided to replace the OS wholesale This was a long and painful process and an interesting one if you find this sort of thing interesting but in the end they had OS X a modern multiuser UNIXbased OS And no virusesWindowss evolution took a more gradual path Windows NT New technologies was in some technical respects a dramatic step forward but Microsoft was very careful not to move too fast lest compatibility problems alienate their users Apple on the other hand maintained compatibility by requiring their users to emulate the classic OS within OS X an approach that infuriated users but allowed Apples engineers to make a much cleaner break with the bad old daysSo during the dark ages Mac users had a brand new modern OS whereas Windows users had an aging singleuser OS full of holes that Microsoft was working to plug Today Windows is a different animal  Microsofts strategy of replacing the planks as the ship sailed seems to have mostly worked And a modern Windows PC is very unlikely to get a computer virus But people remember a time not too long ago when this was not the case and the impressions left by that era linger on in the popular consciousness,1,cdpfkns,1roy3o,explainlikeimfive,new,3,2

defguysezhuh,When calling  in the United States DeafHardofHearing DHH people have several options links to additional information are included as I go along Video Relay Service VRS amp Video Phones VP  They can use VPs to call  immediately via VRS  Basically the DeafHardofHearing person will dial  over the video phone a certified sign language interpreter will respond first and then dial  is dialed immediately via telephone line in a way conference call deaf person to interpreter to dispatch  The FCC also requires that all VP users have the address of wherever the VP unit is located at home or at a business registered on that account so that when dialing  the interpreter can immediately relay that address to the  dispatch operator after the victim has explained the emergency  The address being programmed into the VP is not only a timesaver when dealing with emergencies but is also provides clear and direct communication when a DeafHardofHearing person like anyone in an emergency situation may be panicking and would likely stutter with their own signs or their minds go blank while trying to remember the address  For more information on how VPs amp VRS work you can check out Purple Communicationshttppurpleus or Sorenson Communicationhttpwwwsorensoncom which are two of the larger VRS providers in Florida with Sorenson being the largest provider in the USA I believe TTYTDD amp Text Relay Services  Just to avoid confusion TTY and TDD are the same thing in this context but have two different names for the same device  Some people know it better by one name over the other so I included both though I will refer to it as a TDD from here on out  Moving on its been pointed out that TTYsTDDshttpenwikipediaorgwikiTelecommunicationsdevicesforthedeaf are an outdated technology  For the most part this is true  A DHH person who knows how to sign is more likely to be using the previously mentioned VPs to contact other DHH friendsfamily members and using VRS services to call everyone else from doctors to employers to their local pizza delivery place  However not all DHH people know sign language  As such these people have a tendency to rely on TDDs to communicate with one another or make their relay calls  Instead of a sign language interpreter relaying the calls they will get an operator on another TDD who will then pipe through to the landline to whoever the DHH person is calling and voice whatever is being typed on the screen for that DHH person  The operator will then type everything being spoken back to the DHH person as if they were speaking to that person directly  So its the same idea as calling  on a VRS call but using text instead of video for those who cannot sign Captioned Telephones If you still use a landline telephone you can use a CapTelhttpcaptelcom phone which is a telephone with a large digital screen that allows a person who speaks but still has some degree of hearing loss usually a HardofHearing person and not a Deaf person  Basically youll call someone and a silent operator will automatically pick up while your outgoing number is being dialed  Using speech recognition software everything being spoken by the person youre calling will be captioned live on your CapTel phone similar to subtitles on a TV with the silent operators ONLY job being to correct errors made by the speech recognition software  Recently Sprint created a CapTel mobile apphttpwwwsprintcaptelcomwirelesscaptelsprint so people can use their smartphones to make captioned calls wirelessly as well and have their calls captioned on their smartphone screens instead of relying on a landline  Same principle as using the TextVideo Relay Services but you wont have an operator talking for you  Youll be talking for yourself so less delay in  calls Text Messages  This is still in the works  SOME cities in the United States have now begun doing text messages to  because they recognize that making a phone call in an emergency situation can give away your location if youre a victim of attack and trying to hide eg school shootings muggings home robberies rape etc so this is extremely beneficial not only to DHH but also to hearing people as well  The FCC has a whole page answering your questions on how Texttohttpwwwfccgovtextto is being set up through mobile carriers and when they expect it to be up amp running  However as uMastersInDisasters points out SMS as it is defined now is NOT a reliable protocol If possible use voice I hope this information helpsTLDR  We have several options Videophones TTYTDDs Captioned Telephones and Text Messages limited locations only for texts but slowly expandingSource Im a Deaf Social Worker who currently works in the DHH community and Ive been DHH all my life born HardofHearing then it gradually declined as I got older now I consider myself Deaf,14,cdpllpg,1royox,explainlikeimfive,new,76,62

tmbstone,Basically due to its shape its easier for a boat to move forwards in the water than for it to move sidewaysThis means that if you point the boat into the wind but at an angle the wind ends up blowing the boat sideways The boat doesnt want to move sideways though so it ends up sliding both sideways and towards the angle its pointed atThis enables you to move forwards and sideways across the wind By changing your angle to the opposite direction every so often you can essentially zigzag your way towards a destination even if its upwindFor more infohttpwwwmaztravelcomarticlessailinghtml,9,cdphtbb,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,new,54,45

beerMonger,No sailboat can sail directly into the wind But most modern boats can sail at about a  degree angle into the wind Essentially sailboats have  wings on them One in the air and one in the water the centerboard or keel Both of them are very important to making the boat move upwind The sail itself uses lift from the wind going around the sail to pull itself up Think about blowing over a piece of paper The paper will move upwards towards the moving air This is basically how the sail worksThe other wing the keel or centerboard does the same thing only at a  degree angle to the force of the sail You get an apparent motion in line with the length of the boat You mentioned the boats in AC Those are mostly the square sailed kind which basically only went downwind and used different trade winds to get where they wanted to go Here is  video that should get some give some good graphical representations of the physics of ithttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvyqwbHIrORMampnoredirect,2,cdpgq16,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,new,13,11

amartz,I sailed for years when I was younger You cannot sail directly into the wind but depending on the boat you can get pretty damn close Its an application of Bernoullis Principle The way it was usually explained to me is that the sail is like a vertical planes wing The curvature if the sail means that the air on one side has more distance to cover than the air on the other side in the same time This creates sideways lift that pulls the boat into the wind ,0,cdpjwme,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,new,3,3
SuperStallion,The sails act as an airplane wing does creating a low pressure area on the back side of the sail the relative high pressure area then applies pressure on the sale and tries to push the boat kind of sideways and forward Underneath the water the keel acts as an airplane wing and does not allow the boat to move sideways to the water so it has to move forward The boatis then directed by the rudder  Most boats can travel about  degrees to the actual wind direction high performance boats about  degrees  none can travel straight into itSource avid competitive sailor for around  years in the Great Lakes ,0,cdpkwk3,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,new,3,3

heeero,I am seeing a lot of talk about Bernouilli here but I am not entirely convinced it works that way Is there any experimental evidence for that If you simply do some vector decompositions on the points where force is transfered from wind to sail and then from sail to mast you also get a net force in the forward direction This explanation is more consistent with the high force you feel when sailing into the wind and also with the maximum angle of  degreesEdit I really should go to like a typing seminar or whatever this is getting tiresome,0,cdplo5t,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2

plasticluthier,Ill explain it to you haw it was explained to me when I was about Three sets of forces are happening while youre sailing a boat   You have the wind pushing on the sail  You have a centerboard that stops the boat just going sideways because of the wind  The boat prefers to go forwards rather than backwards because of its shapeNow when youre sailing across the wind or into the wind you can imagine all of these forces as your thumb and index finger squeezing a cherry If you squeeze directly from the sides the cherry stone wont go anywhere but if you squeeze from the back the stone will come out of the front Its the same with sailing the wind pushes on the sails the boat tries to move sideways but the centreboard stops it and the only place left for all that force to go is into making the boat move forwards Now you cant sail straight into the wind the forces wouldnt balance out and there would just be an almighty flapping noise backwards motion and possibly mild panic before you realise the steering is now backwards too So to balance all the forces you zigzag into the wind turning the front of the boat through the wind every time you want to turn This is called tacking Now sails are tight in when youre going into the wind completely out when youre going away from the wind and pulled in until they stop flapping at all other points generally the position of the centreboard matches the position of the sails If you need to know any more Id suggest going sailing I have no idea what AC is ,3,cdpj6al,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,new,4,1

brainflakes,Heres a diagramhttpaforathletewikiacomwikiFilePointsofsailsvgBasically you cant go straight into the wind but at other angles you can always set the sail up to redirect the wind and move you forward so while you cant go straight you can zigzag forwardshttpwwwgoldismoneycomattachmentphpattachmentidampdampthumb,0,cdpla5d,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1
koprita,All of the answers so far are ignoring one thing The keel or daggerboard on smaller boats is a board that sticks down into the water underneath the boat right around the middle of the craft that helps prevent the boat from drifting sidewaysThe keel is shaped in such a way that when the wind is blowing you sideways and the keel is resisting this the effect is like squeezing a watermelon seed between your fingers,1,cdplgbq,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,new,2,1
OmegaFile,The sail is simply acting like a planes wing,0,cdpn7s5,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1
Dirtybirdy,The sail essentially acts like a wing and generates lift based on air traveling  in turbulent flow on one side and laminar flow on the other Just like on a plane wing if air moves faster over one side the pressure will be different on either side and the boat is essentially sucked forward many boats can actually sail faster and more smoothly up wind than downwind This is why boats can sail into the wind even with only one sail The truth of the matter though is that modern computational methods arent advanced enough to theoretically model and calculate turbulent flow too many millions of molecules acting independently in seemingly random directions and the majority of sailing design like Sail shape and curvature is almost entirely empirical Ie Based on peoples personal experience and then fine tuning to obtain slightly better results ,0,cdpnr00,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1
SchrodingersDeadKat,You use the power of the wind by zigzaging sideways A part of the force that you feel sideways is transferred against the wind by using the keel that is why you would be going way slower against the wind than with it ,0,cdpoemq,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1
notepad,Like ukillavader mentioned the sail acts as a big airfoil lift similair to an aircraft wing is going to be generated and this will act generally about perpendicular to the chord of the airfoil the sail formswith the boat at  degrees to the incomming wind and the sail at about  degrees the lift vector will be approximatley in the direction the hull is facing Like thishttpimgurcomhOJVZOThwZGWOf course there are a lot of other little nuances that will effect the outcome but by and large this is how it works,0,cdpvnws,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1

NerdBell,Im surprised no ones given this answer yet so here goesCongratulations Youre using a lot more of your lungs than you used to While youre running youre building up an oxygen debt as your muscles start to use more and more oxygen than youve asked them to in the past and your lungs are struggling to keep up As a result you start really expanding your chest muscles  does this sound familiar This can be where side stitches come from However your lungs are really only used to taking in so much oxygen Chances are when youre just sitting around during the day or walking places you only take very shallow breaths The alveoli at the bottom of your lungs dont see much action and they get lazy but when you start taking deep heaving breaths you start to use them  and they dont like that very much This can happen regardless of whether its cold or warm outside and regardless of whether youre breathing in through your mouth and out through your nose or what have you and for the record Im pretty sure you can breath through whichever orifices you choose er within reason and breath out through whichever orifices you choose again choose wisely as long as youre getting enough breath Some people recommend breathing through both your nose and your mouthIn either case it really just means that youre helping your lungs gain capacity I would suggest looking up some breathing exercises online being really conscious of how deeply you breathe during your day and most importantly keep running Ninja edited for punctuation and stuffReal edit Someone made a fair criticism that this did not give a very scientificcomplete answer This article from a fitness website seems to provide a reasonable scientific explanation of whats going on but I cant find any actual primary scientific studies yethttpwwwlivestrongcomarticlewhydomylungshurtafterrunning,36,cdpkzib,1rp5hk,explainlikeimfive,new,184,148
Captainsuperdawg,If it happens in cold weather it could be simply from the cold air especially if youre breathing through your mouth The cold dry air doesnt warm up through your mouth but it does through your nose So when you breathe through your mouth in the cold weather your lungs get cold dry air in them which can cause the burning sensation,11,cdphrpa,1rp5hk,explainlikeimfive,new,57,46
MINTBERRYcrunch,For me I noticed this lung burning happened when I did not properly warm up my lungs to the air intake required during running which is more than when standing still sitting or walking A slow jog before running will raise your heart rate and breathing rate steadily rather than jumping right up to a running pace This will allow for a more controlled and comfortable run letting your body reach its maximum potential the legs tiring in this instance This is why warming up and cooling down is so crucial to a good work out or run,1,cdpjus9,1rp5hk,explainlikeimfive,new,9,8
fouzzz,EDIT Totally misread your question but I already typed this all up so Ill leave it for whoever is interestedI thought you were referring to a burning sensation in your legs before you tire OopsIm not an expert but I think youre referring to the effects of the build up of lactic acidAs I understand it when your body cant deliver enough oxygen to your muscles it temporarily forms lactate which helps break down glucose and give you energy However one of the downfalls of this process is that youll eventually experience increased acidity levels in your muscle cells hence lactic acid Now the whole process doesnt work very well in acidic environments so the whole process is hindered and this is where youll tend to get that muscle fatigue feeling This is all done as a natural mechanism to prevent muscle damage caused by overexertion Once your body slows down oxygen becomes more available and the whole system sort of reverses itself and everything is back to normalTLDR When oxygen is limited your body resorts to other means that provide a temporary fix but this process naturally halts and reverses itself before the quick fix causes any permanent damage ,10,cdphypn,1rp5hk,explainlikeimfive,new,15,5

soopergenius,In my experience this was because I was living around cigarette smokersIn my family everybody but me smoked  I was lucky enough to be tuned in to the late s propaganda against smoking that began to be disseminated in schools  As I got to the age where exercise seemed a useful venture I began running and after any run I would feel a tired heaviness in my upper chest  To me it seemed a natural consequence after exercise and it went away after a few consistent runsAfter I moved out of the house I continued running more off than on so there were many times I restarted the process  One year I went back to visit my family and decided because I was on vacation that I could run in the nice winter Florida air  Lo I felt the same heaviness but I realized I hadnt felt that in the previous attempts I made away from the family home  I made the connection then my moms smoking habit was affecting my breathing  It shortened my run at least the first few  I didnt do any doubleblind experiments or anything to see the actual differences or how long it lasted but for me it was a revelation that secondhand smoke was actually affecting me,3,cdpjsg1,1rp5hk,explainlikeimfive,new,4,1

anotherredditer,Theres a comment here referring to lactic acid  and thats more or less it Your lungs are surrounded by muscles between your ribs called intercostals They help expand your rib cage so you can take more air in and compress when you exhale helping the diaphragm Since they wouldnt normally get much usage they wear out quicker and the burn you get is that lactic acid buildup just the same as you get in your legs if you havent run in a while ,1,cdpl73q,1rp5hk,explainlikeimfive,new,1,0

hyquip,In the USA the aptitude test is known as the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery or ASVAB  Based on the score the recruit is presented with some Military Occupational Specialty or MOS which they can pursue after basic training  Its not just a job  I doesnt matter if its pushing paper or fighting a war everybody in the military is supposed to be a professional soldier  Theres also the difference between Enlisted and Commissioned personnel  ,0,cdphd3s,1rp7gk,explainlikeimfive,new,3,3
skatanic,One of the first things a potential recruit does is take the ASVAB  The ASVAB is a test that measures how good you are in various areas ie verbal skills mechanical systems math etc  Each area gets a score and each job has minimum scores in one or two of these areas  Theres also an overall score that determines if youre even able to join the military amongst other things  Each branch has its own minimum for this overall score so even if you dont score high enough to join the airforce you may be able to join the army or marinesAssuming the recruit qualifies to join the branch of service the recruiter then gives them a list of jobs they qualify for based on their line scores the scores from each area tested  The recruit then picks one of these jobs and starts training for basic  After basic they go to the school for whatever job they choseThis is one of the first places where the enlisted side diverges from the officer side  Enlisted soldiers pick their specific job  Officers pick three branches such as transportation medical communications etc and the needs of the ArmyNavyMarines determines which branch they get assigned to that is if an officers first choice is full the military will look at their second and third choices  Officers are expected to adapt wherever they go even if they didnt get the job they really wanted whereas enlisteds get the specific job they signed up forAs for why clerical people have to do physical training too its because theyre soldiers either in a warzone or preparing to be in one  Everybody fights  If a mortar comes in or theres an attack at the gate it doesnt matter what your job is  You fight you return fire period  If the enemys shooting at you and your positions about to be overrun Time out guys I need to catch my breath is not an acceptable response  If the  lb infantryman wearing  lbs of gear needs you to drag him  yds to cover because he just took some shrapnel I cant run that far Im not a combat MOS is not an acceptable response  Even though clerical personnel dont see combat on a daily basis they still have to keep up with their physical training because FOBs are a big fat target and someones going to die if they arent prepared for it,0,cdpiil3,1rp7gk,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2
computervirologist,Computer viruses fall under the category of malware or malicious software Even though viruses are commonly used as a term to refer to any type of malware a computer virus is technically a computer program that attaches itself to other programs A computer virus is usually an executable file that when executed will usually perform the following tasks  search for other files on the computer if the file is a program copy the viruss code to that program execute a payload which may or may not be destructiveOnce a program gets a viruss code injected into it it becomes an infected program An infected program when executed will run the virus code first before running the original code of the programSince viruses only infect files when theyre executed they rely on user interaction in order to spread Each time you execute the virus or a program infected with the virus any new programs that were not infected before will become infected now Keep in mind though that unless the virus has elevated privileges it can only infect programs that the current user has writeaccess to An antivirus virus is a program that spreads like a virus but when its code is executed it will detect and remove any virus that has attempted to infect it Think of it like a chain virus antivirus virus original program First the virus code will run then the antivirus virus code will run and remove the virus attached in front of it then the original program will run Antivirus viruses are just one of many of a concept for good viruses and are not widely used Besides viruses there are also computer trojans spyware ransomware backdoors worms and fork bombsTrojans are rogue programs they are programs that claim to do one thing but instead do something else For example many trojan programs ironically claim to be antivirus software but in reality they have malicious payloads such as downloading more malwareSpyware is any program that collects users personal data without their knowledge and consent Spyware programs may run in the background silently while monitoring the user In fact many trojan programs can also be classified as spyware if they carry this feature ransomware will deny access to your computer or data unless you pay a ransom Cryptolocker for example will encrypt the users files and ask for payment in exchange for the password to decrypt the files The password for decryption is stored on the hackers computer and the hacker will not send the password unless you pay up backdoors classify a feature of malware that allows the program to give remote control of the computer to the hacker Many computers installed with backdoors usually part of a botnet A botnet is a collection of computers compromised with backdoors which can all be controlled en masse by a single person usually for the purpose of overloading internet traffic to a bring a website down A worm is an autonomous computer virus Unlike computer viruses worms do not require human interaction in order to spread Worms usually have a database of exploits to use in order to find loopholes in networks for spreading When a worm is running on a computer it will execute any payloads it has and then try to enumerate over any computers in the same local network as its host It may try to scan the software ports of the neighbouring computers it finds to determine if there are any exploitable networking software on those computers Once it finds a host with vulnerable software the worm will run the appropriate exploit to transfer itself to that computer Viruses and worms naturally develop a mutual relationship Multiple viruses may infect a worm allowing the viruses to be transported across networks Once the worm reaches a destination the viruses copy themselves to that machine too You can think of the viruses as piggyback riding on the worm to spread at a faster rate Any worm infected with a virus is known as a mutated wormFinally the one of the simplest of all malware is the fork bomb Fork bombs simply replicate instances of themselves in order to saturate computer memory and system resources The result of fork bombs is the entire system becoming unresponsive requiring a hard reboot If a fork bomb is configured to always run when the system loads the computer will crash every time it is turned on The solution to removing a fork bomb configured for start up is to boot to an alternate operating system and modify the system files of the original operating system ,1,cdpiayi,1rp7ms,explainlikeimfive,new,6,5

diMario,Quantum mechanics or more broadly quantum physics studies matter on the level of elementary particles It turns out that strange things happen when you dig down to a smaller and smaller scale of thingsFor instance electric things In everyday life you can have a light bulb rating  Watt  Watt  Watt and so on If Philips were so inclined they could easily make a light bulb rating  watt or  Watt In every day life things happen on a sliding scale A certain property can have a value of  or a value of  or any other value in between  and Not so in quantum physics When you look at things in a smaller and smaller scale the properties that you measure take on distinct values For electric current for instance you can measure a flow of  unit of charge per second or you can measure a flow of  units of charge per second but you cannot measure a unit of  charge per secondThis is explained by theorizing that electric charge in everyday life is made up by the sum of a bunch of very small but distinct elementary electric charges of which you can have either  or  but not one and a halfIn order to describe this phenomenon physicists say that electric charge is quantized from which comes the quantum part of the nameNow as it turns out not only electric charge but practically all properties of matter that you care to study exhibit this behaviourOne of the theoretical consequences is that when speaking about properties on the quantum scale of things you cannot deal in certainties but only in probabilities When I perform a thousand measurements in a certain quantum physical experiment Ill find that roughly  times the outcome is  and  times the outcome is  But when I perform a single measurement I cannot predict whether the outcome is  or  Weird isnt itQuantum physics solves this weirdness by assuming that before the measurement the property I am about to measure is  and  both at the same time Only after I have measured it the quantum system has decided whether it was  or This means that only after I observe a system the system decides what value it will show me Thus it is said that reality the value of the property is influenced by observation the fact that I measure it,1,cdpij2p,1rp7qb,explainlikeimfive,new,11,10
QuigleyQ,I suppose it would be best to start with a brief historyWhat is light Some people such as Newton believed that light was made of tiny particles corpuscles that were fired off by the light source This explains why light goes in a straight line and how it is reflected off surfaces at the same angle But this does not explain how light is refracted through a prism for example Why would some particles bend more than others This could be corrected for by assuming that these corpuscles speed up when passing through glass Still there are other phenomena that the particle theory does not describe such as diffractionEventually physicists came to support a different theory of light Instead of discrete particles light was a wave Not like a water wave though this wave only moved tranversely like sohttpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonscElectromagneticwaveDgif This explained light much better than the particle theory The most striking example is in diffraction Imagine you have a solid sheet of metal with two slits cut in it a sensor screen some ways behind it and you shine a light onto this contraptionhttpwwwempiricalzealcomwpcontentuploadsdoubleslitboxjpg If light were a particle you should see two bars on the sensor like thishttpstephenwhittfileswordpresscomdoubleslitbulletsjpgw because the particles go through and continue going straight However if light were a wave the sensor would have a more complicated patternhttpgradphysicssunysbeduamarchintgif because the waves interfere with each otherhttpwwwatomunifrankfurtderesearchsynchrotronphotonmoleculeHdoubledoubleslitdoubleslitplanewavegif It turns out when you do this experiment that you get the interference pattern Coupled with the fact that you can explain pretty much all properties of light this theory is pretty convincing So its settled light is a wave rightThe challenge to this theory came from an unexpected direction When you heat up an object it emits light And physicists had equations to predict how much light of a particular frequency While these worked well for low frequencies they predicted that objects emitted infinite energy in the higher ones Clearly this is wrong Planck showed that this problem does not occur if light comes in discrete quantities Other properties such as the photoelectric effect and Compton scattering are also well described if light comes in lumps So are we back to the particle theory again If we are how do we explain the doubleslit experimentLets go back to it again If it is really a particle then why does the interference pattern form Say we place detectors at the slits If light is a wave then itll trigger both If its a particle itll just trigger one When we do this we see that only one is triggered So light is a particle But when you check the screen the interference pattern has disappeared and two stripes show up instead So we take away the detectors and try again Now it reappears If words dont cut it for you watch thishttpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonseeWaveparticledualityogvWhen we watch the slits light behaves like particles When we dont it behaves like waves How can we reconcile these two behaviors The answer is light behaves like some very unintuitive thingQuantum physics is the study of how on earth this works This waveparticle duality only seems to show up for small objects think on the scale of atoms Some of the consequences of this include Objects exist in a superpositionhttpenwikipediaorgwikiQuantumsuperposition of all possible states weighted towards the more likely ones Measuring the object collapses this superposition to a more defined state The more preciselyhttpenwikipediaorgwikiHeisenberguncertaintyprinciple you measure the position of an object the less you know about its momentum Occasionally objects can tunnelhttpenwikipediaorgwikiQuantumtunneling across gaps or barriers that they otherwise could not cross You can entanglehttpenwikipediaorgwikiQuantumentanglement two particles so that measuring one disturbs the other regardless of how far apart they are,0,cdpuf79,1rp7qb,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2

PigglesHunter,Im no physicist so bear with me You need to remove the idea of a ball of gas exploding to fill the universe It is the universe itself inflating it isnt exploding into anything It wasnt an explosion like you and I relate to Its more like the rapid and massive expansion of pure energy but there was no matter no gas at all It had to expand and cool a fair bit until the universe had cooled enough to allow for matter to come into existence from the converted energy The first particles came about a few minutes after the initiation Neutral stable atoms around  thousand of years later No one really knows what came before and it is an area of intense research with a number of theories Nothing in the existing universe can precede the Big Bang so the conditions that set it off are outside our experience outside time and space Some think that the universe began as a quantum fluctuation that was able to last long enough for the process of inflation start Once that process began there was no way for the fluctuation to annihilate itself and you end up with this runaway inflation of the universe This comes from the understanding that spacetime is in constant state of fluctuation There are virtual particle appearing and disappearing all around us Although it is specuated that the Higgs FieldhttpssimplewikipediaorgwikiHiggsfield prevents this from reoccuring within our universe again Another is where a pair of  dimensional braneshttpsenwikipediaorgwikiBrane collide with each other and produce a massive amount of energy which creates the trigger of the Big BangBear in mind Im just typing down what I understand and Im in no way a scientist But I highly recommend you watch Nova The Elegant Universe Its made for people like me who are a bit stupid but want to try and understand a little bit about why the universe is like it is and where it came fromEDIT Corrected a mistake thankyou panzerkampfwagen ,1,cdpibmz,1rpagq,explainlikeimfive,new,3,2
QuickSpore,Hang with me because things get pretty weird The early universe was so radically different from the universe as we know it today it is hard to wrap our brains around itThe Bang Bang is whenamong other things time began Asking what was before literally makes no sense in the context of the theory It is like asking what is north of the North PoleIt is also when matter came into being So there was no ball of gas there was no nothing Even in the early universe there was no gas Everything had so much energy even atoms couldnt form The subatomic particles were whizzing about too fast to form larger particlesAnd asking about a cause for the Big Bang is hard as well As far as we know the universe is it Maybe there is something more but we cant sense or interact with it because it would exist outside of the universe We can make guesses about what it might beScientists are not comfortable with this They would love to know But how do you examine before when there literally isnt a before And how do you measure what is outside something that has no edge to be outside of Thousands of people are working on exactly this And whoever gets an answer to either is guarantied a Noble prize,0,cdpnaur,1rpagq,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2

yakusokuN,First of all before answering any of the questions let me emphasize that the things that nonAmericans see are highly atypical and not representative of what happens everywhere  Theres  million or so of us and if you see  people acting crazed thats one person in a million  You arent seeing the vast majority of the other calmer bored tired shoppers who wait patiently in long lines in stores where nothing happens  These things dont make the news  gtIn such videos people always seem to be grabbing items at random Is this true Or do they have specific items in mindIn the videos you see they probably arent grabbing things randomly but theres so many people that its hard to calmly make your way through the crowd and tapping someone on the shoulder and saying pardon me can you pass me one of those  They most likely have items in mind but the craziest people seeking out the best deals are usually after expensive large items like television sets and its difficult to just grab one of the shelf tuck it under your arm and get out of the waygtIf theyre grabbing items at random just because theyre cheap what is the rationale behind that Do people grab and buy lots of things they dont even actually wantThis sometimes happens but its far from the normgtIf people arent grabbing items at random do they decide beforehand Do places like Walmart advertise lets say iPads as  off and then the riots happen because everyone had a premeditated goal to grab that one particular itemOh God does Walmart advertise  I was over at my parents place on Thanksgiving night and within one hour of watching a football game I must have seen  Walmart ads no exaggeration  We get ads in the mail ads in the newspaper and ads on radio and television nonstop for days  Its really impossible not to know that there are stores having deals on Friday  As youve noted yes often stores like Walmart will feature one big item thats normally  marked down to  and a few people every year get zealous about being the person to get it because quantities are usually limited  just enough to get people excited and in the store but not always enough for everyone to buy it who wants itgt Why are sales such a big deal to begin with Sure I like to save money as much as the next guy But mostly I cant be bothered going out of my way for the sake of a sale I dont mind paying a bit more money for the sake of convenience  even though I only work parttime and have a low incomeIm not justifying the kind of crazy behavior that makes the news in other parts of the world about us but its not just a little more at least percentage  Some items are marked down  so if you dont get it now you will be paying literally double if you go a week later  In the case of the really expensive things this can mean a few hundred dollars and for many who dont earn much this may mean a lot of hours  If you earn hr  off a tv is half a weeks paygtwhat makes Black Friday in the US so different to the equivalents in other countries What inspires all the excitementHonestly companies advertise for weeks the media hypes it up to create a story then reports a story where it happens and makes it seem like its a huge thing and so whats normally less hectic than shopping on Christmas Eve has now become a major deal with huge crowds and chaosDont think the US is unique though  When HampM stores were opening in Europe and other parts of the world there were crowds lined up to the stores  When big name movie stars show up at premieres in London and the like fans line up for hours  Fanaticism isnt localized to the US,38,cdpj66t,1rpfj9,explainlikeimfive,new,274,236

Mdcastle,Part of it is Friday is a holiday for most people that dont work in the service industries All the people in suits that normally make news are at home so its a slow news day anyway and since its a holiday people start to go shopping for Christmas The media and the retailers have hyped it up in recent years with say  flat screen TVs marked down to  as doorbusters They lose money but not a lot as they only have  of them per store so people line up the night before and camp out and maybe  people mob the store when it opens hoping to get one and when they dont they still buy other things Theres also a trend among stores to oneup each other by opening earlier than the competition you can probably only get to the doorbuster at the first store of the day so stores are opening earlier and ealier first early morning Friday then midnight Friday and now even Thanksgiving evening which is creating more news stories about how service workers are getting shortchanged as far as spending time with their families Thanksgiving in the US is when everyone comes home to grandmas house to eat dinner ,0,cdpkjs4,1rpfj9,explainlikeimfive,new,3,3

seerae,For me Black Friday is a family tradition with my dad As the food is cooking on thanksgiving we pull out the ads and browse the deals mapping out the stores we want to go to at the specific times and what we will be getting at each store We wake up at  am grab hot chocolate and wait in the freezing weather outside the store As soon as the doors are open we bolt inside rushing for the deals that we planned for and many other random bargains By  am weve hit all our stores and we grab breakfast at the pancake corral Then we come home for a nap and later we consolidate everything we bought and sort out what were going to return the next day Its a fun tradition but its been ruined since stores started opening on thanksgiving dayFrom my experience  people are rarely violent Ive never seen anything bad That being said there is a definite rush for the good deals I remember one morning they opened up one door and people were filling in but we were so far back that we wouldnt be able to snag one of the thirty  bluray players back when they were never cheaper than  But then A miracle The other door opens and my sister and I rush through sprint across the store hurdling over decorations and into the pile of electronics on sale That day we ended up with three bluray players My dad was proud Other deals inspire other people to come out I mean I normally wouldnt buy an Xbox because I cant justify the expense But two years ago WalMart had an Xbox with Kinect and two games for  It would be my only chance to get an Xbox I didnt get the deal though because that year WalMart opened on thanksgiving Really sad that our tradition is gone,1,cdpma8t,1rpfj9,explainlikeimfive,new,4,3

GreenTea,Basically to make you perceive the sound as wider and more realisticStereo sound attempts to recreate the experience of hearing a real band or whatever playing in the room with youyou hear with two ears of course and each of your ears picks up slightly different sounds because they are different distances from the source So your left ear might hear a little more guitar while your right ear hears more keyboardSound mixers try to reproduce that effect by making certain tracks louder in one stereo channel than the other tricking your earsbrain into thinking youre hearing sounds coming from different directions which makes the sound widerEventually people also began using stereo as an effect in itself for example having certain sounds pan quickly from one side to another which isnt particularly realistic but sounds coolTrue it would be easier to mix everything in mono but when your equipment is working properly stereo sounds better to most people ,1,cdpk3nz,1rpjnq,explainlikeimfive,new,7,6

systoll,Essentially Stereo sound different sound for each ear exists because we can distinguish which ear a sound is being played in  and we use this information to determine where sounds are coming from Putting everything through both earphones at the same level makes it sound like everythings in the same place right in front of us Its not terrible but not ideal By making different elements louder for one ear and softer in the other producers can create the illusion of different instruments existing in different places around you This sounds more realistic and also makes it easier for you to distinguish and follow particular instruments But others have explained this stuff Im here to demonstrate it Most iPods have an accessibility setting to make both earphones play the same thing On iOS you can find it in Settings gtGeneral gt Accessibility gt Mono Audio Enable it with functional headphones and youll notice a substantial difference It also serves as a fix when one of your earphones breaks Or if you want to use it as intended when you go deaf in one earEDIT Buuut quick question When you say you can only hear select layers of a song does that include having the main vocals getting mostly stripped out of most songs Because thats usually what signals the end of my earbuds and its a different issue entirely ,0,cdplrrp,1rpjnq,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2

danpaquette,gt What happens after a company forgets to renew their domain name Once the domain expires it enters a renewal grace period of about  days where the original owner can reclaim it Once that  days is up it enters a redemption period where the domain is frozen for  more days and drops from the zone file The original owner can reclaim or make changes to the domain but the registrar fees at this point are often well into the hundreds of dollars which is easily still worth it if the alternative is losing your businessFor about  to  days it goes through deletion processing where it is dropped from the registry and is available to be registered by the general publicSome registrars will retain their deleted domains to auction them off whether they do it themselves or have an agreement with a third party auction house depends on the registrarMore often than not a domain that had an established website never makes it through deletion processing and is sold off for auction Old domains that had measurable bodies of content users or search volume can be extremely valuable and can sell for many thousands of dollarsWhen its bought at auction the new owner can use the domain as they see fit The vast majority of auctioned domains end up in a portfolio of domains owned by a reseller we call them a squatter They often prompt the original domain owners their competitors and other interested parties to buy the domain well above cost gt Can the person who bought it afterwards negotiate a huge price for the company to get it backThis is legal as long as the domain isnt a registered trademark and they arent trying to actively impersonate the original owners of the domain If there are trademark or legal issues there are avenues people can take to reclaim their domains otherwise theyre out of luck and either have to pay the squatters exorbitant fees or find another domain Ive had companies that drop their domains because no one was monitoring their registrar billing information that were squatted and reoffered to them for tens of thousands of dollars The moral of the story is to always make sure your billing information is uptodate and set your domains to autorenew,14,cdpl9aq,1rpk3n,explainlikeimfive,new,106,92

TheDoctorApollo,After a big meal your body diverts energy to your digestive system to help in the digestion and absorption of the food Smaller meals more frequent meal that are light and have few complex carbohydrates should help in reducing this effect because they will take less energy to process,0,cdpl2x6,1rpnoh,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1
hshepherd,Okayso dgestion does take some effort on your bodies part but the actual driving factor in the tired feeling after a large meal is insulin When you eat startchy foods you are in effect pumping sugar in your veins Your body releases insulin as a response Insulin quickly removes sugar from your blood stream by storing it as fat It also puts your body into an anabolic state Insulin basically is a hormone that is screaming at your body to grow and sleep This is the sugar crash you see in little kids It happens in adults too and with complex carbs as well not just simple onesyou probably notice this is alot more prevelant after eating a big side of mashed potatoes then it is after you eat  lbs of chicken wings The wings are pure proteinfat and will make you feel bloated but they wont make you sleepy like the potatoes or pasta So the best way to avoid the feeling is to control your carb intake Consequently this is going to probably make you lose weight as well becaue you arnt constantly spiking your insulin which is what is making your body gain weight,0,cdplu25,1rpnoh,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1

SecureThruObscure,Depends Individuals with bad circulation really do have numbness or coldness in the extremities faster than people with healthy circulation The reason is pretty straightforward Your blood and veins act like a radiator system Theyre brought to the same temperature as the surrounding area and then sent off to a different part of the body Is its cold out your blood is brought up to your core temperature then sent out to the extremities  It then radiates transmits that heat to the fingers toes etc Typically they lose heat especially in cold weather  People with circulatory issues just supply less blood to their extremities than those without Its worth noting that in cold weather your body constricts the blood vessels in your extremities to prevent hypothermia less blood gets to the skinfingers less heat gets lost and in people with circulatory issues this effect has a greater effect of restriction on overall blood flow than  in otherwise healthy individuals ,40,cdpmmm6,1rptm5,explainlikeimfive,new,161,121

Shmalpin,Your extremities are naturally the coldest parts of your body this is why gout crystals most commonly form in the big toe  They are the farthest away from the heated core of the body so it follows that they are more susceptible to the cold than your head abdomen chest etc  In the cold the body attempts to generate heat in the extremities  this manifests as shivering  If cold in the extremities persists the body shunts blood away from the arms and legs to preserve a warm functional core temperature    If someone genuinely has bad circulation or a pathological reason that their extremities are very coldsensitive and not an offhand selfmade diagnosis then it would be due to a lack of blood reaching the extremities  Individuals with autoimmune disorders like Lupus Diabetes Mellitus Hypertension and Vasculitis generally suffer from some sort of peripheral blood vessel damage  This damage leads to less corewarmed blood reaching the extremities  When less blood is getting to your arms and legs they naturally become closer to the temperature of their environment  Diabetes and Hypertension are becoming increasingly prevalent but autoimmune disorders and vasculitis are extremely rare    Bad circulation is something that a lot of folks are eager to diagnose themselves with whether or not a true medical cause exists  Similar to people that claim to get migraines when really they suffer from the occasional worse than usual headache More likely than not folks generally  dont have medicalgrade bad circulation,2,cdppuxh,1rptm5,explainlikeimfive,new,11,9

TheDoctorOfLove,surgical resident hereNEVER do we inject epinephrine adrenaline intracardiac I really cant see a reason to could be wrong but Ive never heard of any drug being injected straight into the heart even during cardiac surgery When in a crunch it can be injected intramuscular ie epipen for people with severe allergies which gives good enough absorption to have the desired effect Epinephrine jump starts the heart by activating receptors that  increase heart rate chronotrophy and  increase the strength of contraction of the heart ionotrophy If you have taken a drug that slows down the heart this can counteract the effect If your heart has stopped beating aside from CPR we give epinephrine every few minutes until your heart starts pumping on its own or you die Pulp fiction is inaccurate because a heroin or any other opioid overdose does not kill by slowing the heart but but causing respiratory depression which we counteract with naloxone The rock is slightly more accurate since chemical weapons often act by mimicking the signal to slow down the heart Goodspeed appropriately takes atropine which blocks this signal ELI you wouldnt ever really inject adrenalin into your heart but if you did you would kickstart the heart by activating receptors as stated above,0,cdpzp1f,1rpxtz,explainlikeimfive,new,3,3

mookie,Ok let me try to give you the perspective that me and my friends have as  year old college students who talk about politics regularly and Reagan frequently comes up All of us even the Democrats agree that our parents have a kind of blind admiration for Reagan as they cant really give us a reason for viewing him as a great president but heres what we think The combination of new technology being integrated into the stock market massive outsourcing looser economic restrictions and crack downs on unions gave the middle class much stronger buying power for the time at least but actually ended up levying almost irreparable damage on Americas social mobility He also had little care for political correctness and used terms like welfare queens and engrained in people the incorrect fact the welfare was being abused by those on it basically perpetuating a kind of de facto racism that persists to this day and it should be obvious how this was appealing to Whites from all social classes Also his Trickledown economics which in theory sounds really appealing but fails to account for the natural greed and self servitude that permeates among all humans but because of economic success due to other factors it appeared to work due to failures in modern day Canada Bush  and Bush  its clear Trickledown doesnt work as well as thought Anyway he empowered the middle class and there was even a mild recession towards the end of his second term which people didnt attribute to him but instead blamed on new technology because of his cult of personality So basically he was loved because he built an aura of invincibility and growth which was powered by short term fixes to our problems which are even today causing us problems ie outsourcing and the fact that he had a massive cult of personality populated by young middle class kids coming out of college who were allowed massive spending power due to the cheapening of goods and the influx of jobs because of the growth technology which had little if anything to do with Reagan and military spendingtldr I dont like Reagan,7,cdpvyi5,1rpxue,explainlikeimfive,new,11,4

Drew,You say that Reagan is held to be one of the best US presidents but who believes this  Your statement is a pretty sweeping statement which suggests that there is widespread respect for Reagans accomplishments  But that is only true except among fairly traditional and conservative Americans  In any case even if he were held to be an amazing president the quality of a president is not determined by their popularity or JFK would be one of the best presidents this country had ever had JFK is now generally considered to have been a fairly mediocre president  His popularity and the very positive memories of him today came largely from factors such as his coming into office at a very conservative time at the end of the s while being himself young and vigorous having an attractive wife and young children the last young children in the White House had been Teddy Roosevelts and that had been nearly  years before JFK and caring about important issues of social change such as civil rights the Peace Corps nuclear disarmament and so forth  The American public liked the fact that he cared about making changes and that he was youthful attractive witty and energetic  But Kennedy accomplished almost nothing as president No civil rights laws and so forth  Then he was killed which froze the positive feelings about him permanently in peoples memories  The public was heartbroken at the death of such a youthful and charming president and so did not want to even consider rethinking Kennedy which would have seemed unfair and ghoulish  He was our prince and that was the end of the thought process in a way Reagans reputation developed somewhat similarly though not quite in the same way as Kennedys  After all Reagan did not die in office but he was very good on TV witty pleasant easygoing like JFK and much like Kennedy the camera seemed to love him So Regan came across as a likable person as JFK had  Reagan had a less appealing wife in Nancy who was somewhat odd in her belief in astrology and other  habits and Reagans children from his two marriages he had been divorced and remarried were older and a few did not much like him so he never had those assets  But he was a nice guy had a good sense of humor and his appeal on TV always benefitted him  Attractive people with a deprecating sense of humor always appeal no matter what their abilities really are And Reagan was not a bright man  He subscribed to a conservative and narrow philosophy that business could do not harm that our enemies were all evil and did not need to be negotiated with and that America could do no harm  His view of the country and the world was pretty much the view he had learned as a young man and he never really changed it into a more nuanced or sophisticated view as thinking people do  As for his actual policies as president he was impressive in that very late in his presidency he changed his mind and went against the advice of his advisors in seeking nuclear limits with the Soviet Union He had come late in his presidency to realize that a nuclear standoff was a very dangerous thing But this was very much different from the rest of Reagans foreign policy   Much of the rest of his foreign policy was unusually aggressive as Kennedys had been as well with the Bay of Pigs and Cuban Missile Crisis which took us to the brink of nuclear war in   Reagan invaded Grenada in the Caribbean and escalated the nuclear and conventional arms race greatly  He is often credited with defeating the Soviet Union but that is a great oversimplification since the defeat of the SU came as much from all previous presidents efforts as from Reagans and it resulted at least as much from the USSRs own economic and political failures as from any outside pressures arguably more from internal problems than from what the US did  Reagan was in the right place at the right time as the Soviets began to crumble  But the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries actually fell during the presidency of Reagans successor GHW Bush  Maybe he should get all the credit  Of course that would be silly too but crediting Reagan is just as illogical  What people remember about Reagan is that he was a nice guy like JFK who made them feel good that he stood up to the Soviets but so had Truman Eisenhower JFK and other presidents often much more dramatically and that the economy was reviving after a terrible economic decade in the s  So Americans felt better in the s  Was this Reagans doing  Perhaps the economy revived due to Reagan but more likely it was due to other factors such as the end of the Arab oil embargoes which Reagan had nothing to do with ending and to the cyclical increase in the economy that always follows a weak economy and other factors  Reagan actually did do something economically that we still suffer from today  he began the year shift of wealth to the upper class and away from the middle class through his very uneven tax policies which cut taxes on the wealthiest Americans far more than on others  This legacy was one of Reagans worst and we are still suffering because of it  But almost no one today realizes this since they had already formed their opinion of Reagan in the s and most Americans dont understand very well the economic changes of the last  years or who is responsible for the fact that they are not getting ahead while the wealthiest Americans are doing better than at any time since the s This shift was engineered by Reagan and his advisors who sought to cut taxes on the wealthiest Americans and deregulate corporations shifting vast amounts of wealth from the middle class into the pockets of a few at the top  Reagan was also very antiunion his firing of air traffic controllers accelerating the destruction of labor unions which has been a major factor whatever you might think of unions in maintaining good wages for the middle and lower middle classes which stopped improving at this time  Reagan was also a strongly antienvironmental president whose Secretary of the Interior and head of the Environmental Protection Agency abused their offices to serve the needs of timber and coal companies and let auto companies off the hook in not enforcing safety regulations and gas mileage laws  On popular issues like these Reagan was out of touch and left a very negative legacy  As he did with healthcare and the AIDS epidemic which began while he was president  Reagan did nothing to deal with AIDS those who got the disease were most often leftie homosexuals which Republicans did not care about or to improve the medical system in any way  In fact Reagans social record in general is among the poorest of any modern president  In short  our popular views of presidents are often somewhat in conflict with the realities and often at variance with the more considered view of historians  Reagan is ranked somewhere in the high middle of American presidents today while Kennedy is ranked lower and generally considered mediocre  But neither is ranked among the top presidents The public tended to ignore the facts of what Reagan was actually doing and instead they just liked the guy and believed the rhetoric of his supporters that he cared about people was reviving the economy was a patriot on foreign policy  These claims are inaccurate but the average American does not read much Im afraid or dig very deeply into politics and tends to go by whatever the popular image of someone is and how they feel about someone rather than looking more critically at what they are really doing And a sizable part of the population never did like Reagan he was reelected in  of course or buy most of the claims made in his favor and in the last years of his presidency Reagans popularity was dropping  This was partly due to his involvement in the IranContra Scandal which was a series of illegal activities his advisors had been involved in with Iran and Nicaragua which could have resulted in Reagans impeachment but didnt He somehow survived to the end of his term and he got Alzheimers fairly soon after leaving the White House he was already very old and people generally liked him so there was little effort to reevaluate him or criticize him  The public simply choose not to care  But the facts are there nevertheless  It always reminded me of a somewhat tipsy old uncle who had a questionable past had been divorced and lied a little about his accomplishments but was very charming and told good stories so people liked him anyway Popular views of presidents are a very poor way of evaluating them  Abraham Lincoln often ranked as the best president today was considered at the time he was president to be fairly average while some Gilded Age presidents no one even remembers today were considered at their time to be very good  Popular views are shaped by emotion sentiment misunderstandings a certain amount of ignorance abut the issues and faulty memories  Truman was widely disparaged as president then there was a Truman Revival in the s after wed had a series of failed presidents which made Truman look much better and now Truman is receding somewhat as he has been reevaluated once more  Reagan is likely to remain in the middle of presidential reputations but not much higher I think due to his economic divisiveness and other legacies we still suffer from today without being seen as the architect of the fall of communism anymore than other presidents were  In any case I know very few educated people who consider Reagan at all impressive as president  Its the average folks of a more conservative nature who just kind of liked the guy  Heck I liked him but I hated his policies and still do ,0,cdpwhoq,1rpxue,explainlikeimfive,new,4,4

VoreGidal,The myth of Reagan as a great economic free market messiah is conservative propaganda httpthinkprogressorgpoliticsreagancentennialSome standout quotes Reagan nearly tripled the federal budget deficit During the Reagan years the debt increased to nearly  trillion roughly three times as much as the first  years of the century had done altogether Reagan enacted a major tax cut his first year in office and government revenue dropped off precipitously Despite the conservative myth that tax cuts somehow increase revenue the government went deeper into debt and Reagan had to raise taxes just a year after he enacted his tax cut Despite ten more tax hikes on everything from gasoline to corporate income Reagan was never able to get the deficit under control Unemployment soared after Reagans  tax cuts Unemployment jumped to  percent after Reagan enacted his muchtouted tax cut and it took years for the rate to get back down to its previous level Meanwhile income inequality exploded Despite the myth that Reagan presided over an era of unmatched economic boom for all Americans Reagan disproportionately taxed the poor and middle class but the economic growth of the s did little help them Since  median household income has risen only  percent adjusted for inflation while average incomes at the top have tripled or quadrupled the New York Times David Leonhardt noted Reagan grew the size of the federal government tremendously Reagan promised to move boldly decisively and quickly to control the runaway growth of federal spending but federal spending ballooned under Reagan He bailed out Social Security in  after attempting to privatize it and set up a progressive taxation system to keep it funded into the future He promised to cut government agencies like the Department of Energy and Education but ended up adding one of the largest  the Department of Veterans Affairs which today has a budget of nearly  billion and close to  employees He also hiked defense spending by over  billion a year to a level not seen since the height of the Vietnam war,3,cdpzabn,1rpxue,explainlikeimfive,new,6,3

DrMerkwurdigliebe,Thanks for asking a great ELI question We need more of these around hereThe difference lies in where power is at least in theory concentrated In a unitary system all power and legislative authority rest with the national government This means that the national government is the only one allowed to make new laws and that it makes laws for the entire country The UK operates under a unitary system A unitary system allows for broad application of national policies and standardizes government services across regionsA federal system splits up power between the national government and regional governments The US is an example of a federal system the national government has the power to do certain things like raise an army and regulate interstate trade and the states have the power to do other things like run schools and build roads This allows different states to pass different laws based on what works best for them It also limits the power of the national governmentThere is actually a third government type that goes along with federal and unitary systems confederations Confederations are on the opposite end of the spectrum from unitary governments In a confederation the nation is divided into regions or states like in a federation however rather than the regional and national governments being in a balance the regional governments hold the vast majority of the power the opposite of a unitary system This means that most laws are tailored to local interests which is good however problems can arise when a confederacy needs to act together as a single nation like in wartime since the national government is too weak to act effectively,0,cdpq1px,1rpza1,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1

wreckeditralph,I will give this my best shot  I am by no means an expert but I did a little research when I was looking into water filters    When you pass a substance through a charcoal filter a decent number of impurities will chemically attach to the charcoal and become trapped This is another thing that makes charcoal attractive as a filter medium it attracts a lot of the undesirable impurities while leaving everything else aloneCharcoal is also very porous which helps give it a LOT of surface area  This means that charcoal also has lots of areas for the chemical impurities to attach,0,cdpr1dd,1rq92s,explainlikeimfive,new,3,3
jackrex,Actually in most cases we use activated charcoal  which is charcoal treated with oxygen Due to this the molecular distance between the carbon atoms is increased thus effectively increasing the molecular surface area  ie it becomes more porousThis increases adsorption of various liquid and gaseous impurities httpenwikipediaorgwikiAdsorptionIn simpler terms due to adsorption  impurities are trapped in between the carbon atomsAfter a certain period of time all the intermolecular spaces are occupied by impurities and the filter will not adsorp any more This is when you need to change the filter,0,cdpratw,1rq92s,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2

soIsaystomabel,Ok what people are missing about why activated charcoal actually absorbs things yes the pores are important but not the only reason is that charcoal is made up of many carbon atoms bonded together The surface of this carbon material has many sites of positive charge When it is activated by being treated with oxygen the surface of the carbon many of the neutral sites and some of the sites of positive charge are changed so they now have negative charges This leaves the surface of the charcoal with regions of neutral positive and negative charge In practice this means that just about any material suspended or dissolved in a fluid can find a location of attraction on the carbon which it sticks to removing it from the liquidIt can then simply be allowed to settle out of or float to the top of the liquid depending on the density of the carbon used as it will have a different density than the waterThe reason it is used is because it is cheap and doesnt require much energy to actually process the water You basically mix them let it settle,0,cdptzuz,1rq92s,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1

TimeTravellerSmith,Technically yes  It depends on what medium the sound is moving throughSo take a hammer and anvil and bang the hammer down in the air and it moves at a certain speed  Take the same hammer and anvil underwater and the sound will actually travel faster than it would through air  Take a hammer and slam it on a long steel girder and the sound will move through the girder even faster than it would have through the water or airHowever if you are in the same medium you cant get sound to move any faster than the speed of sound in that medium  Speed of sound is constant in a given medium,0,cdprcvb,1rqa2m,explainlikeimfive,new,5,5

Carpet,So the speed of sound in a medium is the velocity that a pressure wave moves through that material atYou can drive a pressure wave through a material at greater than that velocity but you a get a shock wave In the example of a supersonic plane flying through the air this is heard as a sonic boom In a solid when this occurs this is the definition of a detonation The shock wave causes an event called Brisance which shatter the outside faces of the solid causing shrapnelIn both example the pressure wave is still moving above the speed of sound and transmitting the same information so technically you can do it But the shocks caused will create a lot of noise and reflections ruining the point,0,cdpsbda,1rqa2m,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2

TimeTravellerSmith,It does it just does it very slowly  When you have the exposed wick buried in wax and light it the flame has to expend energy melting the wax which in liquid form is also flammable which slows down how fast it can burn the wick since only a little bit is exposed at a time  If you were to take a candle slice it in half pull out the wick and burn it by itself it would be gone in minutes since the whole thing would be exposed to flame as soon as the flame moved down the wick  ,0,cdprak9,1rqa6d,explainlikeimfive,new,3,3

dasmaraud,The amount of energy the fan provides that transforms inmediately into heat is negligible compared to the increase in kinetic energy Eventually when the air calms down a few feet past the fan this kinetic energy might transform into heat and raise the temperature a bitOn the other hand the increase in the speed of the air surrounding your body will also increase the convective heat transfer between these two This means your body either gains or loses heat more rapidly depending on whether the air is hotter or colder,0,cdps2wl,1rqbnk,explainlikeimfive,new,1,1

monkeiboi,A handgun is a firearm that typically wielded and fired by one hand although this is not technically accurate the general concept is that the weapon is designed to be gripped by one hand A revolver as mentioned below is a handgun in which the cartridges or shot is carried in a cylindrical wheel that rotates either by manual manipulation single action or by action of pulling the trigger double action and moves the next round into position to be fired The other type of handgun is referred to as an automatic or semiautomatic handgun With semiautomatic being the more accurate term In this design the weapon functions by automatically cycling the next cartridge into the chamber by using the force of expelled gases to eject a spent casing and load a fresh one typically from a spring loaded magazine Most of these fire one round per pull of the trigger hence SEMIautomatic Handguns that fire multiple rounds with each pull of the trigger are generally referred to as machine pistols Handguns fire pistol rounds which are generally shorter and sometimes fatter than rifle rounds Bullets have a lower velocity and shorter range consistent with their intended functionA rifle is a firearm that is designed to be wielded and fired with two hands has rifling in the barrel and fires a full size or intermediate sized cartridge  A shotgun is also a two handed firearmbut distinct from a rifle in that it usually has a smooth bore barrel although rifled shotguns are common and designed to fire shot many small pellets birdshot may have hundreds of bb sized pellets where  buckshot is nine  cal lead pellets any variation like that you can think of or slug rounds which are thick heavy bullets The distiction is that shotgun rounds generally do not fit snugly in barrel when traveling out like a rifle A rifled shotgun allows the shooter to fire a smooth slug sized bullet with performance similiar to a rifle because it is a tighter fit Shotguns are beneficial in that one shotgun can fire shot slugs or basically anything that will fit in the barrel but always have a shorter range and velocity than a rifle cal cal refers to the bullets diameter in inches mm is the same thing just using the metric system,0,cdpucfk,1rqfiw,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2

wdmc,Under normal circumstances mucus is pushed by cilia little hairlike things toward the back of the nasal cavity to the pharynx which is just the back of your nasal cavity that connects to the esophagus Once mucus makes it here gravity takes over and the mucus drains down the esophagus into the stomach were it is digestedThe nasal septum is what separates the sinuses into your left and right nostril A deviated septum can cause trouble breathing because it will physically block either the left or right airway Im not a doctor but my guess is that your deviated septum is not very severe otherwise you would have trouble breathing all the timeIf it only happens at night it probably is just the result of the fact you are lying down In this position without the help of gravity it is much harder for mucus to drain down into your stomach so it is possible for it to build up in your nasal passages causing congestion This effect could be amplified by a deviated septumThe solution Just from experience being sick I would suggest elevating your head a little bit when you sleep Give yourself a couple extra pillows and see if it helps If it doesnt it could also be allergies like some other posters have suggested,0,cdq1h34,1rqgi3,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2

soIsaystomabel,Ok so I did a lot of H NMR work during my undergrad but it has been a while The nuclei of all atoms have specific properties given their specific make up this includes isotopes of individual atoms When you put atomic nuclei in a magnetic field they can absorb and reemit radiation of specific wavelengths frequency The wavelength of the radiation they can absorb is determined by the strength of the magnetic field they are in and the magnetic properties of the nuclei themselvesSo NMR spectroscopy works by putting nuclei in a magnetic field of known strength and hit it with radiation of a known wavelength You then measure the emission of any radiation from the nuclei When it is detected you have the magnetic field strength and the wavelength of radiation absorbed and emitted so you are able to determine the magnetic properties of the nuclei Which tells us which nuclei or nuclei group for the case of complex molecules is presentEdit Sometimes I find formula helpful this isnt actually a mathematical formula just a relationship between the information basically N Nuclei specific magnetic properties W wavelength of the radiation absorbedemitted and M strength of the magnetic fieldN  M  W  so if you can measureknow any two terms you can determine the rd,0,cdpuaxb,1rqjpn,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2
TimeTravellerSmith,Top and new are pretty self explanatory  New ones are new and top ones are sorted based on most upvotes over a certain period of timeHot is what has a lot of upvotes and current activity right nowControversial are posts that have very even amounts of updownvotes and a lot of activity,0,cdpu04r,1rqjwp,explainlikeimfive,new,9,9
TheCodexAlliance,One of the best things about reddit is that we can like and dislike comments and posts based on how good they are We call this upvoting and downvotingWhat reddit does is tally all of the up and down votes For every upvote  point is awarded to a post For every downvote  point is taken away Then reddit organizes everything in nice little tabs labeled top new hot controversial oldTop sorts all the comments by number from top to bottom So the very best comment will be at the top of the list and the very worst comment will be at the votom of the listNew sorts all of the comments based on when they were added to reddit This post was  minutes ago and was near the top of the new listHot sorts comments in order of the highest points for the past hour Reddit does some fancy math and shows you stuff you might like For instance if you have anfettish for clicking on kitten photos it will you you kitten photos more oftenControversial orders comments based off of thier likeability If my meme gets  upvotes and  downvotes its controversial because people like it and dislike it equallyFinally old will show you stuff from the past week or month that was cool Think of it as an archive of the hot tab but from a few days ago You can even see what was cool  year ago Hope this helps,1,cdpuqgw,1rqjwp,explainlikeimfive,new,4,3
tibbytime,This is debatably not an ELI topic but Ill humor itRap has pretty hard to figure origins Black culture has never been as well preserved or documented as white culture so a lot of old stuff is lost There are some roots going all the way back to Africa with rhythmic and rhyming storytelling over drum beats Its hard to say if this REALLY filtered into the modern genre or not but it probably influenced slaves who influenced the first free blacks who influenced ragtime and then jazz When you get to the jazz generation you get a lot of Harlem Renaissance poets who started performing poetry over jazz This didnt directly turn into hiphop either but it created a kind of precedent that may have directly or indirectly influenced people who would later make hiphop The same can be said of funk in the s a lot of people would even argue that a few select funk albums might be the earliest rap albums particularly Here Comes the JudgeMost of what we now call rap was born in the s DJs spinning dance albums particularly funk and some dub would rap over these records usually improvisationally to toast someone in celebration or for comedy Particularly in New York DJs became sort of competitive about this making more complex and stylized rhymes and trying to elevate the game Eventually you started getting people writing original lyrics to match with older beats and even further down the road you got people who started recording their stuffAfter that the rest is pretty easy to figure out,0,cdpv1ia,1rqjy6,explainlikeimfive,new,3,3
Lkinash,Thunderstorms take the already present static electricity that is in the air static electricity is formed simply by things that have friction rubbing against each other so something as simple as a plane or a bird or even wind moving in the air can create some of it and it discharges that static electricity by connecting to the ground In a way this is where the original voltage and ground of circuits comes from as soon as there is enough moisture in the air since water is conductive the electricity in the air will be conducted down to the ground through that water in the air,0,cdpw8na,1rqkey,explainlikeimfive,new,2,2
