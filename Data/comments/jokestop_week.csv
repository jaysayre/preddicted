Terrible joke. I don't get it at all. 


&gt;A doctor walks into a bar. He appears to be exhausted; his hair is disheveled, his face is drawn. Bartender asks “rough day?” The doctor sits at the bar and says “its flu season, give me a shot.”

/r/dadjokes


&gt;An elderly man walks into a bar holding hands with a beautiful young woman. He is obviously a man of great wealth, as his watch is decked in diamonds and his suit is of Italian make. As the pair sits down, the bartender says “I’m sorry sir, but we don’t serve minors here,” nodding towards the woman. The man retorts “Now hold on just a minute. How would you know if she’s a minor? You haven’t even asked for her ID!” The bartender shrugs and says “she’s clearly a gold digger.”

Groan. 

&gt;A large block of ice walks into a bar and places his order. “I’ll take a whisky on the rocks, but don’t serve my kids.”

Meh

&gt;The bartender walks into a doctor’s office and says “same punch line, different context.” …

This would work better if it came immediately after the first one. 

&gt;Two nuns walk into a bar. The first is elderly, and seems to be fully devout. The other is young, blonde, and appears to be new to the convent. “Bartender,” says the elderly nun, “I was wondering if you could settle a little dispute for us. You see, my trainee believes that true holiness can be achieved in a matter of days, rather than with the years on end that I’ve been practicing. One year out of catholic school, and she thinks that she is as holy as me!” “I’ll tell you what,” replies the bartender, “both of your write down your arguments, and I’ll decide who among you is most holy.” The sisters begin to write their cases. The elder nun finishes first, and slides her paper toward the bartender. At this point, the blonde sister has pulled out a calculator, and starts to plug away at the buttons. The bartender reads the first paper aloud. “‘Everyday, for the last 40 years, I’ve woken at dawn for morning prayer. I prepare breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the entire convent, while using any spare hours for reading the texts and scripture. In case that isn’t holy enough, I volunteer on the weekends.’ Good gracious, sister!” Says the bartender, “this is quite exemplary.” By now, the young nun has finished and has passed her paper to the bartender. “All this says is πr2, r=2… Hold on, is this an equation for the area of a circle?!” exclaims the bartender. “Oh, sorry,” says the blonde, blushing. “It was supposed to be circumference.”

So, the it's supposed to be a ""hole?""

&gt;A bartender has been going through a financial rough patch, and hoped that his wife would accommodate for the tough times by letting him try anal. Now, the wife resents her husband, and was appalled by his audacity to ask for such a thing with their marriage on the fritz. She denies his request. Later in the week, a man walks into the bar and asks the bartender for a prostitute. The bartender is about to send the man on his way, when he gets an idea that would make him some money while simultaneously punishing his wife. “You see that woman in the corner?” He asks, “Well, she’s one of the best girls we got. You go over to her and take her into the private room. You can do whatever you want with her, no matter how much she resists. It’s all part of the act. After you’re through, come back here and pay full price, $2000.” The man nods his head excitedly in agreement and walks toward the wife. The bartender watches from afar as the two exchange a few quick words. All of a sudden, he sees the man grab his wife by the arm and pull her into the private room. The bartender smiles inwardly to himself and thinks “Ha! That’ll teach the bitch to appreciate me. Plus, I’m making a small fortune!” After about twenty minutes, the wife comes out, alone. She heads over to the bartender with a slight limp. “Where’s your new friend?” asks the bartender, smiling. “He owes me a little money.” The wife snickers, pulls her husband in close and whispers in his ear “I let him use the back door,” and walks away. 

Yup, the only thing funnier than a rape joke is an anal rape joke, especially when there's prostituion involved.

So a news reporter was doing a story on homeless people and wanted to find out what type of interesting things they found on railroad tracks, So he visited the local soup kitchen and found a table of three homeless men sitting down, 

He asked to sit down and said he was doing a story on cool things found on railroad tracks, He asked the first man what the coolest thing he has ever found. 

""Once while wondering the track I found a twenty dollar bill and came back here with cheap wine and drank with my pals""

The next man said 
""Last week when I was crossing the tracks I found a hundred dollar bill and came back here a with lots of liquor and got drunk with my friends"" 

The news reporter was shocked at how much money he found and asked the last guy what the best thing he has found, the man replied 

""Last weekend I found a beautiful women tied to the tracks so I untied her and had the best sex ever all day and night, we did all kinds of things""

The news reporter was astounded that a women would have sex with this homeless man.

Series_of_Accidents,"Reminds me of this one:

Once in a land far, far away there lived a group of people called Trids. The Trids were happy except for the huge ogre that lived on the mountain. The ogre would periodically terrorize the Trids.

The Trids tired of the ogre and sought to reason with him. They thought one of their religious leaders would be a good intermediary. So a group of Trids and their minister went up the mountain and before they could even say one word the ogre kicked them down the mountain. Not being dismayed the Trids thought that maybe the ogre was Catholic, so they sent another delegation, this time led by the local priest. But alas, as they approached the ogre he once again kicked them all down the mountain.

The Trids were upset until they thought that perhaps the ogre was Jewish. Unfortunately, no Trids were Jewish, so they wrote to the people of another land and asked them to send a Rabbi to help them with the ogre. The Rabbi arrived and led a delegation of Trids up the mountain. The ogre saw them coming and kicked all of them, except for the Rabbi, down the mountain. The Rabbi, having been told of the previous expeditions, wondered why he alone had not been kicked down the mountain, so he asked the ogre. The ogre laughed and replied:

""Silly Rabbi, kicks are for Trids!""

""Silly Rabbi, kicks are for Trids!""

The scientist soon depleted his area's Myna bird population, so he needed to travel to where there were more Myna birds.  So he went to Africa and hunted lots of the birds.  One day, coming back from a hunt and carrying a lot of Mynas, he saw a lion in his path.  There was no way to go around, and luckily the lion was asleep, so the scientist quietly, gingerly stepped over the lion...when suddenly a big group of African soldiers popped out of the jungle and arrested him.

merry_christmus,"After several complaints about Xbox hardware failures, Santa demands that the four elves in charge of his console division report to his office. They arrive with their little elf hats in their hands. 

""Do you understand how important those consoles were to the children?"" asks Santa. ""Do you?"" He points to the first elf. ""What's the most important thing to you?"" 

""M-my magic hammer,"" says the first elf. ""It was handed down from my great-great-great grandfather. It's how I earn a living. It's irreplaceable."" 

""Bring it here. Let me look at it,"" says Santa. The elf runs off and returns with his hammer, polished in its little velvet case. 

Santa takes it out, turns it in his hands to admire the craftelfship, then snaps it over his knee. He throws the remains in the fire. ""Fuck you,"" he says. ""Get out of my sight."" The elf runs away in tears.

Santa turns to the second elf. ""What's the most important thing to you?""

The second elf shifts nervously. ""Y-your reindeer Rudolph. He saved me from an avalanche when I was a child and we've been best friends ever since.""

""That reminds me. Bring him here. I want to talk to him about a thing."" The elf runs off and returns with Rudolph.

Santa takes a pistol from his desk and shoots Rudoph right between the eyes. The reindeer slumps on the carpet. Santa kicks the poor dead beast in the gut and snaps off his antlers. He levels one velvety antler at the elf. ""Fuck you,"" he says. ""I liked Rudolph. Now get out of my sight."" The second elf runs off in tears.

Santa turns to the third elf. ""What's the most important thing to you? Answer me, now!""

The third elf is in tears already. ""M-my wife, sir. My wife. We've been together seven hundred years. I love her, sir.""

""Bring her here.""

""No!"" screams the elf.

""I just want to meet the lucky lass,"" says Santa. ""Now bring her here.""

The third elf slinks off and returns with a gorgeous rosy-cheeked specimen of female elfhood on his arm. 

Santa unbuckles his belt and drops his red breeches to reveal his fat human dong, huge and erect. Without a word the elf's wife climbs on his desk and excitedly and expertly fellates him. ""There's not an elf woman for five hundred miles that I don't fuck on the reg,"" says Santa. ""They love it. While you work I fuck all of your wives and daughters within an inch of their sanity. Did you really think your elf dick could satisfy her? Is that what she said?"" He finishes and festive spunk blasts from the corners of her ruby-lipped mouth. She milks him and greedily laps up the drops that fall. ""Uuuugh, that's the ticket! Now, fuck you! Get out of my sight!""

The third elf's mind is shattered. He is dragged away by Santa's guards while his wife cleans herself up.

Santa turns to the final elf. ""So. What's the most important thing to you?""
