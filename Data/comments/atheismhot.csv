IvyMike,I think this is one of the most important things we as a group can do to improve our image  The atheists I know in person are generous both with their time and their money but for whatever reason polls keep showing that atheists give less money to charities than Christians even when churchbased giving is excludedhttpswwwbarnaorgbarnaupdatearticlefaithspiritualityatheistsandagnosticstakeaimatchristiansUoVOfhopIThere are several possible explanations for this and we can argue about them and Im sure someone in the comments willBut in the end giving money to worthy charities is something I think we can do better at  Lets try to close the gap,6,cdeibe3,1qll1x,atheism,hot,31.0,25

KaiDaigoji,I know this wont be the most popular opinion here but here goesThe Bible isnt fictionI dont say that because Im some sort of fundamentalist Im an atheist or because I believe its true  I dont  I say it because literature is my thing and weve gotten sloppy with our termsNonfiction doesnt mean true and fiction doesnt mean false  Both of these are genres that entail a lot of assumptions of how the author intends for the audience to approach the piece of literature  For example in fiction the author knows that the audience will approach it as a narrative story designed for entertainment  This is completely different from a piece that is untrue but nonfictionFor example the ancient aliens stuff on history channel isnt presented as fiction  You could do basically the same show but mockumentary style and put it on Sci Fi network no I dont mean SyFy I mean go back in time to when that network was good and it would be fiction  But the presentation of the show now is nonfictional  At our most charitable we could say that its people discussing a certain interpretation of history  the show intends for people to take it seriously even if they arent convincedWhich leads me back to the Bible  Part of the problem with labeling the Bible fiction is that it implies that it is a single book with a single author  nothing could be further from the truth  The old testament is a collection of myths creation myths and founding myths histories books that were written as history at the time of their composition which means something very different that it does today poems and songs and books that purport to tell the stories of various prophetsThe New Testament is similar with new genres being the Gospels a genre based in biography as it was written in the ancient world letters Acts its own genre but there were several others like it that werent canonized and an Apocalypse again there are other non canonical onesThis is the most important thing  the Bible is a collection of books  Its an anthology of books sacred to two groups of people and while some of them may have been intended as something approaching fiction though that would still mean something different to us than it did at the time of writing its wrong to categorical call the Bible all fiction or all anythingThe Bible belongs in nonfiction my friends  Sorry,10,cdhw7hu,1qx9yn,atheism,hot,21.0,11

DumbAsPooDoo,As a person who has profited a bit from internet marketing this shit works as you can unfortunately see However I refuse to ever sink as low as using images of kids sick or healthy So a bit how this works for those who dont know Images that provoke a strong emotional response are posted with the requests for likes Things like sick children or messages of thanksgiving Many people click like to show support some click thinking  like   prayer Most of the religious macros you see shared on Facebook are not actually looking to spread religion but to get people to share the image If you go to the source of these images almost always the page that posts them will be filled with similar images and with links peppered in to an offsite The offsite will most likely be selling a product or service The hope is that through shares and likes awareness of the page will grow a huge amount some people will like the page and potential buyers are found Free advertising Affiliate links are also used If there arent any links or attempts to sell anything chances are that the page admin is attempting to first build an audience to either push a product later or sell the page to someone who wants to sell a product to an audience whose interests are knownI remember one image in particular that I saw my grandmother share It was an inspiring bible quote over a pretty image The image description asked people to like share and comment on what they were thankful for When I followed the link to the source there were plenty more images like this Every once in a while there was a link that said Are you ready to let Him help you with your finances and linked to a site selling an ebookmethod claiming to use Biblical advice to help you deal with money TLDR  essentially  of the images you see like this are people trying to profit in some way Theyre gaining an audience and are or will soon be trying to sell something They are aimed at suckers and generally dont believe in the cause they promote through the images,1,cdhyesb,1qylmp,atheism,hot,6.0,5

NukeThePope,This post correctly describes the psychological damage Christianity visits on countless children An excellent reason to resent the organizations that push this nonsenseBut while were bashing Id like to point out another form of damage and I dont feel qualified to judge so I wont which is the worseThis other damage is intellectual This may not be universally so but at least in the US it looks to me that clergy realize that the hairraising nonsense at the core of Christian doctrine can for the most part only be swallowed by people with broken faculties of reasoning and critical thinkingThe fundamental component the magic sauce of almost all religions is this there are facts to be known whose truth can and need not be established by reason and evidence Specifically revelation feelings in the heart are a respectable source and justification of true knowledgeThis single assertion once believed opens the floodgates to any and every kind of nonsensical assertion Aliens in UFOs are analprobing us  our souls live on when we die  black cats influence our fates with their movements some people have privileged nonworldly access to our dead relatives and knowledge of the futureand so on I think it was Voltaire who said if you can believe in a man walking on water you can believe anything As a result huge segments of the population in the US and elswhere of course are deliberately raised with broken truth meters Or stated more plainly for the benefit of religion the countrys youth is brought up to be a population of gullible idiotsEvery once in a while in rscience and elsewhere I run across articles describing some achievement that seems too good to be true a pharmacist mixing plastics in his kitchen developed a thermal plating that can resist thousands of degrees of heat an African girl has developed a cheap and simple process for extracting electricity from urine an American researcher now collaborating with NASA has developed a coldfusion reactor that produces energy from converting IIRC copper into tinWhen people like me point out some obvious objections to the possibility of these claims we get jumped by hordes of these gullible idiots who admonish us for being closeminded or who point out that applying scientific arguments to these claims isnt conclusive because science has been wrong beforeNow people can be poorly educated poorly informed and just plain wrong about things without the benefit of religion of course But I for one have a big problem with religions persistent efforts to keep people gullible so they can swallow the bullshit The intentionally cultivated widespread inability to tell truth from wishful thinking is holding all of humanity back Its like a residue of the Dark Ages still permeates society,8,cdi1pvp,1qzbeh,atheism,hot,36.0,28

Zermus,Im not sure why but I grew up catholic and I was always the kid in bible class that thought this stuff was fantasy  I rarely ever lost any sleep over it  In fact I honestly dont remember having nightmares past the age of  or  before I even understood all this and it was weird nightmares like a dump truck chasing me or something  Now my nightmares are always me taking on demons and shit Doom style or something I guess its because I grew up playing so many video games so now dreams are like Neo in The Matrix for me or something   Even when I was like  or  and began to reason all I can remember thinking is religion is a fantasy just like The Princess Bride or something  I know I didnt get this from my parents because one is catholic and the other is baptist  My uncle is even a baptist priest  One of my best friends and I were probably the bible teachers worst nightmare  Both his parents were devout catholic as well  We questioned EVERYTHING and asked how this was possible  We even threw in the alien angle any chance we got just to piss them all off  We figured if they believed in dragons and witchcraft and all that hocus pocus stuff back then what makes religion so different  My parents didnt keep me going much past first communion because I was an embarrassment and all of our friends parents hated us for bringing other kids toward hell  Regardless to say everyone who followed us ended up being some of the smartest people in school and everyone who thought we were satanist possessed heathens that we were ended up being the biggest losers in life  Funny how that worked out,1,cdijlgj,1qzbeh,atheism,hot,2.0,1

Kogledk,I think of it like this When we are alive we are part of the state of the Universe Our actions and words influences the people around us in small ways in a sense some part of us becomes a part of other people When we die the way we have affected other people is still there and will affect how those people affect the people around them I guess its like the butterfly effect  our existence sends a tiny ripple through timeYou could check out Dawkins on the subject I know its a bit of a cliche to post this but I think its an interesting view nonetheless LINKhttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvrpOEJlJbI,0,cdi47sk,1qznpv,atheism,hot,2.0,2
fierceredpanda,I certainly can relate Where animals are concerned I really wish I could buy into the whole Rainbow Bridge thing because I know that when my beloved cat passes away I will be an absolute mess The humananimal bond can be exceptionally strong and it doesnt seem fair that something so powerful can be terminated forever But its important to remember that the universe and life arent concerned with what seems fair  they just are what they are and false comfort is always false before it is comfortingBigger losses  thats hard Shortly after I finally decided to out myself as an atheist after a lot of selfdenial my wifes grandfather and my grandfather passed away both from strokes within three days of each other At both funerals and visitations I remember thinking and feeling a lot of things Ill list them here just for examples A degree of happiness Funerals are supposed to be celebrations of the deceaseds life In the case of grandparents look at the family they created Imperfect but a family nonetheless The idea that what we do while we live has no meaning after we die  thats total nonsense Even people with no families  look at all the people from entirely different backgrounds who are invariably brought together to say goodbye Take comfort from that There doesnt have to be any afterlife for our life right now to have meaning At the same time there is the sadness and awkward loneliness of sitting at a funeral listening to religious invocations and thinking about how empty it sounds Even in the case of someone who died after a long protracted illness hearing things like HeShe is in a better place now just sounds so hollow and degrading to this life the one that matters  And I think its difficult feeling like youre the only person at the gathering who isnt comforted by mentions of Heaven or salvation Certainly it would be a social faux pas to rain on everyones parade and say flat out This is all bullshit Instead a nonbeliever has to keep those feelings bottled up unless theres someone you know to be likeminded around In my case I waited until I got home from both funerals and sought out someone I knew would at least listen Ignoring grief doesnt make it go away Ever As a corollary to the last point Ill mention entirely without shame that I cried my eyes out at my grandfathers visitation The reason was simple I knew for a fact that despite what anyone else said I was and am never going to see him again That should make anyone sad Again I think its important not to lean on false consolation Remember the good times and know that a very real piece of the deceased still remains as long as you remember them  Ill add as a final note Humor even of the gallows variety can go a long long way to ease the feelings of loss Laughter really is the best medicine,1,cdi4a1i,1qznpv,atheism,hot,3.0,2
johnnyfiend,You want a physicist to speak at your funeral You want the physicist to talk to your grieving family about the conservation of energy so they will understand that your energy has not died You want the physicist to remind your sobbing mother about the first law of thermodynamics that no energy gets created in the universe and none is destroyed You want your mother to know that all your energy every vibration every Btu of heat every wave of every particle that was her beloved child remains with her in this world You want the physicist to tell your weeping father that amid energies of the cosmos you gave as good as you gotAnd at one point youd hope that the physicist would step down from the pulpit and walk to your brokenhearted spouse there in the pew and tell him that all the photons that ever bounced off your face all the particles whose paths were interrupted by your smile by the touch of your hair hundreds of trillions of particles have raced off like children their ways forever changed by you And as your widow rocks in the arms of a loving family may the physicist let her know that all the photons that bounced from you were gathered in the particle detectors that are her eyes that those photons created within her constellations of electromagnetically charged neurons whose energy will go on foreverAnd the physicist will remind the congregation of how much of all our energy is given off as heat There may be a few fanning themselves with their programs as he says it And he will tell them that the warmth that flowed through you in life is still here still part of all that we are even as we who mourn continue the heat of our own livesAnd youll want the physicist to explain to those who loved you that they need not have faith indeed they should not have faith Let them know that they can measure that scientists have measured precisely the conservation of energy and found it accurate verifiable and consistent across space and time You can hope your family will examine the evidence and satisfy themselves that the science is sound and that theyll be comforted to know your energys still around According to the law of the conservation of energy not a bit of you is gone youre just less orderly AmenAaron Freeman,1,cdi5dx4,1qznpv,atheism,hot,3.0,2

Dudesan,From the FAQhttpwwwredditcomratheismwikifaqwikishouldicomeouttomyparentsasbeinganatheistFShould I come out to my parents as being an atheistThe short answer is NoThe slightly longer answer is that if you are not in a position where that is likely to end well for you you should probably wait until youre more selfsufficient However you know your own parents better than we do You could try breaking the ice on the subject of atheism to get a feel for their reaction to it in general if youre not sure Always keep in mind that for many people religion is a highly emotive subject and for many parents who have been raised to believe in the moral superiority of religious belief a child who comes out as an atheist can be interpreted as a betrayal of them or as a failure of their ownIn some religions it can actually be dangerous to out yourself If your father is a hardline Muslim for example getting kicked out of the house is the least of your worries You risk being beheaded or set on fire If youre coming from one of those keep that in mind as wellratheism will almost invariably respond that you should wait A common proverb here is The best place to come out to your parents is at a home you own over a dinner that you paid for yourself,8,cdidvme,1r0pf7,atheism,hot,76.0,68

DetailedVenom,Bit late to the party here but Ill add my  centsWhen I was growing up I was raised Jewish no one in my family is Jewish except my paternal grandfather and since we were from Russia we wouldnt have been allowed to practice anyway My mother always wanted me to be raised a Jew probably for my grandfathers sakeFrom day  I didnt believe any of it I fell asleep in temple I never paid attention in Hebrew school and I was yelled at twice by our Rabbi for being disruptive When I turned  I had my Bar Mitzvah I memorized the whole verse I had to read since I couldnt actually read Hebrew because of the not paying attention After that was  more years of going to temple dressed in the shawl and Kippah that my parents paid a lot of money forAt  I told my mother I wasnt going to temple anymore and at  I told her I didnt believe in god I dont think she believes me but she isnt a hardcore religious nut she just wanted to appease her dad and it didPoint of the story I am happy that I went through that Not for any cynical reason but it is because of the kind of understanding you can only get from experiencing something At  I scoffed at religion and thought I understood all it had to offer Looking back now at  I realize how dumb I wasYou need to understand something very important you are a young fool All humans are stupid on some level but most arent aware of their own stupidity Everyone does what they think is right but very few people allow for the possibility that they are wrong While I agree with your assessment of Christianity I dont think you are old enough to really understand the implications of religion and what it could mean to your life Its going to suck doing things you dont believe in but you may gain something out of it in the endI have no idea if that helped but I hope it did Its all Ive got,1,cdiko9s,1r0pf7,atheism,hot,2.0,1

xiipaoc,Im going to disagree with everyone and say that nobody here but you can make this decisionLets start with some social issues  Do your parents accept gay marriage  Do they believe  in the catechism of the Catholic Church I saw in another comment that your family is Catholic  How do they feel about women being priests  Find out where they stand on a variety of social issues  It may be that they care about the Church  its their home congregation after all  but dont actually agree with much of its doctrine  You can tell them that youre having theological difficulties if you think there wont be much risk  Again it depends on how obsessed with believing in religion they are and note that religion isnt the same as belief  For example Im Jewish  I know a lot more about Judaism than my parents and I go to synagogue sometimes too which my parents dont do at all not even on the High Holidays  My parents think I go overboard with it even though I dont actually observe dietary or Shabbat restrictions or anything like that I just say prayers and sing songs and have meals  I wasnt actually atheist when I was   though I was never actually observant  but if I had been I think my parents would have wanted me to have a barmitzvah anyway  For us Judaism is a family tradition and we may not observe it very strongly but we observe it at least a little bit  We never believed in the literal truth of the Bible for instance  So when I casually mentioned to my parents that Im atheist  late in my s  the thing that surprised me the most was that they didnt already know  I thought Id mentioned it years earlier  I guess it had just never come up in conversation before and I didnt realize itAnyway that long story was to bring up the point that your parents may not actually care that youre atheist but they might care about you being a Catholic even if you dont believe their shit because your parents might not believe their shit either  I dont know your parents  You do  So make the right choice here,0,cdioc5d,1r0pf7,atheism,hot,1.0,1

disharmonia,I know theres going to be a storm about this so Im going to just jump in right hereI work at an abortion clinic  I am a health educator that goes over medical history with the patients and then explains their aftercare instructions and what they can expect  Since Im the person they get to sit down with and talk to Im usually the one that goes through their situation with them and sort of counsels themWe go up to  weeks and  days  We used to be able to go up to  weeks until the state capped us at   An injuction has allowed us to continue to go up to  weeks and  days at least for the time beingAbortions after twenty weeks are very very important  If you live in a state where abortions are capped please please try to help with advocates trying to overturn those lawsWhile amniocentesis can be performed at  weeks the results are iffy at best with some fetal anomalies not being able to be detected until the th week at the earliest  Most amnios happen around  weeks and the results can take up to  days to come backThis means that most women will have no idea if their infant has a fetal anomaly until after  weeks  This isnt just some FAs are detected after  weeks  I mean that the vast majority areIn my time at the clinic I have seen exactly one first tri FA patient  Meanwhile I regularly see four to five each week in their second trimester  They almost universally over  weeksYou also have to take into account that women dont instantly know if they want to continue with an FA pregnancy  There are a lot of anomalies that leave no choiceno brain no kidneys etc but there are ones like Downs that means the parents often have to sit down together and decide whether or not theyre capable of caring for a special needs childFor parents whove spent months bonding with their unborn infant this can be an absolutely wrenching decision  It can take weeks  And yet most of them have to told that they have only a few days to make up their mind  after that theyre SOLMost of the clients I see over  weeks are FA clients but there are also a reasonable amount of nonFA clients  Most of those remaining ones are minorsBecause teenagers dont have regular periods and because theyre teenagers it takes awhile for them to become aware that theyre pregnant  Then theres the fact that the vast majority are extremely unwilling to inform their parents  As our state requires the parent to be present unless the minor has a judicial bypass theres nothing we can do for them until they inform their parentsOften times this means weeks can pass before actions that need to be taken are taken  Most of my under clients are second trimesterIve also booked appointments for women who reach  weeks without being aware that theyre pregnant  This is more common than youd expect  its very possible to have a consistent period while pregnant  I know people boggle at the idea of a show about people who didnt know they were pregnant until they gave birth but stop to think about that for a moment  that happens often enough that they could make a show about itAnd no those people arent just idiots or rednecks  Ive seen women at  weeks that are skinnier than I am  Pregnancy is not just one predictable condition  It can be different for every woman and let me tell you it can be weird  Theres a reason we have an entire medical field devoted to itFor those who still dont get the importance of second trimester abortions we had a few women testify before the state house when the law limiting us to  weeks was being debated  They were women whod had Potters Syndrome babies wherein the kidneys do not form  This means that the baby can live so long as its inside the mother using her as a dialysis machine but once its born itll live for  days then die  There is no current cure or treatmentThis basically means that if a mother cant get an abortion she is forced to carry her child with a death sentence on its head to term  I still remember one woman talking about how shed go to the store and people asking her what names she was picking out and shed think to herself They think Im planning a nursery when all Im planning is a funeralDue to these testimonies House Democrats proposed an amendment saying that fatal problems with the fetus would be exempt  House Republicans being the majority voted down the amendmentThankfully the injunction is allowing us to still see women whore under  weeks but things are far from settledSecond trimester abortions are extremely important  dont underestimate that,2,cdj37cf,1r28r6,atheism,hot,41.0,39

HermesTheMessenger,I read it years ago Repost responding to questions about CS Lewis apologetic writingsHeres my take on it I focus on the ideas of the person I am talking with   Even when someone borrows an idea from someone else they arent that other person  They are giving their own interpretation of that other persons ideas   Since it always comes back to what the person I am talking to thinks why dont they skip bringing in some third party and use their own ideas  ones that they understand and are able to discuss passionately and intelligently  Note This is why I hate plagiarists  Not only are they promoting someone elses work as their own stealing andor lying but they often dont really have a very good grasp of what the other person actually meant  This frequently leads to awkward questions that the thief cant give an informed response to  yet they often dont realize that they arent giving an informed response In the case of Lewis If his ideas were still of primary interest to Christians they would use them in their own arguments Back to the top There is no reason to focus on Lewis when theres a living person to talk to who has their own ideas  Lewis is unavailable,3,cdiv61e,1r2e8g,atheism,hot,4.0,1

wataru,Disclaimer You is a general you not the OP or anyone in particularI would wager that this letter was submitted to the paper as a joke Granted there are some pretty out there and clueless people in the world but that seems to me to be a bit too much But regardless of thatI am getting kinda sick of the whole being gay is a choicebeing gay is biological argument Whatever homosexuality stems from is not important At all As for myself I am gay Whether I choose to be this way or whether I was born this way has no bearing on anyone other than me So what if homosexuality is a choice Whats it to you The choice of where I stick my dick only matters to me and to the person into which I choose to consentually stick my dick Its not something that needs to be academically debated Its not something that other people need to agonize over or even discuss at all because it is none of their concern Other people dont get to have an opinion on this matter Whatever your personal moral beliefs are you have no right to subject me to them So let people say homosexuality is a choice Its a choice that I am allowed to make that doesnt affect you at all so you have no right to tell me I cant make it If I choose to paint the walls of my living room green if I choose to have Subway instead of Wendys for lunch or whether I choose to be gay or straight has no bearing on anyones life but mine Just because you have cultural bullshit to deal with doesnt mean you get to rain on my parade Personally I dont believe homosexuality is a choice When I look at a hot dude and I get a boner its because of a chemical reaction in my brain triggering sexual arousal Choice has nothing to do with it But neither does anyone elses opinion  In a manner of speaking I do choose to be gay I choose to ogle and stare when I see a hot guy on the street I dont care if it makes him uncomfortable Straight guys do it to women all the time Its a fucking compliment get over it I wish someone would do it to me I choose to gush over the most recent episodes of Project Runway and I watch Supernatural in the hopes that Dean and Castiel will finally lay the liplock on each other If I had a husband I would plaster my desk with pictures of us holding hands at Disney and kissing on the beach like every straight couple in the world does And you know what None of that requires anyone elses understanding or approvalA friend of mine who is a biology teacher said to me once that homosexuality is an aberration in the brain chemistry But it is a benign aberration It has no bearing on the survivability of the individual organism and if a small portion  like I dont know  or so  of the population especially in a species like humans that has no widespread breeding issues whatsoever has it it doesnt negatively affect the survivability of the species either So religious busybodies should mind their own fucking businessWhy would anyone choose to be gay Fuck that If it was up to me I would choose to be gay I love it and I dont give two shits if anyone doesnt like itTLDR  So what if homosexuality is a choice I choose it It doesnt affect you in any way Fuck off,3,cdj2soa,1r2kbx,atheism,hot,15.0,12

Brochachoski,I dont understand the whole argument about whether you are born gay or you can choose whether you want to be gay Im not trying to argue any points here but why does it matter if a heterosexual guy one day finds himself attracted to another man like Josh Hutcherson said in an interview one time Some people get so fired up about this and I really dont understand why it really matters So if any of you would like to try and explain why it matters if someone is born gay or not please do because Im curious,0,cdj3t7b,1r2kbx,atheism,hot,12.0,12
tamist,This is a totally awesome response and super funny but for the record I dont think whether or not being gay is a choice should have anything to do with this debate Obviously its not a choice but even if it WERE why does that make it bad Theres plenty of other choices we make and we determine whether they are good or bad based on the effects and merits of them You know what IS a choice Religion Lets look at the merits of religion vs homosexual love LOL ,1,cdj717e,1r2kbx,atheism,hot,5.0,4

CanAmChris,Hey Boondock welcome to the reboot It took me almost  years until I realized that a huge part of how I looked at things was because I was born in South Eastern Pennsylvania and was sent to catholic school as a childWhen I realized that religion is based on geography I had the same oh shit moment that you might have hadI always thought and was taught that having empathy was reserved for the religious who had a moral standardWhen I lifted the blinders I saw that the Moral Standard was dictated by the guy who stands in front of everyone on Sundays telling them how to live and think and what is right and wrongThat is when I called bullshit on it allLife is very simple now for meI do what is right Its a simple concept that religion tries to manipulate to its own ends gtI no longer judge people I am open to other peoples lifestyles and I try to help people as much as humanly possible I have opened my mind to new experiences and knowledge that my family had taught me were wrongThis is key There is no such think as wrong knowledge as long as your source is reliable and accurateIn your search for knowledge please equate it to truth and fact and evidenceIf at any point you read or hear something that makes you question its truth or has no facts for support or lacks evidence then you are well to dismiss it It is your obligation to dismiss any idea that can not meet a burden of proofAs I said Welcome to the reboot We are all born Atheists and your journey is just beginning,0,cdjdm6e,1r2m5m,atheism,hot,1.0,1

ahf,gtI need an atheistic perspective about if God is loving and graceful then why does he let bad things happen within the worldI have no idea  I am unconvinced that any deities exist  Before I can give you a better answer can you provide me with a clear definition of which of the thousands of deities mankind has worshipped that were discussing  Also what evidence convinces you personally that this deity exists,0,cdixjuu,1r2msx,atheism,hot,4.0,4
Drakeytown,Really not clear on what your question is or whether you understand all of the terms youre using  Im an atheist  I dont worry about what God is like any more than I worry about what Zeus or Thor are likeI actually spend more time on the latter as theyre more interesting  God doesnt let things happen or make things happen because you cant let or make things happen without existing  I am a former Christian  Riddles like this took up way too much of my time before I realized what a waste it all is,0,cdixny4,1r2msx,atheism,hot,3.0,3
BuccaneerRex,The atheist perspective rejects everything about your statementgtif God is loving and graceful then why does he let bad things happen within the world If god is loving and graceful  Atheists do not accept the existence of a deity loving and graceful or not why does he let bad things happen within the world  No god no let Bad things and good things are merely the perception of humansAtheists dont have a problem explaining the existence of evil in the world First theres no such thing as evil only the interpretation of action by humans It requires human perception to give context to an action,0,cdixo6k,1r2msx,atheism,hot,3.0,3
Santaonastick,I am unconvinced that any god exists therefore I dont think any god lets anything happen Moreover I cannot ascribe the attributes loving and graceful to a think I do not believe exists Having said that based on the holy books of some of the more prominent religionsbranches Christianity and its subtypes Islam Mormonism etc the god described there is anything but loving and graceful ,0,cdixwx4,1r2msx,atheism,hot,3.0,3
sciencediction,Define GodWhen you do that I will be more than happy to give you my personal perspective on itAs for an atheist perspective there are only two agnostic atheism there is no evidence to support claims of a god gnostic atheism evidence definitively proves a god cannot exist in reality due to either philosophy or scienceIf God is so loving and graceful etc then why does he let bad things happen within the worldThe terms evil and good are entirely subjective One mans good is another mans evil and vice versa Principles have to be based on something more tangible than a label to be effective Furthermore if the Christian god is without time immortal I dont really see how good and evil have any meaning whatsoever when t is removed from the equation Nor do I see why an immortal being would even care about something as trivial as human existence  or I should say seemingly trivial from that perspectiveI am a Christian Im up for friendly debates If anybody disagrees with me or anyone do so respectfullyI am an atheist I am up for discussion I am more interested in how people think rather than what they think I have never had a debate with a Christian because a debate implies both sides accept the possibility they can be wrong Religious people have faith Faith has this nasty habit of always being correct,0,cdizxpx,1r2msx,atheism,hot,3.0,3

BuccaneerRex,I always considered Pat Tillman to be an idiot Im not denigrating his death or his service but I dont think leaving a promising NFL career to go and play murderball in a sandbox with a bunch of goatfarming former allies who werent even the ones who attacked us on  was the most intelligent thing he could have doneEmotions ran high then and still do so its not entirely unexpected I just dont consider it a patriotic sacrifice Especially when you consider that he probably got fragged by his own guys for being an atheist,3,cdj0jld,1r2wan,atheism,hot,12.0,9
sciencediction,I think hes less considered a hero of atheism and more a go to reference for when religious people try to rewrite someones existence for their own purposesI however consider him a good man and a great example A hero thoughI think thats disengenuous to what happened He was killed by friendly fire in a clusterfuck of military mistakesId consider him more of a martyr A martyr to what exactly I am not sure,0,cdj0hy5,1r2wan,atheism,hot,8.0,8

BuccaneerRex,Presumably any deity worth the title will know what evidence would convince me even if I dont know it myself If my being convinced is a desirable state for the deity then it will provide the evidence for its own existenceAs I remain unconvinced it therefore follows that either the deity does not want me to be convinced or does not exist,1,cdj21pc,1r313f,atheism,hot,12.0,11
ahf,There is no evidence to suggest that any deities exist  Were I presented with valid evidence I would of course change my mindWhat form would that evidence take  I have no idea  Heres what I do knowAccording to many religious traditions a deity exists that created me and possesses omniscience as well as omnipotenceIf a deity exists it knows that I am a skeptic and I would argue that it created me to be skeptical  Further it knows already exactly what evidence would convince me  Since it is omnipotent it is obviously capable of providing me with evidenceMany religions claim that God loves us and wants a relationship with us  If this claim is true then this deity would already have provided me with the evidence I need to believe in it  especially if my eternal salvation depends on itIf religions claims were true I would already be a believer it seemsSince Im not a believer I can only conclude that if any deities exist they dont seem to care whether or not I believe in their existence,1,cdj20wu,1r313f,atheism,hot,7.0,6

yaxriifgyn,I dont have a problem with accepting scientifically valid evidence Any such evidence would and could only lead to some new science or the refinement of existing scienceI have no suspicion at all that any such evidence will arise to prove any of the multitude of bizarre claims from various religion They are an artifact of a more primitive society and must be left behind as we mature as a society,0,cdj26no,1r313f,atheism,hot,1.0,1

Feinberg,Well evolution is only a challenge to religion if you view the Genesis account of creation as a literal description of what happened and a lot of people dont believe its a literal account today That means everything works together and everyones happy except for the youngearth creationists and a lot of Muslims but for the most part its okay Calling Genesis allegory solves a lot of problems Unfortunately theres no clear evidence in the Bible that Genesis is meant to be allegory and in fact theres some evidence that many key biblical figures including Jesus and the Apostles understood the Genesis account of creation to be the literal truth That creates a somewhat sticky problem where youre essentially claiming to understand the Bible better than some of the original authors and maybe even God Himself,0,cdj6d1q,1r3erq,atheism,hot,5.0,5
ninterd,gt Creationists and atheists both too often mistake it for a challenge to the existence of GodWhen we say this we specifically talk about the Gods of the religions with a different creation storygtThe reason I take it to be a nonissue is because while it explains a great deal about the origin of life on earth it does little to explain the more elementary questions of universal originsIts not supposed to explain anything else And its not even about the origin of life but the changes over timegtIf the universe can be shown to be infinite and eternal in the past there would be no need to posit the existence of God the universe would be selfsufficientSaying God is necessary for a finite universe is just an assumption Evidence pleasegtHowever if you take the Big Bang theory as being scientifically true as most cosmologists do then you have a valid sufficient and nearly necessary reason to posit the existence of something at the very least like GodNo not at all Maybe I dont understand where youre getting at but the Big Bang theory does not imply a God at all And the theory doesnt make an illogical belief like God justifiedgt If something like the universe and thereby space and time have a beginning then it is finiteWell maybe I dont see this as a problem though But I am not sure whether this is necessarily the case ask a scientistgtWhat is finite is contingent and what is contingent requires something beyond itself upon which it might existHere we go again with just illogical assumptions Maybe Ive misunderstood the definition of contingent because English isnt my first language but wouldnt a contingent universe disprove a personal creatorgt The only thing beyond the finite is the infinite so if the universe is finite it requires something infinite as its causeAgain youre just assuminggtBy inductive reasoning you can assess what sorts of characteristics this cause would have by logical necessity And some folks like myself find that the logical description of that cause is very similar to the traditional characteristics attributed to God ie changelessness timelessness immateriality infinity etcBy illogical reasoning you can assume that because you cant accept something we dont fully understand a god must have done it But you completely ignore the problems the God question itself creates How could a God possibly exist Why would God do this Why would you assume that God exists Why does the universe need a specific creator while God doesnt How can you justify belief in something infinite which we have no concept of at all its impossible to understand completely You cant possibly understand it and therefor is illogical to believe in,2,cdj6d5d,1r3erq,atheism,hot,5.0,3
Dargo,the reason that evolution is an issue is because it contradicts the bible and if one part of the book is wrong then it calls into question the rest of the book as well gtBig Bang theory as being scientifically true as most cosmologists dono they do not The big bang is currently the model that fits best and is far from being proven that being said your finite  infinite argument is no longer valid as you have no evidence for either Do you have evidence that something needs something to cause it If so what caused god to exist Hes eternal I hear you say then youve just negated your own argument that something did occur without a cause ,0,cdj6h45,1r3erq,atheism,hot,4.0,4
Feinberg,gtHowever if you take the Big Bang theory as being scientifically true as most cosmologists do then you have a valid sufficient and nearly necessary reason to posit the existence of something at the very least like GodWell you dont really You have a reason to think that the universe expanded out from a point but theres not really much to fuel speculation about events before the Big Bang We just plain dont know what happened before the Big Bang Positing a deity is unnecessarygtIf something like the universe and thereby space and time have a beginning then it is finiteWe dont actually know that they had a beginning though and even if they did we dont know that something existed before that beginning gtWhat is finite is contingent and what is contingent requires something beyond itself upon which it might existEverything which has been observed to have a beginning has a cause but the origin of the universe is a unique event and a unique class of events We dont know enough about universe origins to say that the things which apply to toasters and stars apply to the universe Also again we dont know that the universe if finite All we know is that observable matter appears to be moving away from a single point Another problem with this line of thinking is that one part of it the necessity for things to have a creator or cause rests squarely on what we know to be true of mundane objects through mundane observation The other part the deity requires the introduction of an entity with an abundance of supernatural properties which we have no basis to expect are possible There is no precedent to support the idea that something can be infinite or exist outside time and space for instance Frankly if we had reason to expect that these things were possible it would make more sense to apply them to the universe itself than a deityIf everything needs a creator then God would need a creator as well and that creator would need a creator ad infinitum If its possible for something to exist infinitely without a creator then Occams Razor would necessitate disproving an infinite universe before positing a creator for the universeFinally even if it somehow made sense to assert that the universe was caused to exist there is absolutely no reasonable bridge between that assertion and any specific personal intelligent deity ,0,cdj75hd,1r3erq,atheism,hot,5.0,5
taterbizkit,gt  By inductive reasoning you can assess what sorts of characteristics this cause would have by logical necessityThis sentence is confusing  Logical necessity is the language of deduction not inductionLets narrow down what universe means  We live in a spacetime continuum that may or may not be the entirety of all existence  Or it could exist within some other framework context structure or whatever  Which one is the universe For the sake of discussion Im using universe to mean everything that exists in its entirety  This is the only context in which this discussion is meaningful since what good does it do to say that our spacetime contiuum had a creator but not ask whether or not the creator exists within some finite context of its own  This also eliminates advanced alien beings from consideration since they too would live within a finite context It also eliminates matrixlike universes since the software would have to run on some hardware that itself existed in a nonsimulated finite contextSo were down at the roots here  The absolute origin of all originsAs you say it may be possible to intuit certain characteristics that it ought to have  Infinity sounds reasonable just based on your initial argument  Im not sure changeless counts because our comingintoexistence would be a change  Immateriality  this word loses its meaning once youre outside of our spacetime  So does time  Im not comfortable with timelessness for this reason  Its undefinedSo weve got infinity left still  Infinite seems to still be meaningful I guess assuming even that finite isnt a contextsensitive term that only has meaning to us as conscious beings  So maybe whateveritis is infiniteThats a lot of mental effort for not much result  How much does So its infinite I guess sound like a godOn the other hand if whateveritis is warped back on itself in  dimensions like a sphere in  or a ring in  then it can totally be finite and give rise to other finite things without itself having an origin in the infinite  It doesnt even need to be timeless if its warped back on itself in the time dimension  It could just be cyclical and entirely uncausedYeah I dont think we can draw any conclusions about it at all to be honest  I dont think induction or even deduction is going to get you anywhere if youre trying to do this in your head with a scientific laypersons understanding of cosmology  No a priori conclusion is going to be compellingAs always this question boils down to only one reasonable answerWe dont knowThere is no reason other than an appeal to ignorance to suppose that I dont know means so it must be god,0,cdj6r2n,1r3erq,atheism,hot,3.0,3
MrSenorSan,I have to take this further  Even if we prove all our science as wrong or incorrect it only means we have more to learn  It does not prove a god exists   The only reason to posit the existence of god is for this god to make itself evident aside from that there is no reason at all to even begin thinking about a god   Further more even if we agree with your argument this is only an argument for a deist god at best   However many theists use this type of argument of something must have been the prime mover but in their minds they have already made up their minds that that something just happens to be their particular god when in fact they have not provided any evidence at all to prove their particular god is that something,1,cdj743n,1r3erq,atheism,hot,4.0,3

Zed,Im not disagreeing with the main point of the image however I do think the cultural religions amp by that I mean indigenous or traditional were fluid in that they had no common literal text For instance the Germanic beliefs were around long long before the Prose Eddas were ever written amp the same case with the Vedas well at least for Vedism not Hinduism not even mentioning the fact the Germanic amp Vedic were at one point the same ie ProtoIndo European If you strip back the literal interpretations of any deities amp yes I know thats not the images point you can at least see some kind of base in the cultures environment amp people But Im done rambling now,0,cdnava6,1r3rpe,atheism,hot,1.0,1

NuclearShadow,The answer changes greatly  with the type of Christian you are talking to  For example  it seems to be a growing opinion in Christianity that hell isnt a punishment of eternal torture but a simple realm that is completely absent of god    So this type of Christian would simply answer there is no punishment simply choicesSo sadly there obviously isnt a single answer to the question     Some Christians have no problem with the mob boss god  offering protection  or else Some see it as the deities right to act in anyway it wishes  and even if it acts within a manner that it speaks against it is automatically just for god to do so   I once debated a baptist pastor whom simply replied with The ten commandments do not apply to god  meaning no rules apply to god not even his ownMy best advice to you if you is to actually go ask the Christians of the denominations try to ask those that actually have a position within the church  rather than the average believer because they tend to know little of their own faith   ,0,cdji99s,1r4i49,atheism,hot,2.0,2

freekyfrogy,I was a creationist all of my life up until about a year ago Im  It wasnt so much that I bought into the creationist apologists logic but rather that I had it constantly drilled into my head that evolution was false during my childhood and teen years I didnt pay any attention to people like Ken ham or Kent Hovind growing up because I had no need to It wasnt until I actually started looking into evolution from a nonbiassed perspective that I started to look more closely at the arguments against evolution from a Christian perspective  Ironically the fact that the apologists arguments couldnt hold water against the scientific evidence for evolution is one of the main things that led me to look further into Christianity as a whole and realize was based on a weak Foundation made of assumptions and a startling lack of supporting evidence It was people like Ken Ham and Kent Hovind who played a key role in my deconversion,4,cdjpd6p,1r529l,atheism,hot,40.0,36

mindshift,Great question OPMy journey out of the faith was due largely to that one topic I wanted to believe in Gods creation as given but couldnt really make sense of it all I began to study the different explanations for the Genesis story and eventually discovered Sacred Geometry There are a handful of videos that show how the seven days of creation correspond to Metatrons Cube and the Seed of Life And then after I discovered how much of the OT was taken directly from the Egyptian Book of the Dead it was an easy decision to make I have since tried to inform otherswith at best mixed results Any other methods yawl can share in order to be more successful,1,cdjnke6,1r529l,atheism,hot,15.0,14

Crimzenator,Nope I thought it had to be right because my view of evolution was the cherry picked version my parentschurch fed to me Once I took a science class and really understood it the process really began I would always rationalize it as well of course creationism makes sense wed burn up if we were any closer to the sun Or but it has to be true theres not enough evidence to prove evolution its just a theory Or the bible seems to make sense in all other aspects that makes up for the unanswered questions I just need to trust godReally it was that I WANTED creationism to be true so Id fit in facts to try and  justify it,0,cdjymkx,1r529l,atheism,hot,2.0,2
PromSTar,Indoctrination is a hell of a thing  I was the kid who read the encyclopedia for fun  I loved science especially dinosaurs and there was always a disconnect there but still I managed it the first twenty years of my life  I didnt realize how logically flawed my views were  I had never studied logic and had little basis to evaluate my creationism  When I did later study the subject it was clear very quickly how skewed my views were  It was never the case that the arguments for creationism convinced me it was true  I wanted it to be true and I then found arguments afterward  They served as vindication not evidence for a conclusion,0,cdjzlu9,1r529l,atheism,hot,2.0,2

AutumnBeckons,Sometimes the person the arguments are told to is not knowledgeable enough to determine their validity This happened to myself when I was a teenager I believed a lot of creationist arguments because I simply did not know enough about things to determine whether they were actually good arguments But during and after highschool when I started to look stuff up on my own I noticed arguments for creationism and theism in general were simply intellectually dishonest most of the time or just simply not proof of anything really like the first cause argument It took a long while for that understanding of dishonest argumentation to turn into atheism and that was because I am a very rational and scientific person I imagine if I was more emotional andor dependent on other peoples opinions it would have turned into a defensive mindset about the whole issue andor a vilifying of the scientific method itself,0,cdjyenh,1r529l,atheism,hot,1.0,1
Uncanevale,I like this one better from HL MenckenThe way to deal with superstition is not to be polite to it but to tackle it with all arms and so rout it cripple it and make it forever infamous and ridiculous Is it perchance cherished by persons who should know better Then their folly should be brought out into the light of day and exhibited there in all its hideousness until they flee from it hiding their heads in shameTrue enough even a superstitious man has certain inalienable rights He has a right to harbor and indulge his imbecilities as long as he pleases provided only he does not try to inflict them upon other men by force He has a right to argue for them as eloquently as he can in season and out of season He has a right to teach them to his children But certainly he has no right to be protected against the free criticism of those who do not hold them He has no right to demand that they be treated as sacred He has no right to preach them without challenge,3,cdjnh22,1r52ss,atheism,hot,15.0,12

Arkonitez,I believe the only really credible thing you will find in research is that there are many historians who believe that the figure of Jesus in the New Testament was likely somehow based on a real figure who existed at some point As in this guy existed who talked to people about reforming religion in the general timeframe like  BCE   CE or so Obviously everyone disagrees when it comes to how accurately the bible portrays him Its probably true that there was a guy who existed Obviously SOMEONE had to start the religion After that well we all know how legends and myths get pumped up,1,cdjni4d,1r531l,atheism,hot,4.0,3
picado,Historical Jesus works just like magic Jesus as an imaginary friend  Its the same circular process imagine him as some archetype such as moral exemplar then construct him based on what you think a moral exemplar would be which means projecting your own morality onto him backdated Then marvel at how  wise Jesus was which of course he agrees with you As a result hes just as much a fantasy alterego of the believer as the divine one and he serves the same role Youve constructed him as this guy without realizing youre doing that and now  you think that what you believe is endorsed by Jesus Which proves you right,2,cdjnqbc,1r531l,atheism,hot,6.0,4

datcrazybok,I am torn on this one because the Jews had prophecy which indicated that the Messiah was coming there were many individuals who made the claim that they were this Messiah of prophecy Many many individuals actually All evidence Ive read seems to indicate that several decades after the fact people confirm Jesus existed However given the decades lapse in the time which Jesus exists and the historical claims of Jesus you can assume that AT THE VERY LEAST some of the facts regarding Jesus were muddled In fact I theorize that those who described Jesus later on were simply confirming that many individuals had made the claim to fulfill Jewish prophecy and that a few decades ago another one happened However I have also read that people were executed as often as monthly for the same crime that Jesus was supposedly executed for So basically although historical scholars generally accept the fact that Jesus existed when I look at their evidence I cant help but feel that it describes an individual who claimed to fulfill Jewish prophecy rather than this specific individual since none of the mentions really gives specific evidence that claims made in the New Testament actually happened Im with you though Whether or not a man caused a major revolution in Judaism about  years ago offers no insight into whether or not the historical Jesus existed and certainly no insight into whether or not he was divine In that sense to me it really doesnt matter at all There were plenty of people who claimed to be the one to fulfill prophecy  ,0,cdjnkgu,1r531l,atheism,hot,1.0,1

derklempner,I think it can be summed up thusly if Jesus existed as a historical figure then why are all the writings about him from no earlier than about  years after his supposed deathIt is more likely that there may have been a movement started during the time he was supposedly alive and the New Testament may contain an amalgamation of sorts of traits from various religious leaders during that time But if there was just one man that served as the basis for Jesus then why are there no records of him that survived the ages to be verified in the almost years since,0,cdjz5gz,1r531l,atheism,hot,1.0,1
mavnorman,The best argument in my opinion is kinda similar to the argument that leads to the conclusion about dark matter or dark energy Its the argument to the best explanationWhat needs to be explained is why Christianity exists and why the sources are the way they are To explain the evidence you can assume that a real guy existed whose story got embellished over time or you can assume it was a fictional character that was later turned into the description of a real guy which then was embellishedHistorians think the real guy hypothesis is the better explanationThere is also a kind of external corroboration in that one can look at other similar cases in history If for instance its rather typical for a religion to be started by a charismatic founder this corroborates the hypothesis that Christianity was probably started by a real person And typically religions are often started by foundersThis is the very short version of the argument,0,cdk2pau,1r531l,atheism,hot,1.0,1

michael,httpenwikipediaorgwikiSourcesfortheHistoricityofJesus Here are the sources you asked forSomething else interesting to consider the early Christian church dealt with persecution from the Roman state and the Jewish synagogue Both groups were vigorously trying to stop the spread of Christianity because it was a threat to their establishment The easiest way these groups could have killed the new religion from the start is if Jesus had never existed there would be no argument and Christianity would not have even gotten off the ground No one was skeptical that Jesus was a historical figure until about  years after the fact because proposing it sooner would have been absurd in light of the eyewitness evidence In addition the early church leaders did not have the freedom to invent facts about Christianity because of the harsh criticism it was already receiving at the time any lies they could have been caught spreading would have ended the movement The idea that rumors about said Jesus particularly resurrection from the dead would have been accepted so easily if there were not substantial evidence is also hard to  account for if there were not strong evidence supporting it Historians agree that the letters of Paul were written  years after Jesuss death So when he writes in  Corinthians For what I received I passed on to you of first importance that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures that he was buried that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures and that he appeared to Peter and then to the Twelve After that he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time most of whom are living though some have diedThis proves not only that the claims of Jesuss powers were not added years later in the form of legend but also is strong evidence that Paul along with the other church founders had eye witnesses to testify for the events they were writing about which was needed to get anyone at the time to take them seriously In addition ancient cultures clearly distinguished between fictional stories and historical accounts when they were talking about them and historical accounts were not allowed to be changedMost of the information I have given here is from the book The Reason for God in an age of skepticism by Tim Keller Its a good read if youre interested in the subject,0,cdkazkc,1r531l,atheism,hot,1.0,1
Hambone,To my knowledge there is none Not so much as a stray mention He doesnt appear in any of the Roman writings from the period and they were definitely the dominant source of literate scholars in the area Had Pontius Pilate attended a trial in which he felt forced by local populist pressure to give a verdict contrary to his own feelings on the matter then that would definitely have been recorded but if it was then no such record has survived There was certainly no census around about the year  during the reign of King Herod and if theres one thing the Romans kept a LOT of paperwork on its censi and tax informationThe first mention of JC that Im aware of is an account of this new immigrant Jewish sect who are causing quite a stir in Rome and that was in about CE  some fifty years after the supposed events of the GospelIm no expert on the subject but Ive looked into this myself out of interest and considering how influential Jesus supposedly was he appears to be remarkably absent from travel journals letters and administrative records I suspect that Yeshua of Nazareth may well have existed and might well have been a charismatic rabbi or cult leader But that the tales of his exploits and what happened to him seem to be basically a complete fabrication a legend Much the same process as has happened with Kim IlSung and Kim JongIl in North Korea Scoring fifteen holes in one on your first game of Golf is just as much of a miracle as walking on water and feeding several thousand with a single loaf and some fish Its just a more modern miracle,1,cdjnl8z,1r531l,atheism,hot,1.0,0

Brokenshatner,Its terrible that this happened to your family But this happens constantly and it drives me crazy I have had so many students find themselves kicked out of the homes of their parents always from the parents inability to cope with the changing nature of the parentchild dynamic in the house Whatever the trigger  sex drugs fundamental religious differences  being kicked out always forces children to rely more on their other social resources which the parents should rationally see as enabling the behaviors they find so disturbing Deprived of your nice warm bed at home of course youre going to crash at your boyfriendsI have never seen a case of a teenager coming home to apologize though this is probably what your mothers emails are inviting as you said From what Ive seen these crises usually find a positive outcome but Ive never seen that particular one  repentant children immediately rushing back to mamaThis might be because most of my teenaged students lacked the social skills to engage in that kind of confrontation with their parents or that theyre unwilling to fully adopt their old role again  the perfect sinless child their parents still imagine them to be Im not saying this is the case with you as youre a few years older than my students but that it would explain why it just doesnt happen in my experienceYou probably stumbled upon part of the reason parents so frequently take this nuclear option route It sounds like your mother really does expect you to come home and be her baby for the rest of the summer You yourself were surprised at how selfsufficient you are how well youre taking to your new independent adult identity Imagine how foreign your positive experiences with your newfound freedom would strike your longsuffering mother Of course parents would assume their children would be happier at home because they know how hard adulthood is and could never imagine even their perfect children having what it takes At least not without a couple more choice lessons from mom and dad  Its a testament to the respect you have for your parents that you actively put off becoming sexually active until legal adulthood But expecting a collegeaged woman to break off a relationship with a collegeaged man just because he doesnt believe in the same cloudwizard as her parents is a bit unreasonable I think I understand where the not under my roof instinct comes from but its just so stupid when you really break it downOn the bright side at least youre in junior college not junior high Good luck contacting your siblingsTLDR Im sorry Parents are stupid but in a way any parent would understand Make it work for you,3,cdk7pm9,1r5t8r,atheism,hot,6.0,3

DinoDude,You displayed an immense amount of courage and bravery acting the way you did and your parents reaction was inappropriate both in its nature and proportion and thats putting it lightly They do that because leaving the faith shakes their own and having any doubt is a sin because critical selfexamination can lead to doubt They want to control your life because it gives them a greater sense of control over theirs  it makes them feel like they are better people in the eyes of God Its a horrendous thing doing what they did and with company over no less You did the right thing and in a twisted way maybe they have too they are no longer in direct control of your life and can no longer pester or badger you about your choices I have a great amount of concern what thisll mean for your siblings and for your own future education Have they attempted to deny you money for college because of it I worry that your parents will also attempt to lie to your siblings about you and that they might grow up with great disdain for you because of the lies and caricatures of you that theyve constructed  its scary to think about but they dont seem to be thinking rationally to begin with so I wouldnt put it past them If you ever need to vent remember that you have us and your boyfriend to boot Unlike your parents or the Jewish wargod Yahweh none of us will judge you for who you are ,1,cdkfvl0,1r5t8r,atheism,hot,3.0,2

Jancy,I wanted to state that since you are indeed over  your parents have the legal right to abandon you as you are considered an adult in many states  That means that while you are living in their home over age  that they are responsible for you so they expect a minimum amount of respect and a minimum compliance to their house rules       From my perspective as a parent seriously it sounds like we got a one sided picture from you here  Understand that my grown children have been married returned home left again etc  In and out  But when they are back home they follow the rules  No boozing it up unless I am invited  No sleep overs unless I am gone for the night and please dont use my bed  No roommates unless they are pay half of MY rent and bills  Simple stuff simple rules       Being respectful of your parents beliefs should not be a problem  learning to be discrete is a priority when one is an atheist because of the historic social problems we have had when interacting with fanatical religious types who dont understand that this country is founded on the right of the freedom FROM religion and religious persecution        I am sure it is a disappointment to your parents to learn that you are engaging in sexual activity outside of marriage and that secondarily are an atheist  You managed to push two big buttons for parents everywhere and the atheism may not have as much to do about your parents kicking you out as the lies and the sex issue  Sex is so very taboo with Christians  And telling your parents lies if very disrespectful to any parent            About the atheism my favorite point about speaking to a religious family member is summed up by Christopher Michael Langan who you can find on wiki autodidact with an IQ reported to be between  and   When asked about creationism he says  I believe in the theory of evolution but I believe as well in the allegorical truth of creation theory In other words I believe that evolution including the principle of natural selection is one of the tools used by God to create mankind Mankind is then a participant in the creation of the universe itself so that we have a closed loop I believe that there is a level on which science and religious metaphor are mutually compatibleUnderstand that God is a cognitive construct and not a reality         You go ahead and lay that on your parents as an opportunity to discuss why you remain an atheism and give them something to think about  Dont allow your mother to push her beliefs down your throat not allow her to let you feel guilty about your personal beliefs   I suggest you face your mother and just tell her politely that her efforts to bring her religion into your life is offensive to you in the extreme and if she continues you will stop all communication with her  Try putting the shoe on the other foot and shell soon learn how you truly feel  You can also then tell your mother that by the actions of herself and your father that you were forced to live with the boyfriend and now have sex all the time Im sure shell have an ulcer in no time  ,0,cdl1xyk,1r5t8r,atheism,hot,2.0,2

ImaginaryStranger,This sounds a little similar to my story My parents also dont like my boyfriend because hes an atheist and blame him for my atheism So in my story when I turned  my boyfriend and I had a plan where I moved into his home At this point I have not come out to my parents I had a feeling if I ever came out to them they would kick my ass out so when my boyfriend gave me this opportunity I thought sweet I can come out and still have another family who will support me if my original family disowns me My boyfriends mom is a really liberal Methodist so shes cool with our atheism Well before I turned  my parents found out about my plan and basically told me if I moved in with my boyfriend they would drug themselves up on medication and not be able to take care of my younger siblings Thats when I finally came out to them but I guess the worse thing for them was me living with him than being an atheist They convinced themselves its a phase and that as soon as I break up with my boyfriend I will be a good little catholic girl again Now I live in a city  minutes away from home for college in apartment they payed for to bribe me from living with my boyfriend Little do they know he basically lives here with me On the weekends when they come over we pack up all his stuff and he goes back with his mom As soon as my parents go away he comes over again and the cycle begins again They said to my face though if they find out he is living with me they will disown me and cut me off from all the money support Good thing I got  job yesterday that pays better than minimum wage Anyways it felt good to read your story though because I feel like someone else out there knows what I am going through,0,cdkd5yw,1r5t8r,atheism,hot,1.0,1

gamblingman,How well I know this situation Nearly identical thing happened with me around the same age but for different reasons Id love to give you some advice even though youre somewhat overwhelmed with replies Put your family and all the argument and etc out of your mind for now You need to be focused on what you are going to do in the short to near future on your own Dont get too wound up with the distant future or how to help your siblings You have a lot of thoughts running through your mind but the main one needs to be your own welfare first If your siblings arent total idiots no offense they see whats happening and will realize how wildly ridiculous your parents are acting You dont need to try and contact them and potentially create strife for them to handle when your parents give them hell also You can be sure that your parents are already giving your siblings long speeches about how you are being directed by your sinful nature and you arent right with god and satan is controlling your mind etc Without a doubt your parents are telling your siblings that they have to stay away from you because you are a destructive influence  You are not going to go after your parents Dont be out for revenge or try to prove that they are wrong They will use anything you do and twist what you do into a negative light dont give them any ammo They will not agree with you or compromise They will want you to bend over backwards and abandon what you believe just so their view of their kids stays the same They dont want you to be an individual they want a clone of themselves Focus on yourself Though you have a supportive bf imagine if that ends What will you do then Begin your life by becoming a self sufficient individual Look for counseling services When I was at Sam Houston State they had a free counseling service anyone could use So when the gf and I decided to get married we did individual and couples counseling to make sure we were in good shape and it helped A LOT Find a counseling service in your area and GO You will need this because you need someone impartial to talk to that wont judge or spread what you say Dont dwell on your hate Your parents have made bad parenting decisions but people make a lot of bad decisions in life I certainly have If you choose to maintain a hatred toward them that anger and hatred will negatively taint other areas of your life  There is a chance that over time they will relax and realize that they want their daughter around because they miss you and your choices will not cause the world to end I cant promise a result like this but its what happened with me,2,cdko1g5,1r5t8r,atheism,hot,3.0,1

mistersunman,Many have shared in your shoes My dad used to be Jewish and would very much believe in God until I started smoking pot I started smoking it at the age of   now It helped me get out of depression and start putting my head on right I was very sheltered and have been living under very conservative judgemental parentsTheir ideal son is one who makes a ton of money has sex with only  girl and she must be white and preferably Jewish and I marry her and I must have children They would say they care about my happiness but their actions speak louder and they care more about their own ego and image than my wants and needsBefore pot I considered myself Jewish After it opened up my mind I converted to Agnostism I confessed to my parents about what my green habit and I told them that Im tired of living a conservative life I revealed to themThat they have severely oppressed me that I shouldve been having lots of crazy sex when I was  like everyone else And that because I couldnt experience that Im going to now Even when I would present logic about how harmless and beneficial pot is they simply would not accept it They labelled it as harmful of a drug as Heroine My parents have no idea what any of this shit is Theyre very closed minded naive and pretty much keep to themselves all the time Theyre very old schoolI realized I had to move out  I was a  year old with the naive brain of someone whose  It was scary as shitI moved out and began learning about what life is really like They grew increasingly aggressive towards me that I wasnt obeying their standards and judgements So then I told them thats it Im independent Im an adult This is my house This is my roof Its my rules From now on Im doing whatever I want whenever i want if I die I dieI started taking shrooms and started unravelling just how fucked up they raised me I had severe mommyIssues body dismorphic disorder and pretty much socially insane The shrooms opened my mind to the truth I converted to Athiem and have a hate on God Thats right Fuck God Religion has corrupted my parents fucked me up started wars and has been disproven by science for already too long After a year of rebellion against my parents I told my dad Im an athiestHe told me that over time after witnessing his son go down hill he too has changed his beliefs about God What he was describing was Agnosticsm My dad told me hes agnostic My mom later wrote me an email saying how selfish scared and angry I am with myself and that I am blaming God for all of thisAfter all my studying on philosophy my exploration through psychedelics and the self cognitive therapy Ive been doing for a year I can honestly say that I dont have any hate for god Haha because dont believe he exists When I say Fuck God Im saying fuck religion and that Im not afraid of a  year old imaginary fairy tale old fart whose a hypocritical homophobic manslaughtererMy mom has the biggest ego out of anyone I know except for me which Ive been working onIm a lot better today an moving out has been the best thing thats ever happened to me Ive discontinued communication with my mom until I can stop caring about that she doesnt actually love meMy dad on the other hand also difficult but at least he listens to reason He seems to be okay with my habit after he has seen my rising success in life And he seems to be proud of me for wanting to grow up and become a ManI have a similar experience to your bf experience I once dated a black girl for  years Those were very difficult times,0,cdku4bv,1r5t8r,atheism,hot,1.0,1

Seekin,Ive heard it said that while the Christian church may have done violently harmful things in the past currently this isnt a problem  Ive heard it said that religion faith is the basis for many people being generous and altruistic  I personally feel that people are predisposed by their evolution as a social species to be cooperative and even altruistic  But whats being ignored are the daily indignities and useless self debasement because of the teachings of the churchGenerations of men who feel broken and dirty for masturbating because they are told so by their most trusted authority figures  I myself felt this for years  Generations of women told that they are prudes if they are virgins and sluts if they arent and made to feel guilty about it either way Breakfast Club I think  In both cases men and women its merely a consequence of being a sexually reproducing mammal apologies for the redundancy  And theres OPs storyIm convinced that the Christian church has a net negative impact on modern society  Its these personal effects on a family level combined with my hypothesis that people are roughly equally generous and kind with or without religious faith that convince me  I could be convinced Im wrong by evidence  But it would take a lot of benefit however we define that to outweigh the harmful psychological effects in my opinion,3,cdk6j8u,1r6teu,atheism,hot,11.0,8

adventurousabby,I remember the first time I refused to go to church with my family I was  My mom normally the more levelheaded parent blew up and told me that I was going to hell I never said I was atheist or anything I really wasnt at the time but Im sure thats how she interpreted it What I realize now is that she was really insecureperhaps not in her own faith but she didnt want the image of our family to be tarnished in the eyes of the congregation In my particular denomination Seventhday Adventistm which happens to be a more judgmental denomination though I think this is somewhat universal there is a lot of pressure put on parents to raise the kids in the faith In my moms mind my leaving the church was very public proof that she had failedthat she was inadequate It doesnt excuse the outburst of course but I understand why she did it and in time that has helped me move on,1,cdk8xn8,1r7205,atheism,hot,11.0,10

HermesTheMessenger,The Hindu idea of inclusiveness is interesting but limited I have a neighbor who is a Hindu and we went on a trip to a local Ashram that was fascinating  He talked about the lotus flower and the focus on the many facets of god how all religions pointed towards the same source  So how is that limited  Well of most importance to the folks here it does not include the option for no gods  The focus is on the path to god  There isnt even a philosophical angle  like many deists and pantheists hold  that allows the concept of a god to be used while the individual does not claim anything beyond the concept  This is not to say that someone cant be a Hindu and an atheist its just not that inclusive without ignoring the core idea that revolves around the godSince there arent any reasons to think any gods exist and the gods described by various religious sects and even individuals differ and contradict each other it looks like Hinduism is not any closer than the other groups,0,cdkide0,1r7oqb,atheism,hot,2.0,2

BuccaneerRex,I grew up in a secular household but in the US you cant really avoid Christianity I think one of the reasons Ive remained unconvinced by any religion is due to a set of Childrens Encyclopedias my uncle bought from a doortodoor salesman when I was around  or soI dont remember the publisher or anything about the actual encyclopedia set What I remember is that along with the reference volumes were some additional books A book of GrecoRoman mythology with beautiful classic artwork and a book of Bible Stories that were illustrated the same way Because they were published by the same company they were written in much the same way Instead of being traditional chapterverse the Bible stories went through the whole book and basically wrote out the stories in prose form without pulling punches or glossing over the details So I had an early comparative religion course right there I read both sets of mythologies and didnt find much difference between them I grasped very quickly that the idea of a deity is just a way to explain the unknown that happens around us and that the more we learn about how reality actually works the less need there is for a deity to explain itSo I asked my mom one day when I was around  or  what God was Her answer was Its what some people think explains why the world is here But there are other explanations that work better,1,cdkjqa4,1r7t2m,atheism,hot,4.0,3

mverobeach,When I was  my grandfather died and on the way to the funeral I asked my mother what happened to him She said he died And were going to say goodbye to him and well never see him again I asked will I die too Yes we all will Then I started to cry and she said but not for a long time When I was  my best friend died from an asthma attack and my grandmother took me twice to see wakes of her friends who had died As a teen I volunteered in a nursing home and everday people were dying I think death is one of the main things that determines someones religiousity Every person I have known who is really religious as in they pray go to church and are hard core spiritual has a story of how they were confronted it seems spontaneously with the realization of their own mortality A beloved relative or friend died or they were drug addicts or alcoholicsthey all have some story like this I think that until they had such an experience they never gave a single thought to how short and precious life they never gave a thought to the fact that one day they would be dead Luckily I was eased into this realization from a young age and had family members who told me the truth rather than saying that the people who had died went to heaven or some other thingI think it would be an interesting project for a psychologist to do to find out how much this has to do with religious belief,0,cdkgikd,1r7t2m,atheism,hot,2.0,2

Joshed,These are really interesting stories everyone and I enjoyed reading them  I think my story is simplistic but for some reason it stuck out  I grew up in a secular household and never went to church as a kid Some of you mentioned Christianity being unavoidable and I totally agree so I would hear about god as a kid and tried talking to him at night since I was always afraid of dying because I never truly bought into an eternal afterlife probably because I was fortunate enough to not be brainwashed as a child After a while of never hearing anything back I eventually stopped talking to him myself and as I grew older I researched more and more about it and eventually came out as a full atheist in middle school Thanks for reading everyone,0,cdkkupu,1r7t2m,atheism,hot,2.0,2

MrGorsh,Walking with Dinosaurs I was a kid back then and given my countrys general strangely catholic but proscience attitude this TV series have caused my love towards prehistoric life to go up like a damn rocket I got obsessed with paleontology evolution and whatnot It was a major thing because as a kid I was raised with the Bible AND books about dinosaurs Weird Probably but I got access to both views on the continuity of life on the planet and I chose science Then it was just an avalanche of questions that religion couldnt answer until I finally gave it up and decided that if theres any god out there he sure as hell doesnt mind me masturbating or expanding my knowledge of paleontology and evolution having more serious stuff on his schedule,0,cdkjdin,1r7t2m,atheism,hot,1.0,1
Thestrangeone,Interestingly enough the Artemis Fowl books by Eion Colfer played a huge role in my childhood path to atheism I was raised in a Christian home homeschooled and lived in a rural area I was as clustered as you could get However many of the same things that proved the existence of God also proved the existence of faeries from this book I had a very active imagination as a child and while my parents never tried to convince me of Santa Claus around the same time that I used to believe in God I also believed that the Artemis Fowl books were accurate documents I also believed the series of unfortunate events books were also true I enjoyed considering many fiction books as reality Once I finally started giving up these ideas god ended up going with them Actually God was first to go I actually thought the Artemis Fowl books were more believable then the Bible ,0,cdkl49w,1r7t2m,atheism,hot,1.0,1

Dudesan,The suffix phobia typically indicates an irrational or unjustified fear or hatred but the term Islamophobia is used overwhelmingly to describe justified criticism Something like  of the time the accusation is made it is as a juvenile invective comparable to calling someone a Big stupid doodoo head Its the remaining  of cases that give the term any credibility at all but which also provide the sharpest contrast to demonstrate when its use is inappropriateUnfortunately there actually are some rednecks chavs and assorted white supremicists who dont understand the difference between Muslims and Brown People and who really are motivated by base xenophobia and ingroupoutgroup effects rather than by any actual objections to Islam itself Indeed most of these xenophobes agree with hardline Islam on subjects such as the rights of women the separation of Church and State the validity of the Scientific Method whether its okay to go to war because your Holy Man claims that the voices in his head command you to and all the things that most Islamophobes actually take issue with You need look no farther than the Republican Party to find a wide assortment of such peopleThe word is mostly thrown around because certain people would like to silence any and all criticism of Islam no matter how grounded in fact that criticism may be They seek to accomplish this by pretending that the abovementioned rednecks are the only people who could possibly dislike anything about Islam for any reason lumping it all into the category of Islamophobia By this logic anyone who objects to child marriages or to being raped being punished more harshly than actually committing rape or to demanding the death penalty for victimless crimes like blasphemy or to enthusiastic and nearconstant endorsements of violent martyrdom must therefore be a racist The fact that none of these topics have anything to do with race is ignored and frequently dismissed with some bafflegab about culture These people either cannot understand the difference between phobia and legitimate criticism or choose to ignore it when it is inconvenient to them Its especially worrying that some of the people engaging in this dishonesty are not even Muslims themselves but thats a topic for a separate rantThis is a classic example of the false dilemma Youre either with us or youre with our enemies Its roughly equivalent to suggesting that since Adolf Hitler hated Joseph Stalin it is impossible to disagree with Stalin on any issue without being a Nazi even if that issue is something upon which Hitler and Stalin agreed such as whether it is appropriate to solve your problems with genocidehttpenwikipediaorgwikiHolodomor Hopefully such people can eventually be made to realize that its possible to disagree with a horrible ideology without necessarily having to subscribe to the almost indistinguishable nextmosthorrible ideology,1,cdkpcxh,1r8h8z,atheism,hot,3.0,2

taterbizkit,This is a great first step but thats all it is  The judges order stays enforcement until after the entire appeals process is completed  That could take yearsAlso oddly the FFRFs summary in the linked article seems to have misread the opinion  The judge only ruled on  and did not rule on   The article treats this as a victory over both exemptions  There are good reasons to believe that  is constitutional despite this opinion Edit I misread FFRFs summary  They make the distinction properly allows exemption of the rental value of a home provided to a clergyperson  Home is owned by the church minister pays no rent allows deduction of a rental stipend paid by the church to the minister who then pays rent on a home not owned by the church parallels an existing IRS policy allowing exemption of the value of a companyprovided home if having the employee live in companyowned housing is for the convenience of the company  Applying this rule to clergy is less discriminatory than applying it only to business employeesAnyhow as frequently occurs with these cases whether or not this ruling is valid may turn on the standing issue  To have standing to sue the government requires that you have suffered an actual factual injury  You have to have incurred a harm or been denied a benefit  Even if a law is blatantly absurdly comically unconstitutional you have to have been injured by it to sue over it  Silly but thats how it worksBeing denied a tax exemption provided to others is a harm as a matter of law so as long as the FFRF plaintiffs have been denied the exemption they have standingWhats not clear unfortunately is whether or not they have been denied  The Government claims that they havent been denied infact because they never claimed it on their tax returns  The Plaintiffs argue that the tax code on its face makes it illegal to claim the benefit thus operates as a denial of that benefit  This is exactly the kind of semantic nuance that judges use to reach the outcome they like the bestIf an appellate judge or SCOTUS justice wants to they can fatuously claim that as a purely technical matter the benefit hasnt been denied because they never claimed it  This would defeat standing and the case would be dismissed regardless of the merits of the plaintiffs arguments  Even though it could constitute a felony perjury tax evasion etc to claim the exemption the court could rule that not claiming it defeats standingThe judge addresses this point in the opinion that this would have the effect of allowing an unconstitutional law to be unchallengeable because it would be impossible to gain standing to challenge it  Unfortunately this kind of thing does happenOne obvious problem with  is that it applies the deduction to ministers of the gospel  which is pretty obviously an endorsement of religion  Long before this case reached a final conclusion its possible that Congress would simply change the language of  to something more neutral that would preserve the exemption in a way that is superficially constitutional but still manages to exclude nonclergytldr  Dont hold your breath folks  I doubt very much that this order is going to result in any clergymember or church paying more in taxes than they do now  There are too many ways to get around thisSource I am not a lawyer  Though I do get my CA bar exam results in just over  hours P ,0,cdkqrzo,1r8k9i,atheism,hot,1.0,1

JizzLicker,I know  pastors all of whom are extremely dedicated to their community and helping those in need including  gay men They live on very humble salary entirely off donations from mostly lower class congregations  of their subsidized housing have guest rooms that are usually occupied by a church member or sometimes nonmember whose dealing with problems and needs a place to stay Now the fearless defenders of liberty at circlejerkeism are celebrating because some glorious day he may have to pay a little more for his house WhoopeeeBut its unfair other leaders and individuals who help just as much arent given the same breakActually yes they are Pastor housing is subsidized under the e clause of the nonprofit partnership act specifying that any nonprofit founder or direct privilege employee is eligible for this subsidized housing The act used to specify Christian church leaders only but expanded to cover other religions and eventually all nonprofits which fall under certain communitybased criteria But if ratheism has their way the government will just tell them Oh well you could have had subsidized housinguntil we discovered your organization is Christian Sorry turns out freedom of religion only applies if youre free of any religion God bless murica,2,cdl55w5,1r8krj,atheism,hot,2.0,0
AventinusCam,I have no problem with pastors getting taxexempt housing The first reason is these are people who spend tens of thousands of dollars for their education And as a high school teacher I tell everybody to pursue what they love If a student loves the gospel and theology who are we to tell them they are wrong with pursuing it in their education When you combine that with how dramatically little pastors make I am alright with taxexempt housing And they are active members of the community that are essentially on call  Atheist btw I just think the soapboxing is getting out of control,3,cdkyyoy,1r8krj,atheism,hot,1.0,-2

bigdamhero,Just to clear things up for those commenting who have obviously read no more than the title and perhaps the first few lines of the article the court enjoined the IRS from enforcing  USC  and does nothing to  What this means is that if the decision is not reversed on appeal the IRS is barred from granting a tax exemption on extra income provided to a minister specifically apportioned for the paying of a ministers rent or mortgage  which was untouched still allows a church to purchase a home and allow the minister to live rent free without reporting the market value of such  rental as part of his taxable income This wont greatly effect most smaller older or more rural churches as historically these churches save money on minister salary by paying less and providing a living arrangement by way of a parsonage often gifted to the church or bought by the church long ago rendering it a free addition for he church to make Instead what the removal of  does is to prevent a minister from being able to hide any amount of income that they are able to show was spent on living arrangement which is far more common among the larger churches which get proportionately more wasteful with increased size and grant ministers unreasonably high sums for their homes essentially allowing the Revruns and TD Jakes of the world to live lavish lifestyles while reported relatively little On first reading the headline I was concerned for my father who is a minister however upon further reading I realize that neither he nor any lower income minister I have ever met would be greatly effected by this decision ,0,cdkzh5p,1r99hi,atheism,hot,12.0,12

postoergopostum,The last line of the review on Amazon readsReaders will find that over the past twenty years the case for the historical trustworthiness of the Gospels has grown vastly strongerIt is generally considered among scholars poor form to write your own blurbThis quote from the blurb of The Incredible Shrinking Son of Man by Robert M PricehttpwwwamazoncomIncredibleShrinkingSonManTraditiondpreflaBJPBXSsbooksampieUTFampqidampsr provides an interesting contrastFor more than a century scholars have been examining the Gospels and other traditions about the life of Jesus to determine their historical accuracy Although the results of these scholarly efforts are sometimes controversial the consensus among researchers today is that the four Evangelists accounts cannot be taken at face value In fact a team of more than  scholars called the Jesus Seminar has come to the conclusion that on average only about  percent of the four Gospels is historically accurateThere are two points worthy of note   Firstly if you check the link to Amazon youll note that Price being a serious scholar uses quotes from published reviews of his books to provide the text for his blurbs This one is from Freethinker magazine  And secondly that there is another very scholarly and respected perspective on these issues that is somewhat at odds with the views expressed by apologists such as William Laine Craig Dinesh De Souza and of course the very calm and balanced Craig L BlombergNow its not my place to tell you what you should think or what conclusions you should draw on this issue Likewise I dont think you can be fully informed on a given subject until youve got an accurate and sound understanding of both sides of the issueBlomberg is as good an author as any to give you a grounding in the subject as it is presented by the modern school of evangelical apologists Note though that many scholars who are also Christian disagreeThe above link is as good a place as any to get all you need to know of the other perspectiveAnyone who read both of those books would be in a sufficiently informed position to consider the matter and draw their own conclusionsIve included a link below to a Robert M Price youtube video because he should always be read as he speaks Ive also linked to a few Amazon pages for authors who have written well on the subjectRobert M Price at Skepticon part  on youtubehttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvgouJmYtDoRobert M Price at AmazonhttpwwwamazoncomRobertMPriceeBJPBXSrefsrtcqidampsrentRichard Carrier at AmazonhttpwwwamazoncomRichardCarriereBKLYEMrefnttautsimBart D Ehrman at AmazonhttpwwwamazoncomBartDEhrmaneBIRRGrefnttautsim,1,cdkztk5,1r9m68,atheism,hot,4.0,3

NuclearShadow,Many people believe that morality comes from religion   Its a common trap theists try to use  however is not only easily countered by  our understand of morality  through science on how and why it came to be but  since many theists do not believe in evolution I like to counter it another wayWhat people perceive as good and evil changes person to person   Which shows it is largely a culture  and somewhat of a personal opinionThink of a few religions and then look at how drastically they can view certain issues differently    A modern Christian for example would likely see Mesoamerican  mass human sacrifices to be  immoral  yet obviously the other side of the fence would see it as a good and moral act     But it gets worse for theists as even people of the same faith will often disagree on atleast minor issues  and at times even major issues    The topic of homosexual rights for example  you can find that Christians can have a polar opposite opinion on this subject   Some still think homosexuals should be killed  and they believe this to be the moral thing  Others will can be completely for homosexual rights and be supportive of the LGBT community and have nothing but love for such people Now if religion was the basis of morality this would not happen  especially in the case of those that practice the same religion,1,cdl1ugg,1r9ugf,atheism,hot,2.0,1

Daniellassander,i will try to be as concise as i can but give me some slack english is not my native languageThere are many reasons why i dont believe in any religion god or gods first and foremost would be that even if we knew one religion was  true how could we possibly know which one if we have to take it on faith there is no clear way to differentiate between them and we dont know if one religion is true at allSecondly would be that all religions that i have studied never has anything in their texts that reveals  something that we still did not know about the universe or the world we live in at the time it was writtenThird would be that most religions holy texts contradicts itself in certain places so we know for certain that parts are not truecorrect there is no way to discern which is the most accurate and by this we also know that god indeed did not write itFourth if there was a god and he cared about a relationship with us humans he would let us know with evidence and if that god had written any holy text we can be quiet sure that it would be unmatched in the literary world it would be the most perfect thing ever writtenFifth people of all religions often say that their god talks to them and tells them what to do if that god was a real god those people would never find themselves at odds with others of their religion as the god would actually tell them the same thingsi can go on almost endlessly about this but there is one thing that stands out more then anything else science gives us a clear and unbiased way of understanding the natural world we inhabit it has uncovered that lightning comes from a charge building up in clouds by natural processes no god there earthquakes is tensions in the earths crust being released no god there volcanoes are magma under pressure bursting through fissures in the ground untill it reaches the surface no god there science gives us a way of understanding the world we live in that no religion can give us and through all the progress of science we have not yet found something that requires a godedit spelling,0,cdlezmd,1raker,atheism,hot,3.0,3

MartinTheRound,Im not sure what you mean by looking for signs and answers Are you trying to have faith and find justification or are you looking for the truth out there If you are looking for faith your quest is completely different you will need to find something to reassure you to feel the spiritual connection In this case I personally suggest something along the lines of being spiritual that is to say just believe that there is a higher power and dont buy into any specific religion search for the good parts of religions If youre looking for the truth on the other hand you need to ask yourself are you ready to find that there is in fact no higher power and the gods people believe in are just manifestations of psychologyAs for damning people to hell for not believing its one of the glaring problems with christianity Think of if this way if there were a loving god hesheittheythem would not condemn people for silly stuff surely But from a critical perspective consider that the jewish faith and the old testament has no concept of heaven or hell And if you read the bible carefully youll find that nothing jesus said mentions heaven specifically Jesus spoke of the kingdom of god on earth and the resurrection of corporeal bodies when the time comes And people are still waiting Also consider that there is no single interpretation of pretty much anything in the bible Or it can be seen that way consider the christians that kill in the name of god despite thou shalt not kill is a commandment from god Also consider that there are countless churches and denominations so being right is out of the question or at least practically out of the question Since if a truth could be found and presented it would not make sense to fracture churchesYou dont need a church or a doctrine to be spiritual And you dont need to have faith in a higher power or spirituality to be good or happy And if youre looking for the truth you might get surprised be ready What do you seek precisely WhyBut I wish you happy seeking And feel free to ask Im on reddit for a short time but there are plenty of people here to give you plenty of points of view vast majority in a welcoming manner,0,cdlhb0q,1ralx0,atheism,hot,1.0,1

cjbrooksie,I grew up in a very religious home and was very serious about my faith until around age   I still considered myself a believer for a few years after that but I stopped going to church around  Because of a girl I watched alot of nature shows and out of interest started reading more and more about animals and eventually about extinct animals  Over time evolution just started making more and more sense to me  Eventually evolution went from being a crazy theory to something I could see everywhere  You can look at related species and see their similar traits and imagine how they diverged at one point  While accepting evolution does have to mean you dont believe in god for me once I fully grasped evolution and could see how our world formed and life came to be the idea of god no longer made sense to me  As I moved further away I saw more and more how the bible was not divinely inspired but was clearly written by men and many of them not very wise  The bible is full of genocide sexism slavery and so on  The divine word of an infinite being would surely be more thought out  If such a being did exist why would he so desperately need our worship  It just doesnt add up and one day it just clicked that I no longer believed in god  Ill also add that while Id never go back losing my faith was the hardest thing I have ever gone through  Ive never been more depressed than the initial  years after that  My family and most of the people I knew were christians  Its all I knew  And a universe without god was lonely and scary  But now my life has more meaning to me then it ever did as a christian  I live for me and those I care about not a jealous god  ,0,cdlazcs,1ramjh,atheism,hot,5.0,5

StanFitch,Heres my EXTREMELY VALUABLE input I know youve all been waiting with bated breathIm not religious I dont have anything against religion itself or the people that follow their religion of choice Assuming theyre open minded and dont judge every living creature they encounter ha ha right Ive had my fair share of experiences with several different religions as I was growing up my parents were very open minded and allowed me to experience all sorts of different religions on my own I learned very quickly that it just wasnt for me I would probably consider myself Agnostic or simply Spiritual more than anything elseAs far as our government goes Buildings Currency Monuments etc My opinion is there needs to be an absolute separation of Church and State on all fronts plain and simple We as a society And especially as Redditors have already seen how chaotic and crazy a religious influence can make even the SIMPLEST OF DECISIONS in our government For fucks sake they cant even wipe their asses without referencing some portion of the Bible that states exactly how many wipes is too many not enough and whether you can do it yourself or with someone of the same sex in the same roomOur politicians can barely act on what is best for the people of this country without involving some flawed concept of Christianity or Catholicism They cant vote on a simple idea without bringing in the Bible the Jesus dude or the big guy God himself We cant even vote on a simple law to allow marriage to people who love one another what the fuck is that all about kidsAnyway my point in all this rant is simply that the longer we allow ANY religious references in any of our government activities the longer were going to be fighting this religious battle in a government that should not have any religious affiliations whatsoever If you as an individual would like to think that God has his eye on us and is giving us the strength and the power to be a great nation thats fine by me do your thing But DO NOT INTERFERE with what is best for the nation best for the people best for the majority just because the Bible says its naughty or illadvised  of whats IN YOUR BIBLE is terrible evil insane outdated nonsense that offends even the religious followers whove failed to do their homework ie Reading the fucking book that came with your choice of religion The quicker we abolish these references the quicker we can start to become a nation that focuses on the good of the people All of the people Bam there it is Chicks n MidgetsTLDR  Im completely for abolishing anyall religious references within our local state and federal governments because stuff,1,cdlhhkw,1rapjb,atheism,hot,6.0,5

DinoDude,Apparently he needed to feel like everything was designed perfectly in mind for him in order for him to appreciate it Ultimately its an argument as Richard Dawkins put it from Personal Incredulity  I cannot accept that you can love without thinking things are designed therefore there is a designer He interweaves this rather skillfully befitting to his profession with some some glaring nonsequiturs and errors of fact for example personalities and appearance arent random  theyre caused by an easily understood sequence of events occurring in childhood and gene expression respectively Lewis then blindly asserts that it is irrational for music to be pleasurable without having any knowledge himself on what scientific reasons there might be for music existing within cultures in the first place so once again we see argumentum ad ignorantium Furthermore he commits a nonsequitur by implying that because it is irrational you therefore cannot explain it by chance alone  what a load of nonsense Even if my love for ska music and kittens is inexplicable to me that doesnt mean I cant appreciate them or that my feelings for them arent real He makes an assertion there that really amounts to little more than ignorant opinion Theres also a broad implied false dichotomy here along the lines of science without God  total chaos God  order when all the scientific principles we know of operate interact and originate all the same whether or not Gods mentioned in the mix As Laplace famously said I had no need of that hypothesis Essentially what Lewis says here is an artfully crafted carefully written beautifully expressed pile of ignorant horseshit ,0,cdlljhc,1raqhm,atheism,hot,1.0,1

Xylemicarious,Moral objectivism The idea that morality is not subjective or a matter of opinion It is true or false and not subject to human feelings or customs Usually the source of said morality is god but philosophies like Utilitarianism could fit in here as well It stands in contrast with moral relativismMoral absolutism The idea that some actions are immoral no matter the consequences or motive This is often religiously based as well but you could be for example a strict practitioner of nonviolence and think that violence was wrong even in selfdefense Absolutism stands in contrast with consequentialism which says that an actions morality depends largely on its context and its consequencesAnyway theyre often overlapping but different Most atheists wouldnt consider themselves to be either though especially the former,0,cdlcuey,1rava8,atheism,hot,2.0,2
postoergopostum,Ive been thinking about a new approach to arguments about morality Any thoughts and comments would be greatly appreciatedOne of the foundations of just about all religious doctrine is a moral code Further most of these doctrines are structured such that these rules are generally raised to a higher status than mere human rules and are regarded by the flock as being far more important and carrying more weight than civil lawsThis is then used as leverage to try and force all of society to conform with their individual ideology Think of Sharia in the UK or gay marriage in The USApologists also use our own internal sense of right and wrong as an evidence for God By claiming that the ideas we hold on the subject of how we should behave are not things that we have been taught or even conclusions weve reached on our own the assertion is made that this moral law is a feature of The Universe and it was put there by GodTo make matters worse there is the popular troll that those of us without faith are in some way morally compromisedTo date we heathen have tried to construct scientific or philosophical justifications for a moral code or sense that is independent as it must be of a non existent deityBut what exactly is meant by the term moralityLike spiritual and so many other popular terms of faith including faith the wordmorality is a slave to equivocation Part of the way religious belief is kept unfalsifiable is by using a wide variety key terms ambiguously If the things you say about your beliefs are confusing and difficult to pin down let alone understand then its much more difficult for that belief to be shown as falseWords like morality are too loaded We dont need them and by using them we are giving too much groundAs Hitch used to point out those who are psychopathic or sociopathic seem to exist without any genuine idea of morality and right or wrong So morality as such is not available to everyoneInstead lets talk about behaviourHow human beings behave towards each other is something we can test and measure There is already a wealth of data and it feeds in directly to ideas like Harris thoughts on well being and human flourishingWe already call the subject Ethics It is the scientific study of human social behaviour We even know where it comes from Surprisingly most social conditioning formerly moral instruction is carried out by our siblings and peers right from the very beginning of childhood Fairness is understood the day after we first manage to crawl to the toy box under our own steamTLDRSo my position is to put it succinctlyThere is no such thing as morality Its a term of ecquivocation and only serves to cloud the real issue How should we humans behave towards each other so that we maximise human well being and flourishing,0,cdlepxw,1rava8,atheism,hot,1.0,1
Logomac,Objective morality would be moral truths that exist outside of an individual frame of reference and can be objectively measured Absolute morality would be moral truths that remain true regardless of individual situationsTo say that it is inherently wrong to harm someone against their will and this quality of moral wrongness is independent of any participating agents is to make a claim for objective morality To say is is wrong to harm someone period whether it be against their will or not regardless of the situation is to make a claim for absolute morality,0,cdlf1gg,1rava8,atheism,hot,1.0,1

HeatDish,There is none Steven Pinker wrote a great dense book called Religion Explained which you could look at for better answers He argues that our brains work by making categories for everything so as to better remember it later We are attracted to supernatural ideas because they fit in some categories they should and shouldnt A ghost may look like a person so your brain says person category which confuses you when you learn this person walked through a wall without breaking it One would remember this story more easily than say an ordinary hunting story But the hunting story can teach one a lot about hunting So ordinary stories and family histories are mixed with supernatural ideas to make them easier to remember and pass to the next generation He talks about a study in which people were given words to read and a week later were called back to tell the researchers which ones they remembered It was always funnysounding words that were spelled weirdlyBasically religion Pinker argues is a sort of culturallyspecific memory system that eventually became what formed societies and made each group its own The problem is God and the supernatural can still exist in this scenario Pinker only explains how our brains remember thingsBoth athiests and religious people as Tacsol aptly pointed out at the moment depend on faith Religious people have their books atheists have the idea that if we can see touch manipulate or understand something then it is real and something that doesnt meet those criteria is not,0,cdlco65,1ravo3,atheism,hot,3.0,3

SashkaBeth,Oh man I have a very similar friend  We were inseperable as kids  Always there for each other  She helped me through my fathers death when I was   I went to church with her when I slept over at her house even though it really wasnt my thing We grew apart a little at the end of high school when she grew more religious and preferred to hang out with her super Christian friend  We werent in contact too much during college and after until we both joined Facebook and reconnected with each other  She ended up marrying a super Christian guy who went to Liberty University  She posts about religion all the freaking time now She had been a math teacher but her and her husband decided to dedicate all their time to their ministry being missionaries and running Jesus camps  This means an invitation to all their friends to become ministry partners and donate money to support their family and to fund their training to be missionaries  I turn a blind eye to all of it even though it makes me incredibly uncomfortable  I love her but I cannot in any way support their lifes work of brainwashing kids  But I would never tell her so because she was my best friend and was such a hugely important part of my life and I selfishly dont want to lose her even though we dont have much in common anymore other than having grown up in the same small community  She hasnt asked me directly Im pretty sure she knows Im an atheist and to her credit she just loves me for who I am anyway and I hope she never does because it will be a very awkward hell noI dont know the answer but I really needed to get that out because its like watching someone you love go slowly more and more insane and not being able to do anything about it  Really been eating at me lately,0,cdlodnd,1rb7cm,atheism,hot,3.0,3
Snabelpaprika,This is basically a scam a pyramid scheme hidden behind a lot of Jesus so people lower their guard and not suspect anything The extremely sketchy employment contract that isnt any kind of employment just a commitment from her to give them a lot of money It is not an employment if you provide your own salary That is recruiting to a pyramid scheme nothing else The use of partnership is also very pyramid schemy Just as the employment it is nothing but how about you give us money but just renamed so it sounds like something it isnt Why not just call it giver It is to instill some kind of duty and loyalty so they can complain and demand stuff which you cant do to people who are just givers  Pyramid schemes forces people to use up all their social contacts milk as much money out of them as possible and then when they and all their friends are dry they just leave them or force them to stop doing it since they cant support themselves any longer This is not a sustainable way to collect money thats why they need to be able to get rid of all these used up people and that is why the employment is completely self funded so they dont need to provide anything or have any kind of responsibilityShe is being used and probably instructed in how to convince all her friends and relatives to give her money The use of Jesus and calling itself nonprofit is just a way to try to get around the fact that pyramid schemes are illegal I would research what they actually do with the money I assume just a fraction goes to anything at all except the pockets of the leader and this is just enough to keep up the illusion of it helping anyone There are loads of organizations like this who prey on naive people who think they are doing something good but are just used by greedy bastards who hide behind religion to stop people from question the purpose ,0,cdlqe4g,1rb7cm,atheism,hot,3.0,3

NukkaNasty,I was raised Mormon and left the church at  because of many reasons but I always hate seeing people bash it Having a father that went on a mission to rural Venezuela he can tell you it takes guts to leave your sheltered lifestyle to live without any vices but the Bible and Book of Mormon with partners who youve never met before Do I agree with the message and doctrine of the church Fuck no but I dont see the problem with devoted individuals challenging themselves and believing they are serving others and their God so leave em be and respect their beliefs instead of pointing out problems rooted in all religion ,24,cdlvf9h,1rc7k9,atheism,hot,31.0,7
CesarV,I am always polite to them when I see them but ask them a few questions that no Mormon has ever been able to adequately answer  For instance How do you explain the fact that DNA evidence contradicts the historical narrative in the Book of Mormon  Why is steel mentioned in the BOM but not only has no steel been found that was made by natives in NorthCentralSouth America but no evidence that they had the technology to produce steel  Why are horses and barley mentioned but both were not present or used by natives  Why is it that modern linguistics has demonstrated no connection at all with native languages and the middle east  If you believe in the small population theory why is it that in the BOM there are battles with hundreds of thousands of people killed yet no evidence of these battles   Nine times out of ten they smile nod listen and then ask me to check their website or come to the temple for a chat with an elder  I then tell them that I have already done this and no solid answers  Then comes the canned faith answersGod can do anything evidence is irrelevant when you have faith God communicates with us and proves himself this way without the need of evidence etc   Its to the point now that its getting boring,2,cdltm6x,1rc7k9,atheism,hot,9.0,7

youllforgetme,I was a late convert to Mormonism at  I took to it for a few years after my parents converted I left eventually because I could not stop questioning the doctrine I have to say though during my time with them a nicer bunch of people you would be hard pressed to meet No one in the church gets paid for any work they do and  of money given as charity is used for charityLike all places there are a few people that were what I call Sunday Christians but I would say in my area they where in the minorityAs for the missionaries it is crazy what those kids go through mentally I became friends with missioners as we where around the same age and when one went home she was institutionalized She could not leave her room for weeks without another person They live  with another person of the same sex for  to  months so it must be hard being a missionary  So nowadays when I come across them I offer them a lift if they need it I speak to them nicely although I may at times really push them with theological questions they never react with anger or scorn and they have never said I would go to hell for not believing like my own brother who is a Evangelical church member said  to me one dayYes these kids know nothing about the real world but they do try and live there beliefs everyday which can rarely be said about a lot of religious peopleI might also add never has a Mormon called for the death of another for not believing ,3,cdlunjg,1rc7k9,atheism,hot,5.0,2

monedula,A careful look at the list of prophesies you refer to quickly shows how nonsensical they are Messiah would be born of a woman Big deal How many men are not Messiah would be born in Bethlehem This is not what the prophecy says it says that he would be born to the clan of Bethlehem  Messiah would be born of a virgin If you read the prophecy in context it is clear that this prophecy has nothing at all to do with Jesus but is referring to the Assyrian invasion centuries earlier And in any case the original Hebrew says young woman  not virgin Messiah would come from the line of Abraham In other words he would be a Jew Big deal and  Matthew and Luke give wildly different lines of descent inspiring no confidence at all in their reliability Furthermore they are male lines of descent And Jesus father was supposed to be God  on which basis he was not a maleline descendant of Isaac etc The whole thing is a complete muddle Messiah would come from the tribe of Judah This contradicts the Micah prophecy that he would come from the tribe of Bethlehem Messiah would be heir to King Davids throne Jesus was never the king of anything All we get is a repeated prophecy that he will be one day Messiahs throne will be anointed and eternal Were still waiting Messiah would be called Immanuel He was called Jesus See also point  Messiah would spend a season in Egypt If you read this in context it isnt even a prophecy And according to Luke he didnt go to EgyptAnd so and so on and so on Its walltowall nonsense,1,cdls5uh,1rc9vr,atheism,hot,10.0,9

BuccaneerRex,The nature of epistemology does not allow certainty on some types of claims But the lack of certainty is not a vote for belief in the claim An agnostic atheist simply acknowledges the lack of certainty Some people like to denigrate that as fence sitting or holding out but its really not It is just admitting that the concept of a deity is not one that can ever really be proven or not because of the nature of the claim not because of a failure of knowledge or scienceTheist hypotheses are to paraphrase Wolfgang Pauli Not even wrong They cant be scientifically proven or disproven because theyre not science The supernatural is an oxymoron If something has an effect in the universe it can be studied scientifically If something does not have an effect within the universe it cant be said to existWhat this leads to is the conception of a deity being goalpostshifted until deity is simply defined as the universe itself at which point youve just made the deity irrelevant as an entity within your hypothesis I cant say with perfect certainty that no deity exists anywhere But not because I expect one to be hiding somewhere in the universe its because I dont make any claims regarding a deity I can say that any theist claims Ive ever heard of are ruled out by the nature of reality as exposed through scientific investigation and that I do not accept any theist hypothesis as an explanation for the observed phenomena around me By holding this stance I am not making any claims and therefore leave no rhetorical cracks to get an argument into The burden of proof remains completely on the side of the theist and thanks to Hitchens Razor I can reject claims without evidence without needing any more justificationThe strong or gnostic atheist position strikes me as a doth protest too much assertion It is like including And we have ruled out Leprechauns explicitly as the mechanism for this phenomenon in a scientific paper,1,cdm01w9,1rcjy9,atheism,hot,2.0,1

Iceborg,Well if you look at the wiki for Gnosticism you see the main themes Gnosticism is basically an ancient set of religious ideals or philosophies  The notion of a remote supreme monadic divinity The introduction of a distinct creator god or demiurge The estimation of the world owing to the above as flawed or a production of error but possibly good as its constituent material might allow The explanation of this state through the use of a complex mythologicalcosmological drama in which a divine element falls into the material realm and lodges itself within certain human beingsI would suggest that anyone who understands the description of having gnostic ideals when referring to their beliefs means that you potentially submit to some abstracted form of TheismDeism and are therefore not an Atheist Source not just the wiki I used to live with a PhilosophyReligion student who spent ages trying to explain Gnosticism to me when I was a Christian,1,cdly62t,1rcjy9,atheism,hot,1.0,0
alicemizer,Gnosticism is stupid either way because we have no possible way of knowing for sure whether any god does or does not exist It is certainly probable that no conscious deity exists but to deal in absolutes is the height of ignorance Though Id say being an antitheist is fine considering every religion is highly improbable and harmful at some level Just dont shut yourself off to the possibility of some kind of godlike figure however lazy and inept it may be,3,cdlw7ff,1rcjy9,atheism,hot,1.0,-2

arthurpaliden,Genesis For The Modern Age In the beginning there was only God and he alone created the void that was the Universe Then into the void that was the Universe God placed a infinitesimal part of his being Then he sat back and watched And the void being with out substance was unable to contain this essence of God and so it expanded at a terrible speed releasing unimaginable energies Where upon there was created the four fundamental forces to contain these energies The Strong Nuclear Force the Weak Nuclear Force the Gravitational Force and the Electromagnetic Force And with the establishment of these controlling forces expansion of the Universe slowed and the great energies cooled  the first elementary particles were formed  And from these partials the first atoms were formed The initial one having a single proton and electron and God looked down and said let this be called Hydrogen Then when all the Universe was Hydrogen  the Fundamental Force of Gravity caused groups of these atoms to come together in ever larger masses Where upon when the masses became so large and the Force of Gravity so strong that they started to smash the atoms of Hydrogen together creating new atoms and releasing new energies that  illuminated the Universe And thus Stars were born and there was now light upon the void Then as the forces within the stars created heavier and heavier atoms the energies generated within became great Greater in fact than the Force of Gravity Where upon the very Stars themselves exploded spewing the atoms out in great clouds into the void Again the fundamental forces came into play creating new stars from the lighter atoms and Planets from the heavier ones Starting the  cycle of Star birth and death Now it came to pass that the Planets once formed were much cooler than the Stars allowing the atoms of various types to join together according to the Fundamental forces into molecules Some were simple such as the water that filled the seas some were complex such as the precursor proteins of life itself And with in the waters those combined to produce the first self replicating proteins which then became  the symbiotic proteins and they first living organisms appeared And as population pressure grew life began to change to venture into new habitats to eat new foods and thus evolution began And God marveled at the result of what he had put in motion  which was Man Then God spoke to man thus Do unto others as you would have then do unto yourself Use your intelligence to discover the wonders of this Universe and solve your own problems as it will help you to grow as a species and become better people  And oh ya Dont be jerks Then all was quiet and Man looked about and thought Now where do we start,0,cdmdstm,1rcsy3,atheism,hot,1.0,1

GodzillaSuit, I think like this If I live my life well if Im good to other people and I help out where I can how could any fair God overlook all of the good I did just because I didnt worship him A God who cared more about me believing in him than about me being a good person isnt worth worshiping anyway Plus unless you apply this logic to all of the other Gods that have ever existed you really arent being rational about it   I dont think it makes you a terrible person Some people just need to have that kind of justification for good in their lives It makes them feel secure to think there is someone out there orchestrating their lives for them because it takes the pressure off of them relieves them of any responsibility for good or bad events  You dont say anything until you have moved out and are no longer dependent on them Even then you dont have to tell them Religion or lack there of is a personal thing You shouldnt feel pressured to tell them,0,cdm8pgw,1rdclj,atheism,hot,1.0,1

darklightsun,A  So what if there is a God  Personally if he should ever have the courage to show up Ill most likely punch him in the face and make him explain just why the fuck any of us should worship him after the way he treated usA  No it doesnt  Instead of laughing at them ask them to explain exactly god deserves credit for their hard work or actionA  That is a tough one  I personally have not believe since a very yourn age  I only attended church because I was a kid and that is what my parents wanted  As I got older I attended because of the friends I had in the church and the girls I was chasing  Finally after I could no longer that the bullshit of religion I just told my parent  My Dad accepts it but he is an off and on believer and has a habit of asking religious leaders hard questions  My Mom insists it is just a faze and I come back eventually  She is convinced that I went to church for so long because I was such a good Mormon  She just cant accept the fact that I was more interested int he Bishops daughters than anything the Bishop ever taught and the best place to see them was at the church their daddy drug them to  or  times a weekI hope you find a way to tell your parents and that they prove to be good people that can accept you for who you are and dont disown you for not being who they want you to be,0,cdmaotl,1rdclj,atheism,hot,1.0,1

JacksmackDave,I am familiar with this issue  I am  and my parents know I dont go to church anymore  I dont come out and say I dont believe the same things I did when I was younger because I respect people who want to keep their beliefs  I have experiences that make me question the biblical version of things but I also have experiences that to me confirm there is more to existence than random chance I suppose Im agnostic since I cant resolve my personal conflicts with the idea of a God that is perfect changing the rules to the game called life multiple times in the bible  I laugh to myself thinking the rules could be changed again once everyone is in heaven but no one sees that obvious possibility in Christianity But my advice is family is family  If the only reason you want to come out to them is to argue your egotistical point about how they are wrong you are going to cause more harm than good  If they ask you be honest but until you can prove them wrong that god didnt do things for them it will be a battle of opinions that neither of you can win and will just drive a spike into your relationship ,0,cdmdrp5,1rdclj,atheism,hot,1.0,1

ParadoxRocks, If there is a God who created you then he gave you the brain that you have and all that comes with it He gave you the ability to recognize and notice discrepancies and to rationally analyze information It would be cruel if he made you with these qualities and then punished you for using them Also as everyone has pointed out there have been tons of gods worshiped by people throughout history and plenty of them are still worshiped today The fact of the matter is that even if you forced yourself to ignore the problems in your faith and to recommit to Christianity you still would not have freed yourself from this question You didnt make the situation ridiculous and youre certainly not a bad person for noticing that it is One of my biggest personal grievances with religion is that a lot of religious people treat perception and intelligence like personal failings  None of us know your parents like you do so were not really qualified to help there Suffice it to say theres no soft way of saying it and no technique that will make them understand if they dont want to If you think that telling them would only bring misery to everyone involved then dont Definitely dont if youre still financially dependent on them we get horror stories on this sub every so often from young people who came out to their parents and got nothing but abuse for it,0,cdmeg41,1rdclj,atheism,hot,1.0,1

geeuurge, This is an argument for religiosity called Pascals Wager The idea is that if there is no God there is no benefit to being an atheist but if there is a God it pays to be religious The reason this is an unreasonable argument is that the consequences of gods existence literally have nothing to do with whether he actually exists or not Theres no real way to let this go you just have to believe what you think is right not what will net you the most afterlife  No But you probably shouldnt laugh about it to their faces Imagine how youd feel if someone did that to you when you were a devout Christian We all tell little lies as social niceties This is one of them If you dont find that a compelling reason bear in mind that ridiculing someone is probably the least successful way to get them to see your point of view  Dont tell them at least not yet Deconversion is not an easy ring to go through and you dont have to deal with being disowned at the same time Even if youre resolute in wanting to tell them wait until you are sure about your lack of belief and are comfortable with it before telling your parents ,0,cdmhqqa,1rdclj,atheism,hot,1.0,1

IronBear,  Pascals Wager is a false dicotomy  This youtube video outlines all the mistakes in ithttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvfZpJyUPwdU  Humor is a way of coping with pain amp loss  At the root of all humor you will usually find that someone has been hurt at least a little  Sometimes this pain is nothing more than making a silly mistake that wastes time or resources or mildly hurts your reputation with no lasting damage  But almost always there is some loss  So you mind instead of getting stuck in depression it just laughs and goes on  So I would say the fact you find humor in the situation means you are normal amp healthy  If you did not find at least a little humor I would worry you are suffering from depressionHow I would urge you to not make the mistake that ninterd does  Do not believe that just because you recognize the damage it makes you superior  Pride is very likely what keeps your family from recognizing their mistakes and escaping Christianity also  And someday your pride will make you make a keep repeating a mistake also  In the case of ninterd he comes off as an elitist and may actual alienate those he would like to help    I dont think you have to take on the burden of deconverting your parents  As far as I can see there are only two reasons you need to tell them  One is that you are trying to serve as an example of moral atheism in an attempt to deconvert them  Two is that their religious harassment is so burdensome on you that you need to tell them in order get them to let up on you  If one is your only reason to tell them then dont  If two is your reason to tell them then tell them as soon as you are no longer financial dependent on them,0,cdmoged,1rdclj,atheism,hot,1.0,1

shamdalar,Even though you seem to have plenty of responses I like answering these kinds of thingsgtWhat is the role of familyGood one Families are obviously most important for raising children and providing for their physical emotional and developmental needs In todays society where theres a lot of value placed on individual achievement I think successful families will instill values of thinking and acting independently while providing a physical and emotional safety net to fall back on when difficulties arise Outside of childhood I think the obligations of family only extend as far as the strength of the relationships that make them up If a family member repeatedly or severely mistreats you there is no obligation to continue a relationship with that person just because they are familygtIs the universe ordered or randomThere are obvious examples of both order and randomness at work in the universegtWhat is the meaning of lifeLife does not have a meaning in the way a sentence has a meaning since it arose through natural forces acting on random events see there is order and randomness again Our lives have meaning because we as thinking agents assign them meaning However this meaning cannot be a monolith since each of us has our own perspective I find meaning by concentrating on developing my strengths and creating good feeling in the people around megtIs truth subjective or objectivePretty obviously it is objective since truth is determined by comparing a statements meaning to reality Of course if one makes statements about subjective things such as favorite colors then the truth of those statements is in some sense subjective Furthermore since truth depends upon meaning if the meaning of the statement depends on subjective evaluations then the truth can be subjective as wellgtWhere does evil come fromTo the extent that evil is a thing say a disregard for the wellbeing of others to the point of taking intentional harmful action there are evolutionary reasons why these impulses still exist despite our best efforts to eliminate them Individuals can act evilly because greed and selfinterest have been successful strategies for propagating genes and groups can act evilly towards other groups because defending ones tribe against outsiders allowed the tribes gene pool to succeed collectivelygtThose kinds of questionsHow about this onegtWhat role if any does your atheism play in determining your worldviewIt plays a huge role by omission Theistic views tend to have a pretty oppressive effect on the formation of worldviews Its pretty hard to ignore something like a sky dictator when determining how you feel about things My atheism allows me to consider each issue according to its observable properties and find the answers best supported by evidence and reasoning When challenged by good arguments or new data my atheism allows me to throw out previous beliefs and adopt new ones that better suit the new informationId love to give follow up answers if you have more questions,0,cdmhzj6,1rdoty,atheism,hot,1.0,1

thorne,As an Atheist as well I know exactly how confounded people are by the fact that I participate in Christmas This answer may be kind of long but I want to go into why I participate in Christmas even though I fundamentally disagree with the idea of it Btw I want to use the phrase participate in xmas rather than celebrate xmas because although I celebrate the gifts friends and moments of Christmas I dont celebrate ChristFirst of all I want to criticize the Christian idea of Xmas Im sure long ago xmas started out as truly a Christian celebration of their messiah and to some or maybe even most it still is However it has since turned into an industry and an embedded AMERICAN tradition I can only speak for the US One example and I understand this example may be hard to make since almost all the US is Christian Hanukkah As xmas grew in to the huge commercial enterprise it has over the years a relatively insignificant Jewish holiday seems to have had undue importance placed on it to compete with the commercial enterprise of xmas Seemingly indicating that there is an underlying value to the holiday outside of its religious value That other value in my opinion is economic enterprise It ultimately is an enormous American economic enterprise that cant be ignored by other religious preferences within the population Its a time when large segments of the population dont have to work when bonuses are paid and an almost nationallyagreedupon time of year for a day off for lack of a better term The American economy nearly comes to a halt which makes Christmas too big to be ignored But if its too big to be ignored what should we do as Atheists Come up with an Atheistmas and try to apply some type of values to it when the rest of the country is doing something else that way more fun  You could try that and write your own xmastype holiday that takes place at the same time but assign your own traditions to it festivus I think most of us arent as bold as Frank Costanza though and were stuck celebrating an enterprise that has a religious origin but now is simply an American enterpriseAfter all that I want to say I agree with you I like all the festivities the music the gifts and everything that xmas brings I think its fun to celebrate the enterprise that is Christmas but I just exclude the religious elements of itThe last thing I want to say is a warning to Atheists who participate in xmas Like I said I feel xmas is an American industry that we choose to participate in but there is a danger in us participating We belittle the cause of Atheism by participating if we allow the Christian part of xmas appear to be the part of xmas that we participate in If we allow it to be seen by others in that light we seem to admit defeat to go along with the status quo rather than adhering to our beliefs The danger is that we appear to others to not be serious about our cause and lose the little bit of traction that we have in juxtaposition to Christianity in America So I dont feel its bad to participate just that we have to let others know why it is that we do participatetldr Christmas is an American Industry not necessarily a religious holiday   ,0,cdmeqbs,1rdpcq,atheism,hot,1.0,1

cumaboardladies,This is totally how I see myself and how I think people should think about these situations I have always brought this up to my friends and family and try to explain to them how I dont need a god or religion to tell me how to be a moral human being Morals are taught to you by your parents and these morals follow you into your adult life when these decisions have to be made The rules set by religions are basic rules all people should follow but you should follow these moral guidelines if you are religious or not,0,cdmgws6,1re0hp,atheism,hot,2.0,2

gaseousshroud,Is it that any belief in a god is inherently a direct correlation to their moral values Cant one believe in god and dismiss the idea of a value judgment Whatever entity that is god isopinion I dont believe it to have any influence on my life directly or my choices I choose to do what I want and because this I realize that my choices are my own and that is what is makes them so much more important Part of that idea is presented here but I wanted to point out that while there are many people who assume that religion equals morals there are many of us who dont hold on to god as an something they personify in their actions The idea of a god can be without this contrast I enjoy this subreddit because it is a discussion away from any dogmas or rituals that most religions are struck from Especially because i believe organized religion to be a forced interpretation of what ones own personal existence is But i want to believe that my own interpretation of the universe is my connection to whatever my idea of god is By cutting things black and white we begin to loose the discussion of what makes us US Which is why i think identifying how human beings exist intrinsically is the root to determining our way of thinking and comprehension There needs to be a discussion and it may have not been this particular post that made me post this but I felt I needed to say this,0,cdmgbut,1re0hp,atheism,hot,1.0,1

CirclesforInfinity,I came out to my parents and inlaws in a letter format My wife to be and myself ran into a roadblock with the priest that was to marry us when I started asking questions about leaving the mention of God out of my portion of the vows It was important to me that I not vow something that I didnt intend to hold up and live by and I didnt want to lie to the church by vowing certain things before God More importantly this priest was my god father and was full aware where my journey of faith had taken me over the years and that I had become an atheist as a result Instead it was his way or the highway so we elected to take the highway As such we needed to break the news to our families about what had transpired so I printed out the email exchanges that we had had with him and presented them to the parents Of course they were able to connect the dots and soon became aware of my doubts and rejection of faith and belief in the supernatural It was a tough pill to swallow for my parents and my inlaws absolutely freaked out and wanted to stop the marriage proceedings After my parents talked sense into them the wedding went off without a hitch My inlaws still take issue with my lack of faith but that is an entire different story and long post My parents on the other hand started asking me questions Long story short both of my parents have quite a bit of doubt and continue to be interested in where I am and what my thoughts are regarding certain issues They both read many thoughts and links that I post and expand and challenge their own comfort zone with faith In fact they both recently admitted to me that the only thing that keeps them involved in the church is the sense of community and family that it offers They pretty much admit that nothing in the text makes sense and that science is a far better explanation for things than magicTLDR By coming out as an atheist my parents have challenged their own upbringing and beliefs They now embrace doubt and pretty much reject the teachings of the church,0,cdmoqm4,1re4b2,atheism,hot,1.0,1
LordTourettes,The way my dad responded he came across as completely understanding  Granted he helped me come to my conclusion of secularism intentional or not I found myself asking him how he could believe with no evidence why he didnt come across as very religious like my mother just questions of someone breaking through my indoctrination He always said he was quietly religious and I should think for myself on these topics and not use other peoples answers as my own My mom acted stunned then just left it for a while Couple months later she brings up grandchildren and marriage very casually and it ended in a full blown argument over baptism and secular marriage She was losing her mind I wasnt going to baptise my children or be married by a priest and it pretty much ended with her being too mad at me to keep going It doesnt really affect our relationship but we dont talk about that kind of thing anymore,0,cdmqzl5,1re4b2,atheism,hot,1.0,1

jams,YESI once thought I was dead and that I was experiencing the afterlife It was fascinatingI was skiing in the Symphony Bowl I think It was a decade ago at Whistler solo and there were some cliff zones under the chair One of them looked promising I couldnt tell you just how tall it was now  taller than the trees anyway but it couldve been anywhere from  to  Anyway I wanted to jump it When I came down and passed under two ropes and past lines of signs signaling a cliff area and a ski area boundary I wound up at the top of the cliff and learned that there wasnt a good launch No space to start with speed and no lip to hop from because the slope just curved to vertical and the rocks below protruded I elected to do a quick turn and go out the side but I was on the steeps and knocked loose the crust under me I went over the side with a very small avalanche of my own making missed the rocks and trees on the way down landed mostly upright with one ski missing  it was stuck at the top of the cliff somehow but promptly lost it yardsaled and tumbled to a stop some hundred feet laterI was buried shallowly with a decent air pocket in front of me and I was hyped on adrenaline and endorphin No injuries  nothing hurt and I felt amazing Also I was comfortably warm After I wiggled my hands and feet I leapt to the conclusion that having just gone through an avalanche and off a cliff apparently unscathed I was very clearly dead  This posed lots of interesting questions for me as I had assumed there was no afterlife It was comfortable but dark and boring so I first wondered if there was any merit to the idea of purgatory which is where I imagine honestly that I would probably go if the myths were substantially accurate having never really done anything bad nor particularly good for that matterMy next thought was that I was actually dying not dead and experiencing timedilation from some kind of neurochemical bonanza in my damaged brainMy next thought was that if I were dead or even if I were just euphoric and trapped in a dying brain that I might be able to either experience or imagine something better than cozy warm darkness I thought I would start by trying to fly So I jumpedI jumped out of the snow  I was under the chairlift at the bottom of a bigass cliff  People started applauding noisilyI got so drunk that night that I almost died again ,1,cdmhey4,1relo7,atheism,hot,7.0,6

jmsr,Here now while my first reaction is like everyone else just move out its possible that OP lives in a culture in which the children stay at home until they marry  Now as someone who was raised in north america i know how weird that sounds but ive met multiple people classmates coworkers etc who are the children of first generation immigrants and currently live at home even though theyre freaking  goddamn years old and what the hell rightIn my culture im canadian we expect children to move out at  and make their own way in the world because living on your own teaches independence and maturity and we view people who stay at home as being either weird or immature or suffering significant misfortune like being longterm unemployed However one of my coworkers once explained to me that her culture has the opposite view and basically views parents that kick their children out as abandoning them  Whats more this is the standard model of child rearing throughout the majority of the world  In other words posters have to remember that the north american tradition of moving out at  is unusual and simply moving out may not be an option for the OPTherefore it is incumbent on us to try to think of suggestions for the OP to deal with this situation without belittling himher or saying just move out because that may not be an option for many reasonsIN THAT SPIRIT i would suggest to OP that she tell her mom that she is  years old and that because she is an adult now taking her belongings is technically theft a criminal offense  Further  adults are guaranteed freedom of association and can choose to associate with anyone they want and avoid anyone they choose  As a fellow adult her mom no longer has power over her only influence like freedom of speech though you dont have to listen  THAT SAID perhaps OP can contribute to the household as an adult would say by paying rent  What would mum think of thatIn any case good luck and feel free to vent here anytime jmsr,1,cdmvpsq,1rfcif,atheism,hot,3.0,2

alwaysmispellsword,The appeal to authority is not actually a fallacy in formal debate   It is not deductive reason but the fallacy as used in formal debate only ocurs with a false authority  The logic is sound that a real expert might understand nuances that are hard to grasp for someone not versed in the field therefor appealing to one WHO does understand the nuance is not fallacious  Also loaded question isnt a fallacy either its just bad debating   A question is not a logical appeal and therefor cannot be fallaciousMeanwhile you are missing half the appeal fallacies but cherry picked a few   You could have grouped them all as Irrelevant appeals but if you are going to list some separately list them allAlso missing as examples and not a comprehensive list Cum Hoc fallacy seriously your thing missed perhaps the most used fallacy and affirming the consequentA better list with better explanation of each can be found herehttpwwwlogicalfallaciesinfo,6,cdmvkv6,1rfws4,atheism,hot,13.0,7

AgentSmith,Ive always had a problem with the burden of proof fallacy since it is probably the most fallaciously used fallacy  I think it would be more accurate to say that if people are to believe your position you should put some work into supporting it with facts and logicIt is too often the case that people end up arguing over who is making the claim when the fact is that both sides are making some sorts of claims  In these cases no one is supposed to get an automatic pass and avoid supporting your argumentScience knows this quite well and everyone in the scientific community strives to support their hypothesis with as much hard data and provable facts as they can  For instance evolution has quite a lot of evidence behind it In a fair argument or debate you shouldnt be sidestepping your obligation to present the evidence  You should be presenting it in all its gloryHowever the fact of the matter is that its easier just to put the obligation on someone else  This also puts the other side on the defensive and makes the argument easier to win  Its a good tactic but its often labelled correctly as a disingenuous argument by the other side  If the person asserts X is true they have to support it and if you are asserting Y or even if you are just asserting NOT X you have to support your argument to,0,cdn7gev,1rfws4,atheism,hot,1.0,1

BrianJ,uHastyUsernameChoice  I have a question Why is the fallacy appeal to authority a fallacy The Principle of Testimonial Arguments maintains that you should accept a testimonial argument that satisfies the following premises   It is true that the proposition is reasonable to believe   It is true that the proposer is sincere in saying that the proposition is true   It is true that the proposer is knowledgeable in the topic at hand I understand that you shouldnt accept someones argument based solely on the fact that they are an expert without first weighing the reasonability of the claim made and the sincerity of the proposer But this is what this poster states about the authority fallacy gtThe authority that such a person or institution holds does not have any intrinsic bearing upon whether their claims are true or notBut their authority does have an intrinsic bearing on how close to the Truth their claims might be Unless someone makes an unreasonable claim or seemingly has a reason to spread falsities shouldnt we accept testimony on the basis that someone is an expert Consider this Biology Professor A and your crazy uncle on Facebook B who cut a frog open in high school one time have two contradicting arguments A makes a sincere reasonable proposition regarding Biology B though crazy is sincere in refuting it and does so with an equally reasonable statement For the sake of my enlightenment lets pretend that you have absolutely zero knowledge of the topic at hand and therefore are not in a place to weigh the truth of the premises against each other All you know is that both A and B have presented identically reasonable arguments and neither have anything to lose or gain out from establishing their proposition as True Would it therefore be logically fallacious to accept As proposition as deductively or inductively stronger than Bs on the basis that A is a certified expert whereas B is not Because it seems to me that the fallacy of appealing to authority is not a fallacy at all In fact it seems like quite the opposite It seems like it would be logically fallacious to presume that someone who is a nonexpert on the given topic is as capable of proposing a True proposition about the topic as an expert of course with all other premises constant ,0,cdn8fwo,1rfws4,atheism,hot,1.0,1

churchstatelawyer,Standing is often tough in First Amendment religious clauses cases  It is also such a flexible doctrine especially with recent changes in taxpayer standing that it will often be used by courts to avoid having to rule in cases where it is very hard for them not to strike a proreligion law on the merits but they really dont want to  Such as maybe the parsonage exemption  To be fair as well this ruling isnt going to do anything  The injunction doesnt take effect until all the appeals are heard and I cannot see the government not appealing it  It was a great first step and a very well written opinion  How the Seventh Circuit handles it will be interesting to watch,0,cdmxblq,1rfyp3,atheism,hot,2.0,2

lordslag,Young SirI find your ability to genuinely question what youre being told to indicate your curiosity and intelligence that said please let me tell you some things about atheism and atheistsFirstly your teacher is lying to you about everything hes said about atheists  Whether thats intentional or not I cant say because I dont know the contents of his mind or whether or not he knows better  Keep in mind that almost all atheists were indoctrinated with religion as toddlers and children before we knew to question or seek answers for ourselves just like you were  And most of us were threatened with eternal torture for disagreeing with it most likely just like you were  We simply set out to find out what the truth was no matter where the evidence led us or what the consequences of that search would beRegarding morality and ethics we get those things from the same place that everyone does that is from the social instincts were all born with  The necessity to work together in a group to provide for our needs and defense against privation the elements and predators whether that be from animals or other groups of humans  It is very important to realize that religious people DO NOT get their morals from the bible or other holy books  No one stones people to death for working on the sabbath or not being a virgin on their wedding night or being a disobedient child or breaking certain commandments or worshiping other gods all of which is in the bible  Instead evolution equipped us with an inherent sense of right wrong and justice which we codify and adhere to in order to build civilizations we call this sense a conscience and even babies toddlers and animals exhibit it  The reason I bring up those three groups is that they cant possibly know about religion yet have a sense of right and wrong anyway proving my point  Most atheists that I know myself included subscribe to Secular Humanism as a moral framework and I wont belabor that subject here since google will provide you with plenty of resources on that subjectSo far as a soul is concerned no one has ever located one or presented any evidence that one exists  Add a little critical thinking on top of that lack of evidence and one must eschew belief in that concept unless and until better evidence is forthcomingRegarding his accusation that atheists just dont care about anything I think its obvious to you thats just bigoted drivel  We love our family and friends just as much as any other person we strive to be good people do good works for their own sake instead of in pursuit of divine reward feel the pain of sympathy when we see others suffering and enjoy candy music and sex just like any of our fellow humansIn closing please keep questioning everything around you and never accept anything that anyone tells you at face value  Demand they cite evidence in reality to prove what they claim  Search out more evidence for yourself to make sure youre not being lied to  Seek out the educated and wise outside your friends and family who are willing to speak with you because they will have nothing to gain by lying in order to manipulate youStrive seek findand never EVER yield young sir  Good luck on your journey and I can only promise two things about it It will NOT be easy and it will be TOTALLY worth itSincerelySlagTLDR Never believe anything without evidence to back it up  Keep questioning everything everyone tells you including your own instincts and conclusions  The journey will be VERY difficult and even more rewarding,6,cdn1q6j,1rgb8p,atheism,hot,21.0,15

guaboy,I want to share something with you as an Atheist person You are obviously very young and therefore interested in what is going on here These are my simple thoughts might help you or maybe not but I am going to shareEntering the churches and thy were Catholic ones since it is a culture in my country where I originate from as a very young guy I had noticed what it is all about It is about death and fear from it What is the most important part in the story of Jesus His death Yes we are a mortal beings and death is a big mystery that any church uses upon us The story of the sins is number  Combined those two stories in a form of the church dogma tells us we are guilty of something therefore we must dieChurch is about our fears That is why it is so successful Being an atheist and denying the sins and fear of dying does not mean rejecting the moral of the humanity On the contrary it is more awareness by accepting of what we are And there is a moral Jesus Christ wanted to formulate some thoughts here like dont do to the others what you do not want to be done to yourself Existent or not he said what every Atheist already knows there is a morale But some guys tell you that you should be paying for thisAre you afraid to die I am not I face my mortality equally like any characteristics that as a human being I have every day I know that my fellow humans have the same characteristics I do not need God to explain me that via some funny dressed guys That ask for money This is how it goes how it went for centuries What is good enough for my ancestors it is good for me And yes if you ask yourself for a higher sense of all of this I will tell you it is a joke There is no higher sense sense is in us dyingFurther reading all that Mark Twain ever wrote and especially Monty Pythons film The meaning of life Hell that is the one you are looking forGreetings,0,cdn2pbw,1rgb8p,atheism,hot,5.0,5
HermesTheMessenger,First off I would be glad to talk with your teacher privately  As I have talked with thelogians seminary students evangelicals and more than a few Catholic priests over the span of decades I think his objections to me cant be based on something as arbitrary as how old I am nor how informed and patient I may beSo please if it would not cause you any harm ask your teacher to make an account on Reddit and then click this httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetoHermesTheMessengerI await a cordial and even tempered discussion  not an argument  from themgt Atheists arent like us Catholics They dont know about the difference between right and wrong This struck a lot of us odd as we had just thought of Atheism as another religion people believed in Once he saw our blank looks he added on For example and Atheist would walk up to you and shoot you in the head Why silence Because Atheists dont care A few kids questioned him only to be silenced and we moved onTwo basic points If the Roman Catholic Church has a clear vision of morality a deep understanding then why is it infamous for protecting and shielding those who rape children  Didnt the Pope and the cardinals realize what even the most hardened criminals know  that abusing children is one of the worst crimes of humanity As for any atheist doing what the teacher accuses us of the teacher only needs to demonstrate that what they say is true  If they cant or wont then they have to retract the claim  Failure to do so is an indication that they are either lying andor a bigotgt What bothered me is that this class and his teachings have put me off of religion completelyTake a look at cultural anthropology  Religion is fascinating and as a cultural practice does indeed exist in tens of thousands of variations  I do not think it is a source of greater morality nor do I think that theism describes realityRelated Dr Robert Sapolskys lecture about Biological Underpinnings of ReligiosityhttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvWwAQqWUkpI,1,cdmz1a7,1rgb8p,atheism,hot,5.0,4

shamdalar,As you surmised your teacher is an ignorant jerk To address some specific pointsNo atheism is not just another religion A religion is a set of rites and beliefs associated to a supernatural powerNo an atheist is not going to walk up and shoot you in the head In fact atheists are statistically much less likely to commit crimes than religious peopleYes you might say many atheists have turned away from God those that were at some point theists but obviously we believe we have merely turned away from the concept of God Other atheists have never believed in God so obviously cant be said to have turned away from himFinally a lot of atheists care deeply about right and wrong I think its wrong to poison the minds of children against a whole group of people based on lies and ignorance I think its wrong to threaten eternal damnation for insignificant crimes I think its wrong to murder an innocent person and claim that somehow this murder balances out crimes committed by different people at different times My atheism is based on my evaluation of the evidence but the reasons I care about discussing it and defending it are all moral,2,cdn07cq,1rgb8p,atheism,hot,5.0,3

MxM,OK I am an atheist and for me it is strange that what people think what is morally right and wrong is simply because it is written in the book which is older than thousand years and parts of it are really old  thousands instead of trying to understand for yourself what is right and what is wrong It is also strange for me to think that something is moral and right because somebody told me so priest for example because priests are people and they can make mistakesNo for me right and wrong is result of my thinking about common interests about humanity You can read up on humanism which specifically deals with morals without reference to particular religion To me religion reflects moral values not dictates it Can I make mistake in understanding what is right and what is wrong Sure But I will make everything possible to avoid this by carefully thinking about it not just referring to the book and removing my responsibility from my decisionAlso those books bible if you are a christian contains lots of stuff of questionable morality slavery is OK inequity between people men and women etc which many people even if they call themselves Catholics reject WHAT DO THEY USE TO REJECT THOSE AS IMMORAL Critical thinking So we atheists use critical thinking and feelings to understand what is right and what is wrong Not an ancient textAlso a bit off topic but may be useful for you to understand where we atheists coming from atheism strictly speaking is not belief into absence of God but it is absence of believe into God For many of us there is just not enough evidence to support Gods existence in the way it is described in religious text For example personally for me while I can easily answer the question do you believe into God as no I can not answer the question do you think God exists Because it is meaningless question for me I do not know what God is Ask different peoplereligions you get different explanation of what gods isare Does god exist as it is described in the bible with creation of the world in  days including humans Very likely not since we know from our scientific achievements how the universe was developed and how humans evolve Can this universe be created by something Could be But even in this case how I distinguish just an alien civilization with power to create universes from God What makes God to be God and not advanced civilizationYou see I honestly can not answer the question Does God exist since the word God is just not defined It is meaningless for me I do not reject God I do not know what possibly God can be and I do not have blind faith that something that is called God exists  I just do not see need for that and I see lots of damage that can be done if people use blind faithIn shot we atheist do not reject God per say We reject blind faith and welcome rational thinking about everything including morals,2,cdmz7do,1rgb8p,atheism,hot,4.0,2

richertai,Atheists do care  They care about right and wrong  They have to justify it though  Its not just a because I said so justificationgtFor example an Atheist would walk up to you and shoot you in the head WhyBecause some people are sick in the head  You get this with religious people as well  Sometimes the crime can be tied directly to their religious instruction coupled with a sociopathic lack of empathy for others  Those parents that have been killing their kids because of some religious book on childrearing that have come up recently  They didnt care  At least they didnt care about the person  Any moron could see the damage being done but they believed that it had to be right  And whether or not they could justify it to themselves only indicates the level of mental problems they had  They did the damage of their own will  They killed children through negligence outright denial of necessary care or even violencePeople are capable of these things  Motivators like greed and doctrine seem to be the largest perpetrators  Greed can blind you to all others making you unfeeling  Doctrine can blind you but even those with eyes to see the damage are constantly being told and telling themselves that it is worth it  Because this life doesnt matter  They are striving for the next life so all things can be sacrificed on the altar of What We Think God Wants Based On This Book  And it IS a sacrifice of blood of knowledge of pain  This is my book  There are many like it but this one is MINEConfirmation provided me with no answers  I understood scripture better but no real answers to the real questions or mysteries  Occasionally theyd touch on the buzzwords of the day but those are the surface symptoms of deeper issuesThe best thing you can do as a believer is avoid religion  If the truth is manifest in the Bible then you dont need an establishment to interpret and spoonfeed it to you  Read that book from cover to cover  It will drastically change your outlook on what YOU believe and why  You will come across a great many things that you dont agree with  In times like that find out why you dont agree with it  It does help to talk to someone to get a different perspective on the story  Sometimes I genuinely didnt understand the moral of a parable  When I discussed it I understood the meaning more and then either agreed or disagreed with the moral being expounded  Either way it was me judging the book not the book shaping me  It is just a book and can be taken or left at your whim  But you owe it to yourself to understand why you take it or leave it  It tells you more about yourself than any religion ever could  If someone does not answer your question to your satisfaction then delve deeper  Find the source of your dissatisfaction and ask further questions  If they respond with anger or they try to brush it off then they dont know why they believe what they believe and are threatened by your questions  These people are not suitable leaders of any group  Do not look to them for guidance because they have no grounds to provide itFind your own answers and dont be afraid to question others  You will be more at peace about some things and more conflicted about others  This is good  Conflict exists in the presence of opposing forces  These forces are both within you  They are not external  They are not God or the Devil fighting over your soul  They are you trying to figure yourself outThere are external forces that will try to drive you into conflict with yourself and they are most manifest in religion  The pressure of doctrine and the sheeplike nature it fosters and requires is no way for a person to live  You are not yourself  You are what someone else is trying to make you  You will feel it inside  It will be a sense of unease or discomfort  Listen to that  Find out who is wrong and whyNever follow doctrine either political or religious or any other kind  Allowing yourself to be blindly led is no way to live,0,cdn6dw8,1rgb8p,atheism,hot,2.0,2

gbuuun,Well the most interesting point to me has been how religious people hate atheists more than other people of other religions If atheists have no morals then surely Muslims and Hindus have false morals If I were to believe that my god was the one true god and that everyone else had it wrong Id be more suspicious of people who fell for easytospot lies about a doctrine than people who didnt believe one way or another I was also raised Catholic except my church was fairly liberal and didnt really talk about hating anybody However I did ask a lot of questions that in hindsight were indicative of my growing skepticism and my questions were often suppressed or mocked as being incredibly stupid I feel my intellectual growth was heavily stunted during my most formative years due to constant rejection by others of what I thought to be common sense Im surprised and happy that some people were put off by this unfair attack From personal experience Catholicism in developed nations is like Christianity Lite Evolution is accepted nobody really follows the doctrines of birth control and nobody really believes in the Bible literally Because Catholic doctrines so rarely matter in real life Catholics end up falling into two general categories of indifference one believes its doctrines are true and accepts that while it cant be proved it cannot be disproved a lot of apologists are Catholic and the other cares so little that heshe can be dissuaded of the doctrines of the church much more easily than the standard Baptist for example Most people fall into the former and once you dont care to really apply yourself its easier to be nasty to a group of people that you were told are evil than to think for yourself I realized that Catholicism had absolutely nothing to do with morality when my mom said to me in high school that I had to confess my sin of not going to church one Sunday I was actually helping out by giving food to the homeless that day and it made me confused that doing some good in the world was still a form of sin Every confession Id have to come up with sins or make what I did seem even worse so I would have something to say Once you realize you dont have to feel guilty for just being alive or that telling your wrongdoings to a priest doesnt absolve you of your responsibilities to other people you begin to see a glimpse of what it truly means to be moral ,0,cdn95ho,1rgb8p,atheism,hot,2.0,2

xiipaoc,Interesting  Yesterday as I was shopping for dinner my grandmother called and asked what I am  Very surprising coming from her  What do you mean  You know are you Buddhist atheist what  Im Jewish  I really dont know why shed ask  I mean she knows this right  But what else  Nothing else  Im just Jewish  I thought you didnt believe in God  Doesnt that make you an atheist  Sure  Im a Jewish person who just doesnt believe that the guy exists  Ah well first night of Chanukah is Wednesday  At this point I kinda flipped out because I thought it was Thursday  The whole Thanksgivukkah thing right  I really thought it was Thursday  Nope Wednesday  Thursdays the first day not the first night  She was explaining how holidays start the night before  Honestly Im a little worried because I obviously know all this and I dont understand how she wouldnt know that I know  Maybe she didnt know  Still  She knows I go to synagogue  So it was a little strangeAnyway the point of that was that people dont understand what atheists are  Its all really simple actually atheists dont believe in gods  Thats it  They havent turned away from God necessarily  Some have  I used to believe in God when I was little  Then I realized that the guy doesnt actually exist  Did I turn away from God  I suppose  but the guy doesnt existDo atheists have souls  No we do not  Neither do Catholics for what its worthActually there was recently on ratheism a story of a Chasidic teaching it was an image of text presumably so that the OP could get karma for it so dont bother searching where the rebbe teaches that everything was created for a purpose and the talmid student asks why atheists were created  The rebbe answers that atheists are examples of goodness and action  When an atheist helps someone or gives charity he does it out of the goodness of his heart and not because God requires it of him since he doesnt believe that God exists to require it of him  Therefore the rebbe continues you must be an atheist when someone needs help  Dont say Ill pray to God that help comes say I will help  I dont know the origin of the story  If its actually Chasidic then it cant be that old Chasidim have only been around a few hundred years  But I think that captures what it means to be an atheist in terms of what your Conformation teacher was telling you  Good on you and your classmates that youre not conforming,0,cdnjlg9,1rgb8p,atheism,hot,1.0,1

mredding,gt Atheists arent like us Catholics They dont know about the difference between right and wrongPatently false I would call this an outright lie He knows better The idea that he could say this with a straight face is just astounding to me Hes saying it because hes tribal us vs them mentality In group vs out group Hes trying to protect his cultural identity and he identifies as Catholic as hes an older man and heavily invested And back in the day he was invested with a bit of force which has some strange side effectsAnyway INFANTS know the difference between right and wrong Too young to know language or even be capable of speaking physically and psychological tests show they know when theyve been cheated and they know when they see others cheated Behavior analysis shows they will treat the cheater differently indicating their awarenessNo one has to be taught murder or theft is wrong I didnt have to go to school for that Oh boy thanks Teach now that I know murder is Illegal Ill be sure to avoid it next time Just fucking absurdgt For example and Atheist would walk up to you and shoot you in the head Why silence Because Atheists dont care All the above applies Absurd Thinking feeling people dehumanized as Zombies Sociopaths statistical majority are police clergy and politicians What an asshole And the thought I find is disturbing Ill tell you the sort of person capable of saying this sort of generalization on a vague premise to a group is the sort of fellow I would never allow within range of my own childrengt A few kids questioned him only to be silenced and we moved onBecause thats all hes got He knows his position is indefensible so he uses a logical fallacy the appeal to authority his authority to establish he is correct Its a form of circular reasoninggt You cant really turn away from something you dont think existsYoure absolutely correctgt Again he turns down any arguing from a bunch of  year olds and moves onOnce again demonstrating his argument is indefensible and he doesnt want to sitck around and lose his ground for sure In making this kind of retreat from debate he has guaranteed he has lost all credibility And thats why youre here Hi Welcomegt They dont care about themselves or others or life in generalTo the contrary I recognize this is the only life were all going to get which makes the life we have the most precious thing we have It is the religious who believe in an afterlife who diminish the value of this life because living is just an inconvenient and temporary delay in their journey to eternal bliss Man if only such theists could only get to the afterlife faster And I know theists who feel this way and are utterly incapable of defending why they need to be alive or why they fear death Wouldnt death be the greatest and most celebrated thing Youre finally going to heaven Horay Finally Eternal blissSo why the hell do you care About anythinggt There I had said it I dont agree with what the Church teachesYou can be a theist and not Catholic You can be spiritual without theism or religion at all As Neal deGrasse Tyson said in a lecture of his when he looks through his telescope and contemplates the universe hes having the same feelings of Bigness as the theists do when they go to church and contemplate their gods He wants someone to scan his brain and that of a theist when feeling this way to see if the same parts of their heads light up because thats saying somethingAnd you can as we all do fill that need get that fix for the grandure of existence wherever you want to find it Ive sat in an autum forest in the mud and stared at a dried up creek bed and marveled at the majesty of reality and my perception of it I think about the transistors of my computer and the rising complexity of the machines and the code I write and marvel at these mini universes that I create I find the reality of the bleeding edge of discovery in physics that the universe has bends and pockets the relationship of space and time and its far better than any fantasy anyone has ever concocted except for Doctor Who Id totally love a TARDIS All these things make me feel big and special unique and important,0,cdnkyyb,1rgb8p,atheism,hot,1.0,1

MartinTheRound,Im an atheist by the definitions in the responses I would be a gnostic atheistFirst of all I have morals they come from social instinct as was said in other responses but I also have a simple logical selfinterested explanation rationalization really for my morals I live in this world I would like to live in a nicer world so Im trying to make the world a better place People have helped me without expecting anything and it made be feel good so I decided to return the favour and help people without any expectation Not to the same people usually I want to live in a world where people treat each other nicely so I treat people nicely My observation is that when you treat people with respect they tend to treat you the same way Simple self interest to rationalize my social instincts We could get into the biological underpinnings of the social instincts and I understand those as well Im sure you can do your googling or start a thread here and youll learn some If you start a thread Im sure youll get many responsesSecond consider you came here to a hangout place of these evil despicable atheists you declared yourself as different from us our natural enemy How were you treated Would we be treated in an equally welcoming manner in churches I kind of doubt itWe atheists are people too we have friends families and you dont hear about us making war on religious people We might make war on intolerance and stupidity but we dont take up arms and kill the ones we dont agree with we debate and try to convince people Christians do burn abortion clinics we dont burn churches or catholic soup kitchens Christians kill doctors we dont kill cardinals or pastors Muslims kill just about any kind of intellectual we dont kill mullahs I dont see how one can make such grandiose claims with no evidence to support it and tremendous amounts of evidence to the contrary Oh sorry I forgot its all based on faith My problem with that is that it promotes ignorance to a virtue Its notWe are people we see the majesty of the world around us the same way as believers do One of my favourite classical composition is religiously inspired I like some gospel songs but I dont like them BECAUSE they have a relationship to some deity I like them because of how they make me feel We sympathize and empathize We help our fellow man or woman and when we do we dont ask them for their church affiliations We dont pretend to have an authority about other peoples lives I mean we dont tell people whom they can or cant marry we dont tell people what god they should or shouldnt worship We do however take an exception to people using their faith to make other peoples lives worse We do take an exception to religious bigotry and intolerance But we dont try to dictate what you should or shouldnt believe As you might have noticedAnd most importantly atheists dont turn away from God singular specific we turn away from unsubstantiated and very often nonsensical claims about ALL gods equally yahew thor and shiva To be an atheist all you need to do is look around consider that there are many religions consider that they are mutually exclusive consider that not a single one of them as a better proof than any of the others and conclude logically that ONE youve just witnessed the evidence for human invention of beliefs in the supernatural TWO there is no indication that any one of them is less invented than any other THREE they are probably ALL invented and rid yourself of any obligation to live by outdated and unsupported standardsOh and your pastor might remember the judge not lest ye be judged And yes Ive read your book and some other books too In fact Ive faced christians muslims and buddhists that knew less about their own belief system than I didOn a personal note I think ie IMHO atheism takes more intellectual maturity but whatever makes you a happy person is worthwhile and as long as your relations with your fellow mortals are friendly I couldnt care less how you arrange your life But as a fellow human despite being a face shooting despicable atheist I sincerely wish you a happy lifePS on the other hand there is a specific situation in which I would happily shoot your face if you were a sexy lady   But I doubt the pastor had that kind of shooting in mind,0,cdo3kqk,1rgb8p,atheism,hot,1.0,1

ktreanor,The best analogy I ever heard to help explain evolution are how languages changeFrench Spanish Italian are all romance languages meaning they all use Latin as their base  Its easy to imagine how Latin eventual became these different languages  When the Roman Empire fell different areas separated by distance or geological barriers first started having distinct accents much like how Boston and New York City have very different accents  These accents continued to change to the point they became dialects using their own words grammar and pronunciation  Finally after enough time has passed these dialects become their own languages  This is how Latin morphed into Italian over a long period  What never happened was a Latin speaking mother gave birth to an Italian speaking childThats the keymuch like Latin changing into Italian by small shifts over a long period so has life changed by small small amounts over a long period to form all the species we see today,0,cdn3cjl,1rgjae,atheism,hot,3.0,3

EscherTheLizard,I have found it helpful in some cases to explain artificial selection firsthow different breeds of animals and plants are created through selective breeding Once your mother understands how artificial selection works then you would talk about how given enough time new breeds and species of organisms can evolve It will be important that you address common misconceptions of evolution particularly as they relate to human evolution For example we did not evolve from modern apes Modern apes and modern humans share a common ancestor We are very distant cousins just as are all the different dog breeds that now exist   ,0,cdn3eix,1rgjae,atheism,hot,2.0,2
warebec,Check out the book Finding Darwins God when you can It is by a theist and the first part is scientific but the second part is an attempt to reconcile evolution with Christianity It is a safe read for Christians because the author is a believer but I found the theological bits really weak this is the book that convinced me of evolution and was therefore the catalyst to my becoming an atheist I dont know of any particular rebuttal of those theological points but baby steps are probably smarter than trying to convince a creationist to read a book by a known antitheist because they likely cant accept it ,0,cdn4gd4,1rgjae,atheism,hot,2.0,2

MartinTheRound,Well perhaps first you should ask her how she understands evolution which is quite probably a flawed understanding Then you can work to correct her misunderstandingOne common misunderstanding is that evolution works on individuals another is that evolution works on entire species In reality it works on groups of individuals You take one species put them in two different environments theyll start diverging separatelyAnother common misunderstanding is about mutation rates many people assume mutations are either good or bad There are mutations that are inert and sometimes several inert mutations in combination will produce an effect So some mutations produce slow changes and others faster changesBut simply evolution is inevitable The logic is this mutations happen this is an observed fact confirmed both in laboratory experiments and in nature they produce change whether the changes are good or bad depends on the environment hot climate less fur cold climate more fur thus changes will produce effects over time Thus well see divergence of populations of organisms The longer the time the larger the effectsThis is of course a very simplified explanation Whole books can be and had been written on the topicMaybe you can start by watching some of the youtube videos recommended then watch some of them with her and asking her what she thinks about what was said and engaging in a debate and finding more information when requiredBut you should probably start by finding out what her notion of evolution is and go from there Good luck and keep posting on your progress,0,cdn9qg7,1rgjae,atheism,hot,2.0,2
SpHornet,The theory of evolution If traits are inherited by the next generation If there is variation in those traits If there is a selection pressure on one of those traitsThen Those traits selected for will be more abundant in the genepool each generation as long the selection continuesyou can show  by pointing out that kids look like their parents you can show  by pointing out that people look different except for identical twins you can explain  by explaining that genes are not passed on if they dont have kids and  follows pretty clear out of So in words if a  legged lizard has a higher chance of survival it will on average get more children you give your genes to your children so they will be  legged to all children  or none depending on the genetics but it does not matter that much if you look in detail Because those children have also  legs they to will have better survival and thus more children etc until all lizards of that species have  legs or  legs no longer give an advantage,0,cdnaxec,1rgjae,atheism,hot,2.0,2
Maanth,A lot of good links were already provided I didnt read any books on this yet but my first pick would be a dawkins book They are often recommended by biologists too And not for their atheist content but its evolutionary science  But I want to add something to  gt looked into different religions and evolution before she became JW and that it didnt make any sense to her  While the basics of evolution may be simple there are a lot of questions that come up that require more than just looking into it Some people dedicate their lifes on studying evolution And these people are atheists as well as christians Hindus muslims or whatever And they all also after YEARS of study come to the conclusion that evolution is true However only followers of abrahemic religions think that Yahwe created the world less than k years ago in  days and all species at once  There are many many scientific subjects where the knowledge was accumulated by serveral generations of people who spend a horrible amount of time to add bit by bit of it so today we can build stuff like computers You should well expect that you cannot sniff at it and immediately understand it  But you should expect that these lots of people coming from several religions studiying evolutionbiology are just right  ,0,cdnb0vs,1rgjae,atheism,hot,2.0,2
MartinTheRound,You say she looked at evolution and it didnt make sense to her Im not sure what exactly she missed butAsk her to compare the anatomy of mammals A comparison of skeletal structures of for example a mouse camel human bear tiger and a dolphin might show that either the creator has a severe lack of creativity or that there is a relationship between all of these animalsAsk her to have a look at the similarity of brain structures in mammals She will see the same or similar degree of similarity in general as with the skeletal structuresAsk her to consider that weve mapped the DNA of many animals including humans and we see that there is a similarity that matches the previous conclusions about evolution If humans were created separately from other animals you would expect no similarity Indeed if you assume separate creation of every animal you would expect no similarity between any animalsAsk her to consider that the HIV virus was originally infecting monkeys SIV but their bodies were close enough to ours that the virus could jump and evolve into a new virusAsk her to consider that actual evolution was observed in laboratory environment in bacteria and those experiments can be repeated but creation wasnt observed in laboratory conditions nor can in explain the diversity of life on this planet At least not according to the old jewish bibles story old testament Consider that according to this story the earth was depopulated by god and the only land animals and only humans to survive were on the same ship consider how big a ship would have to be just to house every species of spiders Consider that not many birds can sustain flight for  days so there would have to be a lot of space for birds And there are numerous snakes that wouldnt survive a flood Its neither credible nor verifiable And the evidence for evolution is both credible if you understand it and verifiable You might also tell her to look up the documentary hypothesis Its not about evolution at all its about the literary and historical analysis of the jewish bible aka old testament and it shows that the bible has been edited many christian religious scholars accept it in one form or another and to be sure there is disagreement about the details but not about the fact that whats known as the jewish bibleold testament is a composite work edited with an agenda Ask her to consider how after the great flood all the kangaroos ended up in one place and all the pandas somewhere else And most importantly if only Noah and his bunch survived who owed their existence to this god how come the Incas never heard about him And how from the same bunch of people we ended up with all black people in africa and india all white people in europe asian people in asia etc etc And the only people who ever heard about Noah were the people in the same neighborhood Ask her to consider whats more likely that people invented different gods in different places or that some forgot remembered their god and many others simultaneously forgot and invented new onesI dont know what mental process lead you to stop believing but you might ask her to consider that there are many religions some of which must be invented and wrong because they dont agree with each other So we have a proof that humans create religions or does god want to have a laugh at our expense So when choosing a religion ask her what standards would she apply if she didnt have her mind made up already Then ask her if those standards are fair and if her chosen religion passes them and every other religion fails Then ask her why you should not be allowed to make a choice based on such a comparison and conclude that since many must be invented and you cant see why any would be more true then all are probably invented and decide that living a life without the burden of pleasing a god that isnt willing to show himself in a clear an unambiguous fashionThis is not an explanation of evolution just some points that might undermine her certainty in the things she beliefs in and have been shown incorrect and maybe make her able to listen to an actual explanation Maybe The problem is that religions very often make sustained ignorance into a virtue,0,cdnc6im,1rgjae,atheism,hot,2.0,2
eritassisiht,I think the best way to really cut to the heart of it is to point out the difference between the evidence for small changes microevolution ltyes I know there is no real difference between micromacro just timegt and bigger differences like humans being related to apesThe kind of evidence for this is different  Not fruit flies  While the fruit fly stuff is real it just isnt very impressive to most peopleStuff like pseudogenes endogenous retroviruses the fusion of human chromosome These may sound too indepth but they are the best ways of proving that even vastly different animals including us are relatedI have an analogy that helps explain one of the things I mentioned pseudogenesA judge is hearing a case where the defendant is being accused of copying information for their atlas from the plaintiffs copyrighted atlasIf there was only similar information in the defendants atlas there wouldnt be much of a case this is analogous to the defense creationists use to explain similarities between different species  Such as Well a Creator would use similar genes for similar needs of the animalBut what if there were typos in the plaintiffs atlas  If the defendant really did copy directly from the plaintiff and not just research the same information then the same typos would appear in the same places as the plaintiffsThe same scenario is written in our genes  One example is the loss of the ability to produce vitamin CgtVestigial characters should also be found at the molecular level Humans do not have the capability to synthesize ascorbic acid otherwise known as Vitamin C and the unfortunate consequence can be the nutritional deficiency called scurvy However the predicted ancestors of humans had this function as do most other animals except primates and guinea pigs Therefore we predict that humans other primates and guinea pigs should carry evidence of this lost function as a molecular vestigial character nota bene this very prediction was explicitly made by Nishikimi and others and was the impetus for the research detailed below Nishikimi et al  Nishikimi et al gtConfirmationgtRecently the Lgulanoγlactone oxidase gene the gene required for Vitamin C synthesis was found in humans and guinea pigs Nishikimi et al  Nishikimi et al  It exists as a pseudogene present but incapable of functioning see prediction  for more about pseudogenes In fact since this was originally written the vitamin C pseudogene has been found in other primates exactly as predicted by evolutionary theory We now have the DNA sequences for this broken gene in chimpanzees orangutans and macaques Ohta and Nishikimi  And as predicted the malfunctioning human and chimpanzee pseudogenes are the most similar followed by the human and orangutan genes followed by the human and macaque genes precisely as predicted by evolutionary theory Furthermore all of these genes have accumulated mutations at the exact rate predicted the background rate of mutation for neutral DNA regions like pseudogenes Ohta and Nishikimi httpwwwtalkoriginsorgfaqscomdescsectionhtmlmolvestigesThese sorts of evidences are hard to ignore or dismiss  Unless they want to claim that God Jehovah designed our and other animals DNA like this on purpose  That would be a pretty deceptive God to worship though,0,cdnhhez,1rgjae,atheism,hot,1.0,1

MartinTheRound,A few more things to considerThe question of our existence can be separated into four different areas of study The emergence of the universe the big bang theory the formation of galaxies cosmology the emergence of life from non living matter abiogenesis the emergence of more complex life from simple life evolutionThe religious answer to all of these questions is god did it which doesnt actually explain anything god did it doesnt give us any information where as investigating the chemical properties of life allows us to gain further knowledgeWe have good theories for each of these A theory in the scientific sense isnt the same as saying we have a definite answer But IMHO having a good answer is better than having an unsubstantiated claim no matter how definite it is especially if that claim doesnt help us in any wayFor example we know about Newtons laws for a long time and today we know they are inaccurate but they are accurate enough to build many of todays structures Some of our technology requires more accurate theories like quantum mechanics microelectornics or the theory of relativity GPS But others work with less precise theories that have since been falsified civil engineering hydraulicsA scientific theory is a hypothesis that explains the observations and makes testable predictions which can be verified A theory that makes more accurate predictions is better a theory that makes predictions that are contradicted by observations is said to be falsified But as I said a theory that has been falsified may still be useful if the error difference between its prediction and a superior theorys prediction is not significant in the specific circumstances and the inferior theory is easier to apply For example newtons laws of motion break down at speeds comparable to the speed of light and or distances great enough But for calculating automobiles we dont need the precision that wed get from using the theory of relativity Since the distances and speeds are way too small and the errors would be smaller than an atomIn terms of evolution the theory of evolution made predictions that were confirmed For example at the time of Darwin we didnt know about DNA and didnt have the capability to directly compare the DNA of various animals The theory of evolution predicted that animals that were considered related for example based on their skeletal anatomy would have more similar than animals that were considered less related Also the prediction was that all animals would share some DNA All of these have been confirmed The theory of evolution also predicted that if we perform an experiment well get a specific result which was confirmed The experiment was this we take the same bacterium we put it into sealed containers and we regularly add two kinds of food one of which would be edible by the bacterium the other wouldnt We would expect one or more of the jars to have at some later point a strand of bacterium that can digest the other kind of food And this was confirmed I may be oversimplifying the experiment but Im sure you can look it upHowever the so called theory of creation doesnt make any predictions that were confirmed The creationists dont make predictions Ive heard of But my interpretation of the theory would be that there wouldnt be any correspondence between us and any other animal since we were separately created But we see anatomical and genetic similarities between us and other animals So we cant be said to be separately created as some sort of crowning achievement which is what were supposed to be And if the creation theory is stated as intelligent design I would ask why an intelligent designer would give some creatures blind eyes And if were supposed to be the crowning achievement I would expect us to have UV and heat vision And what is the intelligent purpose of nipples on males of the species So by the standards of scientific inquiry creation and intelligent design are both uninformative useless and falsifiedIMHO science is better because it accepts and welcomes revisions As I said somewhere before when you successfully argue with religion you get a new denomination if you successfully argue with science you get better science   science is not the sum total of our knowledge its the method by which weve acquired the existing knowledge and by which we expand the knowledge further Engineering is how we apply the knowledge and marketing is how we make people pay for it  And religion is how we exploit gullible people scientology is an obvious example,0,cdo37ce,1rgjae,atheism,hot,1.0,1

taterbizkit,The existence of Africa is something thats reasonable to accept for two reasons Theres lots of evidence  It might not be firsthand evidence but theres a lot of it from a wide variety of sources  including realtime streaming video from space  The descriptions of it are consistent as well from a wide variety of sources and this is the big thing about knowledge that people just dont get The nonexistence of Africa that is falsification of the evidence of its existence wouldnt alter the nature of reality all that much  This means that its reasonable to provisionally accept the proposition as valid for all intents and purposes  Theres no real opportunity cost in accepting Africa as realIts the same argument that its reasonable to believe in wind your own brain or any of the other stupid you cant see it arguments Christians makeTheyre trying to create a false equivalence between brains air continents and you cant see god either  Theyre trying to rationalize their own faithBut go back to the two reasons why its reasonable to believe in Africa There is no evidence for god except for a the writings of ancient books b  a priori arguments like teleological cosmological ontological arguments  which dont really count as evidence since theyre not yknow evident and c subjective personal stories and claims of inner knowledge  There is no widespread consistency in how god is described and while you can go to Africa anytime you feel doubtful many people spend years trying to find god and never succeed The truth or falsity of the proposition has worldaltering implications   In fact its hard to think of any proposition that has a greater impact on the nature of reality  Science becomes meaningless when an inscrutable agency can alter reality at a whim  It is in no way reasonable to accept this as provisionally valid for any purpose  Thats not to say its untrue but the need for verification of a proposition like this completely overwhelms any value in accepting it without evidencetldr The two things are not remotely equivalent  Africa has high reliability and low opportunity cost  Faith in god has low reliability and very high opportunity cost,2,cdn8a9a,1rh877,atheism,hot,16.0,14

ShadoutRex,yes I have been there But even if you quote a place where I have not been to before I would take the place as existing provided I have seen it mentioned by a reputable source which provides other information which I have already confirmed with my own experiences  I have never been to Russia but the sources that detail the places which I have been with information that matches my own experiences also detail Russia I have spoken to people who once lived and even currently living in Russia There is plenty of evidence supporting the existence of Russia and it would require me to ignore all of that evidence to assert that it does not exist without any cause to say this What is more it is an ordinary claim that it exists There is nothing special stated about the existence of Russia that sets it aside from the existence of countries I have been to And finally if I had reason to doubt that it existed then I can easily enough go there to confirm it When I speak of going to Russia no one is trying to convince me that I will be happy staying where I am Truman Show style Instead I get encouragement While there is always the slightest possibility that it doesnt exist after all it is not a leap of faith into believing something extraordinary like a godYou might say the bible has verifiable true stories in it Sure Some of it is confirmed by other sources It also has a good deal of stuff that is contradicted by other sources and even itself But the more important point is that there is nothing in the bible that is both verifiable and as extraordinary as the existence of the god it asserts If I write on a piece of paper that one plus one equals two and then say that pink flying unicorns are living in my guest room then the first statement cant be used as reputation for the second statement being correct because they are at opposite ends of the ordinaryextraordinary claim spectrum,2,cdn8jbm,1rh877,atheism,hot,6.0,4

BeakOfTheFinch,P Z Meyers handles this question well explaining to  year old girl that asked were you there to a NASA tour guide showing moon rocksDear EmmaI read your account of seeing a  billion year old moon rock and how you asked the person displaying it Were you there the question that Ken Ham taught you to ask scientists Im glad you were asking questions  thats what scientists are supposed to do  but I have to explain to you that that wasnt a very good question and that Ken Ham is a poor teacher There are better questions you could have askedOne serious problem with the Were you there question is that it is not very sincere You knew the answer already You knew that woman had not been to the moon and you definitely knew that she had not been around to see the rock forming  billion years ago You knew the only answer she could give was no which is not very informativeAnother problem is that if we can only trust what we have seen with our own two eyes in our short lives then theres very little we can know at all You probably know that there are penguins in Antarctica and that the Civil War was fought in the s and that there are fish swimming deep in the ocean and you also believe that Jesus was crucified two thousand years ago but if I asked you Were you there about each of those facts youd also have to answer no to each one Does that mean they are all falseOf course not You know those things because you have other kinds of evidence There are photographs and movies of penguins and fish there are documents from the time of the Civil War as well as the fact that in many places you can still find old bullets and cannon balls buried in the ground from the time of the war and you have a book the Bible that tells stories about Jesus You have evidence other than that you personally witnessed somethingThis is important because we live in a big ol beautiful world far older than your  years and theres so much to learn about it  far more than youll ever be able to see for yourself Theres a gigantic universe beyond South Carolina and while you probably wont ever visit a distant star or go inside a cell there are instruments we can use to see farther and deeper than your eyes can go and there are books that describe all kinds of wonders Dont close yourself off to them simply because you werent thereId like to teach you a different easy question one that is far far more useful than Ken Hams silly Were you there The question you can always ask is How do you know thatRight away you should be able to see the difference You already knew the answer to the Were you there question but you dont know the answer to the How do you know that question That means the person answering it will tell you something you dont know and you will learn something new And that is the coolest thing everYou could have asked the lady at the exhibit How do you know that moon rock is  billion years old and she would have explained it to you Maybe you would disagree with her maybe youd think theres a better answer maybe youd still want to believe Ken Ham who is not a scientist but the important thing is that youd have learned why she thought the rock was that old and why scientists have said that it is that old and how they worked out the age even if they werent there And youd be a little bit more knowledgeable todayIll assume youre actually interested in knowing how they figured out the age of the rock so Ill try to explain it to youThe technique scientists use is called radiometric dating It uses the fact that some radioactive elements slowly fall apart turning into other elements For instance a radioactive isotope of potassium will decay over time into an isotope of another element argonOne way to think of it is that its like an hourglass You know how they work you start with all the sand in the top half of the hourglass and it slowly trickles into the bottom half If you see an hourglass with all the sand at the top and none at the bottom you know it was recently flipped over If you see one with half the sand in the top and half in the bottom you know its about halfway through the time it will run And if you look at how quickly the sand moves through the neck of the hourglass you could even figure out how long until it all runs outIn radiometric dating the scientists are looking at how far along all the radioactive potassium is in the process of turning into argon The amount of potassium is like the amount of sand in the top half of the hourglass while the amount of argon is like the amount in the bottom half By measuring the relative amounts of the two elements and by measuring how fast radioactive potassium turns into argon we can figure out how long its been since the rock solidifiedIt takes a very long time for the decay to occur It takes  and a quarter billion years for half the potassium to turn into argon When they measured those elements in the moon rocks they found that the radiometric hourglass had mostly run out so they knew that it was very very oldScientists doublecheck everything They also looked at other elements like how quickly uranium turns into lead or rubidium into strontium and they all agree on the date even though these are decay processes that run at different rates All the radiometric hourglasses theyve used give the same answer  billion years None of them say  yearsI think youre off to a great start  being brave enough to ask older people to explain themselves is exactly what you need to do to learn more and more and open up the whole new exciting world of science for yourself But that means you have to ask good questions to get good answers so that you will learn moreDont use Ken Hams bad question and most importantly dont pay attention to Ken Hams bad answers Theres a wealth of wonderful truths that reveal so much more about our universe out there and you do not want to close your eyes to them Maybe someday you could be a woman who does go to the moon and sees the rocks there or a geologist who sees how rocks erode and form here on earth or the biologist who observes life in exotic parts of the worldbut you wont achieve any of those things if you limit your mind to the dogma of Answers in GenesisBest wishes for future learningP Z MeyersSourcehttpscienceblogscompharynguladearemmab,2,cdncigl,1rh877,atheism,hot,4.0,2

HermesTheMessenger,Its solipsism not skepticism thats why it struck you as wrongThe best response to such nonsense is to turn it back on them and then start asking them the same basic questions about their own claims including their religious notions and where everyone goes when they arent in line of sight  Do they just vanish like a ball that is out of the sight of a babyNow chances are the person posing this is some form of presupposationalist  Presupposationalist Christians literally presuppose that some things are true as axioms such as Christian dogmatic ideas often Young Earth Creationism and partial Biblical literalismSince they presuppose those as true when evidence comes up that contradicts those axioms they toss out that evidence and any conclusions from it as either unimportant or misunderstood  Note Having axioms is fine though usually reliable axioms are based on very narrow and focused ideas that are also up to be questioned and not complex structures such as religious dogmas that can never be questionedIf you want to see a real asshole pushing presupposational arguments just look up anything by Sye Bruggencate  Related to that A backup of Sye ten Bruggencates now deleted comment history from AMA selfatheismhttpwwwredditcomratheismcommentsurvqabackupofsyetenbruggencatesnowdeletedThats right  He did an AMA and then got pissed off and deleted the evidence that he was having his ass handed to himMore related mindtwisting nonsense along those lines     William Lane Craig apologistgt First of all I think that I would tell them that they need to understand the proper relationship between faith and reason And my view here is that the way I know that I know Christianity is true is first and foremost on the basis of the witness of the Holy Spirit in my heart And that this gives me a selfauthenticating means of knowing that Christianity is true whole apart from the evidence And therefore if in some historically contingent circumstances the evidence that I have available to me should turn against Christianity I dont think that that controverts the witness of the Holy Spirit In such a situation I should regard that as simply a result of the contingent circumstances that Im in and that if I were to pursue this with due diligence and with time I would discover that in fact the evidence if I could get the correct picture would support exactly what the witness of the Holy Spirit tells meSource William Lane Craig William Lane Craig  Dealing with Christian Doubt,0,cdndk07,1rh877,atheism,hot,3.0,3

Assgasket,And not only are they logically unsound as have been ably demonstrated herein but pretty much every one of his premises ie Nothing can be at once in both actuality and potentiality in the same respect or if a previous efficient cause does not exist neither does the thing that results has been scientifically disproven  quantum physics is odd stuff and on a very basic level in the universe things like causality and nothing can be in two states at once just go right out the window     ,0,cdnefbm,1rhvy1,atheism,hot,2.0,2
Hambone,okay the first argumentgt Our senses prove that some things are in motion grantedgt Things move when potential motion becomes actual motion grantedgt Only an actual motion can convert a potential motion into an actual motion This is a very Newtonian view of the world but alrightgt Nothing can be at once in both actuality and potentiality in the same respect ie if both actual and potential it is actual in one respect and potential in another the existence of the superposition of quantum states proves this assertion to be falsegt Therefore nothing can move itself not granted it is not possible for subatomic particles NOT to be moving the uncertainty principle means that it is physically impossible for any particles momentum to be zerogt Therefore each thing in motion is moved by something else whatever well grant it and get to the conclusiongt The sequence of motion cannot extend ad infinitum grantedgt Therefore it is necessary to arrive at a first mover put in motion by no other and this everyone understands to be God the existence of a first cause is obvious  causal chains cannot extend indefinitely because we know the age of the universe to be finite you cannot fit an infinite causal sequance into a finite universe ergo a first cause must be present this proof is only valid for proving the existence of some form of first cause It is not valid for proving the existence of a theistic godthe second proof is basically the same argument Okay we accept the need for there to be a first cause Again this argument fails to prove that first cause  god There is a nonsequitur involved It follows that there is a first cause It does NOT follow that said first cause must be a theistic godThe third proof is debunked by the existence of evolutionary forces In a universe in which things can evolve there is no need for there to be a sentient agent at all timesthe very first premise of the fourth proof isgt There is a gradation to be found in things some are better or worse than othersThis is not granted A big stone is not better than a small stone nor is up better than down humans are not better than mice we are simply different Any evaluation of a thing as being better than something else is a purely subjective one and prejudiced a hotter star is not a better star it is simply a hotter star The first premise is completely flawed I reject it outright and with it all subsequent reasoningThe fifth proof is similarly flawed from the outsetgt We see that natural bodies work toward some goal and do not do so by chance This is the teleological argument What is the goal of a mountain Or of an asteroid What is the goal of a comet orbiting a distant star in a system containing no worlds with any form of life What is the goal of a quasar billions of light years away What is the goal of a hydrogen atom lost in intergalactic space What is the goal of water or of solar flaresClouds are not for raining they dont have the goal of raining to water crops The fact that clouds DO rain and that crops are watered as a result can be explained as an emergent phenomenon of natural forces without having to invoke the notion that this was the clouds objectiveAquinas was ignorant to the possibility that natural forces can play out in a sequential nonrandom way without the need for conscious direction An arrow fired from a bow does not fly because the human wishes it  the human is instead exploiting an emergent property of the laws of physics Aquinas has the relationship between action and intent backwards  humans do not cause the phenomenon they exploit it,0,cdni317,1rhvy1,atheism,hot,2.0,2

kzielinski,Firstly all Im seeing is the same thing repeated five times And it all goes to their must be a first cause  However we have good evidence today that causality does not apply at the quantum level Things happen without any cause all the time Assuming some variant of big bang cosmology the entire universe was once so small  that quantum effects dominated Anything before that could take place a causally All that exists may well be a quantum fluctuation grown very large Then again even if Aquinas was correct this would still not prove the Christian god just some god ,0,cdnrmoq,1rhvy1,atheism,hot,1.0,1

KublaKhan,Although I was baptized a Catholic and most of my family are practicing Catholics I was pretty much raised as a Baptist  Considering that half of my mothers family are also Jehovas Witnesses and we had a few Presbyterian family members here and there I got a very accurate viewpoint of religion quite earlier than most other people  This actually helped to question doctrine and eventually wean me off of religion altogetheranother positive thing that was brought about thanks to being raised a Baptist is that my particular church was hugely into charity which was a real eye opener  the church would often have fundraising events for poor community members and for Christmas we would do food drives and collect toys for indigenous villages in Mexico  seeing firsthand the extent of poverty that these people lived in and the effects of this poverty on their culture really gave me insight on the issues that plague our society and honestly it was humbling  You can rationalize that poverty is bad and that marginalizing a huge section of society is wrong but you dont really feel that until you actually see it for yourself in person  For that I thank the church,0,cdniz66,1rhz5o,atheism,hot,1.0,1

JustHereForTheBacon,Which is another good reason to just keep your faith between you and your god  Aside from those who believe that they have to proselytize or perhaps physically pray in a certain way or at certain times all of which would create a potential workplace problem anyway keeping your beliefs to yourself shouldnt interfere with your ability to practice your faithThis is always the first thing I think of whenever someone talks about prayer being removed from someplace like schools or the workplace or government buildings  Not only is there no way to tell when someone is praying if theyre doing it silently there wouldnt be any way to stop themThis is separate from admonitions in faiths such as Christianity to keep prayer private and to avoid prideful displays  Posting your faith on social networks could certainly be interpreted that waytldr  No one cares one way or another about your faith when you keep it to yourself,0,cdng22t,1ri0g9,atheism,hot,3.0,3

KingHell,There is no agenda in Atheism There are no additional beliefs necessary beyond the belief that there is no god Thats it Simple An atheist is someone who does not believe in Gods We are not expected to endorse evolution though most do We do not support or oppose homosexuality We are not necessarily liberals We have no idea how the universe was created except that we dont see any evidence for it being at the command of a god We are open to any evidence that contradicts our beliefs So if Jehovah or Shiva or Allah or some other omnipotent supernatural entity comes thundering out of the sky tomorrow and makes himherself known well probably stop being atheists But we are guessing that based on the evidence so far thats not likely to happen We do not try to prove there is no god because we could not prove a negative  any more than you can prove that the spoof deity the Flying Spaghetti Monster doesnt exist The burden of proof lies with the people making the extraordinary claims So when someone witnesses to me and says My God is great I say Show me the evidence and Ill believe you There is no actual evidence in the Bible or Quran There is very little outside evidence that corroborates them either A Christian or a Muslim is  percent as much an atheist as I am We agree that almost every religion on the planet and there have been thousands through history is bogus False Made up Anyone who believes such things is deluded or deceived by the devil or hoodwinked by Kali Atheists just take it that logical step further and include one more religion to the bogus list yours,0,cdnl3kp,1ribel,atheism,hot,3.0,3

Ihavemyownpizzaoven,The new pope is a great example of what Nietzsche talked about in The AntichristA criticism of the Christian concept of God leads inevitably to the same conclusion A nation that still believes in itself holds fast to its own god In him it does honour to the conditions which enable it to survive to its virtuesit projects its joy in itself its feeling of power into a being to whom one may offer thanks He who is rich will give of his riches a proud people need a god to whom they can make sacrifices Religion within these limits is a form of gratitude A man is grateful for his own existence to that end he needs a godSuch a god must be able to work both benefits and injuries he must be able to play either friend or foehe is wondered at for the good he does as well as for the evil he does But the castration against all nature of such a god making him a god of goodness alone would be contrary to human inclination Mankind has just as much need for an evil god as for a good god it doesnt have to thank mere tolerance and humanitarianism for its own existence What would be the value of a god who knew nothing of anger revenge envy scorn cunning violence who had perhaps never experienced the rapturous ardeurs of victory and of destruction No one would understand such a god why should any one want himTrue enough when a nation is on the downward path when it feels itsbelief in its own future its hope of freedom slipping from it when it begins to see submission as a first necessity and the virtues of submission as measures of self preservation then it must overhaul its god He then becomes a hypocrite timorous and demure he counsels peace of soul hatenomore leniency love of friend and foe He moralizes endlessly he creeps into every private virtue he becomes the god of every man he becomes a private citizen a cosmopolitan Formerly he represented a people the strength of a people everything aggressive and thirsty for power in the soul of a people now he is simply the good god The truth is that there is no other alternative for gods either they are the will to powerin which case they are national godsor incapacity for powerin which case they have to be goodTLDR Once people no longer need a god that wars and kills for a specific people to stay relevant their god turns into a loving god for the whole world ,8,cdno6v5,1ricbk,atheism,hot,19.0,11

BuccaneerRex,I dont understand the concept of spirituality It seems to be just a catchall term for whatever emotional woo someone wants to attach to some experienceSome people say its a sense of connection some say its a feeling of peace or awe or some such other emotion I always wonder why you dont just call it thatI dont believe in spirits but I recognize that humans have emotional needs and often make mental connections between the emotions an event evokes and the event itself such that they feel like they can recapture the emotion if they replicate the event Hence ritual and ceremonyI consider spirituality to be an ignorant response to otherwise perfectly explicable emotional triggers Yes we all feel awe when we look up in to the night sky its an atavistic human response I just dont ascribe any more significance to that emotion than I do to any other To me spirituality is just a way to make ordinary emotions mystical and special and a very human way to make yet another us vs them division as in those who are spiritual and those who arent,0,cdntyf1,1rj3y6,atheism,hot,4.0,4

YourFairyGodmother,Whattabunchadicks  As you can see many of the regulars around here get real tetchy about spiritualism  They dont recognize that spirit has many meanings most of them having nothing to do with supernatural shit or new age woo I suppose its precisely because the word is so often asscoiated with new age woo that the young folks here have such a marked antipathy Spirituality is to me ones state of mind and emotions Attitude perceptivity mindfulness  Sense of wonder awe mystery  Awareness and respect of the natural world and ones place in it Sense of connectedness meditative restfulness etc etc etc   Calling that stuff collectively spirituality makes perfect sense to me  And certainly easier than listing all those things out  Buddhism  the brand where there are no gods not the highly supernaturalificated versions  is prety much spirituality in a nutshell  ,2,cdnum4n,1rj3y6,atheism,hot,2.0,0

Jimmytheloch,Same thing happened to me I got forced into confirmation and never believed in God  My advice would be just to go through with it since it means nothing anyways and it saves the endless arguments  But the main reason is because after the confirmation theres usually a party where the family showers you with gifts and  relatives could probably give you quite the amount So just do it for the money basically,3,cdns5y2,1rj4wz,atheism,hot,28.0,25

Anyextremeisbad,Ye me and my entire family grandparents included are atheists We still do stuff like go to church on the day of christmas and get confirmated If you dont believe in God in a religious family that must be tough Seeing as youre only  you might want to be reminded by this Theres a difference between religion and tradition Some of the traditions come from religion but they are done for a different purpose I dont agree with or enjoy most of the traditions my family has but i join in to be respectfull because of all they have given me Some things you should just join in on to be respectfull and others you shouldnt because they are a waste of time for people that dont believe in anything For example If your parents told you to go to church every sunday then that would be something to fight against because its a weekly thing and would probably be quite annoying Being rebellious as a teen is important to become independent later but try to pick your battles Wish you the best of luck in the future from Norway ,2,cdnsfmu,1rj4wz,atheism,hot,6.0,4

BuccaneerRex,First off you cant exactly be forced to do it You can be forced to attend the classes and to go to the ceremony but if you tell the priest you are being forced under threat to participate he probably wont do it Youre supposed to enter into the thing of your own free willAs to what you label yourself dont worry about it One of the things about being an atheist is that all you have to do is not accept the existence of a deity as claimed by others Some people around here have really strong feelings about labels but theyre just adding on their own baggage The standard advice for young atheists who are still under their parents control is to keep your mouth shut If the natives rub blue mud into their belly buttons you go right along and rub that mudTheres no such thing as magic and there isnt a god listening so there is no reason to not participate if it saves you trouble Let them cast their silly little magic spells and just go along with it At your first opportunity you can walk away as long as you can support yourself,2,cdntsdw,1rj4wz,atheism,hot,6.0,4

Redpoint,As a strong atheist I have to say you need to tread carefully as to why you think people are religious  My experience shows that intelligence is not a key factor  The main reason people stay religious is that they are no willing to change  Humans are habitual by nature and we hate change  Religious people use religion as means to justify their current lifestyle They have been indoctrinate to think that their religion guides their lifestyle however the reality is the opposite their lifestyle guides their religion    So it depends on how you get a long with your family which will determine how you see them  I love my family so when I became an atheist I saw them not as stupid or crazy I saw them as indoctrinated victims of a cult that they had not say in it  That is all they knew that is how they grew up I could not fault them for that  So I made it my duty to free them it took  years of energy and patience but I did it   Im not saying you need to do this but just think about it a little more than just thinking why would they believe in such crazy stories if they are intelligent   If intelligence were the determining factor then I would have by now been a nobel prize winning scientist   And only scientists would be atheists we know that is not true,0,cdnytl9,1rjpjk,atheism,hot,2.0,2

Suiteup,Just imagine  years from now the Sunday assembly is a massive tax exempt community Billions of individuals from all over attend the Sunday assemblies in their communities All religions have been abolished and the current generation are all raised without believing in the supernatural Most everyone attends the Sunday assembly and the head speaker the  class   grand dragon heads the assembly with words to inspire and preach good behaviour for the sake of being good to one another A collection plate is passed around and members donate to the causeEnter Timmy Timmy doesnt go to the Sunday assembly he doesnt see the point Timmy believes he can be a good person without attending and chooses to spend his Sundays reading or playing Ps games Because of this Timmys friends are weary of him How can you be a good person if you dont attend the assembly Wheres your moral compass I know right from wrong Timmy replies but his friends are still skeptical of him How can we trust Timmy hes an unattendee they think to themselves As Timmy grows older more people come to learn of his being an unattendee I just dont understand why you arent you an attendee Where did I go wrong Timmys mother wails Its okay honey hell come to attend sometime he just needs to figure it out on his own youll see Says Timmys dad watching his son slam the bedroom door behind him in anger Timmys girlfriend has been reconsidering attending the Sunday assembly but still she holds firm that she must But Timmy my dad is very strict about attendee values if he ever found out you were an unattendee I think hed stop talking to me I just dont see the point I know how to be a good person without attending the events look just the other day I helped an old lady with her groceries isnt there more merit in doing good things without having it drilled into you at the Sunday assembly You know doing good without being told you mustI just dont think I can be with a unattendee Im sorry As the years go by more happens to Timmy at his job everyone is an attendee and they preach about the values they learnt at the Sunday assembly it makes Timmys blood boil that they should think theyre so superior to him he finally snaps and starts talking to them about how unecessary it is to attend the Sunday assembly and how moral are obtained through empathy and not the teachings of some mega corporation Why are unattendees so angry all the time Im being persecuted for my moral standing his coworkers sayHe is promptly called into his Bosss office and dismissed Timmy puts it down to his difference of opinion and it causes his anger to growLater while surfing the web on his Virtual Reality Pro Timmy stumbles across a reddit board by accident runattendant Immediately he is taken in by all the posts pertaining to other unattendees who have been persecuted pushed around and dismissed from their families SOs and workplaces for their difference of opinion He smiles and feels at home with others just like him Now he has something to look forward to every day with new posts different stories and like minded individuals who share his stance on relig er The Sunday assembly,0,cdo3is5,1rju35,atheism,hot,2.0,2
ca,I think it is a fine ideaI do attend a UU church as an atheist and enjoy it Many of their sermons come down to two big issues relationship and community two things missing in the very individualistic atheist worldI can see why Atheist Assemblies would appeal to some for those two reasons alone I would go if there were one near me I like the UUs but I dont really care for the religious aspectsI think a good question is Why do people attend churchOf course the religious go to worship andor praise God and to seek eternal life But there are other reasons as well to show gratitude and reverence to belong to a communityAtheists humanists agnostics skeptics the spiritual but not religious and even some Christians who dont fit in with the various flavors of Christianity available in their neighborhoods might like to place and time to meet up Sundays are the traditional time we have done that here in the US so Sunday it isMany people attend church less for the religious aspects and more out of habit for family sometimes to hide their nonbeliefBut having a secular place where like or even unlike minded folks can discuss the big ticket issues in life such as why are we here and where are we going seek fellowship celebrate good fortunes and losses and garner a sense of support and belonging to engage with others politically and morally to express gratitude andor reverence for this awesome life we have and to discuss and ponder what it means to be human and consider our obligations to each other well that just cant be a bad idea for those interestedSomeone said life is not an individual proposition  Sunday Assemblies would be a good place to connect with others For many of the nonreligious it would be nice to have a group to belong to that doesnt involve fake stuff or faking stuff,0,cdo45cr,1rju35,atheism,hot,2.0,2

MisanthropicScott,Whose death is a good question that should not be ignoredWhen dealing with the death of a loved one there are three possibilities The person died after a long bout of suffering Having seen upcloseandpersonal that there are indeed fates worth than death death can sometimes be a relief Imagine quality of life as a scale from  to  where  is perfect health and  is death hence not part of the quality of life Quality of life can actually go negative This is when life is worse than death In such cases death is an improvement in condition Read the lyrics to the theme from MASH which were never played on the TV show Theyre quite uplifting and comforting for those of us who have seen worse than death An untimely death These are the worst deaths with which we sometimes must deal There is precious little comfort to be had from religion or nonreligion in such times Family members of mine have lost faith at times like these All one can do is cling to the loved ones who are still with us and grieve together I dont have any great advice here However I can say that religion in such times is actually downright scary Were I to have religion at this point Id be thinking that some god or other actively had it in for me and my family Id be looking over my shoulder wondering what was coming next In a better place With the sick god who just took my loved one from me Thats not a better place Thats worse Someone who goes peacefully at an appropriate time There are times when someone has not suffered unduly has never had their quality of life go negative and simply dies preferably in their sleep Here I would grieve the loss of life of course And yet I would honestly feel some hope that I might have the same opportunity when my time comesLastly there is ones own death Many people fear death and have trouble dealing with the fact that death means oblivion To me I just imagine the way that I felt before I was born or even conceived Why would I fear that As I was for the first  billion years of the universe so I shall be againI do not fear deathI do however fear fates worse than death My big fears are always about the road toward death and what it may entail near the end To that end I have made a living will I hope that my lawyer has correctly worded my living will to say the legal equivalent of If youre reading my living will pull the plugThe idea of having air pumped through the meat that used to be me for many months or until my money runs out is my own biggest fear I take comfort in the fact that as an insulin dependent diabetic I have a reasonably painless way out involving a very large dose of insulin far larger than the one that left Sunny von Bulow in a coma for  years Unfortunately this requires me to be conscious and in control at the timeBTW for atheists writing up advanced directives talk to your lawyer about the fact that hospitals need not honor them One extra bit of protection that may or may not help is to put in a clause that if you are ever taken to a hospital that will not honor your directives you wish to be moved to one that will as soon as possible This may help give your family some leverage to get you out of a Catholic or other religious hospital that believes in preserving life at all costsDeath is always a tough one I hope Ive given a bit of help Atheism will never give you the questionable benefit of being able to deny mortality On the upside it does make life more precious when you know that this life is all we have,0,cdo1w1n,1rk2ps,atheism,hot,3.0,3

genehil,My yearold mother passed away in March and sits in an urn within my TV cabinet awaiting scheduling by Arlington National Cemetery to be placed in a Columbarium Niche with my dad  I was with her when she took her last breath and to be honest my feelings at the time and even now are neutrality I havent grieved at all during or after her death Sure I miss her but Im happy we had loads and loads of time together for the past ten or so years and although we never discussed it formally Im pretty sure she felt a lot like me in that this was it the end of things instead of the beginning of a subsequent existence in some other manner Im glad shell be in Arlington next to my dad but I think thats all it is When its my time to go I will be at peace knowing I did my best to spread love cheer and happiness to all Ive met I dont welcome the end but at  I know its creeping ever nearer Many times a month I stop and say to myself I sure am going to miss this life But thats about the extent of my thought process  Like my mom Ive had a good ride and Im grateful to fate for providing it to me,0,cdo68iw,1rk2ps,atheism,hot,2.0,2
Scottland,Sometimes enough is enough already and death is a relief  Usually it means an end to pain  If someone dies at an advanced age then there is not as much cause for sadness  You may miss them but you both always knew they werent going to be around forever and that death is an important element to existence  If someone has an untimely death then it is tragic and the afterlife doesnt make it less so  The problem with finding comfort in the idea of the afterlife besides not being able to tell if there is such a thing is that you will still be without the people you want to be with  And if you do get reunited in heaven it will probably be with people whos absence youve come to terms with  Its the people you left on Earth that you want to be with  ,0,cdo1as2,1rk2ps,atheism,hot,1.0,1

gbuuun,As a former Catholic myself have you considered the fact that if evolution is true  and the Catholic Churchs official position is that it is  then there was no first human and therefore the entire part about original sin goes out the window making it so that there was no point in Jesus dying in the first place I could perhaps understand if you were something like a Southern Baptist but evolution just demolishes Catholicism without even needing to go further from the first and most important premiseTo answer your question however atheism is not a belief Atheism is a lack of active belief like notbowling is not a hobby There is a tendency for SOME atheists to take their cues from science or philosophy though this is is not a requirement to be an atheist Atheists do not exert that there is no god but that we have no reason to believe one exists Moral philosophy is quite difficult and reading Hume Hobbes Williams and a lot of contemporary philosophers shows that there is no consensus there However I do think that Sam Harris is spot on on the topic of how we should treat others we should treat others not the way wed like to be treated but how theyd like to be treated Harris doesnt say this exactly but I think this is the logical conclusion of what his argument must be If we lived in a universe with only two people and two types of resources rocks and paper and person A liked rocks and person B liked paper does it make sense for person A to give person B rocks If person A deprived person B of paper and gave person B rocks is this a moral society To be clear once more this is NOT what Harris says but an interpretation of the implications All people are different There are things that make us similar in many ways but people have different needs and preferences Some people like jelly donuts others like cream donuts some people like video games and others like books People are very often biased because they play the game of life in firstperson mode They each feel like the main character and quite often they feel that they are not only incapable of making mistakes but also incapable of not understanding what is good for every single person in the world Treat each person as an individual not the caricature of the person you think he is or want him to be ,0,cdo3y14,1rk4vw,atheism,hot,7.0,7

xrancorx,Ahh the muddy waters of ethics where even giving a dollar to a homeless man becomes a philosophical quagmireIs it a moral actionWhat if your intentions were to get a reward for donatingWhat if he will only use the dollar to fuel his crack addiction that is keeping him on the street in the first placeDoes the outcome matter or the intentionShould we be following some sort of hard and fast rule to guide our moral actions  Where would such rules come from anywaySince as atheists we lack a cohesive belief system our moral philosophies tend to be quite varied from person to person  Perhaps some believe that morality comes from whatever society you are born into or that there are sets of virtues that contribute most to human happiness and that your intentions to fulfill these duties is what counts  Other might say that we should somehow calculate the outcomes of our actions and choose those which contribute most to human happiness or at the least cause the least amount of suffering to find what is the right thing to doI think that since there are probably no gods that are giving us the hard and fast rules to live our lives by each of us is free to choose our morals and ethics in a profound way  The responsibility lies with each person to decide what is moral or not and there is really no objective standard by which to judge our actions we must each create our own to our best ability  In fact I would say that this is what every person on Earth does anyway consciously or unconsciouslyPersonally I like Kants idea that I should always treat other people as ends in themselves never as means to an end  As a caveat I must be very careful when we are choosing to act in somebody elses best interests because how can I know what their best interests are anyway  I need to think about the outcomes of my actions as well as my intentions because my intentions are reflections of who I am as a person  Above all I need to be willing to struggle with these moral questions and not rely on some outside force to give me hard and fast rules on what is right or wrong and how I should live my lifetldr people already make their own moral decisions without external influence so think about your actions and intentions and do your best live up to your own standards of morality,0,cdoa26m,1rk4vw,atheism,hot,2.0,2

Wingflier,Ive definitely rethought monogamy since I became an atheist For many years after I left Christianity the concept of monogamy never even occurred to me as potentially flawed It was only after I began to study the divorce rates of industrialized nations that I really began to notice that there was a problemTo me the question is whether monogamy actually produces the most happiness and success for the individuals There is also the question of children and what is most beneficial for them as well However as a person who has no plans on having children this is not a factor for me I recently read a study which seems to prove that unmarried couples are happier in general than married couples httpnewshealthcomlivingtogethermaybementallyhealthierthanmarriagestudyThere have also been societies in the past which did not put such a strong or mandatory emphasis on monogamous relationships and which were quite successful in spite of thatOne reason I despise the idea of monogamy in the st world is that nobody is truly monogamous anyway What we have is known in psychology as serial monogamy In other words were monogamous with one person until were tired of them or theyre tired of us and then we search for someone else to be monogamous with When you look at it from this perspective monogamy just seems ridiculous to me Ive seen so many examples of women men too who are extremely nice and caring to me and who I have daily conversations with until they get a boyfriend after which they disappear off the face of the Earth They will continue to avoid contact with me until that relationship with their new boyfriend ends after which they will come back into my life acting like nothing ever happened This wouldnt be that concerning if it had happened only once or twice but it has happened to me countless times In fact I think its a bigger part of our American cultureAs a person who studies and adheres to the Buddhist philosophy and as a person who is mastering in Psychology I think that jealousy and possessiveness are two of the worst characteristics any person can display especially when it comes to their mental and emotional health and the heath of the relationship While I also disagree with polygamy as I feel that it puts women in most cases into the position of secondclass citizens I do wish people in America and other st world countries would reevaluate their stances on marriage and monogamy when clearly they do not work exclusively speaking Perhaps a culture that was more loving less jealous and less possessive would be a healthier happier one,0,cdo6py7,1rk5z6,atheism,hot,2.0,2

Gooleshka,I dont specifically wish to argue semantics here but monogamymarriage although in principle marriagegtmonogamy unless by marriage you mean a monogamous relationshipOn to your question my atheism has not influenced my view on either monogamy or marriage I find a monogamous relationship to be much easier to manage not to mention I am fully satisfied emotionally and happy with my mateAs for marriage I never considered it the normal thing to do once you settle down with someone I just see it as a thing many couples do The fact that I dont have a Christian upbringing likely has something to do with itSomething my atheism has surely led me to consider is the general motivation behind people getting married Too often Ive seen couples get married to feel they get some kind of spiritual insurance together absurd folkloric and unnecessary hogwash if you ask me But many get married mainly to get both families and friends together throw a party have fun and officialize their union in a legallybinding document,0,cdobb7u,1rk5z6,atheism,hot,1.0,1
MyJokesArentFunny,Marriage and the concept of monogamy being the norm was created by humans  Essentially polygamy is the true norm as it is in our primal nature  Naturally men and women have urges to have sex with attractive people whether they have a partner or not  It is an involuntary response to sexually attractive stimuli which we acquired from our ancestors down the evolutionary line who did not practice monogamy as ritually as we do todayIts a little crazy when you think about it how finding one man or woman to be your husband or wife is considered the normal thing to do  Because of our natural instincts I do not think less of people who are polygamous or who are in unorthodox relationships  I prefer monogamy though as I like the feeling of having one special person to care for,0,cdobfwy,1rk5z6,atheism,hot,1.0,1
siliconforest,No but then I never based my morality and ethics on Christianity Marriage is contract between you and another person making that person your closest relative by law and tradition A spouse is a partner someone who always has your back and calls you out when youre being a dick someone you can grow together with and be a better couple than individuals The monogamy part is just about respect at that pointGood luck to you if you dont think youll need that ,0,cdobgm7,1rk5z6,atheism,hot,1.0,1

skinnyatheist,In a word NoIMHO jealousy and dishonesty are part of the human condition The only difference between a monogamous relationship and a polyamorous one is your spouse if heshe is the jealous type will be jealous of the other spouse instead of your potential mistresses Her ire will be the same just much more focusedNow as for raising kids Raising a kid isnt a fulltime job but it isnt a hobby either its more like a parttime job And no one person can be expected to be there for his kid whenever he is needed  every day of every year put simply shit happens For this reason I believe that ideally every child should have at least two parental figures in his or her life Unfortunately it isnt an ideal world Some people marry the wrong person or find the right person but cant get married to him Other people get pregnant while single and choose not to get an abortion or for whatever reason cant get oneIm not saying that if youre a single you need to grab the nearest available partner and slap a ring on him Or if you are in an unhappyabusive marriage you must stay together for the sake of your children What I am saying is raising a child should be something that you plan for ahead of time with another person whom you have a stable longterm relationship with preferably someone who lives with you,0,cdofsob,1rk5z6,atheism,hot,1.0,1

Thorwwyccun,This is just my opinion on the matter Personally as far as Im concerned I prefer monogamy Relationships and living together in general are complex enough without complicating the equation by adding extra variables I have a Redhead thats quite devoted and loyal to me and in exchange I provide the same I dont expect anything from anyone I wouldnt expect from myself so there is that to consider as well Legally speaking there are reasons to not allow polygamy For example in the case of HIPAA exemptions imagine  wives all trying to cram into a single exam room or hospital room to visit their husband in the hospital The room would be so crowded the staff wouldnt be able to do their jobs In the case of Inheritance Laws consider  wives each with a child and the Husband left no Last Will and Testament to bequeath his estate Who decides who gets what There would be a massive fight legally verbally and quite possibly physically over the EstateI would disagree with the idea that Marriage is Inevitable as well as the attendant ideas I have an atheist friend who is nearing retirement age who has gone his entire life single I see no reason why the idea of marriage in its current incarnation would be considered ideal as a onesizefitsall Personally I think those that cannotwill not commit themselves to monogamy or at least an Open Marriage should keep away from the concept Theres nothing wrong from my viewpoint with cohabitation and in fact would probably be a lot better for society in the long run if more people exercised it If youre happier being a Swinger or even a Serial Monogamist then by all means the legal system allows for such a stance And its not like we lack the ability to have multiple women devoted to the same man or even the other way around Its just that for reasons stated above the legal benefits of marriage are reserved for monogamous couplesTLDR  Do whatever floats your boat,0,cdonfun,1rk5z6,atheism,hot,1.0,1

Cyraneth,After reading through most of the comments and your replies in this thread it seems youre taking the natural world for grantedIf youre asking yourself how something can be that beautiful without some higher power making it so then youre basically discrediting whatever it is you find beautiful You deny it the ability to be so touching and instead attribute it to something or someone you feel is more worthy of that regardless of whether that entity actually is worthy of it or even exists in the first placeIm wagering once you come to the realisation that landscapes can be that beautiful without outside help music can be that touching and events in your life can be that profound youll come to really cherish the time you have your surroundings your friends and family and the work of other humans as what it is instead of simply writing it off as god did it,0,cdo3m7s,1rk5zc,atheism,hot,1.0,1
MartinTheRound,Well you can either just accept you have perfectly natural feelings and enjoy them or try to understand the nature of each feeling and still enjoy them We have many different feelings some of which have straightforward evolutionary reasons others somewhat quirkier ones some are side effects Does it matter to you which quirk of evolution gave you the ability to enjoy your time with your lover Or the ability to look at some nice work of art and wonder in amazement I can explain some of the feelings and it doesnt detract one bit from them Whats sad in my case is that understanding how my depression works doesnt make it any easier not to feel desperately lonely and want to kill myself I know its only chemicals I know which part of my brain is making it so but the feeling isnt any less severe Nor was my enjoyment of love any less powerful when I was loving and loved Just because I could tell what chemicals were involved didnt make my feelings any less enjoyable and doesnt make my current feelings any less hopeless And my ability to explain what makes me want to express myself takes away from my wanting to give you a response So Id say other than attributing your feelings to the wrong cause youre doing all right You are rational and you can realize that majesty can be found all around you even without the majesty being put there for your benefit And you can just enjoy it when you see it Majesty is not whats out there majesty is what you perceive Just like god people believe in god and god isnt out there its in their minds And has real effects on their lives But only because its in their minds Does that get you closer to what you want,0,cdo4p06,1rk5zc,atheism,hot,1.0,1

retoupin,Theologically Biblical humility is an acknowledgement that who we are our strengths gifts and abilities are a result of how we are made which the Bible speaks of as our gifts from GodSo when a Christian thanks God for something they have accomplished or succeeded at they are acknowledging that their ability to achieve that is because of who He has made usAdmittedly some Christians get carried away and thank Jesus for finding them a parking spotbut most Christians are sensibleBy contrast an atheist would say that their gifts and abilities come down to genetics and environment  Christians would also acknowledge these but again believe that even from an evolutionary perspective there is a divine plan involvedI dont know if this will satisfy your question as I suspect it was more a rhetorical question and an opportunity to grouse about religion and show how amazingly clever you are by comparisonBut is is a simple explanation of why Christians thank God  We believe he gives us all good things  Thats why,0,cdo73bn,1rkc0t,atheism,hot,2.0,2

scornucopia,gt Atheists say that the burden of proof lies with the person making a positive claim that something exists Again many other alternatives Not really Whether something exists or not is a purely empirical matter Either there is evidence that it exists or there is notWhen entertaining such claims there are essentially only two rules we can apply either we work on the assumption that an existential claim X exists is false until we have empirical evidence that it is true or we assume that it is true until we have empirical evidence that it is falseIf someone says leprechauns exist we assume thats false until someone shows us a leprechaun If we apply this rule consistently we dont have to admit the existence of fairies or goblins or gods without evidenceIf however someone says God exists suddenly the shoe is on the other foot and were expected to assume that its true until we can show evidence that its not But if we apply that rule consistently we then have to admit leprechauns and goblins until we can disprove them too This is untenableThe only rational rule for existential claims is that we assume that they are false until there is empirical evidence for the claimed thingIf you apply one rule to leprechauns and goblins and the other rule to God you are guilty of special pleadinghttpenwikipediaorgwikiSpecialpleading,0,cdoget6,1rl7kh,atheism,hot,4.0,4

Thestrangeone,Once again depends on how you define god And if youre trying to define god into existence then it is not begging the question as you had assumed but rather moving the goalposts You see we can argue against the bible and its claims of infallibility inaccurate historical descriptions and all around just some absolutely awful advice so if you define god as the bible or Koran or book of Mormon or some other holy text then it is easy to disprove him But when you define god as a bland and generic creator or higher power thats when moving the goalposts come in Because a bland creatorhigher power does nothing to speak to any of the claims of the bible or any other similar holy text Also most if not all of the arguments for the existence of even such a poorly defined and vague god are riddled with logical fallacies If you want to believe in a god that is your choice but simply know that it is indeed a choice It is not a decision made out of a rational consideration of the evidence but on a purely emotional level and in some cases despite the evidence You choose the god that is familiar to you just as the muslim chooses the god that his parents taught him or the Hindu chooses the gods that were taught to him Even if you werent born in a religious family the supposedly tolerant America tends to have an attitude that Christianity is the only true religion and all others are false So if you are in an emotionally vulnerable place the first person that is going to race to stuff your mind full of nonsense will most likely be a Christian Theres a reason conversion stories often have a bottoming out part Its the emotionally vulnerable place where intellect is put aside for the sake of pure emotion So many arguments from the cosmological argument to the watchmaker argument to the ontological argument all involve pure appeals to emotion rather then any actual data supporting any one religion Yet all monotheistic religions claim to be the only true religion Gets a little suspicious after a while,1,cdotr3u,1rl7kh,atheism,hot,3.0,2

toodamnparanoid,That would likely only produce hostility between you and your grandmotherSit down with her and tell her you appreciate the sentiment and that while it doesnt coincide with your view you understand that it was a gift she got for you because she cares for you While you are atheist you understand that she loves and wants the best for you You simply ask that she understand you are trying to find your own understanding and meaning in life and maybe one day the two of you can have a discussion about religion as simply two adults with different viewsIts difficult to get new ideas across to the elderly some times Especially when it comes to religion those who were never raised to question it may be actually incapable of seeing the world any other way  Remember that the more you have a thought the more it is reinforced in your brain as the neural pathways become stronger for that specific idea Perhaps your grandma is  That would likely mean she has thought of and accepted this idea as truth for  years That would be hard to undo however she has likely had her own ideas and dreams which others disagreed with in her days perhaps trying to relate to her in that regard may let her see that you are simply trying to find your own answers about the universe Hopefully she can see the importance in thatIf she simply pushes bible quotes and the like at you ask yourself this do you still love your grandma If so just treat it as her being your crazy old grandma and enjoy everything else you do with her She will likely not be around for too many more years and youll more likely remember fondly the good times you haveIf she still cant see past it dont toss Dawkins or hitchens books at her good choice of authors though as shell likely see it the same way you think about her sending you bibles Treat others as you would like to be treated yourselfI miss my grandma a lot  Hell my parents likely wont be around too much longer Ive had the same discussion with them too It is okay to teach about the bible but it is not okay for them to teach the bible Just know that as much as we hate to think about it our time on this planet is limited You are one of the most important people to your grandma that she has ever known Dont strain a relationship which is likely very timelimited,5,cdol5ma,1rm0ed,atheism,hot,44.0,39

adamwho,If you dont want to click on an FTB link here is the articlePart Neither Veil nor SubmissionMaryam NamazieThe niqab and burqa must be banned to protect womens rights and secularism  and not just out of concern for security Its a shroud strait jacket and mobile prison for women and girls who are bound and gagged and made invisible According to Algerian writer Karima Bennoune the veil represents the everencroaching fabric erasure of womens bodiesCalling it a right and choice is as formal as formal can be when it is often deemed compulsory and imposed and policed by Islamists  often using brute force Also lets not forget the veil is a tool like many others to control and restrict women and girls To me saying it is a right and choice is like saying FGM the chastity belt footbinding or Suttee are suchA ban is not a violation of the right to religion Whilst the right to religion and belief is absolute the right to manifest and express ones beliefs can be and is at times restricted for a number of reasons including protecting public security health order and the fundamental rights and freedoms of othersMen in Shia Islam might have the right and choice to marry four permanent wives and unlimited temporary wives for example but it is nonetheless banned in many places because it is deemed to be exploitative Uniforms are another way in which the right to dress is restricted in society for health reasonsThe European Court of Human Rights confirmed this when it ruled in favour of Turkeys right to ban the veil at universities now under question due to Erdogans efforts to Islamicise the country If dress can be restricted to protect health or public safety why not to protect womens rights and secularismMoreover rights often conflict with one another What about the adverse impact of the niqab and burqa on the rights and choices of unveiled or differently veiled women It is not as harmless as is often portrayed In the Shabina Begum case the House of Lords granted that restricting Shabina from wearing the jilbab to school was permissible in order to protect the rights of others who feared being coerced into veiling As Algerian sociologist Marieme Helie Lucas says The right to veil is always followed with the right to beat up women who do not Clearly the right to veil has a corresponding right to unveil or not veil at all The unveiled or improperly veiled woman is always held up adversely in comparison to the chaste veiled womanMoreover this is more than merely a question of dress It is important to remember that the niqab as well as the burqa and the veil in general is a highly contested political and social symbol Many Muslims or those labelled as such are at the forefront of the fight against the burqa niqab and veil  often at great risk to themselvesIn Iran the slogan neither veil nor submission has become a rallying cry in the ongoing fight between women and Islamic regimes morality police In another recent case in Sudan Amira Osman Hamed who faces flogging for refusing to wear the hijab says Im Sudanese Im Muslim and Im not going to cover my headIn this day and age the veil in general and the burka and niqab in particular are associated with Islamisms efforts to limit rights and impose Sharia law The enormous increase of veiled women and girls across the world and in Europe is a direct result of the rise of the contemporary Islamist movement and the ensuing pressure on women and girls to veil Women are always the first targets of Islamism And veiling restrictions on women is a particular signifier of things to come The lawyer putting forth Turkeys case for restricting the veil at universities said it well the hijab is not just a dress but a sign of political conviction it shows near and present dangerA good case in point is Madani Free school in Derby where girls as young as  have to wear the burqa all teachers including nonMuslims must wear the veil Those who criticise the fuss over a piece of clothing miss the point The niqab and burqa are the most visible signs of Islamisms war on women It also represents sex apartheid and Sharia law and all that follows In Madani School burqaclad girls must sit in the back of the classroom On school trips they must give way to boys and male teachers who cut in front of them in queues Music is banned As an aside child veiling is tantamount to child abuse In the same way that children are not labelled Conservative or Marxist children because of their parents political beliefs children should also be free of religious labels and faith schools until they are ready to make a choice of their own upon reaching Calling for a ban on the niqab or burqa is not about criminalising Muslim women anymore than banning FGM criminalises girls and women who are mutilated Whilst a ban wont solve everything there has yet to be a single prosecution with regards FGM changes in the law including bans are important steps in changing culture and attitudes and defending rightsMoreover calling for a ban is not about cultural imperialism or colonialism Islamist efforts in many places are forms of colonialism too The burqa and niqab are not traditional forms of dress but newly imposed ones for a majority of contexts Plus there are bans on the niqab or veil in a number of countries outside of Europe This is not about East versus West In Egypt the Ministry of Health has prohibited the wearing of the niqab by nurses in hospitals Egypts top Islamic school alAzhar has issued a ban on wearing the niqab in classrooms and dormitories of all its affiliate schools and educational institutes Al Azhar also obliges women to show their faces in court via a decree issued in  In Iraq the niqab has been banned by a fatwa In Kuwait women wearing the niqab have been banned from driving In Azerbaijan and Tunisia veils are banned from public buildings and schools In Syria until recently teachers were banned from wearing the niqabUnfortunately many secularists in Europe have shown a lack of clarity and moral courage when it comes to banning the burqa and niqab Secularism is a human right as philosopher AC Grayling says and one that needs to be actively defended promoted and articulated it is a fundamental precondition for womens rights and equalitySecularists have a responsibility to seize the initiative particularly given the farRights attempts at hijacking the issue to promote their antiimmigrant and antiMuslim bigotry Calling for a ban is not in and of itself racist though racism and prejudice are very real and need to be opposed on par with sex discriminationA ban has nothing to do with a clash of civilisations it has everything to do with a global struggle between secularists including many Muslims on the one hand and theocrats and the religiousRight on the otherA Manifesto against Totalitarianism which I signed in  with  others including Salman Rushdie on the Danish cartoon controversy still applies todayWe reject the cultural relativism which implies an acceptance that men and women of Muslim culture are deprived of the right to equality freedom and secularism in the name of the respect for certain cultures and traditionsWe refuse to renounce our critical spirit out of fear of being accused of Islamophobia a wretched concept that confuses criticism of Islam as a religion and stigmatisation of those who believe in itAnd to that I must add the wretched concept that confuses a criticism of the niqab burqa and veil as a stigmatisation of those who believe in it and wear

MartinTheRound, When europeans came to the americas they encountered an entire continent full of people that didnt have the same spiritual connection They had a different spiritual connection Some people have a spiritual connection to nature and not gods Some people have a connection to art that could be called spiritual That only means that as social animals we have certain needs to feel connected to something As for the probabilities he simply doesnt understand what hes talking about  But when I see many religions each claiming to be the only answer and none of them providing anything better than I am right because I have a book that is right that says that the book is right what I conclude is that all of them are equally invented If and when one of them can be verified externally I would reconsider but extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence If someone told you yesterday I ate grapes you wouldnt find it difficult to believe but if he continued with and then I went to the toilet and when I was done what I found out what came out was solid gold you would have a hard time to believe it If someone said there was a guy who preached I find it easy to believe and if he continues with they killed him and he came back to life I find it hard to believe What would it take for your pastor to believe I excrete gold after eating grapes If he believes it just based on my claim I have some more claims for him God could have given Adam a choice without giving him a choice to sin God could have prevented Adam from sinning like when he demanded the sons life but at the last moment he made it stop But god didnt  But wishing there was a nice little story doesnt mean there is one some of those letters are forgeries many of the christian traditions were purposely thrown out because of an editing process well after jesus and every of his followers were dead What about the council of nicea why was there a council needed to establish what the truth is What about Marceon who made his own bible What he should do is study the history of the bible from a historical point of view and not just choosing what he accepts based on what he already believesAnd I believe the bible says somewhere that some of the people around jesus would live to see the kingdom of god Someone please help me with which passage that is That verse alone proves that either the bible is wrong jesus lied we already live in this kingdom or we have some very old people running around Which one is it,0,cdpda0o,1rncwt,atheism,hot,1.0,1

catchapark,The reason that there are so many copies of the bible is because the same organisation that had a vested interest in the religion was also responsible for making all the copies The church focused much of its energy on it It didnt happen by accidentWe dont have any of the originals We have copies of copies and translations of copies No two copies are the same They all have mistakes as they were copied by hand The fact that the Dead Sea Scrolls match only means it is a copy of a copy httpenwikipediaorgwikiDatingtheBibleThe Gospels were written decades after the events they describe by unknown authors none of whom ever actually met Jesus They were not eyewitnesses At best the Gospels are hearsayThe idea that Adam and Eve had a choice is also misleading because they were completely ignorant of the concept of sin until they ate the apple If someone tells you that you have a choice and then punishes you for not choosing the choice they had already chosen for you then it is not much of a choice Its like a robber holding a gun to your head You can choose to get shot by not cooperating but its not much of a choiceThis thing about taking something out of context When God says its ok to buy slaves from neighbouring nations how is that taking it out of context Some would say that being a slave is better than dying in the desert but there are many examples in the Old Testament where the Israelites killed other tribes and burnt their cities to the ground and took slaves for themselves In one case Moses gets angry because they took the women and children and cattle He told them to kill the nonvirgin women male children and cattle but keep the young virgin girls for themselves httpwwwbiblegatewaycompassagesearchNumbersAampversionKJV This is the behaviour of warring tribes and the kind of morals they had Vengence war slavery mass murder plunder total destruction of entire cities,1,cdp45ob,1rncwt,atheism,hot,2.0,1

wuollett,From the Article cited by the article OP cited  gt Support from a husband or wife was important in sustaining the resolution In reference to people that quit on their ownTreatment of Drug Abuse and Addiction  Part III The Harvard Mental Health Letter Volume  Number  October  page  See Aug Part I Sept Part II Oct  Part IIISo much for the sayings that Everybody needs a support group and Nobody can do it alone Most successful people do This is a contradictory statement having the support of a husband or wife isnt doing it alone  gt Nothing could be further from the truth Even the most ardent true believers who will be honest about it recognize that AA and NA have at least  failure rates And the real numbers are more like  or  or  failure rates It depends on who is doing the counting how they are counting and what they are counting or measuringIn  a different study the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism NIAAA conducted the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcoholism and Related Conditions NESARC found data from a survey of  people where  responded that they had been in an AAtype meeting a  continuance rate was shown after  year of AA Cited from Wikipedia as  L A Kaskutas Y Ye T K Greenfield J Witbrodt amp J Bond  Epidemiology or Alcoholics Anonymous Participation Recent Developments in Alcoholism Vol  Research on Alcoholics Anonymous and Spirituality in Addiction Recovery   From the article itselfgtI believe that whatever successes AA can claim are due the the dedication and tireless efforts of the volunteer sponsors That is a lifeaffirming positive way to help someone in the grips of alcohol or drugs So the article OP linked cites an article that states a support group doesnt work but in the article itself it clearly states that the sponsor system which is a form of support group is a good way to help And with a group like AA to bring them all together how would addicts find these sponsorsFurthermore studies have proven that more studies are needed to properly determine the effectiveness of AA Cited from Wikpedia as  Ferri M Amato L Davoli M Alcoholics Anonymous and other step programmes for alcohol dependence Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews  Issue Both articles make the statement that Christians elements in AA make the program have a negative effect by citing data that doesnt really study the actually effectiveness of AA Nothing is said in regards to time it takes for spontaneous remission to occur and at that point the effects of constant alcoholism may be much more pronouncedWhat needs to happen is a long study that shows the effectiveness of AA versus nontreatment and alcohol addiction specialty centers and the differences in health between the three groups as well as the amount of people who stay completely and utterly sober as opposed to  or  beers every now and then and being considered not an alcoholic anymore whether the alcoholism had any pronounced medical or personal effects and the amount of time between when they started drinking and when they stopped and if AA was more effective in reducing this time If you can provide data showing that people who were turned away by the God aspect of AA quit completely by themselves in the same or less amount of time those that stayed in AA did and stayed sober longer I will believe that AA has a negative effect but until you can produce this data I highly recommend not citing inconclusive sources since all of this is really not comprehensive enough to make the statement that the God aspect of AA makes it negatively effective ,2,cdpgv5v,1roasf,atheism,hot,5.0,3

BuccaneerRex,Your first problem is thisgtAs atheists we can proudly say that we have questioned the existence of God and certainly religion itself We have used our critical thinking skills and curiosity to look beyond what others have told usThis is not the case for everyone Some people never accepted the existence of a deity in the first place therefore have nothing to question Some of us have never been a member of a religion And as annoying as it is some people are atheists merely because nobody ever taught them religion they never reasoned their way into or out of anythingYou do not require a deity to have a religion this is true But your definition of religion is more of a definition of Abrahamic religion not all possible religions Not all religions include afterlives Not all have a central text Not all believe their deity is the creator They do all generally include moral prescripts so thats one Not all include eternal punishments of the ones that do include afterlives And some do not believe that any deities interveneIts a good start and defining terms should really be the first effort of any intellectual activityBut religion is an extremely broad catchall term and you cant really define all possible members of the category in five bullet points,0,cdp9sre,1roh7u,atheism,hot,6.0,6

weshallrise,In my opinionThe historical Jesus of Nazareth was an apocalyptic JewishhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiApocalypticliterature preacher who was charismatic enough to gain a bit of a following I believe he may have thought of himself as a Jewish messiahhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiJewishmessianism of sorts and that he would raise an army of his fellow Jews to fight and defeat the Roman occupiers thus establishing Gods kingdom in Judea After entering Jerusalem and attempting to provoke the authorities however he was arrested for claiming to be the King of the Jews This was seen as a direct challenge to the authority of Caesar and was a crime punishable by death As a result he was crucified by the RomansAs for the mythical Jesus Christ we cant really say what if anything written in the New Testament is true The earliest books in that canon are those of Paul who never personally knew Jesus The earliest gospel is Mark written sometime after  ce by someone who could not have known Jesus Consider also that the writings of the New Testament have been changed and edited countless times since they were written and that none of the original copies exist The bottom line here is that we simply do not know what this character named Jesus actually said or taught other than that it was probably apocalyptic in natureIf you consider his teachings to be socialistic in nature as the teachings in Matthew suggest then they are really no different than those of most other great teachers throughout history The only thing that ever made Jesus of Nazareth special was the myth of his resurrection Without that Jesus was just another preacher and that is where history should have left him,0,cdpomvi,1ror9x,atheism,hot,1.0,1

MarieKlee,Asking for sources for Jesus existence is useless since all the sources that prove his existence have to be faked Think about that for a moment If Jesus isnt real then that means a great deal of our history written in history books has been forged and become a selfpropagating lie as well I dont think Jesus was invented  years ago I think Jesus was invented in the s and said he existed  years before then with the express aim to convert indigenous people in age where empiricism didnt exist Empiricism didnt emerge until the s so you cant take written history for granted before thenYou agree theres no god so arguing on what Jesus said is too subjective to matter since Jesus wasnt real either Its like debating whether or not Hercules was a real person yet conceding Zeus isnt real,2,cdpehmx,1ror9x,atheism,hot,1.0,-1

Thestrangeone,I think a better place to start is why you chose Christianity Because I cant truly address your misconceptions if I dont know what they are But starting with the limited information I have I will address the exact words you said Your first misconception which is rather common is that atheism is a choice implying it is a religion It is neither of those things Atheism is first and foremost the rejection of all deistic claims If you ask me why I reject the god of the bible which I assume the title of Christianity means that specific god I would first ask you why you reject Allah or Vishnu or Xenu or Zues Because if your answer has anything to do with faith let me tell you something there are people out there who have the exact same amount of faith and certainty that you do in fact some of them even more that believe that one of these gods are real So now the question becomes how do you determine which is true Because that is what would matter if it mattered at all I mean if the bible is wrong and Islam was true then you could see where calling yourself a Christian could become a problem for youThink about the radical muslims who engage in acts of terror How much faith do you have to have in order to strap a bomb to your chest and detonate it I bet you that guy is pretty damn convinced that his religion is true And if it is true and yours is wrong once again you can see where you might end up running into a problem somewhere You see the thing that you dont understand is that you are actually an atheist as well You do not believe in Allah you do not believe in Zues you do not believe in Vishnu Im betting you know pretty much next to nothing about hinduism yet you instantly reject it without knowing a single thing about it Back in the Roman times the christians were the athiests as they were denying the deistic claims of the emperor All Christians are actually atheists as they deny many many deistic claims often without ever considering them There is only one difference between you and me and that is I deny  one more god then you do By the way nondenominational many Christians would view you no better then an atheist as they would believe you to have just another one of the wrong religions Some Christians take those denominations very seriously to the point that they view everyone who doesnt agree with them as heritics see baptists and catholics and going back to your point about seeing no problem with science that doesnt actually tell me anything I know another christian that tells me that same thing yet he also believes in a literal  day creation along with the idea that Noahs flood actually happened and all of the other supernatural events of the bible actually happened So Im going to need a little more than that So Id like to know your position first in order to properly explain my position as I cannot explain something if I dont know what you actually know yet You are coming in with some very clear and obvious misconceptions and I need to know what those are before we end up having a big misunderstanding about what we actually think A nondenominational christian who sees no problem with science really doesnt tell me that much about what you actually think or why you think it And I need to know that I need to know what your methods are for determining truth and whether or not you care if what you believe is true,0,cdpezv8,1roxnm,atheism,hot,54.0,54

MartinTheRound,Choosing atheism is exactly the same as when children grow up they choose to believe that presents are brought by parents and not Santa ClausIn the same vein would you say that children who believe Santa brings gifts and children who believe their eyes when they see the gifts bought wrapped and placed by their parents are the same kind of beliefAs was pointed out you also reject many gods you know about and countless gods you have never heard ofAs for christianity christianity came from judaism jesus promised a kingdom of god on earth and bodily resurrection but people seem to believe these days about heaven which jesus never mentioned it was also promised to come around his time and its quite overdue Judaism has evolved from polytheism by first elevating one of the god of their pantheon to a major position then to the exclusive position look at the language of the first commandment or better yet study the history of the jewish bible old testament And Santa Claus reindeer tree gifts is made up too I assume you dont need my reasoning for thatAs you can see its not much of a choice not to believe in Santa when you saw the gifts tucked away a month before Christmas year after year The same way its not much of a choice not to believe in gods when you know how these belief systems evolve cultural anthropology and how they affect people psychology and how theyre exploited just look aroundIf you have a specific christian article of faith you dont understand us rejecting feel free to ask,0,cdpjdjn,1roxnm,atheism,hot,2.0,2

WilliamDhalgren,Pretty short q so youre just wondering why I dont believe in any gods OK  because Ive not been presented with any convincing evidence that any exist And further for it doesnt even seem to be an empirically testable hypothesis as its commonly stated which makes it predictively worthless regardless of its truth if truth is even seperable from empirical methodology which establishes it that isId evaluate the claim that gods exist the same way one evaluates the claim Higgs particle exists or cosmic inflation happened in the early history of the universe or supersymmetry exists or luminiferous aether exists or that a china teapot currently orbits the sun in a long and elliptical orbit Those hypothesis are respectively  solidly proven possible and indicated by evidence but unproven possible but unproven and under increasing tension with the evidence solidly rejected and finally worse than wrong ie unscientific for not offering no empirical testsAny empirical claims ever made in favor of the god hypothesis are in the solidly rejected camp and all that remains seems to be worse than wrong So its not worthy of consideration,0,cdphgsi,1roxnm,atheism,hot,1.0,1

Aberu,I will spare the common answer to this which isnt the answer you are seeking The whole we didnt choose atheism kind of thingTo answer the question how did I become an atheist which is the implication of your question it was because I wanted to rationalize the things I believed I was raised Southern Baptist Moved around to many nondenominational churches seeking answers for conflicts that I saw in each branch that I had arrived at previously I converted Mormon since a good friend of mine was Mormon and opened me up to listening to the missionaries They had answers for why the bible seemed conflicting edited for power and profit grabs etc Then the next logical step was to question the Mormon church after being baptised for some reason my skepticism wasnt honed fully yet I found it difficult to question the Mormon church without every source being tainted by Christian apologist writers and their criticisms or Mormon apologists and their responsese of those criticisms I couldnt find a verifiable independent source I dont remember what I found since its been about  years but I found a pretty independent source and it opened me up to thinking very critically about what I believed I used to wear a religion like a badge amongst many badges on my vest and I never felt like it was the most important thing to know anything about Just one of many things I felt I was expected to have an opinion on and expected to have a belief in something And I thought it was a given to believe in God but I always assumed everyone else believed in God in some form or anotherAfter questioning Mormonism I approached a kind of Deism and was firmly opposed to religious institution I had a deist friend bridge that gap comfortably for me in the same circle of friends as the Mormon friend Then I discussed my ideas with a coworker who I respected greatly a british born Californian punk rock bassist who was there washing dishes with me at the pizza place as a fellow delivery driver He got me to the point to ask myself How do I know what I think I know In other words he was requiring me to rationally justify the existence of a deistic god to him through logic I couldnt and I started sliding slowly into becoming an Atheist over the next year First time I admitted I was an atheist was after hearing a debate that Christopher Hitchens did I dont remember who it was against it was a while ago and he just made very good arguments to embrace what I had already been feeling that I was an atheist He was a brave voice that made me much more comfortable with being outspoken about it and outspoken publically against irrational beliefs That was my introduction to me enlightenment I dont like calling it this but I dont know a bettter wordHope that gives you a unique perspective but I assume most others peoples posts are similar in essence,0,cdpkm72,1roxnm,atheism,hot,1.0,1

gidikh,Mine started with the  commandments  The one thing in the bible that god supposedly wrote himself  He starts off by saying for I the LORD your God am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me  then proceeds to wrap up the commandments by telling us not to be jealousenvious of our neighborsThe first thing that struck me was that this supposedly perfect being gets jealous  I dont get jealous beyond thinking someone is a dbag for hitting on my wife in front of me  But this all powerful all benevolent god gets jealous enough that he punishes children grandchildren and great grandchildren if someone doesnt love himI then proceeded to start reading the bible objectively and wow the god of the old testament is such a dick  Even if you skip all the parts where god is helping his chosen people btw choosing a small tribe of illiterate nomads out of the entire world as your favorite seems a little weird to me but whatever floods your planet kill rape and pillage their neighbors you still have stories of god screwing people over for no other reason that to prove how great he is  Read exodus pharaoh is ready to give up and let everyone go but god hardens pharaohs heart just so god can unless his plagues and get the credit for freeing the slaves  Those plagues by the way include slaughtering the first born of each family include babies unless of course you painted your door with lambs blood because god apparently couldnt tell the difference between his people and the egyptians  This is just one example of manyThen we move into the new testament and suddenly god isnt as much as a dick any more  If god is perfect why would he have a mideternity crisis and suddenly become the cool dad  Jesus shows up and has some pretty good things to say but then they have to throw in some pretty pathetic miracles   Your average doctor has cured more diseases and saved more lives by several orders of magnitude greater than jesus did  My favorite was using his omnipotent powers to save a run to the liquor store during a weddingSo after being thoroughly disenfranchised I started looking at some of the other major religions and found flaws with those as well  I then came to the realization that if there was an all powerful deity that cared whether or not we knew of it and worshiped it there wouldnt be any sort of doubt  It could easily come up with a way to get all its laws and such distributed to its creations that doesnt include having a bunch of illiterate desert dwellers witness something that takes them several decades before they find someone to actually write it downThis lead me to the conclusion that if there is a super powerful intelligent being that created everything it doesnt care about us Or much more likely we are just a random fluke of natural processes,0,cdpnbfm,1roxnm,atheism,hot,1.0,1

mredding,I will answer this in the hypothetical context that there is a god just for shits and gigglesNo This is something god cant doAnd its because you misunderstand the foundations of mathematics Maths are based on axioms which are just statements that make up the rules of math There are many different kinds of math and while some can share axioms or specialize a math by inheriting the axioms of one math and adding its own they dont all share the same basic axiomsAnd the axioms of mathematics arent based on rules of nature or physics They are logical rational reasonable and full of paradoxes as proven by GödelSo your god can decree whatever the fuck he wants about maths and all he will be doing is defining his own mathematical system Math is only an idea a model and the model isnt the thing,0,cdpplc9,1rp6o2,atheism,hot,1.0,1
ScreamerA,No because the rules are not an enforceable thing    NOT because some authority decided it to be The rules are observational and linked directly to human language If God spontaneously changed all the fours in the world to fives or pictures of goats the actual objects those numbers represented would not changeThink of it this way if God set it up so that if you had two apples in one hand and two apples in the other then put them in the basket and the total was five then the natural world would completely cease to function as mathematics currently describes it If the universe survived this new property we would find a new way to use mathematics to describe that new property So your question is fallacious because nature is not the result of mathematics mathematics is the result of nature,0,cdpzzz8,1rp6o2,atheism,hot,1.0,1

mredding,Ive always been an atheist and my parents know it and they also know theres no arguing with me or crossing me My fiance on the other hand does come from a religious family For now they dont know anything about me and thats the way she wants itWe will not be baptizing our children I feel no need or obligation to mention it or draw any attention to it Should it come up in conversation I have no qualms about laying it flat out there and telling anyone who protests to fucking stuff it and keep their unwelcome and uninvited god damn opinions to themselves Not their children not their decision not their businessI can be polite and I can be harsh as the situation dictates I will not apologize or compromise,0,cdppv22,1rpngg,atheism,hot,1.0,1

Greghole,Theres nothing in the bible that says you should baptise babies  Baptism in the bible was a way for people to publicly declare their faith and trust in god  Its something you do not something that is done to you  The Catholic tradition of infant baptism was a loophole to get dead babies who never had a chance to accept Jesus into heaven instead of purgatory  The official position of the church has changed and they no longer teach that unbaptized children get punished  Basically anyone under five years old goes directly to heaven  If youre not willing to tell your grandparents that youre not a catholic just tell them you dont see any point to infant baptism since they decided to let dead babies into heaven,0,cdpzoyn,1rpngg,atheism,hot,1.0,1

ReyTheRed,There are two ways of knowing that I am aware of Deductive logic starts from a few assumptions for example we assume that inference works that modus ponens holds etc and there are other axioms that can be adopted for various purposes and then under those assumptions we can prove things with certainty The weakness of this system is that it relies on our rejection of absurdity Our axioms are considered strongest when the negation is most absurdScientific reasoning is a bit different in scientific reasoning we come up with the simplest possible explanation then expand the field of testing as widely as possible In science we accept things tentatively and do our best to get them thrown out Each real test a theory passes strengthens it But again this is based on the rejection of absurdity and also on a more practical usabilityWhen it comes down to it the only two modes of reasoning that Ive seen make any sense rely on rejecting absurdityAnd if you dont reject absurdity there is no god because tomato is left brick,0,cdpmqjd,1rpqas,atheism,hot,1.0,1

busterfixxitt,Ive encountered this too  For me this is simply a problem of logic at its most basic form AA  For the word know to have any meaning it must reflect reflect reality  You cannot know that   Youre simply wrong and your certainty to the contrary should not be considered knowingReligion and science are not  ways of knowing they are  ways of attaining certainty  Science simply has a better track record of its certainties reflecting reality,0,cdpp6e4,1rpqas,atheism,hot,1.0,1

titscum,gtI considered one of the alternatives to be divine revelation or inspiration and am discounting it as useless because its not testableverifiable and indistinguishable from insanity or deceptionInterestingly though no epistemic system could ever escape from insanity or deception The fundamental problem many people on this subreddit seem to ignore when they profess themselves radical followers of scientific realism is that you have to assume as axiomatic the at least partial reliability of your own senses as well as the method of verification you derived from them Since sensory input is the only source of human knowledge it must also be the foundation of our techniques of natural deduction and verification Therefore no proof of soundness or completeness could ever be given with regard to the senses our very source of knowledge is inherently unreliable and any workaround to that fact eg Kants a priori knowledge instrumentalism pragmatism structuralism etc can only attempt to convince you through examples of its practical success not some sort of formal irrefutable proofThe fundamental subjectivity of our individual perception of reality prevents any absolute claim to knowledge So yes there are infinitely many other ways of knowing since it all depends on what your personal criteria are to label something a justified true belief,0,cdpu588,1rpqas,atheism,hot,1.0,1

fiendlittlewing,gtIsnt the belief in such a theory akin to me believing in the flying spaghetti theoryYou mean hypothesis Belief in science is different from faith because science has proven results One of the reasons for this success is self correction The whole point of searching for a unified theory is because we know that general relativity the standard model and quantum mechanics are flawed Does that sound like your faith Does your religion test its doctrine to insure reliability Does your religion admit flaws in its core doctrine and search for a more correct doctrine Religion would rather reform its members than its teaching ,0,cdppbeb,1rq2pi,atheism,hot,6.0,6

DrClW,I believe you misunderstand a basic concept of atheism its not that we believe in something else its that we have chosen to not believe in any of the world religions because as humanity has developed slowly over the past couple hundred years and discovered the workings of the world we have found these absolute provable facts in front of us to be inconsistent from what was written in a book thousands of years ago leading us to question the origin of the writing and whether or not it is legitimate  Also the flying spaghetti monster theory is used by some atheists as an example of the amount of tangible evidence that exists surrounding gods most atheists dont actually believe in a flying spaghetti monsterTLDRAtheist is a term for someone who chooses not to believe there is no overarching belief  Flying spaghetti monster is a joke,0,cdppuyz,1rq2pi,atheism,hot,3.0,3
Rixxali,Atheists dont believe in godsThats it Thats it about our beliefs As for your question I will answer not as an atheist since the question has nothing to do with my nonbelief in gods but as someone with a little bit of knowledge about scienceA theory in science means that the idea has a LOT of evidence and NO evidence that contradicts it A hypothesis is an idea that does NOT have a lot of evidence for it If evidence is gathered for the hypothesis it eventually becomes a theory if all evidence shows it to be correct However people usually use the word theory to mean any old guess or idea that explains something As you can see the word theory means two different thingsTherefore it is unfair to use the word theory in one sentence with two separate meanings Theory for scientists is NOT the same as theory in the common vernacular The Flying Spaghetti Monster is NOT a scientific theory At best its an unproven hypothesis Just like any other religion If scientists and mathematicians are looking for a grand unified theory it means that they have some reasonevidence to believe that it MIGHT exist And to determine whether it really exists or not they are doing experiments and such looking for evidenceComparing scientists who are experimenting and figuring out how reality works and trying to determine the truth of whether a certain concept exists or not is NOT the same as believing an idea with absolutely zero evidence that its true So no believing that a unified field theory may exist and looking for it  is NOT the same as believing in a supernatural being,0,cdpq05e,1rq2pi,atheism,hot,3.0,3

Brokenshatner,As several others have said funerals arent really the place to pick bones with family I say explain to the priest where you stand if you feel its that important Otherwise just ask him specifically whats expected of you then show up on time and perform Have you ever been in a wedding held in a church This is no different Sure youre there to console a grieving widow rather than fulfill the whims of a bride but essentially its the same Ask the priest where you should stand what you should wear and if you have any lines when you hand off the bread and grapejuice Even if your only line is Amen stand and deliverThe thought youre giving this shows that youre a person of conviction even if faith isnt really your thing If putting on this kind of act is more theatre than you care to engage in just let the priest know and Im sure they can find somebody else If you feel that doing so could alienate family though well if thats priority one youll just have to bite the bullet Im afraid Good luck though either way,0,cdpzw8n,1rqkff,atheism,hot,1.0,1

rabit,Dont worry reasonable minds will eventually make the connection that there is no connection with realityMost likely outcome the already religious become more religious after the film but the rest will probably lean more toward atheism after the filmThis kind of movie may actually do atheism a favor  The truth will prevail,0,cdpxn9h,1rqkmm,atheism,hot,2.0,2

Zimmer,Its always weird seeing how religious parents raise their children and the dynamics involved weird in the sense of I dont exactly know how I should feel about it  I can agree that the parent as in this situation is making an honorable decision that the child drew the picture However I still judge that parent for not accepting the same bullshit they feed their children  Sometimes I wonder how anyone will know if Jesus actually comes back again as some claim Ive seen a lot of dudes who look like Jesus and Ive seen a lot of media on guys who claim to be Jesus while also looking like Jesus The way God wants to test Christians faith that bum on the street claiming to be Jesus seems to correlate well of how it would actually happen I start to get really deep in thought about all of this and then I remember its all a hoax and go fap,0,cdpzdxu,1rqn1l,atheism,hot,3.0,3
