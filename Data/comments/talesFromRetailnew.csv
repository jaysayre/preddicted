themailtruck,As sales lead at my old job I realized my manager had such a list because he would often grill me about the same half dozen employees and their work ethic transactions tardiness etc You can try to outperform the average coworkers and prove your value but honestly you were probably put on it for a personal or ephemeral reason in the first place  something like she doesnt smile at customers enough or  I just dont trust him My advice dont give them a reason but maybe think about jumping ship,2,cczl9wj,1p7nr9,talesFromRetail,new,12.0,10

WallyRenfield,My first suggestion would be to find out who has placed you on their hit list  Speak to your HR manager about it  Make it sound less like an accusation and more of a What can I do to improve type of conversation  However be sure to mention how uncomfortable the situation is making you and how you feel singled out at the unprofessional way in which you heard about the hit list  If possibly ask your HR to summarize the conversation on paper and get a copy  Its a simple way to cover your ass and show misconduct on their part if they ever go through with it,1,cczxhld,1p7nr9,talesFromRetail,new,9.0,8
Techsupportvictim,Sure it can exist They can want to fire you And in almost every state they dont need a reason as we retail are at willIt is totally legal for your boss to walk up to you right now and tell you to clock out and go home and dont come back because you are being fired No reason has to be given They get like a week to send you your final paycheck even And so long as it wasnt cause you are black female and wouldnt blow the boss or such its legitNow the reason that they generally dont just dismiss folks without some kind of cause is unemployment If they cant prove they dismissed you for a reason like stealing or being constantly late then they cant deny paying you Often a reason why they want to get rid of someone that isnt a true issue is money They are trying to reduce high paid folks to keep the budget in control to get their bonuses But if any staff is getting unemployment that is a hit against that So they look for a reason they can out to the state that they fired you with cause to try to deny Watch your register document anytime someone else is using it even a manager Dont give out discounts that arent  on the board be on time etc And document document documentAnd start looking for another job,1,cd00drx,1p7nr9,talesFromRetail,new,4.0,3
pnhh,legal no anywhere this would be legal simply firing you would be as well But since its hard to prove unless you find a paper titled employees I hate and want to fire with managers signature you should start looking for a job where the manager doesnt have some personal issue with youEDIT and what uWallyRenfield said that could help,0,cczyn1t,1p7nr9,talesFromRetail,new,1.0,1

morgueanna,Same thing has happened to me He overdosed As the manager it was hard because I had to acknowledge it but then move on and try to keep everyone from dwelling on it Everyone took it a different way so I had to ensure that no one felt their feelings werent being considered but also that people didnt feel like they were the only ones moving on and carrying the workload From my own experience I think it would be good if your crew could get together after your store closes so that everyone who wants to participate can having anything during work hours is just asking to hurt someones feelings Pick a place close to the location so you know everyone can get there without any problems and just let anyone talk about what they need to talk about Then move on Maybe you can put some pictures up in the back room or perhaps instead of Employee of the Month it can be renamed John Doe of the Month after this person,14,cczn2xe,1p7pc2,talesFromRetail,new,82.0,68

zephyrlily,One thing I regret most while recovering from a loss was declining counseling  If your company offers something like that accept it Find a church counselling group even if youre not religious  See a therapistI made the mistake of rationalizing that the person wasnt that close to me even though Id known him for years  years later Im emotionally and psychologically paying for that decision every day and out of pocket once a week  I got PTSD from my handling of the distress And your friends fiancee is going to either latch onto you and talk about him constantly or completely disappear from your life  Neither of these will particularly help but the former will make you feel like a better person at leastSo yeah brains  They suck  The loss is hard enough without having to battle yourself Im so sorry for your loss,4,cczqocv,1p7pc2,talesFromRetail,new,13.0,9

everalne,Employees and coworkers are practically family for many people Who else do you consistently spend the majority of your waking hours during the weekend When you work with good people who are willing to be friends it is the best kind of friendship adults can find and keep It gets harder to make friends as you get older knowing this makes losing them even harder OP Im sorry for your loss one of my old coworkers didnt come into work one Monday morning He was disabled and lived independently We called the police just in case since he lived alone The police found him he had passed away and we had to call his family We had a short memorial period at work I didnt know him well but he was a great person to be around I wished then I knew him better and you had the opportunity to care and be cared for by a special person and that is a gift you can pass on to everyone in his honor by picking up where he left off Be strong and smile when youre not whistling  ,2,cczrtrf,1p7pc2,talesFromRetail,new,10.0,8

iaskediam,Sorry for your loss I had a young man who worked in one of my stores die and thankfully it was a big national company and they sent in grief counselors for us People handle grief in different ways and even people who arent close to the employee can become distraught while some who are closer to them might exhibit very little behavioral change Its very difficult to anticipate what someone will be going through Youre taking it pretty hard obviously and it would be great for you to have someone to talk to a counselor not just redditors so hopefully your company can make that available Call your HR department assuming that working for fast food means that you work for a national company and you might have those benefits even if your location hasnt taken advantage of it at this pointIn the meantime just remember that the memories that are rushing back and bringing you pain right now are the ones that will bring smiles to your face later when you move past grieving for your friend and on to fondly recalling him,2,cczv7vv,1p7pc2,talesFromRetail,new,4.0,2

poppish,Frig youve made me a bit sad and Im supposed to be meeting a friend  I agree with the people who said to talkIve had my closest brother die driving accident  Personally Im not a big one for talking but I know my mom was very happy when friends stopped by weeks after to check in and share good memories  At the start everyone is just in tears and family is everywhere  It doesnt last long  It says a lot when someone makes a point of stopping by afterPersonally I still tear up when I hear a particular song or watch movies that trigger memories of him and regrets  I never used to cry ever  A little emotional scar that never heals  I have no control over this  its slightly embarrassing sometimes  the only person I explained this to was my exwife who made fun of it  So I dont say anything to anyone but even I appreciate the occasional fond memory mentioned in passing from a friend and treasure it inside quietly like a little girl,1,cd02yfg,1p7pc2,talesFromRetail,new,2.0,1

FredFltStn,If he complained about a possible medical issue while on the clock and it was ignored by management he definitely has cause for a lawsuit If they actually wrote him up for bad attitude instead of offering him the option of seeking medical care theyre gone At my real job they drill this into management because of possible liability issues As the other commenters have said if HR has offered assistance its a done deal The company will definitely frame it as mismanagement to avoid corporate liability Much cheaper to fire a few managers than face a large lawsuit They can limit financial damages if they can show that it was not the culture of the company to behave this way  ,16,cd11ma3,1pcccq,talesFromRetail,new,76.0,60
Sasparillafizz,Yeahit doesnt look good for your boss HRs job is cover your ass for the company Its their job to deal with a troublesome manager the same way your managers job is to deal with a troublesome employee If hes crossing lines HR is not going to risk the company being sued further trying to protect him They will point His actions were his actions and not a representation of the policy our company has in dealing with employees we agree it was unlawful and will help to correct this problem If they side with him it will be very very difficult to defend in court HR absolutely will not lie about it either lest they be raked over the coals So unless your boss has friends or coworkers who are willing to go to bat for him and risk the consequences of striking out affecting them too Id say it doesnt look good for him But on the flip side what do we know about the employee He may have a history of problems unrelated to it and the timing of the heart attack is coincidental compared to the massive pile of reasons theyve had for firing him He had a doctors note did he inform his boss Did he have the note delivered to them in a timely manner Usually you need the paperwork and such on file within a day or two of the incident its well and good if you have a heart attack but you should have a parent or friend come in and deliver the doctors note so the bosses can file the paperwork He chose to stay for the graveyard shift so they could have had reason to doubt how severe the injury was and feel he was exaggerating to get off work Many employees do this Drop a spatula on their foot and they will cry broken foot and sit in the back for  hours Does he have a history of crying wolf or chronic medical ailments he claims that impede his ability to workFiring is a possibility demotion is a possibility slap on the wrist is a possibility nothing at all is a possible but unlikely possibility It really depends on what the higher ups are like what they are suing for exactly and what the fallout might be Dont really have enough info Its possible the boss could be fired but thats just part of a spectrum of possibilities ,8,cd0z7q6,1pcccq,talesFromRetail,new,37.0,29

themosh,There is NO way that HR is going to help sue the company   Period   I have a feeling your friend misunderstood   I have no doubt that they will investigate the situation but remember if they fire the manager they will likely be facing a wrongful termination suit from himThe good news is that HR can reinstate your friend and take disciplinary action against the manager  If I was a betting man I would say that your friend gets his job back and the manager gets reprimanded and possibly transferred to avoid the possibility of retaliation against your friend   If your friend is retaliated against  the management will be in serious trouble   My advice is to document on your own the time date and nature of any further instances of the management mistreating or being disrespectful to the staff  Its a lot easier to conduct an investigation when there are details about an incident Source  Actual HR person,3,cd16kff,1pcccq,talesFromRetail,new,13.0,10

brzcory,This will be unpopular but here it isNo callThat no call part means that while he went to the doctors office it didnt dawn on him that maybe he should call into work and let them know that he couldnt make it in Knowing that someone cant make it in versus having someone just randomly not show up is a big difference Hell when I had my appendix burst I still left a message Hey yeah Im in the hospital and I cant make it in today And if he just took  days off and then afterwards brought in the note thats not going to fly either If he handed them the note from the getgo that would free him of any liability It also depends on your individual states laws Some states protect workers with shortterm disability and whatnot but others are atwill states so you can be fired at pretty much any time for pretty much anything If youre in one of those states they could have fired him for slacking off the previous night and have no repercussionsBottom line Dont get your legal advice from reddit ,0,cd1h0g8,1pcccq,talesFromRetail,new,2.0,2

Voraxia,Celiac here It actually  at least in America effects  in  people sadly most dont know it because the symptoms are so varied and up until recently diagnosis was difficult That being said it is difficult to go out to eat sometimes I typically call ahead or at least look at a places online menu if they have one If I cant do that salad time Many places offer gluten free alternatives but I still have to ask about the rest of the ingredients to see if it is truly safe An example is Noodles and Company They offer two different types of gluten free noodles but only certain dishes become truly gluten free if I substitute those noodles and pay  extra for it as well I also have a peanut and tree nut allergy which makes things even more interesting as in I need to know exactly what is in your pesto sauceSorry some people just act silly but a lot of us will become seriously ill if we eat the wrong thing For me it isnt just a matter of picking the croutons out of a salad ,3,cd1fgfd,1pe1gs,talesFromRetail,new,16.0,13

unicorntentacles,I used to work in a big box store as the cashier over the self check out machines As a customer I love them they are easy quick and reduce my time in line As a cashier I hated them People in my area have no clue how the hell to operate them and if they do know how to use them only use them to try and rob stores blind Examples Scan  item bag  worked for smaller items swap barcodes on big items cut out a UPC for a smaller AC unit and hold it over the proper UPC while scanning deliberately forgetting items in the basket and covering them in bags and my favorite scanning the travel size and bagging the full size Our machines had A LOT of scale issues this was about  years ago and the cashier had a lot of blind spots so there was a ton of running around In the six months I worked those machines we lost several thousand dollars in merchandise because of them Eventually it got so bad that they pulled them out and turned it into a big circle with one entrance and one exit to decreasedeter theft,2,cd26o4e,1pgu6o,talesFromRetail,new,4.0,2

killerrapist,I like using them as a customer but as a cashier its damn annoying The one or two lanes with cashiers always gets long and so we have to say I can help you on self check out Of course what that really means is You can help yourself on self checkout Then they come over to use it but complain about how they dont like it I wish theyd just complain to the manager about it Im not the one making the claim that dragging them over from the lane they want to be in so they can do it themselves is because of customer service and Id be happy to let them stay over there if Im not gonna get harassed by a manager about it ,1,cd2t9q2,1pgu6o,talesFromRetail,new,3.0,2

marco,Formatted for your reading convenienceBackgroundI work the desk at a high end hair salon and spa in the USA I wasnt sure if I should post here or in rtalesfromthefrontdesk my job is pretty much half retailcashier related half answering phones but here goesWhenever the company hires a new person they put them through a  month long internship type program to get them up to the standard of excellence expected from each technician During this time they are referred to as a junior stylistcoloristetc The juniors are able to take appointments during the internship but the prices are about half of what the least expensive haircutcolor would cost with a full priced technician The salon also uses a level system for pricing meaning the longer a technician has worked there generally the more expensive their prices to reflect their skill level we are also departmentalized so stylist only cut hair and colorist only colorSo seeing a junior technician is a great deal you get a great cut or color for half the price most juniors have worked in other salons before just not as high end and they also have a mentor who checks their work before the guest leaves Also anytime a new guest comes into the salon before they leave we give them a thank you packet of coupons to use on future services that DO NOT apply to junior services as they are already heavily discounted Unfortunately the fine print on the coupons only says they cant be combined with other discounts and does not specifically list the junior program people give us a hard time about that frequentlyStorySo when I had just finished training and was working my first closing shift alone I get a phone call literally  mins before we close and I no longer have to answer the phone anymore I pick up with my normal pleasant greeting get no greeting in return just a I wanna see the junior colorist I asked her what kind of color she wants to get done on her hair and told her the days the girl is available That was the first problem The junior colorist was only at our location ThuFriSat because those are the days her mentor works Those hours apparently werent good for this womanIm doing everything I can to make it work around her schedule but there are either appointments already scheduled or the junior isnt working at that time Then the woman tells me she wants to schedule a color for mins before we close I calmly explain that we do not book color appointments that close to closing time as it will take that  mins to put the color on her hair and another mins for it to process By the time she would be shampooed and blow dried it would be about an hour and a half past close and we simply do not book appointments that wayThis is when she lost her damn mind She starts yelling at me saying So you just kick people out the door as soon as you close This is ridiculous Im trying to come there and give you my money and you cant seem to work the computer I once again calmly try to explain that we do not kick people out as soon as we close but we do book color appointments to end generally by the time we close She goes off on this huge rant about how shell have to miss her grandsons baseball game and hell be so upset and blah blah blah All Im thinking is I dont care please just give me your name so I can book this appointment and go homeShe finally gives me her name I put her down for the appointment and before getting off the phone she says oh wait I have a coupon My heart sinks as I start to explain that she cannot use a  off coupon with a junior colorist for a service that only cost  mind you So she wants to get color done for  that at the cheapest full price runs for  as the junior prices are already heavily discounted She starts reading me the small print on the card in a snarky voice saying it doesnt say anything about junior prices Once again I try to stay calm although my voice is shaking now saying that I am pretty sure the junior price would be included in the cant be combined with other offersdiscounts part She loses it again this time attacking me telling me I am the worst customer service person she has ever had to deal with she cant afford it if she cant use the coupon she is gonna have to miss her grandsons baseball blah blah blah When she finally stops I tell her I will have my manager contact her in the morning and repeat the appointment time we scheduled She tells me again my incompetence is unparalleled and hangs upI call my manager immediately on the verge of tears she calms me down tells me I didnt do anything wrong and that I was absolutely right this crazy woman cannot use the coupon for a junior serviceI will never understand why people think its ok to be so rude to customer service people,2,cd3151p,1ph8yi,talesFromRetail,new,3.0,1

Kishandreth,Ive noticed the comments section has turned into a debate about using physical pain as a means to educate children and persuade their behaviorsCountries have laws for one reason people do things regardless of the effects they have on others  A law that has no punishment or lack of enforcement means nothing to certain members of society  Not all punishments are seen as punishment depending on the personIf your daemonspawn understands why something is wrong good for them but why do they still do it  If they cant understand that theyre causing someone else to do more work make them clean it up until they learn that every mess needs to be cleaned  Sometimes all the child can understand is pain  Its hardwired into our brains to avoid pain  Sure all the child learns is to not do something because it will bring them pain but that system works well enough for our government  Its a nice stopgap measure until the child comes to a full understanding of morality charity and being an awesome person to other peopleAlso sending your child to their room is not a punishment when they have a computer and  gaming systems in said room,13,cd2s408,1phsnx,talesFromRetail,new,27.0,14

RagingReindeer,It would absolutely not occur to me to tip at Tots n Ocean Water Inc and now that I know that you expect tips Id rather just not go there at allA tip is for service which to me means personal attention above and beyond the bare minimum requirements of the position  At a restaurant the bare minimum job of a waiterwaitress is to take my order and fetch me my food but they have the opportunity to do more than that they can recommend menu items for me refill my drink and check back on me during the meal to make sure my experience is going well  So when a server at a restaurant takes the time to do those things I am delighted to tip them generously because their actions have made my meal significantly more enjoyableA carhop though what service can they provide  I place my order at a speaker and they bring me my food  Thats it  They dont come by to check on me they dont offer me refills they literally just hand me a bag of whatever I ordered  Its just like going to a drivethrough but it takes a bit longer and is slightly less convenientIm sorry your employer decided to classify you as a waiter but I dont feel any obligation to make up the difference in your salary,3,cd2w39y,1phw0o,talesFromRetail,new,9.0,6

Locclo,Ive met a woman like that before She came in to pick up her cake and she was very nice and patient when we told her that our decorated just needed to write the name on it it would just be a couple of minute Then when she gets the cake she discovers that we made the wrong one the person who took the order wrote it down wrong which is understandable because theres actually a fairly specific procedure for doing it and she was new It was the same theme some kind of Barbie cake same size same price but she wanted the alternate design not the one we madeShe flipped the fuck out at that It got to the point where she was yelling at us and repeatedly calling the person who took the order incompetent and that she should be fired Amazing how quickly some people can go from nice and friendly to HULK ANGRY,6,cd2yu4u,1pj9de,talesFromRetail,new,17.0,11

danubiss,Just so you know the money pens dont technically work It might be a real bill thats been washed and redyed The pen doesnt differentiate its just used to identify the material the bill is made from What you should have your cashiers do is check for the colorchanging ink in the bottom righthand corner Unless theyre the very old bills theyll change colors inside the number of the bill This works from  on up The colors change with each bill and when it was created Some go from green to black some gold to green So use the pen but they should always check the ink It only takes a quick twist to make sure it changes colors,7,cd2vm3z,1pjbka,talesFromRetail,new,31.0,24

Sasparillafizz,You might want to suggest to your employees how to do the other identifications for bills The pens are rubbish All it does is tell if its printed on the right kind of paper which any amateur counter fitter knows not to use printer paper big things The corner should be color changing ink it goes from gold to green Second and third hold it up to the light You should see a super imposed version of the presidents head to the side of the middle portrait if the presidents dont match it means someone washed the ink off the bill and put it through a printer with a new denomination Its called washing the bill Since its a real bill it will always pass the pen test but you can make a trillion dollar bill that way and the pen test will still call it realThe same goes for the vertical stripe Same as the president head when you hold it up to the light there should be a vertical line of words saying the bills denomination A  will say USA  USA  USA  going up the width of the bill If those dont match the denomination or arent there then the bill is fake The vertical stripe I believe is only higher denominations though not sure you would find it on ones or fives never bothered to lookBut yeah check those things instead Takes  seconds Does the corner change color as you hold it to the light When you hold it to the light do the presidents match and the vertical strip say the denomination Then  chance you are good Dont use the pens they only spot really really bad fakes,1,cd2w0g3,1pjbka,talesFromRetail,new,6.0,5

sig,Ive posted this before but its worth saying againCounterfeit pens are actually just an iodine tinture that reacts to the starch in everyday woodbased papersBecause US bills are made from cotton and linen they contain no starch and therefore dont react Any highquality counterfeits would not be printing on standard paper therefore rendering the pen ineffective at detecting a counterfeitThe pens are considered most effective detecting cheap counterfiets made on a standard copier Chances are it would be pretty obvious that something was wrong with the bill before the pen had a chance to detect that it was fakeFun fact You can create a falsepositive on real bills by rubbing cooked rice on them cutting a potato in half and rubbing that on a bill or spraying them with laundry starchhttpwwwbrandlandusacomwpcontentuploadspbJPGYou can also create a falsenegative on newsprint toiletpaper and the thin paper used in large dictionaries and religious texts,1,cd3d8x8,1pjbka,talesFromRetail,new,3.0,2

TiredRightNowALot,Hi there The formatting is making my numbers weird Im a better counter than this shows Im not sure that what I write is going to be of help but Ill throw some suggestions  Find the positive message I know that sounds lame  My organization has restructured many times  Most recently to where I had another manager come work for me  Although that sounds great he hated the idea  He didnt want to be in my location because it was further than he wanted to be from home and it just wasnt what he saw as an ideal place to be  Im not saying its a bad place or Im a bad person to work for although I may be biased but he was just unhappy  We developed a good relationship over a few months together and he finally told me how he felt  The restructuring seriously screwed him and his family it should never have happenedHeres where the positive comes from  I knew of this person I did not actually know him personally however  I knew he had a family I knew that he had some good tenure with the company  The restructuring originally had him losing his job  He makes around K a year and right now those jobs are tough to come by  So in light of this I reached out before the decision was final that he was to part ways with the company and brought him to my workplace  The positive  It was better to have a job  Unfortunately we dont know all the factors some times  So perhaps it was a case of this  either the overtime disappears or a handful of managers disappear  If its tough living with no overtime its really tough living with no income at all  Spend this time while you have a reduced income figuring out what you want to do to bridge the gap for your finances  Do you retrain for something else  Do you add a second source of income that does work with your schedule  I know it might be VERY difficult but there are options  Offer your services on an entrepreneurial level  start a business and manage that business with the assistance of your wife  Look at business opportunities with low start up but be careful  Speak with your manager or Human Resources Department  Make it very clear that you are committed to working with the business you are at but with the reduced income you need to get ahead  Make it crystal clear that you want advancement  Get a clear plan for what it takes to go from Assistant Manager to Store Manager or whatever the next step is  You may think that you already know this and people already know you want to get promoted thats fine  Do it again and do it with some real passion around the topic  Be political tell them how much you love the company the values the mission anything you can  Its a rough place to be I accepted a position a few times in my career where the money I was making dropped  versus the previous position making a great bonus at one position not making it at the next due to going to tougher assignments that had been underperforming but in the end Im up quite significantly from where I started  Took a ton of work and put myself in to some troubles along the way but it paid offIm sorry for your position and I hope that you can get out from the troubles that you are in  If there are more questions that I can answer send me a message with whatever info you want and I will do my best  Ive been in management in various positions and organizations for around  years  Ive made tough decisions that people didnt like and Ive been at the end of those tough decisions too  I think that I might have some insight Good luck ,6,cd3p1zp,1plb4a,talesFromRetail,new,3.0,-3

Sins,My most memorable story is when I quit from my first job For some reference the store was pretty bad and the managers were worse They often showed up strung out on something or did not show up at all leaving us locked out in the freezing winter weather very early in the morning So because of the managers behaviour things were often done improperly including propping open the back door or not closing it at all This piece of information is probably the most important bit and also why it is my most memorable story of me quittingAnyway so fast forward to a while later and I get tired of the hell that place had become and I quit Turns out my timing was impeccable as a month of two after I quit someone who was pissed off at the managers came in the back door which was still not secured and beat up the employees with a bat,2,cd3vq01,1plssz,talesFromRetail,new,7.0,5

unmined,I worked at a grocery store in San Diego for a few years The company used to double manufacturer coupons in addition to sale prices and specials About the worst thing that can happen to a cashier is a customer walking up to a checkstand with a bulging cart and a heap of couponsThis didnt happen frequently because the store I worked for was in a pretty wealthy neighborhood but no I certainly was NOT wealthy myself But the people who did horde coupons invariably tried to purchase items similar to what was on the coupon After all they dont want to use some other brand rightSo  since I was a bag boy Courtesy Clerk I would have to sprint all over the store to either fetch the correct item or to verify the shelf price I usually took about minper customerAny coupon that wound up being nonapplicable touched off a reaction like we were accusing the customer of grand larcenyBut my favorite by far was this A customer we named Pita pain in the ass purchased a Massengil Feminine Douche with a double coupon It was real and she got the discountThe next day  and I assure you I am NOT making this up  she came in and approached the customer service counter She wants a refund for a defective productThats right  she brought in her used douche for a refundOf course she did not have a receipt so we put on our game faces and looked up the purchase using her Club Card It was there and we began to process the refund When she saw the it was going to be something like  she protested that it cost more than thatYep we are now arguing over the value of a used doucheSo we showed her the transaction the retail price and the price she paid after applying the double coupon She was pissed but finally stopping arguing She collected her  and left the storeBut have no fear she did not leave us to shop elsewhere She was a regular for the duration of my employ,26,cd3p3oy,1pm32e,talesFromRetail,new,168.0,142

Battlepuppy,Your customer was selfish  As I read your post my first thought was since you took it on yourself to help in his mind you were claiming responsibility admitting faultThis is just one of those odd human nature things  If the person is not selfaware or unwilling to be aware its one of those thought trapsAs soon as you help someone they think its your responsibility to help them on this problem  When I was younger I did thistried to help someone when it wasnt in my area of responsibility or sometimes even my area of influence When my efforts or suggestions didnt solve it to their satisfaction they were back and angrier and rude demanding more helpNow days I always preface any attempts at help with Ill do what I can but beyond that I cant guarantee anythingWhen my suggestions dont pan out I shrug my shoulders and said sorry no other ideas  Letting them know I take no responsibility for themIn China there are very few good Samaritans  The way the law is set up if you help someone you stand the chance of being sued  The theory is if you helped them you were feeling guilty and therefore must be responsible in some matterThere can be zero connection between the Good Samaritan and the person they helped but they will still be sued because its assumed there must be SOME connection or they wouldnt havechinas laws httpknowledgenutscomchinastragicgoodsamaritanlawsOn the other side when someone attempts to help me if it doesnt work I make a point to thank them anyway and add At least you tried thank youI wish other people would make that effort but many dont,2,cd59j70,1pqru8,talesFromRetail,new,22.0,20
Techsupportvictim,Sorry you went through that I work on the flip side and we have to ask that question And encourage them to do it every time we see them I had a guy come in saying he didnt do it because we turn over all the info to the NSA and its pointless because theres a law that every cell phone has to have gps etc Which is true But thats via the carriers who only do it for the police on warrant So I tell him this and he says going to the police is too much work and he knows we can do it To wit I reply even if we could we would only do it from our corporate office after receipt of a valid police report that it was stolen He yelled about suing and calling his lawyer so I informed him that we could not prove him any further service until we received the orders issued by the court from his lawsuit Walked in the back and wrote a note on the record that he came in claiming it was his phone and it was stolen and he was told to contact police and carrier etc Not that it will do any good if someone else brings the phone in cause it takes corporate getting that police report to flag and ban a phone from service My note was simply informational cause we have to document all customer transactions and conversations I kept the serial out of interest and in the six months since that day it is still not flagged ,2,cd55cy1,1pqru8,talesFromRetail,new,8.0,6

theamazingroberto,unless its a service dog blind paraplegic etc who the hell takes a dog into any kind of store other than a pet supply storeone time i thought i was about to see a dog get shot right inside my store i am and have always been a cat person but that doesnt mean i want to see a dog get its head blown off because of their owners terrible mannersa couple came in with a dog and i tried politely at first to explain to them that they could not bring their dog in and why after reacting much like ops customer i can do whatever i want im the customer blah blah blah a sherrifs deputy came into the store i asked him to intervene and he told the couple the same thing adding that if i told them to leave for that or pretty much any other reason they had to go the wifegirlfriend tried to drag  the guy outside but he actually said the same thing to the cop that he had said to me about how he could do whatever he wanted this guy was either incredibly stupid or had a deathwish maybe both weve all sung a few lines from fuck the police under our breath as the cop pulls away after giving us a ticket but to tell one right to his face to basically fuck offthe cop took a step forward and began again sir at this point the dog began growling and the cop reflexively i assume put his hand on his sidearmthe last time i saw two people run so fast i was watching the relay race during the summer olympics,5,cd6dhjx,1pusay,talesFromRetail,new,12.0,7

Sasparillafizz,Abandon all hope ye who enter hereIn all seriousness just try to be cheerful with customers Yes they may be the th customer youve dealt with today but YOU are their first person theyve met in the store Try adn learn any sales promotions and such your store is doing If your store gives out flyers take one home and skim through it Make note of any good deals you can talk to customers about depending on the size of your store Its not as applicable to say grocery stores But stores that require a lot of interactions with customers and answering questions its good to know a few of these things off the top of your headESPECIALLY peruse any deals they are making for black friday as soon as your store makes them known You dont want to be taken off guard by customers constantly asking questions about Is this on sale How much off for big ticket itemsIf your dealing with money remember how to spot fake currency visit the secret service website if you need a refresher Holidays are when counter fitters love to do cash purchases because cashiers are horribly swamped Count your cash carefully and if you get flustered pause and ask a keyholder to double check They would much rather waste  seconds than have someone manage to quick change you or scam you And as painful as it can be good customer service really does make a difference In America in particular there is a LOT of competition in a confined space In your general vicinity no matter what form of retail there are probably at least  competitors the customer can buy the same or similar products from And if your a large chain plenty of other branches if they dont like your store in particular because its got that asshole manager who was rude to me My manager for instance stresses a story about a store in our chain down the road from us maybe  miles They gave him such a hard time about buying a warranty for his fairly cheap item he didnt go back to that store again for  years And even then he only went because he knew it was under new management Weve got  other stores within  miles of here plus all our competitors If you dont like store A its a skip and a hop to store BCD and E Try not to give them a reason to go to one of the other places you want them throwing their money at YOUR store Some managers take this a whole lot father then others but thats a manager by manager basis And if your uncertain of something ask your boss or a experienced employee Its infinitely better to be the guy who asks a lot of questions than the guy who fucks up frequently Oh And get plenty of rest before black Friday and do not drink or get shitfaced on Thanksgiving Trust me You can wait till after black Friday to party because that  hours will be x harder than any other day in the two weeks leading up to or following And if you get unreasonable customers you can always come on TFR and vent for a bit,1,cd6duv7,1pv5vh,talesFromRetail,new,17.0,16
morgueanna,Leave early every day If youve never had to be at a retail establishment at a certain time during the holidays you have no idea how busy it is You will need to fight traffic find parking and maneuver your way through lines of waiting shoppersPack a lunch You will not have time on your  minute break to go wait in line at a fast food restaurant Also take snacks and mints so you can munch all day and keep your energy upDouble check your schedule every shift Ensure your manager is not one of the crazy ones that changes something every shift Dont give out your contact info to your fellow employees unless you want to cover a bunch of their shifts because they will be callingtexting you every Friday and Saturday to do soCustomersBelieve it or not after reading this sub most people are pretty average Its just that during the holiday season you see a lot more people so the odds of having a bad experience go upMost importantly remember that the merchandise in the store and the money the store makes is not yours personally So dont take offense when someone tries to scam their way into getting it Youre a placeholder and there are hundreds of placeholders just like you all across the retail world Your manager and peers may like you as a person but you are easily replaceable just as your job is Dont get too attached and dont take things personally Show up on time do what youre told smile and when you go home leave work at work,3,cd6iqfu,1pv5vh,talesFromRetail,new,9.0,6

SonGoku,gt I know this isnt explicitly retail but I would love to share this good ol story of mine as I procrastinate writing a really boring papergt I worked a couple years ago as a lifeguard at an indoor pool facility The facility consists of a leisure pool  that never gets deeper than  has a waterslide etc a lap pool for exercise a sauna and a hot tub IIRC it was a Sunday which means there was no executive staff Aquatics Director and the Head Guard on shift was on break he was pretty handsome and off flirting with one of the cute girls working at the front desk gt Anyways there were two guards on duty I was assigned to watch the lap pool sauna and hot tub while the other guard watched the leisure pool While walking around scanning the area I came across a man in the hot tub who had his face submerged in the water for an extended period of time THIS IS A HUGE RED FLAG for obvious and not so obvious reasons So when I get around to the hot tub I tap him with my rescue tube and explain to him the several rules hes violating and he seems cool with it and I return to pacing around the pool rethinking my decisions in life gt When I get back around to where he is he stops me I dont understand why I cant just put my face in the water gt I explain to him well sir when I see someone laying face first in the water I assume that something is wrong regardless of how deep the water is A lot of people like to come in here after they work out and they are prone to losing consciousness especially in hot water with steamy humid air Yea but I pay a lot of money to use this place I should be able to do what I want I understand sir but these rules are here for your safety and the safety of others thats when I uttered every underlings favorite words would you like to discuss this with my supervisor of course he agreed gt Now I think its important at this point to explain that this fucker was MASSIVE like probably ex marine huge and I am the typical gawky awkward swimmer with a tiny ass waist no fat and lean muscle I can barely do a pull up but I have a breast stroke that would knock your socks off but I digress So I wait until I am relieved then I go and try and find the Head Guard lets call him Roman gt So Roman is a huge ass motherfucker that left about a month after this incident to become a cop I explain to him this asshats inability to comprehend something that most  year olds dont have to be told twice to not do So Im relieved of any responsibility to enjoy my break by eating Ritz and peanut butter fuck yea After a minute or so I hear elevated voices gt So I step outside and the asshat is beet red and Roman is chill as cucumber fuck yea veggie analogies I pay  fucking dollars a month I should be able to do whatever the fuck I want Roman keeps his cool and explains what I already told him I wont listen to some little shit telling me what to do as he says this he jabs his finger towards me and in his eyes I saw the pure fury and rage that is steroid abuse gt Eventually he calms down and the rest of the story was retold to me as I wasnt involved in the rest of the deliberations Long story short this guy gets taken off the premises handcuffed and in the back of a squad car He is banned from all locations of this HUGE INTERNATIONAL nonprofit fitness centers and if he ever trespasses he will promptly be arrested Thankfully no fists were thrown cause I dont feel like going to court,1,cd8b0ks,1q0fc0,talesFromRetail,new,7.0,6

AwkwardBurritoChick,In having to deal with elders that are apt to take out their fury on you when you are trying to help them and resort to being threatened insulted and being told youre inferior the method I use is to simply hear them out keep calm realize they are pissed at life and the world and not you keep your demeanor and let them state their grievances  Once they state what they are upset about simply repeat their complaint and then state you appreciate their feedback will pass the information on to upper management and then shut it down by asking if there was anything else you can help them with  They usually dont and if they do repeat process and inform appropriate parties  Many people when you reiterate even verbatim their complaint they are mortified when they hear their own wordsIn my experience this will diffuse about  of the situation as some people especially elders just want to be heard and acknowledged and know their bitch rants are usually about minimal things  To thank them for the feedback and to state to them that they were heard and youll bring up for consideration usually is enough  There is the other  that will push a stupid bitch rant to upper and you then let your supervisor or manager about it after you tell the clientcustomerperson know you are doing as such Its also okay to politely say when you are sure of policy to inform them if you dont mind this is out of my authority and you may contact soandso however they like me are upheld to the same policies Ive described  Yet if there is anything that can be done theyll be better able to inform you of alternatives that I may not be aware or authorized to grant towards a remedy that you are seekingThe biggest key to dealing with customers especially elders is that they are usually so cranky that they have chased off family and friends and so they victimize anyone and everyone they can to assert their dominance Nevereverargueback with these people Ever  Again just take the information in pass and defer it upwards and again keep professional no matter whatand if your organization does allow customers to be abusive threaten you then there is a huge issue with management You dont need to seek a new job to avoid such customers you need to work for an organization and company that knows how to deal with these abusive people Being old or elderly is not a pass to being abusive and if you have a meeting state that if these type of customers are put in touch with upper management that you can no longer work in a hostile work environment  Yeah I went there because if your clients or customers are that belligerent towards you that is a hostile work environment and most illegal and  your companyorganization should address   No one and legally upheld should not work in an environment with hostility and harassment Internally and externally  If your company allows this person to ever return to your company again Id seek a lawyer   The customer isnt always right and there are many laws as to working in a harassment free environment   Your uppers and managers should ensure these aspects for many legal reasons,0,cd8m4tl,1q28cl,talesFromRetail,new,4.0,4

harpyranchers,There are customer service jobs that can be wonderful or at least tolerable  I work in phone based IT support and believe me we get customers who get out of line  The key difference is we have great management and supervisors who will go to bat for us  If customer interaction rises to the level of abuse we are allowed to refuse service  If this becomes a regular occurrence customers are returned their service contract fee and invited to never bother us againIve worked other places where things are very different the customer is king and given a depute you will get thrown under the bus first  This is intolerable soul crushing and I am sorry you have to put up with it  In my opinion this is a huge problem in the service industry where policy allows lower level employees to be punching bags who are in turn then punished because they had the misfortune of dealing with an uncivilized human beingIts not a customer service problem its a management problem,0,cd8ts9p,1q28cl,talesFromRetail,new,1.0,1

walloftextno,gt Sorry for the wall of textTHIS is a wall of text Make a notegtLittle bit of background I work at a campus IT place where were registered with Apple to repair their systems We do out of warranty repair too but that tends to cost moneysince the system is out of warranty after all This is good because a lot of kids on campus use Apple computers  and very few of them know how to fix anything In particular given our location this means a lot of older folks from departments and a lot of greek life This story is about a very loud member of the latter Cast Twoface the girl who came in  TF for short M the coworker with me at the time B my supervisor And lastly me WARNING This story contains harsh language given the language this customer used Also I curse like a sailor My apologies   Me Hi how can I help you today    TF OH MY GOD Im freaking out right now I promise you Im just going to like freak out I swear Im actually making this less stereotypical My computer is like fucked    Me Well if you have it with you we can take a look at it What kind of computer is itAt this point I look her up and down Workout clothes bright neon shoes tight yoga pants North face jacket schoolbranded and sororitybranded JanSport backpack I know its a mac   TF as she takes out her macbook from her backpack Its a mac Do you guys fix macs Please help me    Me staying calm since that usually helps stressed out customers Ignoring the multiple plaques and displays showing that we are Apple affiliated and the two giant pillars behind her with Apple logos Yes we do actually Let me take a look  what seems to be the problem TF now goes on a good five minute long rant about how her computer just crashed on her and it totally wasnt her fault At this point she hasnt let me ask a single question    TF So then the computer restarted and it was just a flashing question mark at this point shes noticeably calmed down  Im thinking Im in the clear   Me this only occurs if  the HDD experienced a complete mechanical failure or  the flex cables bad Its almost always  especially without any loud clicking occuring Well luckily its probably a pretty simple fix  this issue is normally the flex cable going bad This fix is pretty cheap if that is the case but theres the chance its the hard drive thats bad Wed need to check it in for testing if thats okay Well contact you as soon as we know what the repair options are    TF YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT I NEED IT BACK TODAY we close in an hour and a half UGH Okay When can I find out whats wrong with it    Me Ill start testing on it immediately We should be able to contact you in two days by the latest but could have an answer by tomorrow late afternoon If you want to and you havent been called come in tomorrow at around  PM or call and we can give you an updatePaperwork gets signed she leaves She was actually not awful by the end of it having calmed down a bit M is confused as to why she seemed so agitated but was helping his own people and we kind of just laughed it offNEXT DAY TF suddenly barges in at  PM demanding for her computer back This part is hearsay but three sources gave me really similar information  I had left just a half hour earlier    TF IS MY COMPUTER DONE YET    M Sorry but what is your name    TF TWOFACE McCUNTOCTOPUS YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS    M Im sorry Ms McCuntoctopus let me check the paperwork right nowwell it looks like your system finished testing for tier one I finished it that morning and its currently finishing testing in the back Begins to radio the back for information on the testing  we dont always have life updates on the system until testing is finished    TF WHY DONT YOU ALREADY KNOW WHATS HAPPENING THIS IS YOUR JOB    M after getting a response from the back Well it looks like your flex cable is in need of replacement  your hard drive came up fine and testing with other hard drives showed the cable was faulty Well need to order one Thatll be here tomorrow if we get your okay and its  for the part and  for installa    TF YOU MEAN I HAVE TO PAY    M Well yes maam given that youre out of warranty    TF WHAT THE FUCK THE ASSHOLE YESTERDAY DIDNT SAY I HAD TO PAY    M Actually right here on the paperwork you signed off on it being an out of warranty repair and agreeing to it being a charge It also says so in our Work Agreement which is right above your signature in bold    TF WHAT THE HELL THIS IS BULLSHIT THAT GUY YESTERDAY WAS LITERALLY THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE IVE EVER HAD HE NEVER EVEN TOLD ME I GET CHARGED FOR THIS I WOULDNT HAVE DONE IT IF HE TOLD ME I GOT CHARGED FOR THIS well actually its on the paperwork TWICE that she was going to be charged for this repair a minimum of  for the diagnostic which is waved if we do any repairs I read it out to her out loud before having her sign I WANT HIM FIRED HE WAS LITERALLY THE WORST HELPER IVE EVER MET    M Are weare we talking about the same person I was here when you were checked in and he went through all of the procedure with you He even pushed you up the queue given you had stated it was an emergency and seemed distressed    TF THATS IT I WANT TO SPEAK WITH YOUR SUPERVISORAt this point my super comes out  a bigger guy who hasnt really worked a supervisors position before this and is EXTREMELY new Also kind of a huge accidentalsarcastically accidental dick a lot of the time Poor guy wasnt ready    TF YOUR EMPLOYEES ARE TERRIBLE THEYRE TRYING TO CHARGE ME FOR A REPAIR THAT SHOULD BE FREE    B Maam theyre just doing your job And I have it right here on my paperwork that you agreed to paying for the system repairs or diagnostic    TF WELL FUCK YOU FAGGOT this didnt blow over well given my supervisor is actually gay I DIDNT AGREE TO SHIT I WANT MY COMPUTER BACKSadly having missed this this apparently became a giant screaming match  one sided really B kept trying to explain to her that literally no one would do this cheaper and taking it to the Apple store will net the same result and require driving He gave up after a few minutes though    B Well if you want your system back right now I can pack it up immediately but itll still be the  for diagnostics before we can release to you This caused more of the exact same argument and then she began yelling about me needing to be fired again and that he should be fired as well and that M should be fired Basically this girl wanted our whole department gone    TF finally giving up FINE Ill just take it to Apple then Theyll do a better jobAfter a bit more cussing at us she finally pays the  and goes to Apple B having worked at the Apple store notes that the girl just wasted well over  extra  the fix from us would have taken just one day longer would have been done day after all this and she would have only needed to pay  more for all her issues to be solvedPeople are soodd sometimesSorry for the wall of textTLDR Some girl doesnt listen to what shes signing to requests for a whole department to be fired and

mrdm,Back in my tech support days I fielded several TDD calls Fortunately none of the callers were very upset but still it took forever to resolve even basic issues with the delay in communication Definitely aggravating for everyone involved,1,cd8x8g6,1q3l7r,talesFromRetail,new,4.0,3
onlymrfstr,Ive felt your pain man those TDD calls can be so tedious  I got yelled at by an operator once it was the first time I had ever taken one of those calls and the operator explicitly states at the begining of the call This is a TDD call blah blah blah dont talk to me as though I am a go between talk as though you are speaking directly to the caller  Dont use words like he she  they them but rather you or call them by name  Well thats all well and good but again this was the first time I had taken such a call and was kind of unnerved by it think we were super busy at the time and kept saying he or them  the operator snapped on me SIR My job is to type exactly what you are saying to the caller  If you cant follow this simple direction it makes my job harder and this call will last much longer than necessary  that was so much fun,1,cd8xgep,1q3l7r,talesFromRetail,new,5.0,4
tidymaze,I took a TDDTTY call when I worked in retail I was on the phone for  minutes I knew I was helping the customer and it was a pleasant call questions about products but it was a nightmare on my end I kept getting asked by managers why I was on the phone for so long and one manager actually picked up the extension on another phone just to make sure I wasnt on a personal call,1,cd8xp3q,1q3l7r,talesFromRetail,new,5.0,4
restingparrot,I once got a relay call from someone who was wanted to speak even though he couldnt hear me So the operator would type what I said and then he would speak Now if you have tried to talk to a lot of deaf people you will understand that some of them are pretty easy to understand and some of them are not I know it isnt their fault They cant hear themselves Anyway this guy was nearly impossible to understand over the phone I dont remember what he needed help with but it was a very long call because I kept needing to ask him to repeat himself He called back several times and always wanted to speak with me That was the worst relay call that I have ever had Side note I swear they hire the slowest typists possible for the government relay service Im not that fast but I could go much faster than they did Video relay is about a million times better because the operator would actually sign with the caller and it is much closer to a normal conversation ,1,cd8zg9q,1q3l7r,talesFromRetail,new,5.0,4
iamfreakingdeaf,I just dont understand how TDDTTYIPrelay Same thing different devices is still existing Today most companies are willing to do emails IM and the like Most deaf people now also have video relay service that does not suffer the same stop and go conversation nearly as badly as the TTYTTDIPrelay especially since the interpreters can use their hand at the same time while speaking and hearing and get immediate feedback from the callersIm deaf and goes to a deaf university the only two place I really noticed any TTY is either in the museum or are bolted down to the pay phones in one side of the building Thats it We all uses Video Relay Service and other online alternative far more,1,cd8zwkj,1q3l7r,talesFromRetail,new,4.0,3

SanityInAnarchy,gt Basically you tell the operator whatever youd like to say making sure to speak slowly The operator types your end of the conversation on a keyboard and then sends it to the hearing impaired user The user then reads the message types in their reply and sends it back to the operator The operator then reads the reply back to youThis is not the only way this can work In at least one state the operator is using speechrecognition software Since thats most effective when its trained to a specific persons voice it still makes sense for there to be a human operator thereAlso hearingimpaired doesnt necessarily mean they cant talk My grandmother has been slowly going deaf so she uses this lipreading and she can probably hear some bits of conversation as wellThe net result is that sometimes systems like this can be so close to a normal conversation that you forget theres an operator involved,0,cd9bxde,1q3l7r,talesFromRetail,new,4.0,4

MysticSpiral,I work in clothing so I get this a lot We have a lot of stock so most times I will double check the back especially since the newer girls dont have the system down yet However If there is only one of an item on a table or hanging  times out of  that is the only one But no one ever believes me So I get to have a nice conversation in the back with an associate for a few minutes ,0,cd9po3q,1q5ao4,talesFromRetail,new,2.0,2

ThirdShiftStocker,Hmm reminds me of my last few weeks working overnights at a big box department store We had a slight overstock issue but it does not even compare to your story OP Our backroom was filled to the point where there was only one path wide enough to navigate with the pallet jacks and pallets upon pallets of shit in the backroom Most things had been sitting there for some time with some things being there as long as  years Its ridiculousEventually it got to that point where I kept seeing more of the same product and following protocol couldnt just bullshit it and put it anywhere that the modular sheet does not specify so it has to go back A few nights later I was seeing red because of all the chewing out the overnight team would get for not working fast or hard enough and eventually walked off the job I wasnt having it anymore,2,cd9idsh,1q5igw,talesFromRetail,new,10.0,8

lostforever,I feel like a bad person but this is why when people ask me to call another and I dont like them I tell them this Im sorry but our entire area is sold out because all our stores have the same warehouse so if we are out here they will be out there It makes me sound knowledgeable the sentence is a flood of information and most people have no way too push for more info after that because its generally about a onetimespecial item I figure if it is selling out that me pulling this off cant hurt sales ,3,cd9i3mk,1q5ms7,talesFromRetail,new,10.0,7
ctkatz,Our local yellow pages did a wonderful thing by listing all of our restaurants in the phone book by phone numbernot by store number or even address or franchise group just by phone number there have been many times where people call us asking for another stores number we dont have it even if we do have it we dont have it or if we could look it up we have to check the phone book same as you even worse is when people call the wrong store number and expect us to know about their complaint and fix their problem without the food or receipt in hand We dont have a database of all food complaints  when I point this out to people they insist that it was us even though there is another one of our stores corporate owned about a mile away from us,0,cd9kqt8,1q5ms7,talesFromRetail,new,5.0,5

etterboce,I hate it when they want us to call other stores to find a product I used to work in a larger city before I transferred Our company has six locations in that city On top of it our inventory system only updates at night and its frequently incorrect anywayOur stores are always understaffed as well so calling another location that was equally understaffed can take a long time I had customers who would want me to spend  minutes calling other locations for them Personally I would have preferred to have given them the list of phone numbers myself so they could call on their own but that would be terrible customer serviceLuckily my new store is in a smaller town with our closest other location at about  miles away We only have one direct competitor which is nice because this alleviates another irritant we price match and have to verify competitors prices by calling them on the phone To qualify for a price match the competitor must be within  miles of our location Now when a customer asks me to price match I enjoy smiling at them and inviting them to get in the car and drive an hour each way to get their discount that is if the deal even exists or the competitor actually has it in stock,1,cd9s37n,1q5ms7,talesFromRetail,new,2.0,1

notmyfaultyousuck,Cutting her off in Spanish saying just because you speak Spanish doesnt mean nobody else does and seen her reaction I have a story from many moons ago where I was the customer at a coffee shop in Alberta I was travelling across the country with my boyfriend and his family when we stopped at said coffee shop and the two cashiers working were speaking in French to each other and insulting the customers in the store My boyfriends family are French and I speak French so while we were waiting in line these two girls were calling the customers so obese they shouldnt be allowed in public and other things My boyfriends mom was FUMING by the time it was our turnWhen we got to the counter my boyfriends mom put in a fake smile and said in translated words Hi it astounds me that two young ladies like yourselves could be so rude Just because you speak French doesnt mean that nobody else in this place doesnt You should be ashamed of yourselves The two girls were floored because they knew they got caughtShe went on to speak to their manager and explain the situation but I dont know if anything came of it TLDR Just because you speak a foreign language doesnt mean we dont understand what youre saying,8,cd9l9ho,1q5nem,talesFromRetail,new,45.0,37

morgueanna,I think you need to speak to a different manager whether that be a district manager or whomever you feel would have the power to make a policy changeAt my store when anyone left for the day sales person register person back room person whoever the MOD had to do a walkthrough of their area of the store ask them what tasks they completed that day ask to see their checklist of duties and initial beside every project that was finished and leave notes as to why others were not done Then the MOD would take  seconds to give some positive feedback thank them for their work and send them to clock out For your particular department that list could include how much shipment was received and at what time how many boxes were emptied basically how much work was received versus finished Then before the back room person leaves the MOD has to walk it look at that fucking mess and accept responsibility for it by signing that duty sheet with their own initials saying they saw it that way and its fineManagers at your store need to be taking responsibility They are ultimately responsible for everything that does or does not get done in the store thats why they make the money they do So tell them to man up and put their fucking name on the work,1,cda2q3f,1q5ngm,talesFromRetail,new,2.0,1

zephyrlily,My mother was an acting psychiatrist for a while she teaches now   She is the reason I dont have any scars but she confided in me a few years ago that if Id selfharmed shed have paid for the sleeve tattoos  There is just less of a stigma with tattoos than with scars in society If it ever becomes unbearable you can cut a hole at the toes of stockings and wear them as protectors  Flesh colored matte stockings people will probably never notice and they certainly dont keep my legs warm so they wont make you overheat  I have absolutely awful markings on my legs from burns covering just below the knee to my feet so I pretty much bought stock in opaque tightsBut that last woman you mentioned makes me so mad for you and simultaneously want to give you a hug  Im high strung if shed said that to me Id have slapped her in her face job or no job Whew,1,cdab1bl,1q7w5a,talesFromRetail,new,3.0,2

PopTheButterfly,I have rare moments of glory One day Christmas shopping was stressed because of finals I was NOT in a good mood I walked by some girl at a kiosk trying to get people to buy her hair shit I walk by trying to walk as fast as possible but she jumps in front of me and asks me if I would be interested in her product I said I wasnt and for her to have a good day and tried to walk around her She then YELLS and I mean so loud that the people in the stores walked out to see the commotion that my hair wouldnt look nearly as oily as it does if I used her product I lost itI told her that not only is it rude to insult people about their hair but that was why she didnt have any customers as no one wants to shop from somewhere that insults their customers I told her I would look into her company and will make a complaint to the highest authority that I could Then I had a Stephanie Tanner moment and added in a last HOW RUDE and walked off as fast as possibleI did consider calling the main company but then came to my senses and figured that she was just stressed and it came out wrong Unfortunately the next time I went to that mall its really far away from my home and so I only visit it every couple of months or so her little kiosk was gone ,3,cdahyv5,1q8d1o,talesFromRetail,new,11.0,8

InspectorVII,The store I used to work at had several small plastic display shelves  They werent overly sturdy they werent overly expensive   We used them to showcase different productsOne day I was serving this oblivious parent and her monster of a child  The kid was running around the store knocking things of shelves   Hiding and generally being a nuisance  Absolutely zero fucks given from mom   So I pipe up and tell the kid to stop knocking things on the floor because something will get broken  The kid looks at me mulls that over for a moment and starts smacking the plastic display shelves breaking three of themMom shrugs looks at me and says Little boys are so rough of thingsTo which I reply How will you be paying to replace those shelves they are only about  eachOf course mom leaves while telling me how she is going to report me to the owner  She doesnt pay for the shelves she does not take this moment to teach her child accountabilityBonus points  She did contact the owner whose response to the situation is How do you plan on reimbursing me for the fixtures your child broke and the time I have had to take listening to your nonsense,4,cdabpj1,1q8dy4,talesFromRetail,new,31.0,27

Miaoudeminou,Yeah I had issues with the break room at the same big retailer   Mine had to do with the break room being two rooms One was the main break room that most people sat in Then there was the smaller one which had a door because it used to be the smoking room with ventilation before laws were passed stating you couldnt smoke inside a building I too liked to read while on break but sitting in the larger of the two break rooms lead to people coming to talk to me or ask me questions about my book while I was reading So I removed myself and ended up sitting in the smaller break room Which at first was fine and everyone left me alone Then we had an associate switch locations to the one I was working at She decided she was queen bee and everything was hers She would purposely be in the small break room during my breaks and talk as loudly as she could on her phone Which would force me into the large break room where everyone was shouting from one end to the other to talk to each other seriously these people lacked inside voices One day I didnt see this queen bee in the break room and took it upon myself to go sit in the small room And not even five minutes later queen bee comes in chattering as loudly as she can on her phone I ask her politely to leave because she was disturbing my quiet reading time She wouldnt and proceeded to talk even louder So I started loudly mocking her Then we had a yelling contest I finally got fed up with dealing with her dumba and left the room She made the whole HAHA I WIN face at me so I flipped her off We got called into HR to get along and she didnt bother me much after that I was in my early s and not quite mature so I handled the whole situation the wrong way Looking back at it many years later I realize I should have ended up eating at the fast food place I bought my food or in my car My coworkers were jerks and lacked respect for me Yet I was supposed to treat them with the utmost respect   Working that retail place was a complete joke I wish I had never done it Its been two years since I left but I still have a lot of social anxiety from dealing with customers coworkers CSMCSSs and management constantly berating me,10,cdaf7hf,1q8pnz,talesFromRetail,new,30.0,20

SeaBones,The pyramid scheme led by Arbonne has taken over my step mother and step sisters life They push their crap at every family event and somehow their friends arent annoyed by it They can become specialists in skincare and other nonsense despite knowing nothing and just regurgitating what Arbonne wants them to say about their products Its completely ridiculous and Im forever lost on the concept and why anyone falls for itDoing it on company time adds an entire new layer of ridiculousness to an already stupid ordeal,1,cdcy5vz,1q9buv,talesFromRetail,new,3.0,2
OC,I think you should have taken a slightly different tack with this situation  You also seem to have a commonly held misconception about HR  their main role is not to protect the employees but rather to protect the company  Many times those end up being the same role but the company comes firstYou probably should have first gone to Reginas boss or the DM  If you didnt get a receptive ear from them you go to their boss next To them you should have expressed concern that shes not generating enough sales because shes spending too much time trying to sell Amway while one the clock and that youre not able to do your job because Amways a distraction  And also expressed concern that other employees and potential seasonal employees might be distracted by the Amway pitch Your complaint to HR should have been that you were concerned about negative repercussions from her due to your lack of interest in Amway  Can she reprimand someone if they dont purchase Amway  Can she fire someone if they dont sign up enough Amway people  Can she use Amway as a hiring tool  Your bosses probably care most about sales and store work  HR probably cares most about unjustifiable terminations IE being forced to pay unemployment and problematic hiring practicesDont be surprised if shes still working or shes still a manager after this all settles down  Unless its a clear and documented violation of company policy and that she has a poor work history already its unlikely HR will push for her firing  Theyre much more likely to suggest that it be documented and have her reprimanded first  I suspect itll only be after multiple documented violations that they push for her demotion or firingGood luck,3,cdb1h54,1q9buv,talesFromRetail,new,3.0,0

IAmNotHarryStyles,I worked at a popup shop that sold merchandise for a very popular boy band  We had two sorts of bags The first were the ones that were printed with a picture of the guys and the store logo and all that crazy stuff  We charged  for them in part because they apparently charge for bags in Great Britain so that came from higher upoutside the USA and in part because the bags actually cost something like  each to print and it would be a pretty big loss to give them away  The second were regular plastic Thank You bags those were freeYoud think that I was Satan himself when I said Would you like to buy a souvenir bag for   People got IRATE  Damn  They would get SO MAD  Calm down I can still give you a plain bag for free NOPE not good enough for my little Ava she has to have her two  shirts IN THE SOUVENIR BAG BUT IM NOT PAYING A PENNY OVER   I was called a cheat and a scammer  Me of course  Not the store not the marketing company that ran the stores not the band that your daughter probably wont even like in  years me,5,cdb0gu0,1qaf43,talesFromRetail,new,20.0,15

toxlab,Yup nickel and diming I do have to admit that I once got salty over a sixty one cent charge but it was presented at the end of a long drawn out battle with a company and at that point they had a better chance of me giving them one of my testicles than another red centIve reached into my pocket a couple of times just so I could throw a nickle at someone being a prick and say Here you go A nickle doesnt mean shit to me but since your world is going to end if you have to pry one out of your wallet Im glad I could save youI also had a dude purchase a game from me at a flea market booth and when I explained I was three cents short on his change he flipped his shit I let him yell for a while and then opened the loading door opened my car door swiped some loose change off the floorboards along with some dirt clods and other crap and then poured it into his hands and said There you go I turned and walked away and he FLUNG THE CHANGE AT ME My boss was a great guy and I knew had there been an issue he would have backed me up but I followed the guy for a minute regardless so I could let him know I would be happy to knock his teeth down his throat if he felt froggy enough to try something while I was facing him ,4,cdaxh4f,1qaf43,talesFromRetail,new,12.0,8

MagicalKartWizard,As my stores only FT cartpusher my favorite is when a corral has been nudged down for whatever reason and a customer parks in the space behind it The first time this happened I considered blocking them in with carts Two things stopped me One The security cameras would have seen me Two I didnt have time right then as I was being callwd inside to act as maintanence I returned a few minutes later to find that the other customers had already done so I made that my last pickup that hour,2,cdb2oiw,1qamkp,talesFromRetail,new,6.0,4

swilty,i cannot stand when i go shopping with anyone who leaves carts in random places in the parking lot i will always return it no matter how far it is its inconsiderate to the employees and other customers since the cart could easily dent a car if there is a gust of wind and the cart isnt securedi also hate when people put things in their cart decide they dont want it and then just put it on some random shelf in the store im not a very neatorganized person when it comes to my own things but i dont go around making a mess for others to clean up,1,cdbsoxz,1qamkp,talesFromRetail,new,3.0,2

toxlab,A while ago someone posted asking what they could do to be more courteous shoppers for Black Friday and the upcoming madness When I suggested this a few people got pissyI cannot for the life of me figure out why more people dont just move the fuck over after they complete their transaction They dont have to move far just take one big sidestep before rearranging change and cards digging for keys putting on coats or gloves checking your phone or any other happy crappyI even thought to mention that cashiers are often judged on time per transaction and doing this made their numbers suffer People still grumbledI just went grocery shopping I piled my junk on the conveyor greeted the cashier pushed my cart forward to make room behind me paid stepped aside rearranged my wallet packed up my purchases and left The guy behind me was already twenty seconds into his transaction and all it took was me moving my ass a grand total of three feet to make it happen,10,cdax27n,1qao2b,talesFromRetail,new,37.0,27

toomuchpapertowel,Where I work liquorconvenience store were also only supposed to keep a small amount of change in our drawer but corporate wants us to accept large bills no matter what  Now I have no problem accepting a  bill for a reasonably large order but the people that come in at  am and try to buy a  item with a hundred can go fuck themselves  Like I said however the higher ups want us to take it anyway  Our store manager on the other hand is very much of the screw you were not a bank mindset so as long as we handle it in a way that wont get reported to headquarters its all good  The best way Ive found to handle this is if your drawer isnt in a position to accommodate a large bill let the person know Im sorry I dont think I have enough to break that right now or well I can probably break that but youre going to get mostly fives and ones  How they respond determines how this transaction progresses  Many times the person will use a card or find some smaller bills  If this is all they have and they are polite about it I can buy change from the safe with their hundred or ask another cashier if theyve got some twenties if they immediately shift into screaming dick mode then Im sorry there is physically nothing I can do my drawer does not have that much in it even if it does and you can go to any of the  banks within a five minute walkEdit for another frustrating story I just remembered  Had a guy pay for two bottles of vodka  purchase with a fifty no problem thats reasonable  As soon as it was complete however he just remembered that he needed a third  So I ring him up for another  bucks and he hands me another fifty  Nope not happening stare at him in exasperation for a moment then tell him that he had just cleaned me out of smaller bills with his fifty and that he was free to pay with any of the change that I knew he now had  Thankfully his friend stepped in and paid with a card before it got too contentious,9,cdbbh06,1qc1yz,talesFromRetail,new,39.0,30

arglebargleIV,I worked for RGIS for a couple of months Pros   If you can count its not difficultCons   The work locations were scattered all over the place I didnt like driving to a different place for work every day   Hours and schedules were very erratic and unpredictable   A lot of the stores wanted inventory done when the store was closed which meant you might be working  am to  am and then somewhere else later that same day from  pm to midnight   Grocery stores often had us do inventory during regular open hours Having to work around shoppers while on a tight time schedule could be frustrating   Its all numbersbased how many things can you count in an hour  Some things you can fly through but some things say clothes with tags buried inside rather than hanging on the outside so you have to fish each one out take longer and you end up with lower speedratings if you are counting that type of product   Like many jobs the written rules are directly contradicted by the verbal instructions For instances you are officially told to never ever estimate the number of anything always count exactly And yet when I was counting the candy racks at a grocery store checkout I was scolded for actually counting each bag of MampMs in the box I was apparently supposed to pick up the box estimate how full it was and base the count on that eg if the box felt about threequarters full and originally had  packs I should record  and move on A firing offense on paper required in practice,0,cdbeug5,1qc6tq,talesFromRetail,new,4.0,4

jonpants,Props to the Mom but it is kind of sad to see this kind of good in my opinion parenting referred to as old school because it should be the norm I hear kids my daughters age  talk back and act out towards their parents in ways that would have gotten me grounded or god forbid smacked on the ass It makes me feel old to say this but the majority of young kids I see in my store have no respect or fear of their parents Sadly the parents dont command it either They just give them the electronic gadget and hope they shut up On the other hand today I saw a parent scream at their three month old child for crying I almost walked over and smacked the woman I dont understand that logic  My infant is crying so this loud angry noise from me should make it stop If I see a well behaved kid in my store I make it a point to compliment the child and hook them up with some stickers or the like Its awesome to see the kid get all excited because someone said they were well behaved and rewarded them for it Well that turned in to quite the rant Ill get off my soapbox now ,7,cdcdv4n,1qekfj,talesFromRetail,new,38.0,31

CrazyOverlord,I work with Stacy I dont like Stacy           First of all Stacy acts like she knows everything           A lady wanted to buy a  tablet and inquired about the refund policy Usually with bigticketed items like this we will only do returns if the item is unopended and it is within  days I mentioned this to the lady and told her that I would call my manager just to confirm In comes Stacy declaring Oh I know this She takes on a whole authoritative persona and tells this lady that she could return this product opened as long as theres no scratches and everything looks fine WTF Essentially she took over my transaction and acted as though she was my superior or something I knew she was dead wrong with the policy and later on confirmed with with a supervisor A couple of weeks later the lady who bought the tablet came in to return it  luckily it was unopened      This girl was even dumb enough to put an Xbox on hold under a sign that said DONT PUT ELECTRONICS ON HOLD Someone else called in inquiring about Xboxes Unable to find any others I asked her what time the customer who she put it on hold for would come by She told me she didnt know I asked her what their number was we always ask for a number and she proceeds to tell me that she didnt take one down SMH I asked my supervisor what to do and she told me that whoever came for the system first would get it Both customers came at the same time but luckily my manager was able to find another one           Working with Stacy is a pain  Not only did she forget about her shift  days before Christmas leaving me as the only cashier she still refused to come in when she was told she was scheduled for that day I had asked that morning if it would be possible to leave early for a family thing and my manager had initially approved it but after Stacy stiffed us everyone ended up staying half an hour longer This was also the day that our gift card system went down  MOSTSTRESSFULDAYEVER    Last year she would called me at  and pm asking me to take her shift  which starts at  claiming that an exam got changed Now I would believe this if it wasnt the th time that she has used this excuse She forgot to book off her exams and tried to fob them off the day before Our schedules at work are set  weeks in advance and our shifts are pretty much set I know I work weekend mornings and Monday nights Its annoying and frustrating hearing her look for sympathy when in reality its her own fault for being so dumb  She also likes doing the work of the merchandisers when she should be working on the line up thats over  people long She spends all this time chatting up customers which is extremely frustrating especially since that means that I have to work to churn out these customers faster This is work time  not time time to socialize or promote her mothers hairdressing business      She actually had the balls to do her homework on front cash a couple of months after we had a meeting banning this When my manager lets call him Dave told her to put it away Stacy straightout lied and told him that the cash manager who wasnt working that night had given her permission Knowing that was bs Dave called the other manager Rachael and asked her about this Apparently Rachael sent Stacy home a couple of nights prior because she wanted to go home and study for a test but she had never allowed her to actually work at front cash  Dave pulled Stacy into the back office and gave her shit about how this was unacceptable because they werent paying her to do homework There was also the matter that she was trying to turn managers against one another Stacy ended up crying and my manager freaked out and sent her home As far as I know nothing else ever came out of this    Stacy is always sick       Im not even exaggerating Every time I work with her she always complains about having a sore throat or feeling under the weather She once came into work and when my manager and supervisor were talking near front cash proceeded to tell them how she had an ear infection and couldnt hear out of one ear Please note that she made no mention of this during the hour she was working prior or when she was talking to my supervisor earlier She then asked if she could leave early to go to the doctors Shes used this shtick twice that Im aware of Shes also bruised her ribs pulled a muscle and has had various other injuries that I cant even remember Apparently its gotten to the point where her parents ignore her when shes screaming in bed because of the pain telling her to just go back to sleep    ,3,cdd1z9m,1qh4fr,talesFromRetail,new,21.0,18

Sasparillafizz,My old manager was sooooo bad at actually managing his store He was sadly my first experience at retail so I didnt know how bad he was until I got a taste of a good managerWe have a midsize stand alone store not a strip mall or gods forbid a mall storeBut our manager would take every shortcut imaginableHe put sku stickers on blank cases to speed up inventory counts because he couldnt be bothered to get a ladder and scan the stuff that was on the high shelves We dont know if any of it was actually up there he never scanned them he just assumed they were and scanned the sticker rather than verify actual product on hand We ended up having one of the highest shrink rates in the company in weekly counts But our actual inventories when a rd party company came in to inventory showed we were pretty on the ball We didnt know where a fucking thing WAS at any time but it was apparently all in the store and not stolen Just a lot of manual shrink outsins because he was constantly finding or losing productHe also never filed product or put them away Not Anything Now for a large store this isnt much of a problem if the manager isnt on the floor doing grunt work But we arent a huge store there are usually maybe  people in the store at an avg time What he would do is since we deal in used product he would take them and drop them in a drawer for to file And we would only start filing those at the end of the night So we would end up doing what should be the entire days worth of work in the last  hours It sucks for the part time employees because they would come in every day for closing shift to a literal fucking MOUNTAIN of workSpeaking of the part timers He sucked at scheduling What he would do was he would make one column of time for figuring out what hours a nonkeyholder was to come in for help but then would just call random people and ask if they can come work today It was apparently to much effort to schedule around people having second jobsschoolcommitments to actuallySCHEDULE Noone would know when they were working till the day before sometimes hours before they are called in Our DM was pissed when he visited one day snatching the schedule and asking What is this a pot luckOnce again since he did no actual work besides standing behind the register helping customers our walls look like shit We get like  hours of labor each week About  of those are the managers So since he did nothing for store maintenance we essentially had to run the largest store in our district on  man hours labor including the normal day to day customer service The store bloody well looked like it constantlyHe took shortcuts on how stuff was put on walls to save time he was loose about filing things away to save time he cut every corner he could get away with and STILL fell behind on everything and pissed off our DM at every turn whenever he came in to look at our wreck of a storeOne of my favorite ones was since we deal in used games I was trained by him to take any games regardless of condition that didnt have their case as refurbished I must have ended up costing our customers thousands of dollars for refurb fees for games that were flawless Why Because our manager felt it was to time consuming to make cases for them so we would take unscratched games and send them off to a company to be buffed out at our customers expense because he was to lazy to do what our company is SUPPOSED to do I didnt find out this was wrong till our ASM explained that this wasnt policy since this was what I was trained to doHe would also be rather sketchy about getting numbers He would offer incentives for customers to trade in their games and reserve upcoming titles Well give you a free reservation of the new Halo But the truth is that he was just applying a promotion the customer should have gotten regardless hed just not tell the customers about the extra  bonus they give to trade ins for ALL trades this week Instead hed only apply it IF they got our discount card or they were reserving something to fabricate extremely high numbers We would end up with a extremely low pickup rate for reservations because he would get so many people to reserve and then they wouldnt actually buyWhen our new manager took over we found he had not filed or organized ANY of the paperwork in the last yearIm so glad hes gone Our new manager for about  years now is immensely on the ball not afraid to say no to customers treats us well and puts in tons of time to the store himself Very hands on when running his store,2,cdd7cju,1qh4fr,talesFromRetail,new,7.0,5

morgueanna,If youre in management Make sure everyone knows what theyre doing by giving them specific short information Dont hit them with a wall of text in the form of memos and sales goal sheets and all that If you cant fit the info on a  x  card its too much  Speaking of those cards if you have the time create cheat sheets of responsibility for each positiondepartment on a card that size They fit in pockets and are good reminders if new employees get frazzled from being left alone in a department Put whatever their basic duties are the items they should be offering what the sales are in their zone etc This is also something that can be used to hold people accountable how can you say you didnt know the sales when I handed them to you on your own personal card See if you can get your district manager to do a payout to buy some donuts coffee and candy for the back room Treat your employees and keep them sugared up for the day See if your boss is also cool with people dressing up for the event My stores have done pajama parties elves and reindeer little kids outfits etc No one can feel bad dressed in a ridiculous costume and it really diffuses some of the stress customers feel waiting in line for hours when the door is opened by a  tall dude wearing footie pjs you know your day is gonna be greatIf youre just a grunt Leave one hour before you usually leave If it usually takes you  minutes to get to work leave one hour and  minutes early Seriously Not only is traffic going to be a grind but finding parking will take you all day Even if you get there super early you can take some time to relax in the back get some status updates from others on break back there or just chill in your car listening to music to pump yourself up for your day Pack a lunch and bring pocket size snacks You wont have time to stand in line at a food court so bring food Bring mints and an energy bar to sneak a snack on the sales floor when management isnt looking Honestly even if they catch you almost all sins are forgiven on Black Friday and they will understandenvy you Make yourself a cheat sheet of sales in your department and in the entire store Ask your management team for backup items  will anything be used to replace item X when it is sold out What do they want you to push in its place  Find out before Black Friday what your departments plan of attack will be Even though this should be a managers responsibility weve seen plenty of stories on TFR of poor communication Find out where your extra register tape will be where overflow hangers will go who will be running supplies out of the back etc Dont expect or rely on your managers to have your back find out for yourself Have your managers name and contact info ready on small sheets of paper Guess what its Black Friday someone will want to complain about something They will ask for your corporate office number or a complaint hotline Give them the store managers name and number and send them on their way to yell at someone else This serves two purposes  since you have it ready it will cut down on writing timefinding a pen and  when they see you are ready to hand them out like candy it makes them less inclined to actually complain because they think it happens all the time and wont do any good,3,cdditfx,1qjg67,talesFromRetail,new,28.0,25

etterboce,Our major sales are on electronics We normally have pull tags for our big ticket items What I have found works is to print out pull tags in a different color than normal we use red for all of the door buster itemsJust print out enough for the amount of each item you actually have in stock Then go through the line and let each group of customers pick from one of the doorbusters and hand them a pull tag obviously starting at the front of the linePut any attachment items near the registers for easy access We also have a dedicated area for purchasing computers tvs and other big ticket products In our store we have a copy and print center Nobody is coming in to make copies at opening on Black Friday so we use the registers their to ring up those items It is a bit away from the other registers and we always put our best tech sales people back there along with the merchandise behind the counter it is usually locked upIt will be busy so develop a quick sales pitch You will not have nearly as much time as normal to talk to the customer so if you want to sell attachments or services youll have to make your pitch short and sweet A lot of people will tell you no but you should be able to make up for it throughout the day because of the sheer number of customers you will deal withThe day always sucks It is long and usually none of us get enough sleep because of the incredibly early start Just remember that you have the potential if you make sales incentives or commission to earn more that day than any other day of the year,1,cddg616,1qjg67,talesFromRetail,new,5.0,4

BizSib,You probably know this but the reason he wanted to exchange it in one transaction is for statistic purposes Most retail employees and stores are tracked on the these measurementsUPT Units per transaction Total items soldnumber of transactionsDPT Dollars per transaction total salesnumber of transactionsThese numbers are used to rate employees and stores determine raises and bonuses etc When you return something it counts as an additional transaction and one less item or less  So a return doesnt just cancel out the original sale it acts against your total stats So say the employee had sold  items that week in  transactions for a  UPT When you return one item it brings him down to  items but up to  transactions so his UPT drops to  Most stores have a standard of  or higher So what you did is basically add  transactions and  items  from the return and  from the sale Using the same example you brought the UPT down from  to   units transTLDR you messed up his stats ,5,cddofju,1qk89v,talesFromRetail,new,12.0,7

tidymaze,I actually had something similar happen to me several years ago I got rearended in a parking lot light tap not a lot of damage and there was a toddler in the car that hit me and she was sitting in her grandmothers lap in the passenger seat the mom was driving When the police showed up I let him know what I had seen He said he couldnt really do much because he hadnt seen the child out of a car seat when the car was moving but you better believe that the mom and grandmother strapped that kid in to her car seat as they were leaving The best part The little girl said clear and loud as day Why cant I sit on grandmas lap again I like riding on grandmas lap The cop was over at their car like a flash telling the adults that it was the law for the child to be in a car seat and if they were caught it was a huge fine and points on their license,1,cdee6xw,1qkn9u,talesFromRetail,new,7.0,6

techiebabe,Ive been a secret shopper for pubs shops underground stations train journeys and stations What would you like to know Personally I wouldnt shoplift Im more worried about remembering the name of the assistant trying to subtly time how long it takes for them to greet me and trying to get the task done get out so I can braindump into a notebook then get home and write the report I dont want to waste any time as it doesnt pay that well and I cant afford to fanny aboutYou can recognise me by needing a receipt in situations where people dont usually bother  eg a drinks order at a pub or asking staff to let me retain a ticket at a station barrier Or if youve got a product on promotion and I ask about that even when it should be obvious to see if you know which products to push or how to present a gin and tonic perfectly or whatever Or if I pop into the loo when you dont think Id normally need to such as a really quick visit when Im visiting alone and clearly feel awkward leaving my drink or bag unattended or I dont spend very long there eg checking if it is clean and stocked but without using itOr if Im spending ages browsing and seem genuinely interested  ask questions but then only buy one cheap item  for example I was told to buy something at x store they would refund up to  I didnt know the store so I had to look at pretty much everything before working out that all I could buy at that price was a small candle I never want to mark people down as I know your bonus may depend on it On the other hand I have to be honest so if you dont have a namebadge or I spent ten minutes queuing I do have to record that I once  ONCE  scored a pub  and I got crossexamined I made sure I was CERTAIN that everyone greeted me in time was helpful glasses were sparkling clean tables were spotless empties were removed within a minute etc Remember that the mystery shopper will get questionned if they just say everything was fine and it is very very unlikely that everything will be perfect just because life happens I dont want to risk my job by being anything other than honest but if you are helpful  friendly  go the extra mile I WILL commend you I want people to do well I am disabled and if you offer to bring my drinks to my table  ask if I need help taking my goods to my car I WILL commend you its always worth doing ,4,cded15q,1qmr4d,talesFromRetail,new,11.0,7

rugbygirl,I did mystery shopping in college a couple times I had to drive to gas stations and a few restaurants to make sure they were carding for cigarettes and alcohol I felt like a scum bag the whole time I studied psychology in school so it got me thinking about situational factors that lead people to not card me For example days that I would do my hair and makeup and wear something cute I wouldnt get carded as much especially from guys around my age Days that I wore a sweatshirt and my hair thrown up in a bun I almost always got cardedNothing will make me feel worse than one of the last gas stations I shopped My form told me that this store was a cigarette check and that the employees are required to check your ID and also scan the barcode on the back Well I go in the woman is very pleasant asks for my ID but does not scan it My heart sank because not scanning counts as a fail I tell the woman I have to fail her for not using the scanner and I see her face go from pleasant to terrified in  seconds She proceeds to beg me not to fail her because the scanner is broken I tried to explain that the store is registered as having a scanner and there is nothing I can do about that She started sobbing telling me that if I failed her she would lose her job It didnt matter what the circumstance was even though she did ask for my ID and did confirm that I was at least  She had  kids at home and was a single parent I couldnt bring myself to fail her because she did in fact check my ID I was not going to be responsible for this poor woman losing her job I told her to make sure her boss got the scanner fixed and marked it as a pass  At a different gas station I had the clerk actually chuckle a little bit when he asked for my ID saying something along the lines of you look like your  I was  at the time A surprising amount of clerks could tell I was a shopper immediately  A lot of the time I would make eye contact when I got to the counter and there was an unspoken agreement that they knew what I was there for they would ask for my ID and ask if they passed,2,cdf1twa,1qmr4d,talesFromRetail,new,4.0,2

etterboce,I generally hate dealing with teachers at work My store is a bigbox office supply retailer and we have teachers come in all the time As a group they are generally incredibly cheap and entitled They also commonly make it clear that they feel they should get everything for free or nearly free because of the public service they provide and their terrible payI am married to a teacher who works in a middle school autistic classroom in the poorest area of my city We spend a fair amount of money on supplies every week for her classroom so I certainly know what its like However even though it totally sucks that we have to purchase certain classroom supplies on a regular basis she definitely makes enough money that we can afford to do so she is given an allowance at the beginning of the year  if she taught regular ed it would be plenty She works at her job because she likes to and because she finds it rewarding  She doesnt want others to feel sympathetic towards her for doing soWith that being said she has to do several communitybased field trips with her students per year Every so often they will visit a store it makes sense because most of what she works on with her students is behavior She would never even think of going anywhere without first contacting the store manager by telephone and in writing She also contacts them well in advance of when they wish to come and also holds the visit during an offtimeI could completely see a group of teachers walking into my store and doing the same thing Im not sure what kind of benefit them going to an electronics store had because they certainly could have held technology training without actually going to a store But if they wanted to they sure as hell should have called your store manager and asked permissionLuckily our policy states that anybody who wishes to meet or assemble at our store needs to have a letter from corporate before they can do so this obviously doesnt happen overnight or in the less than  seconds most customers desireWe have had groups including teachers try to set up tables at the front of our store on multiple occasions We have told them no and they eventually leave without setting up Some have contacted corporate and have been given permission but we would have had an email from them well before they group was scheduled to arriveTLDR For business teachers they behaved in an incredibly unprofessional manner,4,cdf3sz9,1qodto,talesFromRetail,new,16.0,12

Abracadanielle,Ive told this story on Reddit before but I enjoy telling it so here we goI worked at a corporate restaurant a few years ago around  when the economy started to officially tank So business was awful and corporate heavily coupond the surrounding area to try and bring people in It was a ridiculously good deal of a coupon Buy oneget one free on damn near most of the entrees including steaks and ribs and stuff And it brought people out alright It brought out the cheapest motherfuckers imaginable The coupon would appear in the paper once a week every week for almost an entire year We got all these new regulars and they would only come in to use their coupon tipping on the discounted price All the good servers started to quit because of what bullshit it wasSo there was this one couple in particular that I will never forget They were awful They were rude and their order was ridiculously complicated and trivial They wanted all their sides plated separately because as they told me they felt the kitchen would give them more food that way When it actually its just that a scoop of mashed potatoes will spread out on a plate by itself They like bragged about this to me I would just bite my tongue They would talk down to you in the way that shitty older customers do like youre the help in an antiquated sense They would flag me down when I was talking to other tables Like I was talking to someone and the woman would yell for me and wave her arm And it would always be for something incredibly trivial Like Im going to need a refill in about five minutes was probably my favorite Really You felt the need to interrupt me when I was taking another tables order to tell me that So when all was said and done theyd pull out their BoGo coupon turning their ish ticket into a ish one Then theyd slap a  down and tell you to keep the change with a shitty smile So after dealing with them through all their horseshit youd have a dollar and some coins to show for itThe story does have a happy ending One night when we were busy they came in and pulled their usual routine They each wanted two sodas each one with extra ice the other with none They asked the same questions about the menu Thirty questions about the bbq sauce and then asking for it on the side after all that Food all on separate plates thinking the kitchen is stupid enough to give them bigger portions Asking for new mashed potatoes because they accidentally put too much pepper on them and need new ones I wasnt waiting on them that night but I could still see everything The check got dropped and they outoftheblue demand to talk to a manager Guy starts to chew my manager out because that past week there had been no BoGo coupon in the paper They were livid and demanded to have their usual discount My manager bless her gave them the most amazing shiteating grin and told them that our individual store had no control over when corporate chose to put out coupons They then said Well if you dont give us a coupon for tonight were never coming back My manager actually replied with something to the tune of Thats fine They were livid How is that fine She said Neither the restaurant nor the serving staff has been making any money off of your business I think well be fine They paid full price for the order left in defeat and sure enough never returned,2,cdh2elv,1qvk5o,talesFromRetail,new,12.0,10

Pies,I dont mind couponers so much as long as everything matches up  times out of  its a really fast process especially if you can override since the system cant find the item even of youre staring right at it What does bug me though is when you have two lines open  being express which wasnt me at the time and get two women who come up and pay with  credit cards and cash for an order backing up the entire line which makes the customers behind them become very immature But thats a story for another time,5,cdh3uav,1qvk5o,talesFromRetail,new,13.0,8

error,Some tips from my  years in womens retailWhen a customer is says theyre just looking let them look  But as soon as they pick up something comment that itll look good or is a very versatile item When we get new product in the store Ill start planning out outfits for certain popular piecescloset mainstays so if a customer likes one thing you can show them coordinating pieces Always be honest  if something looks horrible tell them in a tactful way and have another suggestion for them to try Like the above commenters  over time you will recognize customers and they will start to know you and in time trust your judgementrecommendations Also jewelry and scarves can make a complete look and are easy add ons to suggest Good luck,1,cdh6v36,1qvw7c,talesFromRetail,new,3.0,2

etterboce,I have found that the best thing for me is to try to build rapport with the customer and make himher feel comfortable Also having a lot of product knowledge also really helps Always be as honest as you can be with them as wellI think the main thing is that you dont need to worry about pushing products on the customer Just show them the products and accessories that are applicable to what they are looking for and explain any possible benefits I work in a different type of store We sell office supplies and electronics but its really the same general idea We have a lot of expensive and overpriced items and the company wants us to upsell as much as possibleThe biggest thing that I have found turns off customers is when they feel like they are in the middle of a sales pitch Make them feel like you are just trying to help them get everything they will needSometimes companies do things that are stupid that try to force employees to upsell For instance our company forces employees to offer a ream of paper with every transaction Its not a terrible idea in theory but when Ive worked with a customer for an hour or more and then randomly offer them paper when I know its something they do not want or need it screws up the whole flow of the saleTLDR Make the customers feel like you are there to help them rather than to sell ,0,cdhazee,1qvw7c,talesFromRetail,new,1.0,1

lel,I have a disabled lady that comes in fairly regularly who acts like this She is in a wheelchair but can move her arms enough to use her card She yells at the man who comes in with her might be her carer her son her husband  who knows yells at us is extremely anxious about everythingI was bagging her stuff once I scan a bottle of fly spray and am going to bag it She says panicked Put that seperately wont you Its poison you know Yes I knowEveryone was on alert mode when she came in one day extremely irritated More than usualAfter she has paid for her stuff a coworker is asked to take her bags out to her car for herMy coworker comes back in looking quite upset I ask what happened and she tells me that this customer apologised to her saying she had a stroke or something a year ago and has episodes where she becomes angry seemingly out of nowhere and cannot control her emotions very well She mentioned she was on medication for it but that she was having a bad dayShe told my coworker that she has a jewelry store and makes her own jewelry then gives her a little bracelet because she felt bad for how she was acting Now I was still pissed after she told me this story but it was also like a lightbulb moment as well Oh so thats why youre acting like that Its not because youre angry at us its because you have a medical condition Okay I can deal with that I thoughtI still dont think its an excuse for acting badly and treating people badly but it does explain some thingsThe reason Im saying this is because perhaps this customer had a similar story I mean she is incredibly hunched over and I think that anyone stuck in that hunched back position would get cranky from time to time In no way does it excuse her actions but there is probably a reasonable explanation behind itOr she might just be a cranky person for no reason There are many other disabled people I see fairly regularly as well They are all perfectly nice and I have had no dramas with them at all But maybe their disabilities are solely physical not psychological,0,cdhw8sa,1qyazy,talesFromRetail,new,1.0,1

RiflemanLax,I caught a pair of girls sisters about  and  a few days after xmas onceWe were open late til  to process returns and also an after xmas sale So we see these two who are obviously too damn young to be alone by themselves just piling up merchandise They ended up going into the fitting room and filling up some bags We stopped them at the mall entranceThey were so quiet and had this look of shame Heads hung And their clothes were just dirty Jackets were soiled Going through the merchandise none of the stuff was anything flashy Just socks underwear generic tshirts some jeans some cheap jackets etc Was about  worth They werent talking much at all except to give us personal informationCouldnt get a hold of a parent The whole situation was depressing but it got worse Cop showed up me and him are just trying to get something out of them Need a parent or relatives info Finally Im just like WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTSThe little one looks up at me and eeks out At home To which I replied DOING WHAT Again a quiet response Smoking crackI got the older girl to talk more She added that they hadnt gotten anything for xmas they was nary a mention of it in the household and the rest of their clothes were in a similar condition Felt awful to hear to say the leastCop asked me what I wanted to do as in prosecute etc I said absolutely not It was policy to do so but at that point Im in this fucked up mix of rage and depression over their situation and I cant say I gave a fuck That and they were already fucked in life and didnt need a record to go along with their predicamint no sealed juvenile records in my state Besides I got a police report so anyone reviewing the case would assume I prosecutedCop said he was going to take them to the troop and call family services The fact that it was then past midnight and no parent had called not to mention the drug allegations was enough for an emergency order or whatever Not sure how that worksSometimes I wonder what happened to those two and I try to be optimistic but the area of the city theyre from made it likely that they fell right back into the same cycle as their parents Some kids have no chanceBe grateful for what youve got guys no matter how little that might be,2,cdic0jt,1qyww2,talesFromRetail,new,13.0,11

mtux,I think they may have a case though I am not a lawyer Its not so much that the pillar is there but the material that the pillar is covered by Mirrors are probably not the best thing to cover pillars with especially if they wrap all the way around as it may leave an illusion that the pillar isnt there which can cause someone to run into them especially if they are running around The other aspect is if it can be proven that the pillar itself may have been damaged prior to the kid running into it and was not taken care of then that in itself might be seen as a liability on the stores part for not fixing a hazard that wouldnt exist that would gash the kids skin Of course running into would still hurt but if the prior damage caused the gash that could be deemed negligence on the store which leads another reason why mirrors that can break are possibly the worst thing to wrap these pillars in Of course anyone can sue anyone for anything and can win either through settling or just through the courts,1,cdiohgs,1qzps2,talesFromRetail,new,3.0,2

Endulos,I did the exact same thing but I wasnt an employeeShortly after Grand Theft Auto Sand Andreas released I was in an EB Games just browsing When a kid and his mother came inThe kid wanted San Andreas The mother actually looked at the rating and questioned it but he was LYING HIS ASS OFF to get it Pulled every trick in the book Oh that was a mistake Didnt you hear about that What Nudity Theres nothing like that That was a mislabeled etc etc The mother actually seemed to buy into it But what didnt help matters was that the employee behind the counter was making up his own bull shit and agreeing with the kid Anything to make a sale I guessBefore she bought it I decided to speak up and told her the TRUTH Both the employee and the kid glared daggers at me The mother was DISGUSTED that both of them lied to her and she drug the kid out of the store by his earI spent a couple more minutes browsing the store and said employee says in a shitty tone Can I help you I just replied Nope Just looking and left the store I was actually in there to buy a game but fuck that guy Hes not getting commission on my purchase,22,cdimty3,1r14xk,talesFromRetail,new,74.0,52

BloodBride,Yknow theres been something bothering me about video game age ratings and movie age ratings for a while and this topic is what made me realise exactly what that is The with parental consent part If a parent wandered into a liquor store or came to a tobacconist and asked their kid what they wanted or there was any suggestion that the age restricted product was for the underage person even if by a mere day we would have to legally restrict that sale because its for a minor and we could still be in trouble should someone report that case The parents consent doesnt factor in There is no degree of being almost the right side of proper Not old enough no knowledgeable sale However with movies video games and other items of media the parent can tell you to shut the fuck up and sell their darling little turd a copy of whatever violent entertainment they want Thats whats odd to me The video game doesnt suddenly become less violent or have less graphic content because the parent says its okay Its the same media as it always was the same as alcohol and other age restricted products  they dont change in property because the parent says its okayNow dont get me wrong Im a fan of all sorts was shown age restricted media as a kid and Im aware that kids can handle it that isnt my issue hereMy issue is that age restrictions are handled that differently That its okay for media that can effect psychological development to be just okayed in by a parent even if you know its for an underage person and you cannot be caught out by the law for selling it that way but if you accidentally let slip a pack of cigs to a minor via a parent you can lose your job and earn a fine,1,cdiqj84,1r14xk,talesFromRetail,new,3.0,2

etterboce,I sell electronics and get this from customers all the time They will go through the entire computer aisle and act disgusted that not one of our PCs are made in the USThe way I typically handle this is to ask them how much they were planning on spending on their new laptop The response is usually somewhere between  I then explain the basics of how much labor costs in the US versus China and that it is simply not possible to build a computer that would fit their desired budget in AmericaSometimes this calms them down a bit and other times they end up deciding to buy a PC made in Singapore or Korea Of course we all know that the quality of PCs made in other Asian countries are vastly superior to those made in China and the human rights of workers there are also a lot betterAs others have said these idiots who complain about Chinese made products probably have no idea that the majority of what they own is likely made either in China or another developing nation with nearly nonexistent labor regulations,0,cdjsibf,1r4axm,talesFromRetail,new,5.0,5

ZennerThanYou,The key with these kinds of promotions the kind that commonly elicit a negative or frustrated response from customers is in the explanation Im definitely not saying youre not delivering a perfectly logical and appropriate response Just saying maybe a different approach might make your days a little less awful Of course I dont work there amp dont know all the details but at another holidaydriven retail store I worked at I often took an approach something like I understand that you shop here often and we truly appreciate your loyalty The purpose of the  minimum purchase condition is to incentivise purchasing ALL of your thanksgiving items earlier to avoid the list minute holiday rush Its generally a winwin for our customers and for us The main point Im making is that in my experience customers appreciate being educated as opposed to thats what the coupon says so do it or you dont get the discount The other way to handle it is when they say theyre buying a turkey amp want to use the coupon say Ok great Ill be right over here if you have any questions and let the cashiers deal with it I know Its a shitty solution if you give two craps about the cashiers PS   I also know that incentivise is not a word But it should be ,5,cdkyb1r,1r82al,talesFromRetail,new,3.0,-2

superspeck,Heh Actually that reminds me of a time when I did school a cashier I wasnt trying to get a discount or anything he was just having a problem with a POS system at a place that Id worked at while in high school It was a regional camera store and is now national This is about ten years ago several years after Id stopped working for them I was buying up their stock of a slide film that had been discontinued He was having a problem getting the machine to ring it up because when looking up by the UPC barcode the POS insisted that the product had been discontinued yet it was obviously sitting right there on the counter which meant it was probably in inventory but under the retailer part number and not the UPC I told him to hit the key that escaped to the manager menu and walked him through looking it up by name When it worked he said that he had to go get his manager to make sure hed done it correctly Fine Ill wait Fatty McManager came stomping out of the back room with each step shaking the carefully planogrammed displays and a cloud of steam coming from each ear He asked me who the heck I was to tell his employee how to access HIS manager menu and what was I trying to pull with having his employee ring up stuff that wasnt in inventory and how the heck did I know anything about their system I just said Yeah I used to work at low numbered store back when the POS system was released and yall probably do it differently these days but we had to use those menus because things were pretty broken when they were first installed That didnt appease Fatty McManager though  he said it was VERY irregular and pompously declared that I should give him my associate number if I was indeed an employee This companys POS system assigned a number to each associate for life They were sequential so you could tell when someone had been hired by how low their associate number was I gave it to him told him You can look me up in the computer F menu  heres my drivers license Address is obviously different but the names the same and sos the cell phone number Oh and whats your associate number His was well up past a quarter million I asked him if a particular district manager still worked for the company and confided that his associate number was in the double digits I got my film and after Mr McManager deflated he actually gave me the employee discount even though I didnt ask for it tldr There are cases where a customer might school a blowhard manager Not that I think you OP are a blowhard However you might find out someday that you were just a number to the corporation ,16,cdlcw22,1ragwd,talesFromRetail,new,45.0,29

MagpieChristine,The grocery selfcheckouts here seem really poorly designed When they first came in you needed to get the attendant to override for you when you started because putting your bags in the bagging error would trigger the scale Its not bad that the scale is that sensitive but the add bags button is an entirely necessary feature I think they might even let you take bags off and add new ones these days I never buy that much at the self checkout because every time it burps I have to wait for the overworked attendant My biggest beef with them is that the grocery store in the mall has ONLY selfcheckouts at the mall entrance Sure I get that its not really feasible to have two sets of conventional checkouts but I hate having to carry my bags of groceries back through the store past the selfcheckout to be able to leave ,0,cdmaq0r,1rbn62,talesFromRetail,new,1.0,1

dagronBorn,I worked at a popular bowling alley where the bartenders were running this notsoclever scheme where they would put the money for the drink orders in the tip cup instead of the register I worked as a server and short order cook when needed and my tips were miniscule in comparison to the bartenders Eventually the higherups noticed a substantial amount of money missing from the bar and that the inventory didnt match the sales I was on medical leave when they were busted One by one they were questioned and each gave a similar account saying that I was the one pocketing the money Little did they know the GM had spy cameras installed in the bar that caught their day to day operation I come back to work to find new bartenders and servers and whatnot Corporate policy back then was that when something like what I described ever happened the current employees had to be terminated and a new staff hired on and trainedIncluding yours truly I was royally pissed Even more so when I found out people that I had thought were my friends had tried to pin their crime on me,0,cdn8x4g,1rcbas,talesFromRetail,new,1.0,1

iaskediam,The moment she brought up the business she actually became guilty of two other things potentially laws may vary For one she is now slandering as the business owes no money and she is potentially staining the reputation of the business by saying such a thing For another if it could be construed that she was coming between the business and their customers and causing the business material harm she could be in violation of another law designed to protect the right of a business to conduct their transactionsYou need to have a conversation with your boss when this lady is not present She is potentially causing you harm also if the business were to be damaged through her actions or possibly if your boss were to use company assets to pay her off despite this being about his brother Tell him that you understand his personal situation but when it bleeds into the business it needs to be handled and not ignored or else his problems could compound and you and your coworkers will get dragged into the mess Tell him you are quite capable of handling the intrusion yourself so he doesnt need to be involved in a conflict that he wants no part of Assure him that you are looking out for both him and the store He wouldnt want his business to suffer because of an employees private affairs and he shouldnt let his own get in the way either He has the biggest stake in the company but everyone he is paying for their work also does and they shouldnt be subject to this ladys unnecessary stress inducing presence while they are thereLet him know that the next time she shows up you will give her the option of making a purchase and leaving or skipping right to the leaving part If she refuses you will tell her that the police will be summoned and she will be charged with trespassing Let her know that if she attacks the business verbally like she did on this occasion further charges will be pressed if applicable  In short make sure your boss knows that if the lady continues her antics youll do everything you were going to do after he left last time while he is still there acting on behalf of the business and your coworkers My guess is that the boss will initially balk at the idea but with a little push on your part hell actually be glad to know that theres a plan if she returns and that someone else can take charge of the situation,5,cdnn2ex,1rhnqp,talesFromRetail,new,17.0,12

xWhackoJacko,My first job was at a grocery store so I tried extra hard to be a good worker not that I dont now at my current job but yea We also had a couple managers whom were both female who pulled this kind of shit all the timeTheyd tell you to go do carts You go outside to do carts and you see an elderly woman struggling to put her bags away So you stop pushing the carts making sure not to block anyone trying to back out and you help her  and continue with the carts THEN you go back in  and they yell at you for helping a customer because you took an extra  minutes to do cartsSo the next time I do carts same situation Old guy who has like  big bags of charcoal under his carriage  who clearly could use help  is in my sights But because I dont want to get yelled at I pass right by him and feel like absolute shit And guess what I go inside same manager yells at me for not helping a customerAt this point you explain to them that theyre contradicting themselves and they are completely oblivious to their actions  from only a few hours ago And then they get even bitchier about it because you dared to question their authority It also never made sense to me that managers at these retail stores treat their employees like shit They all had to do those kinds of job and work up the ladder like everyone else They should know how ass it is in general so having stupid fucking managers doesnt really help WhatevsDisclaimer I only pointed out that they were female because the Male managers were actually cool at this grocery store Only the women two in particular pulled this stupid power trip assness And of course not to say male managers are saints either My bosses now are all males and I fucking hate them as much as I hated these two broads ,2,cdo82p8,1rjww9,talesFromRetail,new,11.0,9

Techsupportvictim,We have mall alarms that go off all the time And internal ones for our store if both go off we clear the store right awayThe other fun though is that we deal with soft cell batteries Easy to puncture if you arent trained to deal with them You literally have to take a week long course in how to handle them safety rules etc Anyone comes back to so a battery replacement they are right next to a fire extinguisher and open fire safe These are lithium based batteries and yes if they are torn they can explode Guy comes in griping about how his phone gets really hot smells funny Slams it down on the counter in front of me I pull up the serial since it was turning on preparing to start trouble shooting etc I notice its rather warm and that the display seems off lifted up even His comment about the smell makes me nervous so I say Im going to go to the back and have a look at itNow Im happen to be the only tech on duty trained to handle batteries the other two were on lunch Once Im out of the customers sight I radio the mangers to stand by as we have a potential battery fire risk Yep we are code orange boys and girls I clear the room as my manager comes in and grabs the fire extinguisher Warehouse has been alerted and all runs to the floor are paused and they are standing by to clear out Floor managers are standing by clear the sales floor without alerting the customers just yet Fire safe is open Tongs at the ready Neutralizer is in tray Safety goggles face mask and apron on yeah seriously Manager also has safety gear onDeep breath unscrew the bottom Generally attach suction and lift up the tray Two things catch my eye one the battery casing is white ours are black Two there is a freaking screw embedded in the middle of the batterySplit second later the smell is worse The mask is basically one if those dust things so I can still smell some of it Its like a scene out of a movie I hear Sam Jackson oh hell no in my head as a grab the tongs phone into the tray tray into the safe and slam the door and lock it My manager is on the radio at the same time basically screaming thermal event this is NOT a drill Warehouse manager hits the fire alarm for our store which also alerts the mall End of the story mall is cleared out fire department called took two hours to clear the store for anyone to go back in and we couldnt go into repair room for like  hours until the neutralizer absorbed the fumes and the safe could be opened I was sent home with pay and I got to have to go to doctor and cleared to come to work because I might have been exposed phone actually caught fire in the safe and was a charred mess Company was nice enough to let the guy pay for a service swap with the understanding that the third party battery actually voided the warranty etc,1,cdoe5th,1rkgbf,talesFromRetail,new,17.0,16
WishfulOne,I find it scary that no one was evacuated at least until it was discovered that there was no fire  I was shopping in a store in a plaza one day when the fire alarms started going off  No one seemed concerned about this  The two employees were at the counter looking totally lost and confused and the customers were shopping like nothing was happening typical customers  I asked one employee if that was the fire alarm  She said she wasnt sure but that it sounded like one  I told her to get the customers out just in case something was wrong  She told me that the fire alarm was connected to all the stores in the plaza and the fire mightnt be in this store  I told her it didnt matter to get everyone out and to ask her boss about the procedure for a fire alarm so she would know in  the futureAs everyone left the store people were coming out of the other stores in the plaza and I could hear fire trucks in the distance  I had other shopping to do so I left  I dont think there was a real fire if there was it was never mentioned in the local news  It scares me when no one evacuates an area when fire alarms are going offedit formatting,2,cdo55j6,1rkgbf,talesFromRetail,new,6.0,4

etterboce,To everyone who keeps saying she should file criminal charges against the customer I agree in theory However even if OP knows who the customer is simply calling the police could result in her termination depending on the company Its a really terrible thing but many corporate retailers side with the customers so much that they will terminate an employee for calling the police without authorization And they are completely allowed to do this without any worry of recourse because it is company policy and in the employee handbook that they make us sign when we get hiredI dont know how I would have reacted I would love to say that I would have done something awesome and put the lady in her place but Im not sure In times like that its hard to say how any of us would really have reacted Ive had some extremely tense situations with customers over the years and Ive never reacted completely how I would have expectedEither way Im sorry you had this happen to you OP Nobody has a right to put their hands on you Next time the best thing you can do is remove yourself from the situation call a manager and fill out an incident report Ask for medical care if you even slightly think its necessary And do not ever serve that customer again Even if management will not ban her let them know that you will not wait on her Make your manager go up to the register every time she comes in,0,cdpt0sl,1rotqh,talesFromRetail,new,2.0,2

supersecretaccount,I worked at the same chain a long time ago People are nuts One lady very clearly ordered five large fries then claimed we had gotten the order wrong and she had allegedly ordered onion rings We got the onion rings ready and the manager who was also present when the woman ordered asked her to pay the difference for the onion rings The customer refused and took the fries to her booth where her friends were waiting out of sight dumping them all over the floor As they all left they called my manager a dyke I swept up the fries baffled by the whole situation You could say that was my first really bad customer service experience ,0,cdpyiga,1rqgnj,talesFromRetail,new,2.0,2
