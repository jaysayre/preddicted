Nothing to worry. I have had one too. In my case it was a witch who was sitting on top of me. These are just figments of our imagination as our mind struggles to understand the  transition state between being asleep and being awake. Basically your brain is awake, but your body is not. So your body doesn't obey your brain's command to get up and move. So your confused brain interprets this as someone/something being on top of you and holding you down.

btheb272,"This is very interesting, forensically.
What they're going to do is take an image of the entire computer.  There's this really cool tool called Ftk. What sucks about it is that it takes forever to create a ""case"" for it, because in order for the the tool to be able to carve unallocated data, it needs to index every bit on the hard drive. 

What's neat about Ftk is that it can pull every email ever sent or received on that machine. That's right folks, deleting your email on hotmail doesn't mean it deletes on your computer.
Whoever did this, is a moron when it comes to computers.  So, the meta data, the data that stores information about the file, is most likely accurate.  What they will do, is figure out when this file was created on the local machine.  Then, they will narrow down the emails opened on that day.  I bet it came from email from the sounds of this story, and they will know exactly what email address this came from.

The problem with cyber forensics is being able to tie the identity of a email or screen name to a real person.  Is Ross's email his full name?",null,2,cd1y8j7,1pfpgc,nosleep,new,9

I'm glad that she has a bathroom in her room so I don't have to leave until morning. Nothing has happened so far and the police officers gave me a walk talkey so i can talk to them while they sit in the car outside.

Decembermouse,"Do you think he has a way of seeing this post?

Were I in your shoes, I'd feel spooked and out of options. Something ... off ... is going on with him. People don't just disappear like that. You can let him get close, and he seems to be ok with you looking at him. I don't think you will be able to hurt him, but psychology itself is a powerful tool. He knows some things you don't - how to find you, how to disappear, and possibly other things. You know things that he doesn't, as well... you have your own secrets. He knows this, and it might be why he's interested.

Next time you see him, meet his gaze, and slowly develop a little hint of a smirk. Let your eyes move away from him, off to the left a bit, and let your head turn to the left too, like you're anticipating and imagining something only you know about. This shows you're confident with him watching you, and that you don't need to be staring back at him the whole time, and your expression will convey that something has changed. Don't make your expression too obvious - just a hint. As you shift your gaze back towards him, confidently lower your head a little bit and let your posture straighten up a bit. Make it look like you are unconsciously shifting to a ""power pose"" but don't make it apparent that you are intentionally changing your posture.

I don't think it will make him go away, but it's clear there are things that are hidden from his understanding. There may be other reasons he's done nothing that's actually harmful, but when you subtly convey that you possess some advantage he doesn't know about, this will alter his perception of the situation.

That means he was outside the house when he took it.  If it was from *anywhere* else that's bad.  That means they were inside the house.  I'd recommend (only if you can afford this, of course) selling everything, and buying new stuff.  Otherwise, get rid of your cell phones and computers, they can be traced.

zushiba,"&gt; But is it really all in my head?

Can I answer this with a post I made regarding someone else's sleep paralysis / meeting with the Hag?


&gt;She is real, she's not alone. They are spectral death, soul eaters. Sleeping humans attract them like flies to shit. They hover around you while you sleep in hopes that you'll die and they can eat your soul.

&gt;You can only perceive them when you're close to sleep and your minds eye is allowed to wander free from your body. They exist in that realm.

&gt;The tunnel with the light at the end, is their throat, the light is collected energy of hundreds of thousands of humans that they've eaten over the centuries slowly digesting over the course of hundreds of thousands of years.

&gt;The souls live on in their guts in a perpetual state of blissful dreaming where many think they have died and gone on to meet relatives but that is not the case.

&gt;Some of the hags prefer good feelings (Gone to heaven) others prefer negative feelings (Gone to hell).

&gt;If you're lucky and you die while none are around, you become a disembodied ghost free to roam about but forever hunted by them.

&gt;The only way to fight them is to learn how to induce a lucid dream state. Humans are capable of completely controlling the spectral dream world It's just not easy to do. A lucid dreamer is capable of harnessing that reality and using it to do battle with the soul eaters. Most lucid dreamers are unaware that they have this power and create a cocoon world where they just jump around and have fun. Killing a soul eater grants you the power of all the souls that they've consumed.

These things have been here perhaps longer than Humans have had fire. They are represented in every culture. Demons, Succubi/Incubui , The Old Hag, The Night-Mare, Aliens, Kanashibari in Japan referring to being bound by metal chains and in the Caribbean it's attributed to the souls of unbaptized babies who sit on your chest attempting to steal your life away.

No one can say where exactly they came from. Their form is at least related to ours in some way. They generally have 2 arms 2 legs a head and a torso. Could that have existed before us? Did they come about because of us? Perhaps we simply perceive them as having a somewhat similar form to ours, maybe a horrible distortion of the Pareidolia affect. Our brains have no real way to understand the creature that we're perceiving and so our brain does what it does so well and fills in the gaps, assigning vague human features to a creature that is anything but.

Darkdreams123,"I wish to fully illustrate the fact that I am NOT shitting you, in any capacity. Everything I have said is completely genuine, and based in personal memory both recent and not. It occurs to me that I never articulated what the faces looked like. Allow me to correct that obvious mistake; the faces are definitively inhuman, with no more than 4 exceptions. The structure of the head, the placement of the eyes, none of it fits within the definition of humanity. I was happy to not have dreamed last night, but...I still cannot shake the feeling that they have some dread significance in my life. They never blink as they stare at me, and every now and again, if I lay alone in pitch blackness with my eyes open, I catch glimpses of them turning to look at each other randomly. I'll fess up and say that I smoke no small amount of pot, but it's Canada so its everywhere and its pure. Anyway, a couple years ago, I drew up some stuff while I was blitzed out of my mind, and I have the strong impression that the idea came from one of the faces.
I'll post the picture here if I can. Before anyone asks, I only have some idea of the significance of these symbols, even though I know that I created them. I used to have a complete chart for what symbol meant which concept or stood for which alphabetic letter, but it has long since been lost and what little I've been able to recollect from memory is pitiful.
I figure that people have heard of the Greys, so I'll come out with it; do my symbols match up with any other symbols elsewhere? http://tinypic.com/r/10degqp/5",null,0,cd33w7v,1pitx0,nosleep,new,2

Lucid dreaming is like taking your inner spirit and exploring the plane of existence that spirits and entities usually live/frequent.

It's been a few years so this particular spirit has a very good link to you.  (she also sounds like a strong spirit to start off with)

The best thing to do is to learn how to spiritually protect yourself.  I recommend talking to your mom further about spiritual protection and house cleansing and you must do it yourself (or with anyone willing to help you)

A Bible itself has very little power because it's just an object.  It's the faith of the person and their unwavering spiritual belief that produces power, that's why your prayer worked good in the dream, but wasn't strong enough to completely drive her away.

I've had a few night terrors in which I'll scream and either stand backed into the corner on my bed, spin in circles with the blanket wrapped around me, or dive across the room. I'll usually lay down afterwards and wake up immediately after my head hits the pillow because of my scream still echoing in my own ears.

I'd say I imagined or dreamt up myself doing these things but in all of those cases I was living with a roommate that confirmed what I believe happened, typically by telling me before I even mentioned it.

That being said, I've had a few other dreams of me laying in bed very aware of a dark presence in the room. Sometimes I talk with this presence commanding them to get out, or to leave.

Then it's head went out the window. When I was 10ft passed it I looked in my side view to see its body pulling itself together in the street. Initially it was six foot tall. When it bent it was 5feet away from my car. I just need to rid myself of this feeling of dread. The three girls who crossed right before I seen it were screaming bloody murder when it was contortions back together. Maybe I interrupted it trying to accomplish something?

I understand you are worried, but this doesn't seem malevolent. I never believed in ghosts either until I moved into my first place. I had similar experiences as you and one day mentioned it to my mom. My mom admitted that the realtor disclosed to her that the previous owner had passed in my condo. Since I was a first time buyer I didn't understand the legalese that it was written in on the disclosure and my mom told the realtor to not tell me.  The reason I mention this is I went from being freaked out to relieved (I wasn't losing my mind!). I was able to get the name of the lady who died and viewed her as part of the house.  Maybe you could do the same?  Research the house and make friends with the spirit?  No joke I once had a horrible horrible migraine and I looked everywhere for my bottle imitrex to no avail. I decided to ice pack my head and when I opened the drawer to get a baggie there was one pill!  I truely believe she found it and helped me.

I am a huge horror movie/story buff. I love scary and unexplained shit, and exploring abandoned buildings is somewhat of a hobby of mine (along with a few other photographer friends). 

Have you looked into the history of the house at all? like you said about yourself, I don't really believe in ghosts other than pure entertainment value. That being said, I think that sometimes shit happens we have issues explaining. Also, have you posted anywhere other than reddit about this? I know reddit may be the only place crazy enough to buy in to a story like this (not to discredit you, because I want to believe you. I just know we have lots of very....creative..people on here!) 

Aside from looking into the history of the house, have you checked for drafts of wind in the house? If it's old, there could be an infrastructure issue. Additionally, do you typically lock your doors or no? Last but not least, have you noticed at all any memory issues as of late, or small gaps of time during which you cannot recall what happened?

nixonboyd,"Sometimes the most obvious explanation is the true one, even if we want to find any other alternative explanation first.

This is the issue with scientific skepticism v the paranormal.

That plain truth is that paranormal events occur.

I was a skeptic until I experienced a full apparition in circumstances that, to my own satisfaction at least, proved that these things are real.

The problem with science is that it bases the veracity of phenomena on their duplicability - and the paranormal couldn't care less.

It reminds me of the saying ""bees are technically too big to fly with their tiny wings. Thing is, the bee doesn't know that""",null,1,cd516z8,1pqgrc,nosleep,new,3
Empirica,"I once lived together with a girl that happened to be cleptomanic, and she not only stole some of my stuff, sometimes she also rearranged things in my room. For example she would mess up my desk, eventough she did not take anything from it, or pluck out my digital clock. I don´t want to accuse your roommate or anyone else living in your house. There could be another (rational / paranormal) explanation for these occurances. But if actually a real human being is behind your disappearing stuff, it probably would not be too unusual for him if he also plucked out the TV and the Playstation, for whatever reason.

About the footsteps on the stairwell, I don´t really have something like an explanation. Are those stairs wooden? Because wooden things / furniture sometimes make noises (by themselves) that go from creaking to thudding. That was explained to me as ""The wood is working"". Often happens when the temperature changes. My desk once produced a thud that was loud enough to wake me from my sleep.
Of course, these noises are mostly very quiet and there is almost never more than one creaking, but up to three in a row is also possible.

mrs_starbuck,"Hey, OP, I know you say that you don't believe in ghosts, and I'll admit that these days I sometimes question whether I do or not, but when I was a child right up to when I was about 17, I lived in a house that I believe was, for want of a better word, 'haunted'. And a lot of the things that you describe here also happened to me in my house, including things going missing and electrical appliances being disconnected and unplugged. Like, I remember once my mum buying a new dress and coming home and hanging it in her closet. She never ever saw that dress again and even when we eventually moved out and boxed up the entire house it didn’t reappear. It was just gone. And once I remember leaving my bedroom for five minutes to visit the bathroom down the landing (I was the only person upstairs at the time) and when I got back my record player and speakers had been disconnected and all placed on top of my bed, their wires coiled up neatly as if I had been about to pack it away. A lot of other things happened too, like unexplained noises and once I even saw an apparition (although this only happened once in the whole 15 years that I lived there). So although I can understand you not wanting to jump to a paranormal conclusion, all I can say is that I never found a ‘human’ cause to the things I experienced and years later, once we’d moved out of that house, one of the neighbours confessed to my mum that they’d always known that house was ‘funny’ but they hadn’t wanted to say anything while we were living there.",null,0,cd6gh7s,1pqgrc,nosleep,new,1

Even with a low light at your back, you will never be able to see out as well as something else can see in.  Also never look directly at your light source.  Keep it in your periphery and conserve your night vision as best you can.

But we heard it a few times and thought maybe it was street racers. It was very late and we were very high and in the middle of sexy times. I couldn't orgasm while my husband was going downtown because this had me so distracted. We heard voices and yelling/screaming male and female outside the window but we saw nothing. I started to wonder if it was the weed making me hear shit but he heard it too. There was also a weird light in the sky, but the room was close to the airport. Creeper out high me had to get up and look and other lights were moving, obvious planes, this one was sitting like a star but it looked like a really bright light. As in every horror cliche, when I convinced him to get up and look the light was gone, the noise stopped and sexy times resumed.

PatrickRsGhost,"It's not the house itself that's haunted.  I don't think the land is that much haunted.  Sounds like the events are tied to specific items in the house.


Is the dining room set something your mom inherited from your grandfather or grandmother?  What about the plates you heard clanking?  Did she inherit a china dining set from her mother or her grandmother?


A lot of the activity you've described sounds like residual activity to me.  Most paranormal sites will describe or liken residual activity to watching a video clip or listening to a sound clip being played over and over.  Whenever I read that description, I keep seeing the movie ""Speed"" when they looped the same five seconds of video over and over to fool the bad guy.  Residual activity is more like watching a rerun of a TV show.  Usually that rerun is aired on a certain night, or right after another rerun was aired right before it, such as a TV series playing in syndication.  Or, you could look at it like a holiday special.  The holiday special, be it ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"", ""Garfield's Halloween"", or ""Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown"" is only played on or close to the holiday in question.  Very rarely will you see a Halloween special being played in the middle of Summer, except maybe a Halloween episode of a syndicated TV show, as I'd described before.


What you've described sounds like residual energy that had attached itself to the objects.  Perhaps the dining room set and the plates were well-loved and used a lot in the past, and so what you heard was a replay of them being used at some long-ago special dinner.  The object your sister heard falling might have been some heavy piece of furniture that you have that might had been dropped or fallen at some point in the past, usually resulting in some dramatic event, like if it fell and killed someone, or if a now-deceased cat knocked it over and caused it to break something else, and whoever owned the piece before's emotions are still tied to the object.


A lot of paranormal investigators have found that spirits are not only tied to places, be it land or a building, but to single objects as well.  There have been multiple reports over the years, some recorded by well-known paranormal investigators like the Warrens, Hans Holzer, John Zaffis, and many others, where the haunting was not centered around a house or land, but rather some common object.  It could be anything from a piece of jewelry or article of clothing (which would be most widely acceptable, since they're kept closer to the person), to even something as odd as, say, a candy bar wrapper.


It sounds to me that whoever owned the items that seem to have the most activity surrounding them is checking up on the objects, making sure they're still in good repair.  Perhaps your family isn't using them as often as they should, and perhaps the spirit is reminding you they're there, and what they're to be used for.",null,3,cd60ilc,1pt0nz,nosleep,new,7

I've seen people here, native americans mostly, in the dead of night. Way before my town even existed, it was a reservation, and many of the people died and were buried here. So when a house or building is erected on top of haunted land, the spirits can easily come into the building. It doesn't sound like the spirits want to harm you.

It was past midnight, the stars shone beautifully and gently. You could see the whole galaxy as though there were no lights around us for at least a hundred miles. I was hugging my ex on her backyard, we could just stare endlessly at the stars. 

I saw a little grey object hovering the moon, and felt something was wrong. The object turned to the moon and seemingly *shot* blue beams into it and half of the moon blew away, scattering small fragments around its own frail orbit. The grey object kept on blowing the pieces one by one until the moon was no more. 

My jaw was hanging open, I was flabbergasted. I looked up but there was no moon anymore, how could that be? All of the sudden terror struck and I knew there would be consequences for not having a moon anymore. Something to do with the ocean.

As the sun broke through the trees, my father arrived, but my ex was no where to be seen, probably fled with her family. My father hugged me and told me he couldn't leave me here to die alone.

I ran next door to get my Mom and we started running for the underground storage warehouse caves that are near my house.  Allot of people had the same idea. I lost her in the crowd but I made it to the caves.  As I did the place where I entered caved in.  Allot of people were stuck in the dark with me. Crying children and a deathly sort of silence followed the chaos.  Then light someone had a lantern.  We stayed in the underground for a while.  Mom was not there.

I've dealt with Zozo 4 times in 14 years. By the third time, he knew me by name. I don't touch the Quiji board and I won't. I went to a neighbors house a few doors down on my third case and asked them if they knew anything about anything weird. They didn't. Asked them if they believed in paranormal. They don't. Asked if they were afraid of a Quiji. They weren't. I said my name was James and was doing an experiment. Asked them to come over and try the Quiji. He put his hands on the Quiji and before I even asked anything it moved. It spelled out ""Hey Jude."" Dude had no idea what was happening. I told him my real name is Jude. I asked aloud who was saying hi. It spelled out zozozozozozozozozozozozo before flying off the table. Yep. Nope. 

Let's make this short, zozo is known to FORCE poltergeist activity onto people. By that I mean, poltergeist activity is caused by severe psychological problems. These problems normally don't exist until zozo enters the picture. Stop fucking with the Quiji. 

I think Zozo has killed like 9 people or caused 9 people to murder 9 people or something like that. None of my cases were ever that fucked up.

booby trapping is often illegal so i would refrain from doing that unless you can get some kind of ok from your local police chief.

this person has some kind of fascination of you, espeically if he took your clothing. where i live there was some guy who was breaking into women's houses and putting their undergarmets on their sheets while they slept and just stared until they woke up and ran out. so you're dealing with someone who is not stable. this feels a lot like penpal and eventually they should stop. the thing about obsession means they may not want to kill you but they may if they feel like they cannot have something from you. but i would advise you know how to handle a knife and keep one near you but hidden at all times. also never stay somewhere alone. always have someone else around. if you hear something you're more likely to have eyes on this person with two people and you're more likely to have someone call the police. having a cell phone is good to because it means you can call 911 anywhere so you can leave your house as well.",null,0,cd8jeoq,1pufa7,nosleep,new,1

I saw her as she entered my room this morning and she walked straight through the door. so either she's a some kind of halucination brought on by sleep deprivation or she's not corporeal. but when she walks it's normal but sometimes it's almost like she teleports but not so much that she can teleport but i can't react fast enough to see her walk. so i left the room to follow the blood trail and she just stayed in my room. it ended on the front porch. my roommate was slightly confused as he seems unable to see the blood trail. i went back upstairs to my room and sat down and looked up at her. she was just standing there. and then i heard a voice. it wasn't someone talking. it was like everything else had no sound and it rang in my head silencing any kind of hearing or mental ability. the words i heard sounded like they came from a woman who was at least 30 to 40, perhaps older. ""i feel old, i feel dead."" where the words i heard. when i looked up she disappeared. i'm not sure what this means. i feel like they were trying to communicate but i don't even have a name to call them by if i was going to. but i don't think it's the spirit of a little girl i'm seeing. it seems like someone much older who perhaps has chosen to appear as they were when they were young. or maybe they appear in that form for some other reason?",null,0,cd77orv,1pvcfc,nosleep,new,2

The energy you feel should be warm feeling.  Practice a lot until you can feel the aura of many things.  Try feeling many different auras at once.  After you get a good feel for that, sit by yourself and start to feel your own aura.

In fact, a Chinese man who was the recipient of a facial transplant in 2006 died in 2008, in part because he stopped taking his immunosuppressant drugs.  Second, a dead donor wouldn't work because the tissue would have already started to die.  Finally, even if you had an appropriate face, it's not just a matter of removing it and sewing it on.  You would have to remove your own face and then use microscopic needles to connect arteries, veins, muscle, and nerves then suture on the new face.

The next few days it's all he talked about. How the rabbit would open a hole in the wall. He said he left his body and went through the hole and the rabbit showed him places and told him things that when the got back he couldnt remember. I just told him he is probably dreaming all this up. 

Well that night there was scratching on the wall in my room. I looked around and couldn't find anything making the noise and decided that it must be something outside or a mouse got inside the wall. Well it just got louder and louder. Until I finally got dressed and went outside. Nothing was there. I went back in my room where the scratching was still going on. I hit the wall a few times hopefully scarring away the rodent. It stopped for a few seconds and the continued. It kept going until around 3am the it stopped completely. 

The next morning we were eating breakfast and my lil bro didn't say anything about the rabbit. As glad as I was to finally not here him talk about it, it just wasn't normal. 

So I asked him ""Didnt the bunny see you last night?"". Now what he said chills me even today. He said, ""He didn't take me anywhere last night. He told me he was trying to see you, and you wouldn't let him in. He said you tried to hit him."" 

After that I started asking questions about this bunny. All I got was that he would take him places and tell him secrets. The stuff he learned he would forget when the came back. Also the bunny wasn't just a bunny. He supposedly looked like the guy off of Donny Darko. A more realistic version. But the movie hadn't been released yet.

throwaway77752,"Throwaway because this touches on some things that are fairly personal.

Need some backstory:

When I was a teen I had some nightmares (at least I really hope that they were nightmares, the event I'm describing will explain why I am unsure about that). These nightmares were broken up in weird ways, as nightmares often are, but they were of me being abducted by aliens. I always brushed them off as a product of my imagination.

Fast forward eleven years. I have two children. I have  never, and still haven't spoken about those nightmares where the children MIGHT overhear. Only at home while they are gone, and only with a small, select group of people. Last summer (not the one we just got out of) my son was four, and I started having nightmares like that again but wasn't telling anyone. That was in June.

The nightmares hadn't stopped by mid-July, in fact they were more frequent and longer, and I was waking up with bruises. I figured it was me thrashing about in my sleep, so I decided it was time to set up a counseling appointment. That night, my girlfriend and I are putting the kids in bed and my son looks at his Mom while I am standing in the doorway, I assume he didn't realize that I hadn't entirely left the room and due to angle he couldn't see me, and this conversation happens:

Him:
""Mommy, tell daddy he'll be okay.""
Her:
""What to you mean, daddy's fine.""
Him:
""But daddy's worried that when they come in their spaceship and take him we might not come back.""

At this point I am starting to have an anxiety attack, but I keep listening.

Her:
""Wait, are you talking about aliens.""
Him:
""Yeah, but they like to be called planet strangers.""
Her:
""Oh, is that so?""
Him:
""Uh-huh, but they said not to worry, they promised they would bring daddy back after they brought him up in their spaceship and that they wouldn't hurt him.""
Her:
""Okay then, you sleep good little man.""

Her and I stepped into the back yard and she was smiling thinking the whole thing was funny, until she noticed that I was visibly shaken. She asked me what was wrong, and I explained that I had been having those nightmares again for over a month.

That was the most terrifying thing a child has ever said around me, ever.

monster_bunny,"This isn't scary in the sense of ""I see dead people"" but rather like a smack of reality from the least likely place. 

I should start by saying I have a small disdain for children. I don't know, I guess I was just born without that ""mom"" gene.  So whenever I'm around kids, I'm awkward. I do, however, have a huge spot in my heart for the mentally disabled. 

I was working a job in a sports venue fresh out I college. After a couple years, it became a hell hole. A prison to my aspirations, really. I had major reservations about my co-workers, who played terrible jokes on me and made my life hell. In a sales-oriented environment, this was seen as friendly competition. For me, it was more like harassment and Dante's 9th Circle. I would get that horrible feeling it my stomach just getting into my car for the commute to work. Stuck in traffic? No big deal. Just prolonged my entrance to misery. I would get physically ill just pulling into that parking lot every weekday morning. 

Well one of our marketing ladies had a few kids, and one of them was sadly born with severe autism. High functioning, but definitely compromised. This kid was about 7 at the time. One day, she brought them into work. They were always very well behaved so it didn't bother me much. My co-workers had left for lunch and it was just me doing my work, when the disabled child in question watered into my desk area and found comfort in the spiny chairs. 

I gave him a smile. Out of nowhere he asked me what I wanted to be when I was little. Now, normally I would have responded with some bullshit answer like a doctor or a police officer, but I was feeling particularly shitty this day so I told him the truth. 

Here is that conversation. 

Me, lightheartedly-""I had no idea when I was your age, but I don't think I imagined myself doing this!""

Kid-""Why?""

Me ""I dunno.""

Kid ""Do you like your job??""

Me Shellshocked. Sudden urge to be honest. ""No. I'm not very happy here.""

Kid- ""Then why don't you quit?""

Me- totally at a loss of my surroundings. ""Well, I don't really know. I guess I don't have an answer for ya.""

Kid ""That's silly. You should at least be happy.""

Me tranced- ""yeah. I guess I should.""

Kid- ""What do you wanna do instead?""

Me- "" I want to be an actress""

Kid- ""Then why don't you be an actress?""

Me- ""I...I,..don't know.""

Cue the kid's mom calling him from down the hall to go to lunch together. 

Kid- ""bye""

Me- ""(untangible words) ""bye""

I spent the rest of the afternoon browsing local community theatre advertisements and started applying for auditions. And now, I'm an actress. And I'm happy.

Something about that kid. It's like he reached down into my soul and said ""Hey, you fucking moron! What are you doing to yourself?! You're miserable and you're going to keep living this pathetic rat race of a life unless you listen to your heart.""

She used to love this game, and she always chose the same hiding spot in the closet next to the door where my sister kept wrapping paper and coats. I would search for a few minutes before finally getting to the closet, and since she is only 2 and quite short, I would look over her head and pretend not to notice her. After that, she would leave the closet and ""sneak up"" on me to gobble me up instead.

The last time we played the game, she was in her usual hiding spot and I guess she had managed to shut the door all the way. She would usually leave it cracked open so she could watch me search through the house and giggle.

For my story, I was visiting my cousin (she was about 8) in Italy and we were sharing her room. Before going to bed the fifth night I was there, I wished her a good night, she replied (translated) ""Goodnight, I hope you two sleep sound.""

My mom got extremely worried, but then thought maybe she was just being a kid and saying shit. But my sister kept telling different stories about this man, who was really nice, that would come to her window and she would let him in her room. (This was around the same time that my parents were always fighting and got a divorce a year later). The man would come in her room and *climb on her fucking walls and ceiling* and talk to her, casually, about her feelings and whatever was going on in her life that was bothering her. 

There was a nail in the floorboard that had always been sticking up out of the floor about a half inch or so. One night, when walking to the window, she stubbed her toe on the nail and it started to bleed. The man gave her a band-aid and hammered the nail in. She woke up the next morning with the wound and band-aid on her toe and even the nail in the floor was still fixed. My sister remembers everything clearly today and she's 21 now.

arkmtech,"I grew up with sleep paralysis and various dreams/nightmares as a common (often nightly) occurrence. 

A couple of things I've learned about it in my 30-some years:

* Sleep paralysis nightmares are often triggered by subtle, unfamiliar noises (such as the wind blowing, or air whistling through a heating vent) in an otherwise quiet environment. 

    If prior to going to sleep you turn on a fan to generate white noise, or tune-in your radio (perhaps at a quiet volume) to a station that plays familiar songs, the nightmares &amp; paralysis are less likely to occur.

* If you see (or sense) a dark, indistinguishable figure somewhere in the room with you, it's nothing to be afraid of. Most times (and for most people) it just stands and watches - Occasionally it comes over and touches you, or may even sit on you, but it's entirely harmless.

* Move your feet. I know, I know... you can't. Most people think they can't. But you CAN. Wiggle them at the ankle. 

    After telling many others with sleep paralysis this, they've been able to do everything from completely regaining control to flying. Not sure why this is, but let me assure you that it works.

Hope that helps you a bit - Get some rest now! :-)

""You are not respecting me, nor your mother.."" he paused, stretching out his hand to steady himself against the doorframe. "".... as you should be.""

""Look Jerry. I just want a glass of milk, then I'll go to my room. I'll be out your way."" I said as I forcefully pushed past him and into the kitchen.

""You sooon of a bitch."" He slurred at me. I knew him to well not to know what was going to happen next. I ducked as he made a swing at me, his fist flying right over me and crashing into the wall.

This time, though, I fought back.

Putting my full momentum behind it, I swung my fist straight into his gut. This time it was him who doubled over in pain, winded and gasping for air.

Pleasure overwhelmed me like a flood that sweeps over a dry plain ; as I embraced my anger, embraced the rage that I had accumulated over the years of abuse, pain, grief and neglect.

I was not finished with him. No. I had merely begun.

As he was doubled over in pain, I brought my elbow crashing back into his exposed neck, sending him crashing to the floor below.

He looked up at me with, his eyes wide and terrified. He was suddenly scared of me. And he was right to be so.

""Please"" he pleaded. ""Have mercy on an old man like myself.""

""Mercy?"" I spat back out in reply. ""Tell me Jerry, when did you have mercy on me? When did ever listen to mine, or my mother's, pleas for mercy you little shit?"" 

Without giving him a chance to reply,  I started to kick him as hard as I could in the ribs. I wanted to break that fucker's lungs.

I knew at the time, that I was giving into my rage, into my anger. But boy did it feel good. I hadn't felt the pleasure, the bliss this strong ever since I killed my bunny, Darcy, many years ago.

I couldn't stop now.

I had to step it up a notch.

He lay on the ground, gasping for air. His face and hands begging for the mercy that he could not voice.

And I showed him none.

I grabbed the heavy cast iron fry pan that lay resting on the oven nearby. As I swung it done upon his exposed legs, I realised I had the ultimate control over him. The power between life or death.

He screamed out in raw pain as I smashed his legs repeatedly, over and over again. I shuddered with pleasure as I finally heard the loud pop of his bones break in each leg.

I walked back to the oven, gently resting the frying pan back on it, unworried about Jerry trembling in pain on the ground behind me.

He wasn't going anywhere. Not with those broken legs.

Yanking open one of the many kitchen draws, I searched through it, looking for my favourite carving knife. Finally finding it, I turned around back to Jerry, my hands trembling with both rage and excitement at what I was about to do.

I couldn't stop now.

I had to step it up a notch.

Jerry eyes darted from looking at the grin plastered over my face, to the knife I held in my trembling hand, the realisation hitting him instantly.

""Please."" He began to weep, tears streaming down his face. ""Please, I beg of you, don't do this. I am sorry, you hear me."" He stretched out a shaking hand in my direction, as if to push me and the knife away. ""I AM FUCKING SORRY.""

I did not pause to listen to his screams, but instead took another step in his direction. He was just a coward. Just a fucking coward.

 ""YOU HEAR ME BOY. I AM SORRY FOR ALL THE SHIT I DID TO YOU AND YOUR MUM.""

""Keep shouting."" I taunted back at him. ""Show more of the fucking coward you were all along, hiding beneath a facade of strength and alcohol.""

He tried to reply, but his mouth failed him and instead just shook in terror, drool trailing out the side of his mouth.

Sinking down to one knee, I grabbed him by the scruff of his t-shirt and roared in his face ""SHOW ME.""

He couldn't even look at me, the fucking coward. Instead he closed his teary eyes shut, drool still spilling out of his spluttering mouth. His body trembled as I held him, his paralysing fear increasingly apparent by the yellow  wet stain leaking from his crotch.

I raised the carving into the air, my whole body trembling, not from fear, but from the rage that coursed through my veins. I paused there temporarily, wondering for a moment how I had gotten here. How I had come so far from that little boy that saved an ant so long ago.

But I couldn't stop now.

I had come too far to turn back now.

I had to step it up a notch.

Letting out a howl of raw pain and rage that shook me to the very soul, I brought the knife down as hard as I could, the blade sinking deep into Jerry's soft flesh.

I stabbed him for every time he abused me.

I stabbed him for every time he hurt my mother.

I stabbed him because my Dad was dead.

I stabbed him because my mother had turned to him in her grief, rather than me.

I stabbed him because he never even came close to be being like my Dad.

I stabbed him because he had fucked up my life.

I stabbed him because I could nothing else, I had come too far.",null,1,cd8j2bg,1q2kev,nosleep,new,7

The fact that he apparently likes to hang out in the bathroom makes me think he's a bit of a pervert too.

I think your presence stirred him up a bit, and when you were gone for awhile he might have started to let go out of boredom. Now that you're back, and with a kid, he's got someone to interact with again. 

I can't imagine why a spirit would want to stick around pranking and poltergeisting people unless it's got some emotional issues. He even tried to grab your friend Anna? What happens if you ever decide to sell the house, or someone else moves in with you that he decides he doesn't like?

But you must not strike them.
You don't know the exact rules. You don't know whether these things are physical or ghosts or whatever. If you hit them, it might allow them to hurt you. Honestly, I'd avoid making any physical contact with them at all. 

You took measures against them with the salt line, which is a start, but since they are coming to you away from your house now, it is time you get some sort of talisman, something that is meaningful to you and tailored to you. A cross won't do jack shit for you if it means nothing to you. Anything can be a talisman so long as it deeply, at the pit of your being, means something to you.

He worked at a state park and he was making his rounds when he spotted a man laying on the ground near the camp grounds. He thought the guy maybe sick or injured, so he went to check on him. It turns out he was injured. He had shot himself with a shotgun the night before. My friend was the first person who cared enough to check on the guy laying there. 

The police came and got the body about 5 hours after they were called. It turns out the guy had been reported missing by his family a few days before. For some unknown reason he drove several hundred miles from his home, rented a camping spot in a small state park, and committed suicide.   ",null,2,cd9l025,1q4wg0,nosleep,new,3

WillOTP,"**Formatted Story + Minor Edits**

It was some time after an awesome party. It was 10:00, and me and my buddies had a great time at my friend's house. I was ready to crash on the couch for the rest of the night, but the wiser decision was probably to go to my actual bed. 

Or so I thought.

 It was pretty lonely, me being half an hour away from the city. I slipped into some sweatpants and a long t-shirt. It would have to do. I was too tired to do anything otherwise. 

It was a beautiful summer night, out here in the quiet woods. I liked and appreciated the nature. And yet, for some odd reason, I was restless. Unsettled. It was an odd feeling. Like being watched. I brushed off my nervousness and concentrated on getting some sleep. 

I walked to the bathroom, which was right across from my bedroom. Convenient. I turned on the tap to wash my face. Anxiously, I closed my eyes and filled my cupped hands with water, splashing it on my face. I opened my eyes to grab a nearby white towel. Regaining my senses, I entered my room. 

Then I noticed something I hadn't seen before. 

There, lying in front of me, were a pair of bloody scissors. The blood was still wet. It was new. I tried to come up with a logical explanation for blood being on the scissors. Maybe I had cut my ankle on accident while walking out of my room. I checked my feet. There was no scars or dried blood on anything. Nothing that indicated a cut. 

The blood drained out of my face. No. I didn't remember cutting myself, on accident or not. I picked the scissors up. I threw them away, trying to forget I'd even found them in the first place, hoping I'd eventually forget about it. I told myself it never happened, concentrating on the other tasks at hand. 

I had two dressers, one of which had a big window beside it. I also owned a big placeable mirror, one you couldn't hang up. Every night, I would switch the mirror to the dresser facing the window so that you could see the window through the mirror, just to reflect the beautiful night. As I hefted it up, I felt a chill crawl up my spine and I could feel it ringing in my head. What kept giving me these unsettling feelings? 

As I was about to place the mirror on the dresser, I could see through the mirror that a pale, white face appeared in the window. It wore a creepy, wide smile, with yellowed, worn out teeth, as if it ate metal. Yet it's teeth were sharp and pointed, which was strange. The corners of its mouth were bloody. 

Its eyes stared at me. They were huge, gaping eyes, as if they were looking not only at me but if they were looking right through me, tearing my soul and being. I couldn't tell if it was male or female. I couldn't even tell if it was HUMAN. I wanted to scream, but my voice caught in my throat. 

For five seconds, I just stared at it. It seemed like time stopped. It stared back. Then the face moved away in a millisecond. That's what got me back into motion.

 I dropped the mirror. It shattered into pieces at my feet, wincing as a few fragments of glass pierced my bare leg. I backed away, too scared to make a sound. I was breathing quietly, but heavily. I heard my front door open. Frantically, I ran to close my door. I leaned against it. My heart crept into my throat, pounding constantly. 

I thought about its face. The bloody corners of its mouth, as if it had been cut. My eyes lingered to where I had thrown the scissors. Oh no. But how... I tried to find an answer. It was in my house. It cut its mouth into a smile. With the scissors. Why was it outside now? It had obviously been in here recently. But then, the truth unearthed itself. I mouthed the answer. 

IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN HERE. 

I couldn't believe it. I tried not to believe it. Then the power went out. Great. The opening of the screen door broke my thoughts. It was inside. My breathing stopped. Its footsteps were loud. It walked at a slow pace. 

I inhaled. It stopped. I sensed it could tell where I was. But it walked to the kitchen. I could hear it rummaging through the drawers. I heard a metal scraping sound. It was pulling out a knife. 

Tightly, I closed my eyes. Tears ran down my cheeks. I slid down the door, sitting down on the floor. I was going to die. It swirled around, hearing my quiet sobbing. It made its way toward my bedroom. It stopped at my door. I could hear its breathing through the crack. It spoke in my ear. 

""COME OUT COME OUT AND PLAY WITH ME..."" 

It's voice was hoarse and sounded tripled, as if there was three voices talking at once. I froze. 

When I did not answer, it spoke again, whispering, ""LISTEN TO ME. COME OUT. YOU CAN HEAR ME. I KNOW YOU CAN."" 

It sounded wistful, as if it were a child wanting a friend. I reached in my pocket for my cell phone. It wasn't on me. No... I slumped against my door. 

The voice screamed, ""LET ME IN. I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE. LET ME IN."" 

It slid its knife through the crack in the door, barely missing my arm. My phone was on the other side of my room. My mind raced. Dare I make a break for it? I slid my leg and tried to grab my phone with my toes. It slid away. I bit my lip. I had to grab it. I quietly slinked away from the door, hoping the psycho wouldn't notice. 

I grabbed around the pitch black room for my phone. I felt a flat, rectangular shape slide into one of my hands. My phone. I dialed 911. Holding the phone up to my ear, a woman's voice said, 'Sorry, we could not locate any reception to your phone. Please try again.' 

I kept dialing over and over again. I had forgotten all about that... THING... coming into my room.. Slowly, the door opened. There it was. It laughed hysterically.

~~Saturday morning I woke up and saw the box on my desk. Mass confusion hit me until I remembered ""Oh wait... the gift..."". I fumbled with it, and put it back down. I had to run some errands that morning and decided that I'd open it that afternoon when I got home.~~

~~I went out for the whole day. My feet were sore when I got back in, maybe because I hadn't walked around like that for so long. Whatever the case may be, I collapsed on my bed and dozed off.~~

~~When I woke up, it was 10:25 P.M. and my room was completely dark. The TV in the living room was blaring about selling me the latest ""blenders"" with ""four blade technology"".~~

~~I lay in bed for a few more minutes, then I rolled over, my eyes landing on the small box. *Okay,* I thought to myself. *Let's open this puppy up.* (I was mimicking my favorite line from one of my favorite video games)~~

~~I grabbed a pair of scissors from the cupholder, the blue glow from the TV set in the other room was just enough light for me. I was careful to be very gentle with the box, just in case something was triggered by touch. The scissors glided over the tape and I was in. I folded back the cardboard gentle, and slowly.

ShadeeLeeann,"You both took your hands off the planchette before closing the circle; you opened a door when you started that game. 

Metaphorically, your fingers' physical contact with the glass were the hold you had to the door's handle. That contact grounded, and confined a small section of the spiritual realm to only that glass planchette. 

When you let go, you lost your grip on said door, and the choice of who - or what - passes through the threshold. You left an entryway for spirits to come and go as they please. In your home, no less. 

Now they don't even need an invitation to invade your, and your family's, life. You already gave it to them. 

That was a foolish thing to do. By what you've described of him, trust me when I say the entity you summoned is not your friend. I sincerely hope you find a way to close it very soon.

Take the planchette and submerge it in another saltwater jar, tying it off with red ribbon just like the others. DO NOT BREAK IT.

Take each jar and bury it in a separate location, far from where you live.


After that, perform a home cleansing by burning sage in every room while loudly and firmly revoking the invitation of any spirits into your home.

musicboy2109,"I had played with a Ouija board myself back when I was in high school. Honestly my first encounters were good. Whatever this spirit was it claimed to be my grandmother. I had some of my friends play while I was in the room but not a part of the circle and had them ask questions about her that only I knew the answer to and they were true. Well eventually as we kept playing it was no longer this kind spirit we had been talking to... It was someone who referred to itself as ""D"". It no longer had any interest in answering any of our questions and it only was interested in making threats. I didn't dispose of it right away. I kept it in my closet but never played with it. Tapping noises kept happening in my closet so I put it outside in the trunk of my car to keep it out of my house. Well then the tapping moved from my closet to the window right outside my bedroom. I was scared but shortly after I was involved in a car accident which completely totaled my car but not the other two cars involved and the Ouija board was still in the trunk. Since the accident I no longer have the board and the paranormal incidents have stopped. I don't know whether their are good spirits you can encounter with the Ouija board or if they are just manipulative but it is something I no longer feel comfortable messing with.

Lyn5643,"I think I can clear up the ""Peggy"" name thing. When I was 16 we moved into the bottom half of a duplex and my 2 sisters and I shared the basement while my parents, brother, and infant sister lived upstairs. While my mom was pregnant she kept waking up seeing floaty things that looked like lightning bugs above her bed and in the shower. The windows and back door would open randomly in the night all the time. They told my mom the baby would have down syndrome and likely suffer from cystic fibrosis. My mom attributed the open windows and stuff to stress then a ghost. At Christmas we were talking about it to my grand mom and my mom and I were finishing each others sentences it got pretty creepy. We both pictured a red headed woman from the 1950s who was beautiful and kind and we both pictured her in a mint green kitchen decorated with pink rose accents like the towels and stuff. It wasn't a dream or a psychic vision, it was like we just knew that's what it was. Oddly though we had pictured the same thing. We found out after bad flood damage that the house was FULL of toxic black mold. We were nearly evicted for not paying rent so my dad worked out a deal with the landlord to fix the mold issue, paint the house and he'd write us a great letter of recommendation to move out. By this time the baby was born with asthma, 3 out of 5 of my siblings and my mother have asthma. I think the ghost was trying to ""air out"" the house. Found out she had died in childbirth. When my dad pulled the wood panels off the kitchen walls we found mint green paint and a porcelin knob with a rose on it.

So following the logic behind an insane mind, kill the source of the unlucky events and it all gets better. And, of course nobody looks down on the guy with 104+ murders, nobody knows it's him, it specifically says the authorities can't track the murders. But it was very obvious that the father tried to kill his eleven year old son, so of course people will be ashamed of it. I mean, I'm all for constructive criticism, but complaining about points that are perfectly justifiable makes me mad and ashamed honestly.

NotMyCircus8612,"Please read this whole comment. Nope. Don't do it. Don't go ask your neighbors. I suffered from a form of psychosis for a short period of time, where nearly everything you have talked about happened to me. I heard voices, discussing everything I was doing in my home. I started to think it was the neighbors or something, and the voices told me to go ahead and just knock on their door. That they'd tell me what was going on. Out of fear of looking insane I didn't. Once I noticed that they followed me to any home I went to... i.e. my moms apartment, my dads house, my place, I knew it had to be me. There was no way that someone could be watching me in every single place and that I could hear them. I went to the doctor, sought help, they started prescription meds and the voices went away. I stopped taking the meds shortly after and I've never heard them since. My psychosis was only temporary. In my case the voices sounded exactly like those of my closest friends. I was convinced they were playing a prank on me, messing with me. That they had somehow rented the place next to mine, or were hiding somewhere in my place. Sorry this was so long. It really freaked me out reading this... It is EXACTLY what I went through. If you want to talk more about my experience feel free to message me.

The victim usually wakes with a feeling of terror, has difficulty breathing because of a perceived heavy invisible weight on his or her chest, and is unable to move i.e., experiences sleep paralysis. This nightmare experience is described as being ""hag-ridden"" in the Gullah lore. The ""Old Hag"" was a nightmare spirit in British and also Anglophone North American folklore.""

casewall,"The weight thing blows my mind. I've heard so many people mention that to me. It's gotten to the point where whenever someone suggests that they've been experiencing it, I'm immediately able to confidently respond with, ""Oh, that's a demon."" 

What interests me the most is that when you were talking about the pressure, I couldn't stop thinking about Psalm 22:3, which is ""Yet You are holy, O You who are enthroned upon the praises of Israel. (Psalms 22:3 NASB)"". The translation of this is pretty literal, as it's saying that God Himself SITS on our praises. As in, when He is praised, He wants to dwell there, be around, or join the party (if you will). Then I started to think about the opposite. If I believe that verse to be a truth about God, would it be totally ridiculous for me to imagine that the enemy and/or those who represent his domain does the exact same thing with fear? It's believed that when people are praising God, they are intentionally inviting Him in, and because He's the gentleman that He is, He comes, seizes the opportunity to show Himself. Demons are not gentlemen, and they don't require an invitation, which is a scary thought. But, if one is delivered, I can imagine that they'd seize that opportunity in a similar fashion to what you've experienced.

malignant elementals. I believe they feed off attention from humans, and can grow to be either very very helpful or very very dangerous, depending on the energy and attention you put into them.

---

I was trying to forget, forget how happy I was, how much I enjoyed that time with him. But seeing the event in the newspaper made the memory rush back to me like a swarm of bees. The headline read “Jack Townsmen found dead, killer remains unknown.” 

I couldn’t believe he was gone. Even now, I do the same as I did when I first found out he was dead. I kept dying it to myself, over and over again. Whenever I think back on the event, the tears always come rushing to my eyes. I loved that moment, craving for it to last forever. But, he ended up dying, ending our beautiful moment. 

Why? Why did he have to die? Jennifer ran to me and pushed me half way off the seat as she sat on the other half (it was towards the end of class during free-time). My thoughts were interrupted when she saw what I was reading and asked “Oh my god… I’m sorry Liz. Are you okay?” 

What kind of question is that? I’m reading a story about my boyfriend found dead along with an unidentified killer out there. You don’t try to comfort me, you don’t even look sad, all you do is ask if I’m okay? Stuff like this always pisses me off about people, Jack always used to do that with me. It’s okay though, I should stay calm. Me and Jennifer will have fun, won’t we? 

DING! DING! DING! 

Oh thank god, saved by the bell from talking to her. Guess that term really does apply in life, “Saved by the bell.” Funny. Walking home now, I try and re-live the memory of that beautiful moment. But like always with precious moments, it’s never the same feeling. 

Again, I should stay calm, I have all the memories in the pictures I took. Looking at his face, his eyes. The memory brings such peace to my mind. The smiles I had in these pictures, god that really was the happiest moment of my life. All because of my sweet boyfriend Jack. 

Grabbing the bloody knife in my hands, it’s all running back to me now. How clueless and blind he was, how he always sugar coated everything and never really cared. The exact thing that literally drives me insane with people. The pleasure, the happiness I got from finally taking that knife and stabbing it inside his stomach. How wide his eyes got… The blood gushing from his wounds and mouth. 

I kept on stabbing him, letting all that built up anger release. How hard I laughed in that moment, how I felt that piece of paradise everyone always dreams about. And like always, no one ever suspects the innocent loving girlfriend who lost her boyfriend. 

I miss that moment with Jack, almost as if I want to do it again? But who would my next victim be if I were to choose to do it again? This question has constantly been bugging me for the whole day now. Trying to think of someone, looking at someones face in school that just gave me the feeling that they should be next? 

Come on, think, who's someone that's similar to Ja- Wait a minute... Jennifer… Yes, her, perfect. My best friend Jennifer who I obviously ""love"" so dearly. I must call her, find a way to meet up with her. Picking up the phone, I called Jennifer. 

“Hey Jennifer… Want to come over later?’’ I asked. 

“Oh yeah sure Liz, sounds great.” Perfect, so much easier when your victim comes to you. Now then, a plan... Oh, that's easy, we’ll lead her to my closet. Show her the bloody knife, show her the pictures, and then we’ll have the most beautiful best friend moment in all of history. 

Of course it won’t be as pleasurable as with Jack, but it’ll still be nice looking at her. 

The shock so easily shown from her face and eyes. Asking me why, over and over again. Then just finally seeing her choke on her words as the blood finally gushes from her mouth. It’ll be quite enjoyable, I just have to find a way to lure her to my closet. I could just, shut off the power? Yes, that’s exactly what I’ll do. I’ll just shut off the power and scream her to come and help me. It’ll be so easy due to the fact of how gullible she is… 

DING!

The fabric was so thick she had to ask for help but nobody was home to answer. She got up and began to feel light headed (she was being choked for several minutes while asleep).

When I lived in Gulfport Mississippi I had a friend who lived in an apartment with her husband. One day she came in to work and told me about a dream she had. She was in a field with her husband and saw a man waving at her, trying to get her to go to him. He was near a large lonely tree. Her husband kept telling her not to go and to ignore the man which she did.
She had this dream 3 days in a row.
The creepy part? All during this time the couple noticed a smell in their apartment. They checked everything and couldn't find a source. It kept getting stronger and they called the super who also couldn't find the source. 
The super remembered that the ventilation was shared between hers and the upstairs apartment. Super tries to get neighbor to the door with no luck. That's why it went on for three days. Finally the door is forced with the cops there to follow procedure for opening his apartment without his consent.
What they find is the neighbor dead, stabbed so many times the stopped counting after 50 some odd hits. 
My friends dream stopped after that. I clearly remember her coming in each day to work talking about the dream before the smell problem.
Why was he killed? He brought a prostitute and her pimp to his apartment on the promise of crack cocaine if she serviced him. He had no drugs and the pair became enraged. They killed him in a frenzy, changed into some of his clothes, jumped out the 2nd story window in back and got away.
This made the news and can be checked. It was in 2002-2005 time frame.

hirschey112,"This reminds me of a story about an experience that my mom had when I was little. She was very close with her grandfather, who lived about two and a half hours away at the beach. My parents would bring me there a few times a month to see him, because he had a soft spot for me.

 When he was in his late eighties, he wasn't doing well and ended up being admitted to the hospital. Everyone pretty much knew that he only had a few days left and it was only a matter of time before he passed away. It was the summer of 1994, I was a year and a half and my mom had just gotten pregnant with my sister. Her grandfather was the first person my parents told because they new it would make him happy during his last few days. He was so excited and he said that he hoped she would turn out just like me. I feel horrible for not remembering him, but I was very little at the time. I have a very vague and most likely constructed memory of sitting on his lap in my house and repeatedly spitting out a green pacifier. I doubt it actually happened, but I like believing that I can remember even a tiny piece of him.

Anyway, my parents and I had just visited Pop for the weekend and my mom decided that we should go back home Sunday evening so she could work the next day. She really struggled with that decision, because she wanted to be there with him at the end whenever it would come. That night, while she was sleeping at home in what later became my childhood bedroom, my mom woke up at around 3 am and she thought she saw her grandfather sitting at the foot of the bed, looking at her comfortingly. She said that by his expression he seemed to be telling her that everything would be okay. Then he disappeared and my mom went back to bed, thinking the whole thing was some weird dream. The next day, her step-grandmother (Pop's third and significantly younger wife) called and told my mom that her grandfather had died at around 3 am that night. My mom believes that he really did come to say goodbye, and she has never forgiven herself for not staying with him at the hospital that night. I'm not religious and because I love science I don't really believe in the supernatural, but the hopeless romantic in me wants to believe that Pop really did stop by that night.",null,1,cdfiqvs,1qonsw,nosleep,new,11

I eventually (30s-1m later) shook myself 'awake' and that was that. The second time, however, was a much different experience. Approximately two years after the first experience, I was staying at my parents house for a few nights. I was trying to pass out on the futon and, half asleep, I rolled to one side. Suddenly my body became frozen like before, but I felt very strange; like an impending doom was near. I looked at the couch parallel to the futon, and on the back of it was a toad, its eyes glowing red. The toad sort of flopped down onto the cushions of the couch, and continued staring. Then out of the corner of my eye I say a black cat enter the room. Its eyes, again, red. It walked towards me oh so slowly, and I knew my time had come. I tried screaming for help, but the only sound I could make was a faint moan.

AcquiredMinerals,"I used to practice lucid dreaming a lot. I found that while trying to do a wake induced lucid dream (attaining a super realistic lucid state  by meditation and slipping into its seamlessly from consciousness) I would fail and end up in a paralytic sleep state. The same old hallucinations would occur, but you can actually control them just as you control the elements of your lucid dream. You are still dreaming and still in control,  if you practice enough. I've turned ghouls that were sitting on my chest into hot babes straddling ne before. And sometimes you can slip into the full subconscious dream from the sleep paralysis stage,  too. It just feels scary at first. 

However.... I quit lucid dreaming. This was after one morning when I'd woken up froma lucid dream at my friends house.  I heard what I thought was his mother sighing  in the parallel room. Neither of my other two frienss heard it. Again, I hear the sigh. "" You guys heard it that time, right?"" A unanimous ""no"" from them. Then, a third time I hear it. ""Okay, you guys HAD to have heard that one"" One says no,  the other says ""yeah."" After she left and I was alone with the first friend, he said ""Dude, I think she just said yes cause you asked three times,  that's what she's like. I didn't hear shit.""

I immediately stopped lucid dreaming. When reality starts to blur, you don't fuck with that shit. ",null,0,cdjyy3w,1qs3hz,nosleep,new,2

Anyway, once, only once, I was experiencing this laying on my side facing the wall that was probably a foot and a half away from me. At first all I heard was silence. Then, a man, at least it sounded like a man, started whispering directly into my ear. I was so scared while this was happening that I didn't really hear anything he had to say. The only thing I remember, is that he wanted me to do something. I tried my best to wake up or scream no so someone could hear me and save me. Well I managed to wake myself up because my asleep body was saying the no 's so loud that it woke me.

Sometimes I  hear the door to my apartment open or someone moving around outside my room when I know no one is out there. It is so real. What is really creepy about my paralysis is that nothing seems out of the ordinary. I can see my room, and exactly where my clothes are strewn about with perfect clarity... Even though in reality my eyes are closed and I'm not actually seeing these things. If you were to ask me any other 'waking' time to recall my room with detail, I couldn't do it. Yet in my sleep paralysis it's as if I'm looking right at these things.

Also, I never really SEE anything, just feel that sense of terror, or impending doom as you so perfectly put it.  I can't move yet my eyes are wide open and I'm staring around my room just knowing that there is a presence somewhere. Seriously, sleep paralysis is so fucked up.

&gt;the blood dripping from the wound and pooling at the hollow of her neck.

No authors write the same as any other and everyone describes things differently, but I read stories on here a lot and something I'm finding fairly consistent is that authors tend to over explain the obvious, we know the blood is coming from the wound, there's no need to mention it. 

&gt;the blood dripping and pooling at the hollow of her neck

That just seems to come across as a little more creepy to me.

Personally those kinds of descriptions that add one tiny detail too many just sort of make me cringe a little, but I like things to be as vague as possible, let the imagination run wild (hence my obsession with Lovecraft), even detailed descriptions of a character turn me off sometimes (although your description of the woman was vital to the story for obvious reasons), but that's just me.

Talking to the next door neighbors one day and they said the house sat empty for years after the murders in that house. Murders? WTF.

We looked up the local records, and sure enough, a family was butchered and killed in that very living room. Nobody would rent the place. The owner ended up selling it to some slumlords, who eventually rented it to us.

Ouja boards and ""talking to the dead"" through mirrors are real life witchcraft and used in the occult. You didn't talk to the dead. You are talking to demons. You probably summoned one into the house. If you aren't Christian, I would recommend getting a pastor or a priest or something to drive the demon out. Really anyone can do it, provided that they are a believer. One of my teachers has either directly done this or has helped people do this. This is pretty much the textbook aftermath of occult practices. The ones who practice it, however, welcome the demons rather than fear them. 

It's really as simple as saying something such as, ""Dear Heavenly Father, Give me strength for the challenges I face, and cast all unkind, mischievous, or evil spirits from my presence. Wrap me in your loving arms to protect and fortify me. I ask these things in your name. Amen."" (Quote from /u/TreasureHouseofDoom 's post).

kasger,"This sounds a lot like sleep paralysis.

I've experience the first part of what you described a dozen of times.
Lying in bed, not able to move but able to watch.


When your body has been lying completely still for a period of time, your brain will start testing you to check if you're awake. Typically you'll get an itch or something similar that should make you move.
If you ignore these 'tests', your brain can get tricked into thinking you are asleep.


This is a common way to enter lucid dreaming, but from my experiences it's hard to do and always ends up pretty scary.

When your brain thinks you are sleeping, it will 'lock' your body to prevent most movement during sleep. After that, the 'dreaming' or, processing of the days experiences will start.
This is where real life and your imagination will get mixed together, all while you are awake.


From what I've read, people often hear whispers, sometimes from dead relatives in this state. I've heard someone whisper my own name once. It's also very common to hallucinate, or completely enter the dream world, which it sounds like is what happened to you.


If you can't avoid this, you can possibly learn to control and manipulate your dream, so instead of it continuing as a 'nightmare', it could be an awesome lucid dream instead. Check [/r/LucidDreaming](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming) for more info on that, and good luck! ",null,1,cdisx3k,1r1tik,nosleep,new,4
Rabbid_Rabbit87,"Assuming this is paranormal and NOT sleep paralysis, then I would say there are only two known types of entities that are physically able to touch you. Those are demons, and poltergeists. These two types go by different names in different parts of the world but they are what they are. Demons, as you probably already know, are evil and want nothing more than to make you suffer. Their intentions, of course, are not readily known. They could be causing you distress to feed off your fear and other negative emotions. They could just be after your soul. One way or another, demons haunt either because they want something FROM you, or they simply want YOU.

Poltergeists on the other hand are quite different and are more unpredictable which can make them more dangerous as we don't know enough about them to know what they want, if anything at all. Poltergeists are believed to be either non-human, non-religious (demon/angel) spirits, or they are beings from a parallel dimension. I believe it is the former.

What these entities want is unclear, but they have known to be harmless in most cases. Typically they are mischief makers that may turn lights on and off, or hide your car keys in the fridge. Some are more malevolent and could kill you by means of straight up throwing a knife in your back as you pass through the kitchen, or maybe make the banister you're leaning on, on the fourth floor balcony give way so that you fall to your demise.

Some have been said to protect and while others are said to mess with you in more diabolical ways. Such may be the case with you. This entity, whatever it is, has the power to touch you, reach into your subconscious and manipulate your dreams at will. Given the extent of it's ability I would say it's less likely to be a demon, though not impossible. I say this because it seems that with what it can already do with you, it should be able to possess you by now if that were it's goal.

But this is all speculation of course and this information is only based on personal experience, experiences of others, stories, videos etc. That being said, some form of research most be done. You need to video tape yourself at night and share your findings for feedback. Try placing a digital recorder near your bed while you sleep to hear what you may. You could even attempt an EVP session to communicate with it. I would suggest having someone else perform the EVP as it's you it is interested in. Also, don't bother with ouija boards. At this point I don't think you could bring in something worse than that but you don't wan to chance pissing it off or giving it more power either. Always remember, too much acknowledgement of the what-ever-it-is may give it more power. Just keep calm and go about your daily activities as if all is normal and go to bed with an idea of a nice dream in mind. Focus on that positive, happy dream, perhaps you can make it happen. I know I have done this and even controlled my dream as I slept. With patience and practice, so can you.

willbo360,"Residual doppleganger. There are certain energies in all of our bodies that flow with our regular schedules. The energies can build up if we are in an area regularly. That is why houses start to feel like 'homes' after a while. It's attachment. Attachment forms a bond with a person, place, etc. I assume your mother is usually where you heard the voice coming from at that time? Whatever she got called in to do is not a usual thing? It's nothing to worry about. I've seen/heard a few copies of people I know, and it can be really strange. They seem like real people until you realize there is no way they are physically there. Same goes with dead people. That's what ghosts are. There can be living ghosts too. Does this make sense?
Attachment to you+attachment to house/room= residual presence.

The energies can manipulate the minute vibrations and sparks in your mind and make you think someone is there. Dead people have weaker energies (they collect with the static in the air, the charged ions floating about, they harness them to gain presence), and that's why you feel that prickle on the back of your neck... That means their presence has taken an interest in you, even if the weaker energies cannot do anything more than influence your mind/mood slightly.
The thoughts you hear sometimes that don't seem to fit with the rest are not yours. The voices you think you hear are not in your head.
The things you see in the corner of your eye are just watching. No need to worry about them.

wjd1990,"I had quite similar experience in the past. 

While staying at my grandma's house for night I always slept in one of the bedrooms upstairs although there was an empty bedroom created for guests next to the living room downstairs. For some reason I didn't like that room because it gave me uneasy feeling - even when I was a teenager. I've spent there only one and only night but it was enough for me to experience one of the scariest and strangest nightmares I have ever had.

I was lying in the bed in the same room but it was a broad day. There was  a woman in a nice golden dress, probably my aunt, talking to me. I couldn't understand her, she was mumbling something uncomprehensible. Then, she disappeared leaving behind her DRESS levitating in the air like a ghost or something in front of a black wardrobe which my grandparents used to store their warm clothes and other clothes that they didn't want to throw away. Like it wasn't scary enough, after a while the wardrobe door opened and other few pieces of clothing- some dresses and a suit, all put on hangers, flew out of it. Those clothes hung in the air next to the golden dress and they started to perform crazy dance flying in circle fast. 

The hellish show lasted for short time but it was enough for me to wake up with heavy breathing and heart beating really fast.

When it starts up, it's a soft footfall like it was when it first started then it gets louder and becomes two footsteps. It gets louder and faster as it approaches the stairs.

 I heard it come down the first step today. I sat here at my computer, frozen. I don't know what it wants, but I'm scared for the safety of my pets. My parents don't believe me and the thing is never out when someone else other than me is home.

Demons,ghost, and unknown entity sometimes use your friends/families name to interact with you.


The place you are playing with when you are a child is place with some demons,ghost and unknown entity.


Spells are commonly not written in english, and you are force to read in German. that is a red flag.


Pricking your finger will result of dripping blood, blood is common sacrifice for activating spells.

Placing a blood in your forehead is never been a protection, it is actually a good saying as you are the sacrifice.

Scattering, burning and destroying such a thing will not do good, demons for example, is not a dying entity afterall. Once you burn all the things they are living with they will find another place to live. And you are the most easy target in this part.",null,2,cdl28uq,1r8n66,nosleep,new,8

If I couldn't reach her I'd try to reach close family members or friends. Since you've both been friends for so long I doubt her family would find it odd that you might contact them if you couldn't find her on your own. If you can't reach her (or maybe even if you can..)I'd do some research on the property itself and see if I could find anything out about the history of it. How many previous owners has the house had? Find out who lived there, why'd they leave? If you can find out some names maybe try to contact previous owners and talk to them directly.  Why has it been abandoned? If I started to entertain the idea of actually going to the house I would probably check it out first. Sit outside of it in my car, somewhere where you wouldn't be too noticeable. If you can't watch from your car, then park it somewhere close by and out of sight but still keep yourself out of sight. See if anyone's coming and going from the property, see if you notice anything weird going on there. If you feel comfortable entering the place after watching it for a bit then go ahead and check it out but if it were me I'd bring someone with that I trust. Make sure your phones charged up and any other type of safeguards you want are in place. I'd check out the house, I'd probably check out everything.

Go to that old house you used to hide out in down by the farm. When you approach the house, try not to make any sound. Go up to the loft and you will find a trunk.

Open the vial and drink it. When you do so your vision will go blurry, but you have to stay calm. Pick up the paper in the trunk and read the first paragraph. It's in German, but I know you won't have trouble with pronouncing it. At this point, you MUST stay calm. You will start to feel closed in and you will start hearing voices. DO NOT listen to what they have to say. Tear the paper into the smallest pieces you can and scatter them on the floor.
When that's done, go downstairs to the ""kitchen"". You will find a gas can and a lighter. Set fire to the house. No matter what the voices say, you HAVE to set fire to the house.

Better yet how the hell could they possibly know where you live, your name, your friends name, AND a place you both went when you're younger? 
Maybe try researching the house, if there were any murders there, anything like that that could insist something that would need to be burned down, From the sound of it it's a ritual.. Even worse a blood ritual, usually that can infer a summoning of something.... Or last resort.. go there, but only if you're as careful as the person says, and see if theres anything on the vial, Or just take the vial and take it to the hospital or somewhere you can get it tested, find out what it is. but that's dangerous taking something from there because let's just say IF it's good reasoning behind doing what the letter says, there could be a malevolent spirit or thing there that could follow you back.. 
Or even worse (Yeah everything in this is bad or worse..) It could be a trap. Say this person does know you both very well like a stalker, and wants to harm you, kidnap you, or kill you, In a way it all depends on how close you and tiffany were in a way,

* * * 

So I'm not sure who to go to about this but I feel like this story needs to be told, if only for my own piece of mind. 

I'm an intern in a city hospital which serves a notoriously under-served community. The hospital itself is old, its been standing since the late 1800s, it used to be a tuberculosis sanitarium. I've never really encountered anything supernatural, but I haven't written off the existence of such phenomena.

 That being said, a shadow in the night isn't enough to make me start thinking of ghosties and ghoulies and long legged beasties and things that go bump in the night. So when I started working nights in the hospital things seemed to go pretty well.


I'd have my admissions, I'd take care of the current patients without issue. Then one night I got an admission, I'll call this patient Jerry. Now Jerry as it turns out has a very long history of coming to this hospital, to the point where admitting him is almost a rite of passage for any would-be-physician that trains at this facility. He has a whole boat load of medical issues, kidney problems, diabetes, high blood pressure. He also has a history of schizophrenia and on top of that he has some good old fashion dementia. 

Before meeting Jerry I was told he's actually a really fun guy, he's always enthusiastic and seemingly happy to be here. So when I went in to see him and found him very sullen, I was a little anxious. 

The admission was done, the orders were placed and I didn't think more of it. He had been admitted for chest pain so I knew I would be going back to draw additional blood work later that night. It was around 2 in the morning when I went back to see Jerry. I was hoping that I could just do it real fast before he fully woke up. When I went in there, Jerry wasn't in his bed. Jerry was now sitting in a corner of the room with his sheet, his gown and pillows all wrapped around him in some sort of makeshift armor. 

I quickly walked over to Jerry and saw that he was crying... not crying, but rather whimpering as if he didn't have the stamina to make it a full cry. I tried putting on a brave face and said ""Jerry whats going on?"" For an old guy, Jerry was quicker than I thought, and stronger than I would have believed. He grabbed my wrist and pulled me towards him. ""They won't leave me alone, they won't let me sleep, they won't let me eat."" He continued on in this line of things the phantom ""they"" wouldn't let him do. 

I assumed it was the staff taking care of him at his nursing home. As upsetting as it was to see Jerry like this, I still needed the blood and this wasn't the first time I'd dealt with a confused older patient. I helped Jerry back to his bed. Then I explained to him how I needed to draw blood to make sure that he was OK. Strangely enough or maybe not so strangely enough this made Jerry feel better, maybe it was something he knew from his long history of being a patient, it was something familiar. 

I tied the tourniquet in place, then I cleaned his arm, found my vein and went for it. I'm not the greatest phlebotomist so its always a relief and a bit of an ego boost when I see the blood traveling through the tubing. 

I was filling up my vial, it was about half way full, when Jerry started screaming, ""LEAVE ME ALONE! LEAVE ME ALONE!"" He began to jerk violently, somehow the needle stayed in place, but then to my disbelief the blood in the vial started backing up the tube as if some force in Jerry's body was pulling it back. I was so shocked I tried to pull the needle right out of his arm, but the needle didn't budge. In shock I pulled harder, my efforts still could not budge the needle. In response, I quickly pulled the vial of blood out from the opposite end of the tubing. The vial which had been collecting blood had gone from being 3/4 full to maybe being about 1/4 full. 

After I pulled the bottle out from the other end of the tubing the needle dropped from Jerry's arm, leaving in its wake what I could already tell would be a one nasty sonofabitch bruise. Again owing to his deceptive quickness and strength Jerry grabbed me and pulled me close again and in a voice that wreaked of desperation and fear he asked me ""Can you see them?"" I pulled my arm free and I ran out of that room. I walked back to the nursing station, one of the nurses asked what had happened because of the screaming. I played it off as being a result of my own mediocre at best blood drawing skill. With the blood now drawn I would be able to get some sleep. 

I made my way to the on-call room, which happens to be in one of the older parts of the hospital. I climbed into one of the beds and closed my eyes. All I could see with my eyes shut was the look in Jerry's eyes when he pulled me close and asked me if I could see them. I resolved that this was a case of some funky weird vacuum trick in the tubing, and a senile sick old man. 

The only trouble is since then the shadows I've seen in dark rooms seem darker, the lights unable to pierce them. The noises from the old pipes have shifted from random tings and pings to rhythmic tappings. I'm not really sure what to make of it. In the past few days the shadows have gotten darker, the tapping louder and now I can't shake a feeling that I'm being watched.

LucklessLemings,"Lurker here.  If you follow the UFO conspiracy theories, MJ-12 stands for the group called Majestic 12 which took over from Project Blue Book for investigating (or rather covering up) supposed UFO phenomenon.  When I researched FM 3-36 TRADOC, I found a handy powerpoint outlining what it is.  It's a field manual outlining terms and things to consider in Electronic Warfare.  The manual is available to look at here.  http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/FM3_36.pdf  As all publicly available field manuals are, it contains very little info on how to wage Electronic Warfare, but just outlines terms and things to consider.  However, some interesting things to consider.  The powerpoint I found was written by two people simply called COL Dixon and william.darley which are microsoft usernames.  There are no links to communicate.  The powerpoint was made in 2004, edited in 2009, and looks like an intro.  Considering how this field is much newer than MJ-12 and the purpose of the powerpoint, it seems like FM 3-36 could have been written in 2004, but I'm not sure.  The version available online was released November of 2012.  So it has been in operation since at least 2004.  One interesting thing is that FM 3-36 is mostly an Army manual, although there is an entire chapter dedicated to working with different agencies and friendly nations.  I haven't found anything specifically outlining hard drive security, although you can bet if it says ""Erase and Destroy"", and it was sent to be destroyed, it's probably been erased.  Now, that doesn't mean all is lost.  Many less experienced people would simply wave a magnet over it, which is an imperfect way of wiping data.  Most likely, they would use a program which erases and writes over the disk several times, erasing it pretty well.  Still, if it has not been physically damaged there could still be a chance to recover the data.  If they were uber secure about data, they might have a program which alerts a server if it's being tampered with by anything with internet access.  So if you have someone checking it out, take out the internet card.  I'd recommend taking a look at Wikipedia, since even the existence of MJ-12 is debated.  From what I understand though, if it did exist, it closed down decades ago.  What would most likely be on there is scanned and conslidated old information.  What is strange is that it would be in a desk, meaning it was being used somehow, rather than in a storage bin or server.  I haven't found any news about air force bases being turned into a nature preserve.  But I've only been looking for half an hour.  I'm gonna find you out.  :)",null,3,cdlnhwb,1ragny,nosleep,new,3

I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend, with a nail gun, and some man uh some old faggot with a dog last week. I killed another girl with a chainsaw, I had to, she almost got away and uh someone else there I can't remember maybe a model, but she's dead too. And Paul Allen. I killed Paul Allen with an axe in the face, his body is dissolving in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen. I don't want to leave anything out here. I guess I've killed maybe 20 people, maybe 40. I have tapes of a lot of it, uh some of the girls have seen the tapes. I even, um... I ate some of their brains, and I tried to cook a little. Tonight I, uh, I just had to kill a LOT of people.

markzzi,"Yepp, you definitely experienced ""sleep paralysis"". It happens to me about once a month. I remember the first time it happend a couple of years ago. I was really exhausted when I went to bed and fell asleep almost instantly. I dreamt about me walking around in a mall. Then I realized I was dreaming and entered some sort of ""lucid dream state"". After having some fun in the dream flying and throwing people around, I opened my eyes and had this ""The Grudge"" looking girl hoovering over me. She pinched me down to the bed and I couldn't move or scream. Then pooff, she was gone and I jumped out of the bed. 

After this experience I read about ""sleep paralysis"" so the second time it happened I knew what was going on and was able to keep calm. 

I have no problem with it occuring from time to time since it always happens  the same way. Me realizing I'm dreaming, keeping my eyes shut, feeling her hair and hearing her whisper. Sometimes she even tries to drag me out of bed, but I'm always waking up at the same place I fell asleep. Sometimes I even open my eyes and stare at her, trying to figure out what she's whispering.

Still waiting for this to happen when my girlfriend is awake. It would be interesting to see how the body is reacting trough the whole thing.",null,0,cdmrh18,1rd3m8,nosleep,new,2

UR_Khaleesi,"I have been to seminars every once and a while. From what it sounds like, she may have been started on a new medication to help with depression or anxiety. Some of the medications, such as Zyprexa, have terrible side affects at first. I was a complete zombie... Like falling asleep standing up lol. It's only like that until you build it up then your body starts getting used to it.

I wouldn't get paranoid. I am sure she is having a hard time with coping. She married the love of her life, and now she wants a baby and can never have one with him. It's a very big life decision that she is faced with right now. These seminars require a lot of 'feeling' and talking. She is likely exhausted from built up emotions. Put yourself in her shoes and think about what she is going through. She can either stay with you and be happy but always have the yearning to know what it would have been like to be a mother, or she can leave you and go through the process of finding someone else on equal footing as you( which may be impossible to her) and have a child...all the while thinking, what if I do all of this and then find out I am not cut out to be a mom. Or what if I leave him, never find someone else and then I'm alone and I'm not a mom.

Coming from a woman...this is a huge life decision. It sounds like she is emotionally exhausted. Check all around for any knew meds that she may be hiding. Or just talk with her...

Usually hypnosis is only done one on one for past life regression not in a group setting. The other way is basically just like a guided meditation where you relax to a point where your mind is clear and then slowly recall vivid memories from your past going backward to the beginning of your life. Past life regression happens after you recall your earliest memories from this life then keep going and recalling memories from someone else's (or your past) life. You can find guided meditations for past life regression on YouTube. 

Hope this helps ",null,1,cdnfebv,1rhbuc,nosleep,new,5
NaturalGlow,"Ok so I spoke with my boyfriend about this to get his opinion. Even though she says she didn't get hypnotized she very well may have been. She seems highly suggestible. It doesn't necessarily mean someone was swinging a clock in front of her eyes. There are different types of hypnosis, one she may not have recognized as such. That being said, it was his suggestion that you get medical help immediately. The things she is doing and saying are very unusual and she probably needs to be evaluated.",null,1,cdnifp6,1rhbuc,nosleep,new,4

menu_balk,"Well, I don't know how mirrors influence dreams, but I know to *never* look into a mirror when (lucid) dreaming.
Lucid dreaming is the state in which you can control your dreaming. Think as your dreams as a semi-sandbox. You can only partially influence the world you are in, but you can completely manipulate that world (fly, find/think up guns etc.). Look up how to trigger it. Its tiresome, but fun.
However, since the part in your brain that controls logic is shut down during sleep, a few things consistently don't work as intended. These are so called reality checks. You can perform these on a bi-hourly basis in real life. You will subconsciously then also perform them in your dreams. When you notice something is 'not right', you become aware you are dreaming. Do note that some reality checks might work as intended, yet you can still be dreaming. This is why it is wise to perform multiple to be sure.
Also the shock/joy of this fact alone wakes you up, however, you can prevent waking from a (lucid) dream by spinning around very fast. This forces your mind to think about balancing, thus canceling out your 'waking up' signal.
Without further ad: reality checks!

1. Digital numbers are all garbled. Your average nightclock might suddenly display something like this: http://goo.gl/rUVPRC
2. Light switches don't work. Remember: no logic. Due to this, light switches don't trigger changes in luminance. They *might* trigger other stuff.
3. Your body is only semi-solid. This means that you can for example, with enough force, push your finger through the palm of your hand. (This is a very easy reality check to work into your daily routine.)
4. Creepy check number one: your hands will often have *more than five fingers on each hand*. And usually they aren't even matched up in number
5. Creepy check number two: mirrors show a distorted/disturbed version of yourself. It sounds interesting, but it is jarring to watch, sometimes enough to wake you up.
6. You can breathe through a closed nose.

Laurashrti,"A few things about mirrors that are considered old wives' tales:

* Don't let two mirrors face each other because it can stop the flow of energy in the house.
* Don't put a mirror in your bedroom because it allows bad spirits into your dreams and they can 'steal your soul.'
* If your soul wanders during the night a mirror can 'capture it.' Another possible reason to keep it out of the bedroom.
* Mirrors can be gateways from spirits, both good and bad.

Just a few things to consider, but take them with a grain of salt. The gateway thing would concern me. Having two gateways facing each other would possibly allow for heavy traffic... if you believe in that sort of thing... :)

The same happened to me a lot when I was younger, it got better with the time.
I can't remember when it started, but I remember having a really hard time sleeping because of the voices. It was like trying to take a nap in the middle of a party! Most of the voices where just rambling, I couldn't even understand what they were saying. When I was about 12, the voices started to call me. Some were unrecognizable, but others were from friends and family, they kept calling my name and I started sleeping with some of those nature sounds things to muffle the sound.
It's nothing scary or anything, it just gets in my way when I'm trying to sleep. :P
Now I'm 25 and I still hear the voices, but I got better at it. Now I can block it, and distinguish what they are saying. Usually it's just lonely people looking for someone to chat with. :)
I've had some weird experiences, though. Once I woke up to someone moaning in pain, right in my ear, and when I woke, scared as hell, the moaning turned into some crasy laughter. -_-
Sometimes I hear whistling, and my dog hears it too.

What could've happened is that part of your brain stops working while dreaming which leaves a distorted image of you once you look in the mirror. Since the ghost wanted to talk about death, you had the thought stuck in your mind about death and your brain emitted screaming in return. In return of your paranormal encounter and your nightmare, you things that it's from the ghost in which gives your brain the fuel for dark thoughts.

Or ill hear bags(I have a pile of like trash bags so I can use for trash) Ill hear that shuffling and they'll run to it and nothings there but they're running all over the room. But the creepiest thing is we'll be laying and ill be watching tv or playing some Gears of war and I'll look over at the cat(s) and they'll stare into the upper corner of my room, same spot every time. and its not like one of those stares like oh look corner of the wall, its one of those stares when they're concentrated and focusing on something. Thats weird. But also my moms bf said the place is haunted he swears of it(i live in a fire house built 180 years ago, used to have a stable for horses and shit, but now thats his show case room area).

ephique,"Since people are in eager need of having some questions answered, I am going to fill them in for you. Vote this up so it gets on top.

When did the sister die? - Shortly after the last time she interacted with Jonathan.

Why was the father acting as if he had seen the sister, when he assumed she was in Jonathans room? - He was playing along, pretending like she was alive in order to give Jonathan the idea that she wasn't dead. Alternatively he could have seen the ghost of the sister, much like Jonathan did with his mother. It's up to the reader.

How did the mother die? - Jonathan first saw her when she was a rotten corpse, he never knew. The father still stated she died of a liver-failure during interviews. If she did or not, no one knows.

Why was the father acting like a british doctor of some sort? He was suffering from schizophrenia. 

Most important though, the story actually has all the hints and details in order to figure this out, and some of you did. I failed as a writer to make some stuff clearer. It's always hard knowing how other people will interpret your story. This is the first story that I've written that is longer than a thousand words.

I want to thank everyone who read it, who gave me tips and who upvoted it. I've enjoyed these 3 days of reddit posts of my story. I really enjoyed reading what people were speculating about the ending, someone mentioned that he would have something behind the fridge; that was my favorite one. 

Thank you :)

Also, why didn't you yourself answer the ending instead of a police report? The story seems unfinished with it ending abruptly and then going with a police report.

I believed there were people were trapped in my walls for most of my childhood... I heard them, after all. But if my grandmother came in for any reason, it would all stop.

Sometimes it still happens, and my doctor believes that both the shrinking/expanding and the music/whispers are a neurological phenomenon related to my migraines. He calls it ""Alice-in-Wonderland-Syndrome Aura"" or ""lilliputian hallucinations"" that cause the feeling of the room warping, and that sometimes children experience this but grow out of it.

NarwhalBanana,ahh wow. It seems to mee it was attached to you. Well if the most of the incidents happened to you so it must of. Plus you grew up basically there so you were growing up. While we are young we see things. Things that are always around but as we grow older we either keep this sight or we loose it and forget. If she was humming tip toe through the tulips then i say burning the house down would be a valid option. That point you said you saw things from the corner of your eye interested me. I have no doubt that you did in fact see things and that's plain old creepy.,null,0,cdq04da,1rqd1h,nosleep,new,2
