Axon350,"[A little while ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1ozb35/who_was_the_first_us_president_to_have_his/ccx9me5?context=3) I talked about the first photograph of a sitting US President. You can see some links in that post.

The earliest surviving photo of a president in office is of James K. Polk. There are a couple undated photos of him, so the order is unclear, but they were almost certainly taken while he was in office because he died just three months after leaving.

Those are the earliest *surviving* (in digitized form, you'd be surprised what you can find in books) photos of a sitting President. Yet there is a mysterious photo of John Tyler. Wikipedia says that Polk was the first to be photographed in office (without citation) but has in its article a photo of Tyler, purportedly taken by Anthony, Edwards, &amp; Co. A press release from March 17, 1845 in the New York Herald talks about an exhibition of pictures taken by Anthony, Edwards, &amp; Co. and mentions a portrait of 'ex-President John Tyler'. The portrait is not described and neither is the date on which it was captured. Another press release mentions the gallery on March 13, implying that it was a multi-day event. Tyler only left office on March 4. 

It is possible that a photo of Tyler was indeed taken while he was still in office. Further corroborating this is a brief blurb here at the Encyclopedia Virginia which mentions an advertisement from 1844 from Anthony, Edwards, &amp; Co. claiming to have photographed Tyler. It is as yet unclear when exactly the existing daguerreotype of Tyler was taken, though I conclude that it is certainly possible for him to have been photographed in office.

Here, on the other hand, is the largely undisputed [first photograph of any US President, John Quincy Adams.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/John_Quincy_Adams_-_copy_of_1843_Philip_Haas_Daguerreotype.jpg) ",null,2,cdpcwce,1ro73k,askhistorians,top_day,11

davratta,"That  would  be  Kluck's  infamous  left  turn.  He  was  supposed  to  keep  marching  west  and  encircle  Paris,  but  Kluck  and  his  superior,  Molke,  were  both  very  concerned  with  the  gap  between  the  First  and  Second  Army.  A  French  observation  plane  noticed  this  change  in  direction  of  Kluck's  army.   Joffre  was  able  to  order  the  BEF  to  advance  into  this  gap,  while  attacking  Kluck's  flank  with  French  troops  from  Paris.        
      However,  you  can  blame  Hemulth  von  Molke  for  detaching  two  corps  from  the  first  army  to bolster  the  German  Eighth  army  in  east  Prussia.   You  can  also  blame  Molke's  tinkering  with  the  Schiliffen  plan.  He  augmented  the  fourth  and  fifth  armies  and  made  the  center  of  his  line  stronger.  The  Italians  did  not  declare  war  and  did  not  send  the  six  corps  that  were  suppossed  to   join  the  German  seventh  army  that  guarded  the  Rhine  river.  So  Kluck  went  into  the  battle  of  the  Marne  with  fourteen  fewer  divisions  than  Schiliffen  intended.  Molke  did  not  keep  the  right  wing  strong  and  ignored  the  dying  words  of  the  plan's  developer.   The  two  corps  Molke  detached  from  the  first  army  were  to  late  for  the  decisive  battle  of  Tannenburg,  but  did  help  the  Germans  kick  butt  at  the  battle  of  Masurian  Lakes  two  weeks  latter.  These  two  major  victories  stopped  the  Russian  steam  roller  and  destroyed  Russia's  Second  army.

*But*, because of Poland and the later invasion of Finland, the British and French were very interested in bombing the Soviets, and possibly even providing troops to support the Finns. One of the early plans for the intervention into Norway (which was planned *before* the Nazis invaded, btw) was to deploy troops across Norway, which would serve as a bridgehead for deploying troops into Finland. 

Actually, the biggest reason why these plans fell through was the collapse of the Finnish resistance. But the Brits and France were really keen on attacking the Soviets. Of course, that all changed when the Norway was invaded, and later when France was attacked. ",null,1,cdpd6ww,1rog7o,askhistorians,top_day,2
john_andrew_smith101,"The short answer to your question is no. All of these occurrences were isolated incidents that happened for various reasons.

The long answer is, well, complicated. I don't quite like covering Russia with broad generalizations, since their society is so unique, but I think in this case it might work. Russia is a steppe country, whose borders are very long and open, making it vulnerable to the various horse tribes of the steppe. In order to counter this, Russian rulers tend to militarily expand in order to eliminate possible threats from the steppe. They also tend to consolidate and centralize power, using terror and violence when necessary. This is not so different from other European monarchs at the time, although it can be argued that the Russian methods were more thorough. And then sometimes the ruler was just plain mad, as it can be with any monarchy. Ivan the Terrible, for instance, was starting to go crazy at the time he killed his son. He didn't intentionally do it, and afterwards he  held his son in his arms, crying.

It's important to understand the situation many czars were in order to understand their actions. They were often threatened by war, rebellions, and coups. Sometimes this necessitated harsh policies. Peter and Catherine were certainly great rulers, but they ruled Russia with an iron fist. Peter brutally stamped out opposition to his western policies, and Catherine either manipulated or killed anyone who was a threat to her. Ivan the Terrible created the Oprichniki, which was the original secret police. These rulers were keenly aware of the political situation and did this not only to hold onto power, but to save their own skin. 

So now we're at Peter the Great. Peter asks his son to start preparing to become czar, while his son wants nothing to do with that. Peter had another son, but he needed to make sure that after he died that Alexei wouldn't get powerhungry and go after the throne anyway. He demands that Alexei become a monk; if he wants to be czar one day to join the army. Alexei flees from Russia to Vienna. This causes quite a stir among the nobility and Peter suspects his son of treason. He convinces his son to return on the false pretense of safety. After Alexei's return, Peter starts his inquisition, to root out all the ""traitors"" in Alexei's circle. His son is convicted then sentenced to death. He is instead tortured to death in an attempt to get more information.

Stalin's situation is also unique. He was also very concerned about the political atmosphere in Russia. He was also in the middle of a devastating war, and while it did give him some leverage among the general population, he could no longer afford to eliminate political threats in the military. Stalin's son was captured by the Germans. Hitler offered to trade him for Field Marshall Paulus, and Stalin replied ""I will not trade a Marshall for a Lieutenant."" While we can speculate on the various reasons Stalin abandoned his son, it is claimed by his daughter that Stalin believed his son deliberately surrendered, and was therefore a traitor.

The very long answer to your question is that Russian leaders might not have cultural background for killing their heirs, but they do have a history of autocracy and paranoia. Hopefully this answers your question.",null,10,cdphgz4,1roiae,askhistorians,top_day,35

WhenTheRvlutionComes,"Mao ruled for a *really* long time - almost 30 years (1949-1976, besides perhaps an intermediate period after the great leap forward and before the cultural revolution in which he held little real power). The famine associated with the Great Leap Forward (simply ""The Great Chinese Famine) lasted only for years. Shocking as the 30 million death toll may seem, in terms of China's ~600 million population at the time, it was a drop in the bucket. Population levels soon rebounded. As for the Cultural Revolution, it was, proportionally, a much smaller affair. It's very simple, honestly. A quarter of a million mothers happened to spit out a billion or so children. Mao would've had to of killed a lot more people to outrace the birthrate - hundreds of millions, obviously. And, surprising as it may seem, Mao wasn't personally responsible for the majority of deaths on the period. Plenty died for banal reasons like a heart attack, or the Measels.

One thing in particular about Mao's term was that he encouraged mothers to have large broods of children, as he believed that a large population was good for the country. The consequent effects of rampant overpopulation in subsequent generations, of course, prompted the CCP's about face after Mao's death, towards the one child policy.",null,0,cdpi8uz,1ropf0,askhistorians,top_day,3

vonadler,"The conquest of Anatolia was not so much a conquest as it was a migration of several semi-nomadic Turkish tribes of the Great Seljuk Empire after the Eastern Roman defeat at Manzikert 1071. While they became the majority or plurality (ie the largest group but not above 50%) of most of Anatolia, they did not completely displace the local population. There were large groups of Greeks, Armenians, Kurds and Jews living in Anatolia up to the early 1920s, when both Greece and Turkey ethnically cleansed their territories in a ""population exchange"" and those Armenians and Greeks that remained in Turkey were forced to take Turkish names and speak Turkish (the Pontic Greeks were forcefully assimilated this way).

So, first of all, Anatolia was not as Turkish as you may think it was during the days of the Ottoman Empire. Secondly, the Turks moved there 300 years before Osman founded the Ottoman Empire, and thirdly, the Balkans were far more muslim than you might think, before the ethnical cleansing condicted after the Russo-Ottoman war of 1877-78 and the First Balkan War 1912-1913 and finally the Greaco-Turkish War 1919-22.

The term ""Turkish"" during the days of the Ottoman Empire was more used as a slur than anything else. Turcik people on the countryside were referred to as ""Turks"", which meant something like a simpleton or a hillbilly. The elites called themselves ""Ottomans"".

The Balkans did have large groups of ""Turks"" or various Balkan groups that had converted to muslims and were by the time considered more or less ""Turks"" despite their ethnicity being something else.

Overall, ethnicity and religion is very inter-mixed and before the age of nationalism, it could be hard to tell who was what - people identified more along the lines of the rulership (being Ottoman) or religion than they did along the lines of ethnicity.

Here are a few maps that can help explain how intermixed things were.

[Ethnic makeup of the Balkans 1861](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/RizMap19.jpg). As you can see there are large groups of Turks in the Balkans, especially in Romelia (today part of northeastern Bulgaria and southeastern Romania).

[Another map of ethnic makeup of the Balkans, from 1877](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/CarlSaxET1877.jpg). As you can see, muslims and Turks are viewed pretty much as the same, and there are large groups of them.

[An ethnic map of Anatolia from 1910](http://mediaevalmusings.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/800px-asiaminor1910.jpg). As you can see, large groups of Greeks and Armenians and some others.

About 2,5 milion muslims were forced to flee from the Caucasus and Balkans, with another ~1 million killed in the 1877-78  and the 1912-13 war ([source](http://www.ieg-ego.eu/en/threads/europe-on-the-road/forced-ethnic-migration/berna-pekesen-expulsion-and-emigration-of-the-muslims-from-the-balkans)), and there still are large groups of muslims in Bulgaria.

Bottom line? Anatolia was less Turkish than you think until 1923, and the Balkans were more Turkish than you think until 1913. Still, there was a migration of Turkish tribes pre-Ottoman Empire into Anatolia that did not happen into the Balkans.

Edit: Put in Kurds as one of the groups in Anatlia, as per the remark of /u/G_Comstock",null,4,cdpglia,1rox3z,askhistorians,top_day,17
TheWinStore,"Botched intelligence and botched communication within the Kennedy administration contributed a great deal to the failure of the Bay of Pigs. Yet the catastrophe was entirely avoidable. 

Just for some essential background information: during his first few months in office, JFK was immediately confronted with the question of what to do about Cuba. In 1959, Castro had taken control of the country, and Castro wanted to free Cuba from its dependency on the U.S.—the U.S. bought 50% of Cuba’s sugar (at subsidized prices) and owned the major oil refineries, sugar plantations, and utilities. Castro wasn't a communist when he took over, but his brother Raul was and so was Che Guevara. Both pressured Castro to draw closer to the Soviets.

On November 18, 1960, about a week after his election, JFK was briefed on a CIA plan to send an invasion force of 1500 Cuban exiles to invade Cuba. President Eisenhower told JFK that the anti-Castro plan was proceeding well, and that it would be his responsibility to see it through. That advice left a big impression on JFK, who greatly respected Ike’s military background. 

* * *

So what intelligence and bureaucratic failures doomed the Bay of Pigs, and why did they develop?

**Failure #1: the Joint Chiefs.** The Joint Chiefs studied the CIA plan and correctly concluded it would fail without large-scale popular uprisings in Cuba, meaning the people of Cuba would have to rise up against the government. The Joint Chiefs also correctly concluded that there was no evidence the Cuban people would do so. 

Unfortunately, the Joint Chiefs obfuscated their conclusions. For example, they concluded that the CIA plan had a “fair” chance of success. But does fair mean good or bad? It’s very ambiguous language. What the JCs really meant was that there was a 30-70% chance of failure, which are pretty poor odds, relatively speaking. But when JFK’s advisors read the memo, they weren't aware of this probability. Additionally, all the Joint Chiefs' reservations about the plan were buried in the back of the long memo. 

**Failure #2: obsession with secrecy.** A series of meetings were called in the White House to discuss the CIA plan. One of the first issues that arose was the ""disposal problem,"" which was raised by Allen Dulles, who was still head of the CIA as a holdover from Ike’s administration. He said that if the invasion were called off, the Cuban exiles who had been training in Guatemala would come to the US and risk leaking the plan, making JFK look weak and indecisive. 

In March 1961, JFK approved the plan, provided US involvement was kept secret. He wanted the plan to be free of traces of US fingerprints. Whether this was even feasible was another question entirely. But secrecy was desirable at the time because the U.S. was still engaged in sensitive negotiations with the Soviets over Laos. JFK also wanted a more benign relationship with Latin American countries, and a U.S. invasion of Cuba would make the U.S. look bad. 

Unfortunately, JFK's desire for secrecy led to the invasion site being moved from Trinidad, Cuba to the less-exposed Bay of Pigs. This decision would have substantial consequences. As far as intelligence goes, JFK approved the plan with the assumption that even if the invasion failed, the Cuban exiles could flee to the mountains and conduct guerrilla warfare there. There was a minor snag, however—whereas the original invasion site at Trinidad was close to the mountains, the Bay of Pigs was not. It seems that no one took the time to look at a map and point this out to JFK. Oops. 

Excessive secrecy was a problem even within the process of administrative decision-making. At every meeting, for example, the CIA would hand out copies of the latest plan and then confiscate the plans at the end so that none of JFK's advisors could leave the room with them. This prevented the administration from consulting outside experts at the State Department and so forth. 

**Failure #3: erroneous assumptions.** The Bay of Pigs plan was based on numerous erroneous assumptions. For example, it was assumed that the invasion would set off an uprising in the Cuban underground against Castro. But after the air strike, Castro just rounded up all the members of the Cuban underground and chucked them into prison. The anti-Castro forces were weak, disorganized, and lacked clear leadership. No Cuban underground even existed. Another poor assumption was that US involvement could be kept a secret – clearly implausible given the extent of US involvement. And finally, there was the assumption that even a failed invasion would allow a flight to the mountains, which never occurred. 

**Failure #4: newbies.** Typically, bad intelligence can be checked by thorough, careful decision-making. However, JFK’s advisors were reluctant to speak out against the plan. The advisors were in place only 77 days, were new to each other, and were not used to blunt discussion. They were afraid to challenge the CIA on the premises of the plan, especially because the CIA was headed by Allen Dulles, who had overthrown governments in Guatemala and elsewhere. There was no real discussion where advisors were allowed to debate the issues—the administration simply deferred the plan to the CIA and so the outcome was extremely poor.

**Failure #5: bureaucratic politics.** The CIA and the Joint Chiefs were much more concerned about their own parochial interests than national interests. The CIA withheld critical information from the president (such as the known weakness of the anti-Castro underground and the low morale of the Cuban exiles when they learned US would provide direct support). The CIA also had no evidence of strong anti-Castro forces on Cuba. 

The CIA was not the only culprit. The Joint Chiefs did not effectively warn JFK that the operation was not militarily feasible. They failed to warn him that Castro’s air force had to be totally destroyed for the invasion to have any chance of success. And the Joint Chiefs did not make their other reservations known to the administration. Why? They thought if the plan started to fail, JFK would have to deploy US troops to salvage the mission, which would conveniently serve the Joint Chiefs' interests. And if the invasion did fail, they assumed the CIA would take the blame, not them.

* * *

All of these reasons contributed to the failure of the Bay of Pigs. Would a U.S.-flagged invasion have succeeded? Perhaps, but JFK would never have approved such a plan. If the intelligence had been properly handled, the correct decision would have been to take no action. 

Fortunately, JFK learned a few lessons from the Bay of Pigs. First, don’t trust the bureaucracy. Second, don’t be awed by experts. And third, encourage frank discussion and debate. JFK would draw on all of these lessons during the Cuban missile crisis—so in a way, failure in 1961 laid the groundwork for success in 1962.

mormengil,"Have a look at the small city of Uzes, in Gard in the South of France.  The center of the city is still laid out much as it was in Medieval times.  

The city has 8,000 people today.  Perhaps 5,000 in the 12th century? (6,150 in 1793)

The city was surrounded by a defensive wall (now gone and replaced by a road).  Inside the city were three great defensive towers (still there), The Tour Bermonde (the keep of the Seigneurs de Uzes - first recorded in 1080 AD, who later became Viscounts, and then Dukes), The Tour du Roi (built by the town guilds as a counter power to the Seigneurs and the Bishop - later taken over by the Kings of France), and the Tour de l'Eveche (The tower of the bishop's palace).

There was a bishop of Uzes since at least 442 AD.  There was a cathedral there in the 12th century, but it has been rebuilt twice since then, and the current one is from the 17th century.  Its ""Tour Fenestrelle"", however, has survived from the 12th century.  There are also several other churches.

In the center of town is the ""Place aux Herbes"" which is where the market was (and still is) held.

Buildings in the city are of stone, with Roman tiled roofs.  Domestic buildings are most typically three or four stories high.  They frequently have a vaulted ground floor, used for workshops or storage or shops, with living quarters on the two or three upper floors.  There were a mixture of apartment buildings, single family homes, and the city mansions of rich merchants or feudal knights from the surrounding countryside.

The main industry in the town, probably since the 12th century, was the manufacture of cloth. But it was also a center of government, church, law courts and commerce for the surrounding area.  The bishops had the right to mint coins in the 12th century, so there was a mint.  

On the outskirts of the town were several large monasteries.   The town was surrounded by the hunting preserve of the Seigneurs, and by farmlands and small villages, each with its own small castle.

The agriculture of the area, then as now, was vines, olives, sheep, fruit, vegetables and grain.

If you search for images of Uzes, you will get a pretty good idea of the nature of the medieval city.  (Though the surviving buildings generally date from the  12th century or later, rather than the 11th.)

The street pattern and building footprints inside the trace of the old walls are all the same as they would have been in Medieval times.",null,0,cdq13i4,1rp0tz,askhistorians,top_day,2
Bezant,"&gt;Just outside Athens, Pisistratus cut himself and his mules about the body, then drove into town claiming that he'd been attacked by his political enemies. The people gave him bodyguards, who followed him around armed with clubs. Pisistratus then took the Acropolis by force with the help of his new bodyguards.

This one, I don't think is particularly hard to believe.  The main point is that he overrode the traditional Athenian objections to an armed bodyguard.  Once he had, say, a handful of men the precedent was set and, as a powerful political figure, he was able to expand his guard further over time.

&gt;Pisistratus was later driven out of Athens. His plan to get back into power is described by Herodotus as “the silliest trick which history has to record.” He found a tall woman called Phye (Φύη), and dressed her up as Athena. He taught her some goddess-like moves, then rode into Athens on a chariot with her standing next to him. The Athenians fell for this ludicrous ruse, and he returned to power. Herodotus himself is incredulous about this story.

My Greek history professor suggested that, rather than being taken in by the ruse, it was never intended seriously and the Athenians just went along because they appreciated a good show.  The entire 'show' was secondary to the political context that allowed him to return and be welcomed by the citizens.  I find that a more reasonable assessment than the Athenians being complete idiots.  (for fun, if you calculate Phye's height she was about 5'7)


&gt;After being chucked out of Athens for a second time, Pisistratus gathered an army and made for the city. On the way, a soothsayer wandered by, and told him some nonsense about fish being caught in nets. Pisistratus ordered his army to advance; at that exact time, the Athenians were “having lunch” or playing some dice, or having an after-lunch snooze. So Pisistratus's army walked into Athens unopposed. 

This strikes me as the fairly common practice of random oracles and divine acts being thrown in.  The thing that makes Herodotus different from the people that wrote about 'history' before him is he incorporated human agency rather than divine.  A common feature of his work is explaining the human side and  the supposed divine side of any historical event, but what really makes it history is they basically function without the divine bits.

What we know is that during his exile he built contacts throughout the Greek world, raised a pretty big army, which he marched back to Athens with and won the battle of Pallene.

Also keep in mind, he was not just some nutter gaining power through crazy tricks.  He was an important political leader with a large base of support among the Athenians, as well as a skilled and competent ruler.  So it wasn't very absurd that he rose to power.  

As to whether people believed the more fanciful parts of the story; probably not at first, but as the time passes and the events grow more distant the authority of remaining sources gets stronger, so until more serious criticism of historiography emerged Herodotus' version was likely widely believed.",null,16,cdphf7u,1rp2ge,askhistorians,top_day,113

khosikulu,"Only in a few places did various Europeans have the power to generate conflict directly and/or raid for slaves (even then they had African auxiliaries, like Portugal in the area of northern Angola today).  So some involvement by Africans of various standings and origins had to exist, and did; the mixed-heritage Eurafrican trading class that grew from the 1500s onward was also a crucial part of factoring slaves into the Atlantic trade.  But one must always remember that only certain African societies took part, and only certain leaderships, under varying conditions (usually connected to other, existing political objectives).  African rulers didn't have to ""give consent,"" because the majority of people taken into slavery--and certainly the majority of fighting-age men--were captured in war or surrendered as tribute.  Under the older system, however, those people remained in the region; the export trades removed them entirely.  Except for civil war (important in Kongo) and occasionally the sale of condemned criminals, African rulers were not putting ""their"" people into the trade, but normally their enemies or other strangers.  The acquisition cost was effectively pretty low, so this was pure profit for the individual captor.

The ""getting guns"" thing was not quite as important as you suggest, in part because a number of societies had other things Europeans wanted too, and sometimes they wanted other things from Europeans.  Asante, for example, not only actually *imported* slaves on the coast, but also had gold and could buy firearms. It wasn't alone.  Arms traffic in West Africa wasn't restricted to those who engaged in slave trafficking.  (It wasn't just leaders, either; a lot of traders were pretty independent and simply gathered slaves from the major markets.  Slave-oriented states like Dahomey were late developments on the whole.)

The Atlantic trade was something of a magnitude unknown in the intra-African trade (or generally in the African experience of slavery).  Chattel slavery required a lot of people to pretend they weren't doing anything wrong; the massive expansion of the slave trade required the same.  In effect answering the question of who's at moral fault is impossible because everyone involved in the trade, from the point of capture to the final destination, was in some way responsible for the trade.  The morality of the slave trade is another matter, because of the prospect of presentism, but we can certainly recognize analytically that the machinery of the export slave trades worked helically, growing and deepening as it went, one step at a time, involving people of all sorts with a lot of different motivations across three continents and a whole ocean.  A search for particular ""blame"" is not really relevant here, and it's honestly not good history to frame a complex, 300+ year long commercial trajectory that way.

Have a look at John Thornton's *Cultural History of the Atlantic World 1250-1820* or his earlier *Africa and Africans in the Making of the Atlantic World*.  He gets at some of this in there.  One important warning, though--the agendas in play when people talk about ""the blame game"" (or the related ""numbers game"") are a mile wide, on many sides.",null,4,cdphq5f,1rp6v4,askhistorians,top_day,26
mormengil,"""Moral culpability"", is a very tricky subject for historians to get into.

We really should not anachronistically reflect our own moral values, or today's moral values back into the past, and use them to judge historical people.

If we think that it is immoral to conquer other people, does that mean we should go back in history and declare that Alexander and Caesar and Muhammad and Genghis Khan were evil and ""morally culpable""?

Instead, if one of the goals of history, is to deeply understand the past and the people in it, we should try to understand how the people themselves, or their contemporaries, thought about the morality, and how they might have judged themselves or been judged AT THE TIME.

At the time of the early Atlantic slave trade in the 1500s, slavery had been a long standing institution in Africa, and the slave trade (in the Indian ocean) had been going on for a long time.  I don't think we know of any sources indicating a moral objection to the slave trade within African societies.

There was also little or no moral objection to slavery from Europeans in 1500. It wasn't until late in the 1700's that the abolitionist movement, and men like John Wesley and William Wilberforce in England, and colonists in Northern Colonies like Vermont and Massachusetts began to be a strong voice against the morality of slavery.

African rulers were certainly heavily engaged in the slave trade, but whether they or their contemporaries considered them ""morally culpable"" for this engagement seems dubious.

By the late 1700s, there were enough people in Europe (mostly England) and the Americas who thought that slavery was immoral, and were vocal enough about it, that most Europeans were aware that the subject had been opened for debate.  Whether (or when) any of this debate occurred in Africa, I don't think we know.",null,1,cdpjwy3,1rp6v4,askhistorians,top_day,5
GHboy,"The moral culpability of African rulers is a loaded and subjective question whose answer depends on perspective.
It's a complex interplay of the two. European powers specifically set up forts on coastal areas to purchase slaves. However, they could not have purchased slaves without a seller.
In addition to buying slaves from 'free-lance' slave catchers, Europeans also bought slaves who were POWs and refugees from kingdoms such as the [Ashanti Kingdom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashanti_Empire).

Considering the extreme profitability of the slave trade in the Americas, it was in European interest to have Africans fighting as it supplied a steady stream of slaves. It was in the Africans interest to sell slaves as to acquire guns so as to not be enslaved by their enemies.

If an African kingdom had refused to cooperate and sell slaves, the European powers would have simply armed the competing tribe/kingdom. So the Africans had to play ball whether they wanted to or not, and some states, like the expansionary Ashanti empire, definitely wanted to play ball.

Secondly, tribes never actually sold their own people. They sold other tribes from further inland. So I'm not sure if 'consent' is even applicable. It's fairly easy to consent to you enslaving my enemy.",null,5,cdphw56,1rp6v4,askhistorians,top_day,4
khosikulu,"Only in a few places did various Europeans have the power to generate conflict directly and/or raid for slaves (even then they had African auxiliaries, like Portugal in the area of northern Angola today).  So some involvement by Africans of various standings and origins had to exist, and did; the mixed-heritage Eurafrican trading class that grew from the 1500s onward was also a crucial part of factoring slaves into the Atlantic trade.  But one must always remember that only certain African societies took part, and only certain leaderships, under varying conditions (usually connected to other, existing political objectives).  African rulers didn't have to ""give consent,"" because the majority of people taken into slavery--and certainly the majority of fighting-age men--were captured in war or surrendered as tribute.  Under the older system, however, those people remained in the region; the export trades removed them entirely.  Except for civil war (important in Kongo) and occasionally the sale of condemned criminals, African rulers were not putting ""their"" people into the trade, but normally their enemies or other strangers.  The acquisition cost was effectively pretty low, so this was pure profit for the individual captor.

The ""getting guns"" thing was not quite as important as you suggest, in part because a number of societies had other things Europeans wanted too, and sometimes they wanted other things from Europeans.  Asante, for example, not only actually *imported* slaves on the coast, but also had gold and could buy firearms. It wasn't alone.  Arms traffic in West Africa wasn't restricted to those who engaged in slave trafficking.  (It wasn't just leaders, either; a lot of traders were pretty independent and simply gathered slaves from the major markets.  Slave-oriented states like Dahomey were late developments on the whole.)

The Atlantic trade was something of a magnitude unknown in the intra-African trade (or generally in the African experience of slavery).  Chattel slavery required a lot of people to pretend they weren't doing anything wrong; the massive expansion of the slave trade required the same.  In effect answering the question of who's at moral fault is impossible because everyone involved in the trade, from the point of capture to the final destination, was in some way responsible for the trade.  The morality of the slave trade is another matter, because of the prospect of presentism, but we can certainly recognize analytically that the machinery of the export slave trades worked helically, growing and deepening as it went, one step at a time, involving people of all sorts with a lot of different motivations across three continents and a whole ocean.  A search for particular ""blame"" is not really relevant here, and it's honestly not good history to frame a complex, 300+ year long commercial trajectory that way.

Have a look at John Thornton's *Cultural History of the Atlantic World 1250-1820* or his earlier *Africa and Africans in the Making of the Atlantic World*.  He gets at some of this in there.  One important warning, though--the agendas in play when people talk about ""the blame game"" (or the related ""numbers game"") are a mile wide, on many sides.",null,4,cdphq5f,1rp6v4,askhistorians,top_day,26
mormengil,"""Moral culpability"", is a very tricky subject for historians to get into.

We really should not anachronistically reflect our own moral values, or today's moral values back into the past, and use them to judge historical people.

If we think that it is immoral to conquer other people, does that mean we should go back in history and declare that Alexander and Caesar and Muhammad and Genghis Khan were evil and ""morally culpable""?

Instead, if one of the goals of history, is to deeply understand the past and the people in it, we should try to understand how the people themselves, or their contemporaries, thought about the morality, and how they might have judged themselves or been judged AT THE TIME.

At the time of the early Atlantic slave trade in the 1500s, slavery had been a long standing institution in Africa, and the slave trade (in the Indian ocean) had been going on for a long time.  I don't think we know of any sources indicating a moral objection to the slave trade within African societies.

There was also little or no moral objection to slavery from Europeans in 1500. It wasn't until late in the 1700's that the abolitionist movement, and men like John Wesley and William Wilberforce in England, and colonists in Northern Colonies like Vermont and Massachusetts began to be a strong voice against the morality of slavery.

African rulers were certainly heavily engaged in the slave trade, but whether they or their contemporaries considered them ""morally culpable"" for this engagement seems dubious.

By the late 1700s, there were enough people in Europe (mostly England) and the Americas who thought that slavery was immoral, and were vocal enough about it, that most Europeans were aware that the subject had been opened for debate.  Whether (or when) any of this debate occurred in Africa, I don't think we know.",null,1,cdpjwy3,1rp6v4,askhistorians,top_day,5

As you can see, the 19th century saw Russia expand in two ways. Firstly, into the Caucuses under Alexander I, then into Central Asia and the Amur area - the area around Vladivostok. I had gotten my ports confused (much better with 20th-century Russia) regarding Murmansk/Archangelsk and Vladivostok/Okhotsk. 

Now, how serious was this expansion? Firstly, it was serious enough that the British developed defence plans for India in the late 19th century as the Russians knocked on the door of Afghanistan. While the Russians did not in fact plan for an advance against India, the British were thoroughly concerned regardless. 

But more importantly, it was a heavily invested-in expansion. Russia used the language of colonization similar to what Western European states used for Africa, but used it *internally*. Here is where it becomes interesting. Russian internal colonization used language which spoke of the American spread; the romantic ideas suggested something similar to the spread of people throughout the territory of the Louisiana Purchase and the west of what is now the US.

I had gotten my ports confused (much better with 20th-century Russia) regarding Murmansk/Archangelsk and Vladivostok/Okhotsk. 

Now, how serious was this expansion? Firstly, it was serious enough that the British developed defence plans for India in the late 19th century as the Russians knocked on the door of Afghanistan. While the Russians did not in fact plan for an advance against India, the British were thoroughly concerned regardless. 

But more importantly, it was a heavily invested-in expansion. Russia used the language of colonization similar to what Western European states used for Africa, but used it *internally*. Here is where it becomes interesting. Russian internal colonization used language which spoke of the American spread; the romantic ideas suggested something similar to the spread of people throughout the territory of the Louisiana Purchase and the west of what is now the US. 

For the British concerns regarding India:

For the discussion about the spread *within* Russia, see Alberto Masoero, 'Territorial colonization in late imperial Russia: stages in the development of a concept', *Kritika*, vol. 14 no. 1, Winter 2003, pp. 59-91.

L__McL,"I was reading on this the other day. The Russian Empire was based on a single continuous stretch of land stretching from Poland to Canada. At their peak they had the third largest empire of all time, only smaller than Britain and the Mongols. Because of this they didn't really see the benefits of colonialism as opposed to the likes of Britain and France, who were powerful but relatively small nations.

A single instance was in 1889 when Russian adventurer Nikolai Achinov attempted to establish a Russian colony in what is now Djibouti. The French, who already were a major colonial power, quickly stopped this happening.

To put it bluntly, unlike Britain and France, Russia had a large base nation and preferred to expand from than colonise, which simply wasn't an option for Western European nations.",null,0,cdpny69,1rpfwp,askhistorians,top_day,11

BeondTheGrave,"The answer is really simple, so dont be upset if this is a brief answer. But,  Shiloh is so important for Grant because he almost lost. See, the battle happens over two days, and on the first day the Union forces were thoroughly beaten by the Confederates. Grant *should* have accepted his loss and pulled his troops back, its what every other general did during the war (need I bring up panicky McClellan?). But instead he consolidated his forces and fought again on the second day, where he turned the tables and inflicted a defeat on the Confederate forces (a defeat which allowed the Union to keep all the gains it had made across the Mississippi river, I should add). This showed Grant to be a tenacious and capable commander. It didnt prove that he was a ""great"" general (that would come in 1863), but it proved he was willing to continue fighting when by all measures he was actually beaten. 

Also, its interesting to look at the battle of Shiloh in the context of the Overland Campaign. During Overland, Grant suffered major defeats at every engagement (if we use the same ruler we use for every *other* Civil War battle, which doesnt quite fit the OC Ill admit). But US Grant kept turning Lee's flank and continuing south. Whereas every general before him *had* retreated after losing to Lee, Grant just kept going. 

Thats another reason why Shiloh is so critical to US Grant.

Beyond that, the geographic region in which you arrive, in which in time you arrive, further has a huge effect on your cultural integration. Urban slaves generally had more autonomy, and were required to socialize faster because they were usually in extremely small numbers in close quarters with settlers. 

Rural farmers could still have 1 - 10 slaves, from many diverse regions, forcing them to learn a common language (usually English). Large planters, largely in the southern states that had a year-round climate for agriculture, could have anywhere from 10 - 200 slaves (even in the Early Colonial years) and they would be less likely to develop any kind of propensity for English in the first generation. 

In other areas of the Caribbean, the native language of the slave-holding class was much less adopted because in places like Brazil, Haiti, etc. slaves were imported in such mass numbers, and less care was given to their survival. Generally speaking these areas has a much larger population of native Africans at any times. This differs from British Colonial North America in that the class of ""African Americans"" rose much sooner out of the imported population.

Sure enough the world has changed and there are a lot of new resources out there but the main principle of learning by doing hasn't changed. I've moved countries a few times and I've never learned a language through class. I've learned it by listening, pointing, asking and picking up words as you go.

It is important to note that for some people it takes longer and for some it takes less time. Some are just simply much more talented in picking up and understanding new languages. Exactly like some people are more skilled in maths than others, some are more skilled in athletics and so on.

If you try and are completely surrounded by a new foreign language I'd say it takes on average 1 year to learn an acceptable level to be able to speak and converse. If the language is close to another language you already know then it might take less than six months. But if we analyse it from the perspective of being completely different it takes at least a year. Once you get the basics you'll learn faster.

Only thing we need to think of when it comes to slaves is their ability or freedom to communicate with others that spoke english. If they were heavily tied to one owner and their farm then it might have taken 3-4 years instead of one. It all ties in with exposure to the language. So I'd expect heavy correlation with exposure to the language and it will have been case specific.

In all my research, I've never come across this notorious turkey vs. eagle vote. What actually seems to have happened is that, in June 1782, Congress asked  Charles Thomson, the Secretary of the Continental Congress for eight years, to design the Great Seal of the United States. He took advice from the committees within Congress and first described the seal as such:

* On a field       Chevrons composed of seven pieces on one side &amp; six on the other, joined together at the top in such wise that each of the six bears against or is supported by &amp; supports two of the opposite side the pieces of the chevrons on each side alternate red &amp; white. The shield born on the breast of an American Eagle on the wing &amp; rising proper. In the dexter talon of the Eagle an Olive branch &amp; in the sinister a bundle of Arrows. Over the head of the Eagle a Constellation of Stars surrounded with bright rays and at a little distance clouds. Motto In the bill of the Eagle a scroll with these words E pluribus unum. 
* (Source: You can find this many places, but one of them is [The History of the Seal of the United States from 1909](http://books.google.com/books?id=jUZmAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=On+a+field+Chevrons+composed+of+seven+pieces+on+one+side+%26+six+on+the+other,&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=C87yE2byri&amp;sig=A97cKqiIxYwQfXE3bD80h2T2PwI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4NKYUrjCBceEoQTop4HADw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=On%20a%20field%20Chevrons%20composed%20of%20seven%20pieces%20on%20one%20side%20%26%20six%20on%20the%20other%2C&amp;f=false).)

The important parts for this question are the repeated use of ""eagle."" By 1782, Americans had already established the importance of the eagle to the colonies. The Magazine of American History suggests that as early as 1779 that John Adams had chosen the eagle to be America's emblem. 

* In the autumn of 1779, John Adams was sent to England to negotiate for peace. Among the eminent people whom he met was Sir John Prestwick, a baronet of the north of England, a friend of the Americans... In a discussion of the subject of the national coat of arms so long awaiting decision, Sir John suggested an escutcheon bearing thirteen perpendicular stripes, repeating the idea of the national banner. He proposed, according to the narrative cited, that in order to give it consequence it should be placed on the breast of the displayed American eagle without supporters, as emblematic of self-reliance. 
* (Source: [Magazine of American History from 1893](http://books.google.com/books?id=v0xIAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA482&amp;lpg=PA482&amp;dq=Chevrons+composed+of+seven+pieces+on+one+side+%26+six+on+the+other,+joined+together&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FeEelb4e_h&amp;sig=XcJ6grxKhk53VfLJyiGifyqBimA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bMyYUsYs0NygBOyTgfAF&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=1779%20eagle&amp;f=false).)

While there are any number of reasons why the colonies chose the eagle, all in all, it may come down to a positive association with the bird and other already existing emblems. After all, the eagle was commonly used in Europe as a symbol in coat of arms at the time. Also - when the Society of Cincinnati formed in 1783, the eagle became its most popular symbol. According to the Society's museum website:

* Designed by Pierre L'Enfant, the first Eagles were made in Paris in 1784 by Duval and Francastel [and sent to America for the Society.]
* The museum collections include more than thirty-five examples, foremost among them the Diamond Eagle, which French naval officers commissioned for George Washington in 1784 and became the badge of office of the Society's president general. 
* (Source: [The Society of Cincinnati Archives and Museum](http://societyofthecincinnati.org/collections/museum_collections/sotc).)

It's not surprising that as soon as the eagle came into the imagery of the United States of America that it was often repeated and with great respect. The new nation was being forged out of disparate peoples and needed such symbols to reinforce their separation from England as well as unify the colonies into states.

tl;dr - *The showdown choice between turkey and eagle did not happen. Instead, the eagle appears to have emerged as the frontrunner for several great emblems before being chosen in the Great Seal and thus America. In the 1780s, the eagle was on the mind of many Americans... except Benjamin Franklin, who called it a scavenging lazy coward.*",null,10,cdpnodj,1rplq1,askhistorians,top_day,83

The Eagle was first used as an official national symbol with the adoption of the [Great Seal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States). There was no Eagle v. Turkey vote in this process. It went through several committees which expanded on the original idea and after years developed a symbol which was approved by Congress. Congress was never presented a turkey alternate nor am I aware of, or can I find, anything suggesting one of these committees ever considered a turkey. 

While it's true that Frankling [penned some negative words](http://www.americanheraldry.org/pages/index.php?n=MMM.Turkey) about the eagle this was not in regards to a national bird or the Great Seal.

In all my research, I've never come across this notorious turkey vs. eagle vote. What actually seems to have happened is that, in June 1782, Congress asked  Charles Thomson, the Secretary of the Continental Congress for eight years, to design the Great Seal of the United States. He took advice from the committees within Congress and first described the seal as such:

* On a field       Chevrons composed of seven pieces on one side &amp; six on the other, joined together at the top in such wise that each of the six bears against or is supported by &amp; supports two of the opposite side the pieces of the chevrons on each side alternate red &amp; white. The shield born on the breast of an American Eagle on the wing &amp; rising proper. In the dexter talon of the Eagle an Olive branch &amp; in the sinister a bundle of Arrows. Over the head of the Eagle a Constellation of Stars surrounded with bright rays and at a little distance clouds. Motto In the bill of the Eagle a scroll with these words E pluribus unum. 
* (Source: You can find this many places, but one of them is [The History of the Seal of the United States from 1909](http://books.google.com/books?id=jUZmAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=On+a+field+Chevrons+composed+of+seven+pieces+on+one+side+%26+six+on+the+other,&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=C87yE2byri&amp;sig=A97cKqiIxYwQfXE3bD80h2T2PwI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4NKYUrjCBceEoQTop4HADw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=On%20a%20field%20Chevrons%20composed%20of%20seven%20pieces%20on%20one%20side%20%26%20six%20on%20the%20other%2C&amp;f=false).)

The important parts for this question are the repeated use of ""eagle."" By 1782, Americans had already established the importance of the eagle to the colonies. The Magazine of American History suggests that as early as 1779 that John Adams had chosen the eagle to be America's emblem. 

* In the autumn of 1779, John Adams was sent to England to negotiate for peace. Among the eminent people whom he met was Sir John Prestwick, a baronet of the north of England, a friend of the Americans... In a discussion of the subject of the national coat of arms so long awaiting decision, Sir John suggested an escutcheon bearing thirteen perpendicular stripes, repeating the idea of the national banner. He proposed, according to the narrative cited, that in order to give it consequence it should be placed on the breast of the displayed American eagle without supporters, as emblematic of self-reliance. 
* (Source: [Magazine of American History from 1893](http://books.google.com/books?id=v0xIAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA482&amp;lpg=PA482&amp;dq=Chevrons+composed+of+seven+pieces+on+one+side+%26+six+on+the+other,+joined+together&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FeEelb4e_h&amp;sig=XcJ6grxKhk53VfLJyiGifyqBimA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bMyYUsYs0NygBOyTgfAF&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=1779%20eagle&amp;f=false).)

While there are any number of reasons why the colonies chose the eagle, all in all, it may come down to a positive association with the bird and other already existing emblems. After all, the eagle was commonly used in Europe as a symbol in coat of arms at the time. Also - when the Society of Cincinnati formed in 1783, the eagle became its most popular symbol. According to the Society's museum website:

* Designed by Pierre L'Enfant, the first Eagles were made in Paris in 1784 by Duval and Francastel [and sent to America for the Society.]
* The museum collections include more than thirty-five examples, foremost among them the Diamond Eagle, which French naval officers commissioned for George Washington in 1784 and became the badge of office of the Society's president general. 
* (Source: [The Society of Cincinnati Archives and Museum](http://societyofthecincinnati.org/collections/museum_collections/sotc).)

It's not surprising that as soon as the eagle came into the imagery of the United States of America that it was often repeated and with great respect. The new nation was being forged out of disparate peoples and needed such symbols to reinforce their separation from England as well as unify the colonies into states.

tl;dr - *The showdown choice between turkey and eagle did not happen. Instead, the eagle appears to have emerged as the frontrunner for several great emblems before being chosen in the Great Seal and thus America. In the 1780s, the eagle was on the mind of many Americans... except Benjamin Franklin, who called it a scavenging lazy coward.*",null,10,cdpnodj,1rplq1,askhistorians,top_day,83

The Eagle was first used as an official national symbol with the adoption of the [Great Seal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States). There was no Eagle v. Turkey vote in this process. It went through several committees which expanded on the original idea and after years developed a symbol which was approved by Congress. Congress was never presented a turkey alternate nor am I aware of, or can I find, anything suggesting one of these committees ever considered a turkey. 

While it's true that Frankling [penned some negative words](http://www.americanheraldry.org/pages/index.php?n=MMM.Turkey) about the eagle this was not in regards to a national bird or the Great Seal. The quotes come from a 1784 letter to his daughter, not a public campaign against the eagle. ",null,6,cdpn4rb,1rplq1,askhistorians,top_day,25

Danny_Gray,"The names of the months September, October, November and December come from the Roman calendar or the calendar of Romulus.

This calendar consisted of 10 months named:

Martius (31 days)
 
Aprilis (30 days)

Iunius (30 days) 

Quintilis (31 days) 

Sextilis (30 days) 

September (30 days) 

October (31 days) 

November (30 days) 

December (30 days)

You may notice more Latin number prefixes Quint and Sex (5 and 6 respectively.

So what happened to this calendar? Well first of all, it wasn't very good. There were 51 days between December and Martius which weren't assigned to any month. 

This calendar was first reformed by Numa Pompilius in around 713BC, the second of the seven traditional kings of Rome. He tinkered with the calendar somewhat. Because Romans considered odd numbers lucky, he removed a day from each month with 30 leaving 57 winter days unassigned. 

And so he created two new months Ianuarius and 
Februarius which pushed the numbered months back by 2, making their prefixes wrong. The calendar then looked like this

Ianuarius (29) 

Februarius (28)
 
Martius (31)

Quintilis (31)

September (29)  

October (31) 

November (29) 

December (29) 

This year was 355 days long and roughly coincided with the solar year however an extra month had to be added occasionally to correct for the solar year actually being 365.25 days long. This month was called  Mensis Intercalaris  and was placed in the middle of Februarius.

We're getting towards the modern calendar but we still aren't there. Next came along the Julian reform by our favourite roman Julius Caesar. He started the reform in 48BC and it was finished by his successor Augustus.

The Julian reform was a bit complicated at first, changing lengths of years so the calendar year would correlate with a solar year and renaming Quintilis and Sextilis to Iulius and Augustus after Julius and Augustus Caesar. 

This calendar was used until 1582AD when it was changed again in the Gregorian reform so that Easter would stop drifting through the year and that's the calendar widely used in the western world today.

agentdcf,"There were no state regulations regarding labor, as far as I know. However, the trade would probably have been regulated by guild structures in cities or towns of any size. Medieval London had Livery Companies for carpenters, joiners (different from carpenters because they used adhesives and not nails), bricklayers and tylers, and plumbers, among others. These guilds would have controlled things like apprenticeships and mastery, as well as prices and wages. 

I don't know anything specifically about the building trades, but I have studied the baking trade a bit, and I think we can extrapolate from one to the other. For vital elements of the urban economy, guild structures and what regulatory legislation existed served to either remove a trade from market forces entirely, or at the very least highly circumscribe its operation. Prices and wages were so arranged as to ensure a ""just price,"" preventing collusion and manipulation of the market by merchants and tradespeople while providing acceptable wages to workers. With set wages and prices, what frequently happened was that craftspeople competed in quality; whoever could build the best house or bake the best bread would have more custom and do better. I suspect, from my fairly cursory reading of medieval urban history, that being a tradesmen was not a bad gig, as things go. If you could get into a guild, you were going to do alright, as long as you were reasonably competent. If you were a casual laborer, things were going to be rough.

Guild structures also regulated quality and conduct, often with their own private courts, empowered to fine guild members and punish them publicly. For bakers, this meant ensuring the proper weight and purity of products. For builders, I would guess that quality meant ensuring stability of construction and soundness of materials. Bakers all had their own personal stamps which marked the loaves, so that any loaf's baker could be identified if some violation was found; I would guess that similar measures existed for builders, so that if a building collapsed without cause, the builder would bear at least some responsibility.

In the timeframe you're looking at there wasn't anything resembling a unifying practice. Liturgies were local, and though there are some who argue for a unifying ""shape"" of Catholic liturgy being apparent, the wording of the liturgies wasn't uniform, and it wouldn't be for quite some time. It's likely that the Arian liturgy kept a similar ""shape"" but we don't have any extant liturgies to say for sure. 

As far as monasticism goes, the idea of ordered monks didn't really exist yet, and ""cloisters"" were mostly just associations of hermits who lived in community. Nothing like the Benedictines or Augustinians. The Franciscans sort of follow this model... But I'm digressing. 

Arian monasticism was very decentralized and existed primarily in the Arabian peninsula and in Syriac speaking eastern kingdoms where it would survive (marginally) until the rise of Islam. It was a very hermetic kind of asceticism, and didn't lend itself to putting down roots and putting up buildings.

backgrinder,"Each unit in the US Army has an offcial TO&amp;E, or Table of Organization and Equipment established by the Army. This determines everything assigned to the unit, from men to equipment to vehicles, and breaks everything down. A division TO&amp;E will call for a certain number of battalions, each battalion has companies, each company has platoons, etc.. Depending on the tasks assigned to the division the battalions will be set up differently. An armor heavy division will have a different grouping than an Infantry division, which will have a different grouping than a support unit. 

 The TO&amp;E will call for an infantry company to have a specific number of privates, plus a specific number of sergeants and officers (and will specify specific ranks for specific jobs, when someone is promoted they automatically shift to a new job with different responsibilities). 

 The TO&amp;E will also call for a specific mix of weapons. In a WW2 infantry platoon the standard weapon is a semi automatic rifle. Each company will be assigned a set number of light and heavy machine guns, used to set up defensive positions, and crews will be assigned to carry them, tripods, ammo and either serve them with ammo during battle or protect the gunner from enemies sneaking in close enough to take out the  weapon. Large crew served weapons are generally company weapons that can be assigned to a certain platoon by need, lighter (.30 cal) machine guns are platoon weapons. Then there are the in between type weapons, like Thompson submachine guns and BAR's, and specialty weapons like bazookas. 

 Tommy guns and BAR's (Browning Automatic Rifle) are squad type weapons. A company is divided into platoons, run by Lieutenants, and platoons are broken into squads, led by non-coms. During combat the squads were often separated, each performing a different task, particularly in the US Army where the standard infantry doctrine developed by George Marshall before the war called for a unit to be divided, with one group firing directly on a target from cover while the other group attempts to flank it. A simple, easy to learn and effective maneuver, but the forces are divided so platoon weapons are only available to one group at a time. 

 A group separated from the rest of the platoon will need enough punch to hit the enemy, and may need to defend themselves from counterattack. That's where squad weapons like the BAR and Tommy gun come in. A Tommy gun is a close in weapon. It is actually a machine pistol, not an automatic rifle. It shoots a snub nosed .45 bullet that won't stay straight in midair, and it tends to buck a lot and be hard to keep pointed on target. It's great for spraying a lot of bullets in a general direction quickly while making a huge calamitous racket though. It also has a lot of stopping power. Because of this it's great for clearing buildings and fortifications. It's also good for defending against sudden attack. Bullets go everywhere, bad guys all duck, and your squad gets a couple of precious seconds to assess the new situation and deal with it. 

 The BAR is an offensive and defensive weapon. It's a big, heavy bitch to tote around, but it can be handled by one man and fired while standing and moving. It shoots a .30-06 rifle cartridge (like the crew served Browning Machine Gun), so it's more accurate than a Tommy gun, and you can attach a small bipod stand to it and fire it from a prone position. 

 Now, outside of the basics, with crew served weapons being company weapons, and hand held machine guns being owned by the platoon and assigned to individual squads, is the question of who was selected to use each weapon and why. Generally during training the biggest, strongest, toughest most aggressive guys were assigned the squad weapons. The most obvious reason is these weapons and their extra ammo are pretty heavy, and big men make better mules. Also, the more aggressive guys would be more likely to actually use them. A lot of people aren't aware but not everyone pulls the trigger in combat. Some are scared and break, some just freeze, some can't bear to kill and avoid firing at another human being. After a unit had been blooded the officers and noncoms figured out who the shooters were, and reassigned weapons based on need. After a unit had been in combat longer you had vets absorbing in new replacements, and vets would get first choice of weapons as well. Sometimes after a few engagements that big heavy bitch that was such a beast to lug around and made so much noise and attracted so much attention was a lot more attractive. Combat soldiers have a fine appreciation of the value of getting lots of ordinance on target fast, and soon realize that big noisy attention getter usually causes the bad guys to duck and cover once it has their attention instead of shooting back at you, a nice fringe benefit.

US Army Infantry Divisions 1944-45 by John Sayen breaks down the TO&amp;E of line infantry divisions during WW2, and WW2 Infantry Tactics Company and Battalion by Stephen Bull and WW2 Infantry Assault Tactics by Gordon L Rottman cover a lot of the breakdown of how these weapons were used in combat.",null,59,cdpmoak,1rprb4,askhistorians,top_day,395

 The TO&amp;E will also call for a specific mix of weapons. In a WW2 infantry platoon the standard weapon is a semi automatic rifle. Each company will be assigned a set number of light and heavy machine guns, used to set up defensive positions, and crews will be assigned to carry them, tripods, ammo and either serve them with ammo during battle or protect the gunner from enemies sneaking in close enough to take out the  weapon. Large crew served weapons are generally company weapons that can be assigned to a certain platoon by need, lighter (.30 cal) machine guns are platoon weapons. Then there are the in between type weapons, like Thompson submachine guns and BAR's, and specialty weapons like bazookas. 

 Tommy guns and BAR's (Browning Automatic Rifle) are squad type weapons. A company is divided into platoons, run by Lieutenants, and platoons are broken into squads, led by non-coms. During combat the squads were often separated, each performing a different task, particularly in the US Army where the standard infantry doctrine developed by George Marshall before the war called for a unit to be divided, with one group firing directly on a target from cover while the other group attempts to flank it. A simple, easy to learn and effective maneuver, but the forces are divided so platoon weapons are only available to one group at a time. 

 A group separated from the rest of the platoon will need enough punch to hit the enemy, and may need to defend themselves from counterattack. That's where squad weapons like the BAR and Tommy gun come in. A Tommy gun is a close in weapon. It is actually a machine pistol, not an automatic rifle. It shoots a snub nosed .45 bullet that won't stay straight in midair, and it tends to buck a lot and be hard to keep pointed on target. It's great for spraying a lot of bullets in a general direction quickly while making a huge calamitous racket though. It also has a lot of stopping power. Because of this it's great for clearing buildings and fortifications. It's also good for defending against sudden attack. Bullets go everywhere, bad guys all duck, and your squad gets a couple of precious seconds to assess the new situation and deal with it. 

 The BAR is an offensive and defensive weapon. It's a big, heavy bitch to tote around, but it can be handled by one man and fired while standing and moving. It shoots a .30-06 rifle cartridge (like the crew served Browning Machine Gun), so it's more accurate than a Tommy gun, and you can attach a small bipod stand to it and fire it from a prone position. 

 Now, outside of the basics, with crew served weapons being company weapons, and hand held machine guns being owned by the platoon and assigned to individual squads, is the question of who was selected to use each weapon and why. Generally during training the biggest, strongest, toughest most aggressive guys were assigned the squad weapons. The most obvious reason is these weapons and their extra ammo are pretty heavy, and big men make better mules. Also, the more aggressive guys would be more likely to actually use them. A lot of people aren't aware but not everyone pulls the trigger in combat. Some are scared and break, some just freeze, some can't bear to kill and avoid firing at another human being. After a unit had been blooded the officers and noncoms figured out who the shooters were, and reassigned weapons based on need. After a unit had been in combat longer you had vets absorbing in new replacements, and vets would get first choice of weapons as well. Sometimes after a few engagements that big heavy bitch that was such a beast to lug around and made so much noise and attracted so much attention was a lot more attractive. Combat soldiers have a fine appreciation of the value of getting lots of ordinance on target fast, and soon realize that big noisy attention getter usually causes the bad guys to duck and cover once it has their attention instead of shooting back at you, a nice fringe benefit.

There's some evidence that this was deliberately encouraged by the Hitler. In *Inside the Third Reich*, Albert Speer writes:

&gt;He [Hitler] also did not like establishing clear lines of jurisdiction. Sometimes he deliberately assigned bureaus to the same or similar tasks. ""That way,"" he used to say, ""the stronger one does the job.""

Hitler's quasi-Darwinist thinking in this regard doesn't really seem to work out, however, and the practical result of the constant bureaucratic struggle was a lot of wasted time, money, resources, and talent due to inefficiency and the unwillingness of ministries to cooperate with each other.

Georgy_K_Zhukov,"France had a large army at the time, and on paper, it was possibly the best in Europe. They had the numbers and the equipment. The problem was that they didn't see the direction warfare was going. The generals were still stuck in a mentality gained in World War I. *Not*, however, the idea of static warfare, which people seem to think due to the Maginot Line, but rather the tactics of the end phase of the war, during the Hundred Days offensive.

As such, the French invested in lots of infantry tanks. Big, slow, heavy tanks that were to be distributed throughout the infantry to move with them and supply support. While they did have some quality tanks, like the SOMUA 35, they just didn't have enough of them. And even if they had more, without a serious reevaluation of their deployment, the effectiveness would be questionable at best. Most French tanks even lacked radios!

They invested in a LOT of artillery. Because they believed that it was the key to victory. But they didn't foresee the pace that World War II would be fought at. Their guns simply couldn't be wielded effectively as the battlefield changed, and also, since they lacked *mobile* artillery, they couldn't move the guns quickly enough. Many of them were of World War I vintage.

Strategically, the French were also lacking. While it is not true that the French believed the Maginot Line was going to keep them safe, and in fact the purpose of it was to force the Germans to attack to the north of the line, the French did make a grave miscalculation in where they expected the German thrust to come. Expecting a similar path as that taken during World War I, the Anglo-French force was positioned in the north-east of France, waiting for the Germans to enter the Low Countries. When they did, they moved in to Belgium swiftly to counter the Germans. But the main German attack was further south, through the Ardennes, which the French planners had assumed was to rugged for the Germans to move through quickly, and consequently, had not defended very well. This wasn't the case though. The Germans swept through, and in just over a week the Anglo-French force that had been positioned on the border - the cream of the crop - was cut off from the rest of France. The British began evacuating, and France soon had no choice but to capitulate.

And thats it in a nutshell. France had quantity, but not quality. They were well prepared for another war fought in the style of October, 1918. But what works there didn't work all that well in 1940.",null,0,cdpp6q0,1rpulu,askhistorians,top_day,11

idjet,"I think you are perhaps getting hung up on labels and definitions, and we should clarify these so that you can understand.

'*Capitalism*' is very strictly defined as an economic system in terms of how economic value is created and stored, profit is a byproduct of that. Capitalism is generally viewed as having its origins in the late medieval period when we begin to see the creation of broad markets for labour and goods through the transformation of serfdom and bartering economy to monetary economy.

It's true that there has always been something for sale, whether armour, houses and castles. However, if we look closely at what was for sale in the European medieval period, we would see the list of things bought and sold is short and very infrequently transacted. The greater portion of the economy was what we would roughly call *bartering* - this was at the rural and village level. In fact even 'taxes' were paid 'in kind', often as part of the harvest. Remember that medieval society was predominantly agricultural. Yes, someone with money could by anything - but money was relatively rare. For example there were whole regions of Southern France in year 1000 where there were no mints creating coin - ie, money. (note: bartering is used loosely here to allow a short response - some will complain).

As such, from a modern financial perspective, the financial transactions were 'stunted', they have no accumulating value. To explain: as a farmer, or as the noble who en-serfed the farmer, I could not store my wheat for several years waiting for an increase in the value of the commodity and trade it for charcoal or building limestone a year later - I had to trade it within its life or it goes mouldy. I could not speculate in value and make a profit on the difference between my production costs and my sale value when wheat supplies were low. Or, as an blacksmith I would be working directly in the castle of the lord for whom I work, but I am not paid in cash. I am fed, clothed, I have a small home or just a room in the compound. As a blacksmith I might also do some metal work for the local farmers, because they are tending the lands owned by the noble I work for. But I am not paid and neither are they. There were large towns where money might be used, but the overwhelmingly rural medieval population did not engage economically with cities in substantive cash.

So how did this economy change to capitalism?

The general idea held in economics is that the transition from feudal economics to capitalism was through the transformation of [manorial serfdom to free holding tenant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_capitalism#Prehistory_of_capitalism). This is a point of argument for some, and you may see responses to this post which argue differently. But, the point is still important: this was the moment where the medieval serf-farmer no longer paid *in kind* with his crops, but he rented his land from landlord for cash and he could sell his crops at market for cash. The landlord could evict him from the land for a higher paying tenant, and the farmer could sell his crops for more to those who were willing to pay. The farmer could invest in his farm so that it was more productive. The landlord could take the cash and invest it where he likes, perhaps in speculating in other lands, or in other assets. It's labour and assets that begin to have value, not the crops themselves.

And this is where we begin to see the fundamentals of capitalism: in large scale lending, in speculation, in transforming serfdom and bartering into labour-for-wage relationships. These things did not exist at large scale until after the medieval period. 

None of this happened fast - there were many places in Europe that remained unaffected by early capitalism for several hundred years. And there were transformations in forms of capitalism such as [mercantilism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_capitalism) before we get to modern capitalism as we know it.

The essence is that economic relationships transformed into an exchange of capital, and capital is abstractly related to 'actual value'. And this completely overtook all other economic relationships from 1400 - 1800.

Canadian_Ambassador,"I just wrote an undergrad paper about the history of interest/usury and can maybe help shed some light on this. 

In Ancient Greece, Aristotle was against any form of interest. Interest is the cost of borrowing money. His reasoning was that because money had no value in itself and was a medium of exchange between two commodities, it should not be hoarded. Money by itself was not considered wealth. It was the physical goods bought that dictated how wealthy a person was. This viewpoint has been debated though as being idealistic, and not how life actually operated in ancient Greece. 

Aquinas follows in similar tradition with Aristotle, except adds the Christian charity idea to the mix. Due to the nature of money, hoarding it is bad and unnatural. You cannot have a capitalist society without leftover money to fund and invest. This was backed up by the Catholic Church. Again, this viewpoint was challenged by specific people, but the Catholic Church stood by it's stance. 

Big changes didn't start to occur until the Reformation. Both Luther, after some prodding, and Calvin, after no prodding, both accepted that interest was an acceptable risk that the lender takes over the borrower. 

Prior to the Reformation, interest was an unnatural way to create wealth by the scholastics and the Catholic Church. Now, that is for loan payments. Venture Capitalism was not frowned upon and was one of the ways that people who were looking for investment circumvented the sin of usury. 

The Romans did have some forms, but usury has always been condemned under the Old testament. I did actually ask a question related to this, but it has also yet to be answered. 

I am not a historian by any means, but I am taking a class on the History of Classical Economics. Basically, the economics of the world until Marx. The reason I don't address Rome and Roman influences is because from what I found the majority of their contributions were in law, not economics, and therefore, out of the scope of my paper. 

To answer the question though, if I was being bold and banking (ha) on the history of venture capital, probably the 13th century is when you could find the beginnings of modern capitalism. That is mostly me talking out of my ass. 

From what I read in regarding interest, I would put the timeframe at, or during, the Reformation. The backlash that the ban on usury caused the Church to lighten it's stance in the 18th century, but the Protestants had been okay with it, officially, for 200 years prior. 

The important thing to remember is that capitalism requires surplus money to invest. If you put restrictions in place stopping the borrowing process, it makes it significantly tougher to engage in capitalist procedure. 

Hope that makes sense. I am a couple beers in because I am finally done essays and slightly celebrating. Sources will be provided upon request. ",null,2,cdpqycx,1rpw94,askhistorians,top_day,4

Reedstilt,"At the time of Old World Contact, there were three major polities in Florida and several smaller ones. 

**Calusa**

The southern half of Florida was under the control of the powerful and expansive Calusa. The core Calusa region was center on Charlotte Harbor in southwest Florida, with their eponymous capital Calos currently identified as the [Mound Key site](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mound_Key_Archeological_State_Park), but their influence spread eastward to encompass the Mayaimi who lived around Lake Okeechobee, the Tequesta of the Keys and modern-day Miami, and the Jaega near modern-day Palm Beach. The Ais, who lived on the east coast from Cape Canaveral southward to the Jaega (who may have been part of the Ais as well) were either subjects or allies of the Calusa - the relationship is a bit unclear. Additionally, Taino refugees from Cuba (and likely from elsewhere in the Caribbean since earlier refugees had fled to Cuba first) had established communities in southern Florida under the protection of the Calusa dominion, before the Spanish arrived on the mainland. Until the Spanish negotiated a peace in 1567, the Calusa were at war with Tocobaga who lived around Tampa Bay.

The Calusa were led by three men. First was the paramount chief, called the 'cacique' by the Spanish after the Taino title for a similar political position. The Calusa word for this rank is probably *certepe*, but that's uncertain as it could refer to village chiefs as well. The paramount chief received tribute from Calusa village chiefs and from the leaders of his non-Calusa subjects. He also had several wives, one each from his non-Calusa subjects for example as well as having a ""sister-wife"" according to Spanish chroniclers, which probably meant he had one wife from his own clan, rather than literally marrying his own sister.

The other two men were the war captain who command the Calusa's military specialists and militia on behalf of the paramount chief and the chief priest who oversaw the temples, organized important rituals, and attended to the religious needs of the paramount chief's family (which he was usually part of). 

The Calusa built canals, earthworks to keep their homes above the water during floods, and large communal houses and temples. The ""king's house"" in Calos was said to be large enough that 2,000 people could comfortably gather there for councils. 

What makes the size and structure of Calusa society especially interesting is that they made no use of domesticated plants or animals, though there ancestors a few centuries earlier probably engaged in some farming. The bulk of their diet was composed of seafood, though some wild plants were gathered and they made a type of bread from [coontie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coontie), a cycad native to the Southeast. Deer were relatively rare in the region and Calusa traded their seafood with people to the north for venison and deer hides. In 1600, the Spanish reported that the Calusa (or their Tequesta subjects)  travelling to Havana to sell fish, ambergris, fruits, turtle shells, [cardinals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_(bird\)), and other items. Such trade likely existed in Pre-Columbian times between south Florida and Caribbean as well.

**Timucua**

Most of northern Florida (minus the panhandle) and a large portion of southern Georgia was the realm of the Timucua. Unlike the Calusa, the Timucua were not unified into a single cohesive nation. Instead they had several powerful village and alliances of villages, which at the time of Contact were vying among themselves for dominance. 

Each village had its own chief, called *holata* or *utina* in various Timucua areas. For simplicity, I'll use *holata* here. The title of *holata* was inherited matrilineally within the White Deer Clan. Clans were ranked, and while the White Deer was at the top among the Timucua, the relative ranking of the other clans (Panther, Bear, Fish, Earth, Buzzard and Quail) differed between the Timucuan districts. 

The *holata* had several prominent subordinates. The *inija* was the most important of these, who severed as the *holata*'s spokespeson and communicated the *holata*'s orders to others and gather information for the *holata*. The *inija* was also chosen from the White Deer Clan. The *holata* was also served by two ranked *anacotimas* and the *afetema*, who seem to have been advisers chosen from the elders of the village. Women became *holata* regularly, and when they did so, their subordinates were also women. The *holata* oversaw both the secular and religious affairs of the Timucua; war, however, fell to the *irriparacusi*, the war chief (also known as the *uriutina* and possibly just *paracusi*). The *irriparacusi* had his own entourage of officials: *ibitano*, *toponole*, *bichara*, *amalachini*, and *itorimitono*, though their duties are unfortunately unknown. The *irriparacusi* likely inherited their rank as the *holata* did, but that's not certain.

Like the Calusa, the Timucua fished and harvested wild plants. But they also hunted and cultivated maize and other domesticated plants--though not to the extent of their Mississippian neighbors to the north and west. Famously, the Timucua wore [deer disguises](http://media-3.web.britannica.com/eb-media/13/70213-004-110FA638.jpg) when hunting. Unlike the Calusa, however, they were quick to adopt Spanish agricultural tools and plants.

The surplus of their hunts were trade south to the Calusa, but the most important trade routes went north and west to the Mississippians. These trade routes brought down copper, greenstone, and argillite from the mountains. The Timucua also controlled an important chert outcropping in northern Florida which was vital for the production of tools and weapons. Chief Utina and his alliance largely controlled this outcropping and the most important trade routes, which made him an enemy of other major Timucuan alliances. In the 1600s, the Timucua would become important middle-men, controlling the trade between St. Augustine and the nations of the interior.

**Apalachee**

The Apalachee were a small but powerful Mississippian chiefdom located between the Ochlockonee and Aucilla Rivers. The Timucuan-speaking Asile who lived east of the Aucilla River were subjects of the Apalachee. The Apalachee had two major towns. Ivitachuco was the dominant town in the east, while Anhayca (modern-day Tallahassee) dominated the west and served as the capital of the whole chiefdom. Historically the two towns were ruled by brothers. Later in the 1600s, political power would shift to Ivitachuco, at which time the Apalachee were at war with the Timucua (again the Spanish negotiate a peace treaty between the two).

*Nico* seems to be their word for paramount chief.  Interestingly *holata* refers to subsidiary chiefs.  The Apalachee *holatas* oversaw major towns which controlled districts and satellite towns within the larger chiefdom. The *nico* and the *holatas* were the spokespeople for their respective dominions and oversaw ceremonies within them. The Apalachee *nico* was also served by an *inija*, though his role here was to oversee the *nico's* guards, farmland, and to serve as a sort of court historian, as well as handling trivial day-to-day business of the chiefdom. The *holatas* seem to have had *inija* of their own, and the *inija* were apparently relatives of the *holatas*. Finally, the *nico* had an *atequi*, a translator whose duties extended over other areas where such language skills were important.

The land of Apalachee was an important stop on the trade routes heading west out of the Timucua regions to the Mississippians, and was famous throughout Florida for its agricultural productivity. That fame was used as bait by other Florida peoples to lure the de Soto's expedition out of their area and encourage them to keep moving onto Anhayca, where de Soto's expedition spent its first winter, living maize, beans, squash, and other plants cultivated or harvested in the region, as well its ample stores of dried venison. They grew three types of maize for different purposes: a small fast-growing maize used to quickly replenish their granaries in spring, a yellow maize used for hominy, and a white maize used for flour. They also made flour from a root known as *ache* which the Spanish said was indistinguishable from flour made from wheat in both versatility and taste. Both *ache* root and the flour made from it were important exports from the area.

sambeau,"The origins of Professional Sumo wrestling started in the early 1600s around the time that the Shogun (Ieyasu) brought peace amongst the warring families of Japan by using a hostage system: the wives and children of the provincial War Lords were required to live in the capital.

The peace brought a need for entertainment and a surplus of Samurai.

gingerkid1234,"&gt;Did Jewish people not charge interest when loaning other Jewish people money? Was interest condemned as usury? Or could Jewish people loan to non Jewish people at interest?

The answer to all those questions is ""kind of"".  Judaism prohibits lending to other Jews at interest.  It's a biblical prohibition.  However, there are several caveats, which I'll explain at the end, since they're a bit complex.

Anyway, it wasn't exactly ""condemned as usury"".  Usury just isn't a term that's part of Jewish legal thought.  There are simply sorts of loans which are prohibited by religious law--whether something is or isn't usury is irrelevant, since for Judaism it's not a meaningful category.

Judaism does permit loaning non-Jews money at interest.  The wording of the biblical prohibition explicitly doesn't include outsiders in the ban.  There are some Rabbinic cautions on doing so, since it's not so far from a prohibited thing, but it's definitely permitted.

&gt;Also, how did this affect relations between Jewish people and Catholics? The Catholic Church condemned the charging of interest, so would they have tried to stop Jewish people from charging interest?

The Catholic church itself didn't try to stop it.  Jews were seen as outside the religious prohibitions on the Catholic church, so as long as Jews followed any local secular laws, the church didn't actually ban it, even if they did attempt to discourage it.  However, this doesn't mean that relations were always good as a consequence.  It wasn't uncommon for wealthy debtors to stir up resentment at Jews, so they'd be run out of town and/or expelled by the government.  This would make the loans practically unenforceable.  It also could cause resentment--Jews were outsiders to society, who could hold a significant amount of financial power over someone.  This contributed to Jewish stereotypes for centuries.

However, it could also help Jews be welcomed in places.  Sometimes the importance of access to capital was acknowledged, and having Jews around was seen as a way to improve the economy.  This is significant reason why King Casimir of Poland admitted a large number of Jews during the Crusades, which is essentially the reason a large Jewish population existed in Eastern Europe.

Anyway, back to

&gt;Did Jewish people not charge interest when loaning other Jewish people money?

There are several exceptions to the general prohibition.  These include:

1. Loans between partnerships are generally except from biblical restrictions on loans, since the wording usually is specific that the rules are for one person lending to one other person.  This is especially important for avoiding problems with loans of all sorts during the Sabbatical year, when all loans are void.
* Loans can use some sort of legal fiction to have the same output as charging interest without actually breaking rules.
* These were generally not strenuously objected to by Judaism because the biblical prohibitions seem to be speaking about short-term loans to the poor, to support themselves.  So lending at interest in one of these permitted ways wouldn't violate the spirit of the law, so long as the letter of it was upheld (things that violate the spirit of laws are often prohibited Rabbinically).  The ability of poor people to have access to money so they don't starve is a concern in several biblical laws.  The one that comes to mind is the requirement to pay hired labor on the same day that they work, so they don't have to wait to get the money required to support themselves.

However, that doesn't mean interest-free lending didn't happen.  An important part of Jewish society historically was the ""Gemach"", short for ""gimilut chasadim"", meaning ""acts of kindness"".  These lend money to people for various purposes, without interest.  They are a legal loan that is enforceable (and generally has co-signers), it's just interest free.

Issues that traditionally would have been state-level issues became legislated under federal law through the commerce clause, and that's what gave a new head of steam to the state's rights movement.

Georgia, disagreeing with this provision and given the Supreme Court's lack of prestige during this time period didn't even show up to the oral argument. Naturally, the Court sided with the plaintiff. 

Outrage ensued amongst the several States and shortly thereafter the 11th amendment was ratified in 1795, which served to reverse the Court's decision in Chisolm v GA. The 11th isn't absolute, but it is definitely a major victory for states. ",null,0,cdq2pd2,1rq7q0,askhistorians,top_day,1

gingerkid1234,"It's important to note that ""apologist"" and ""apologetics"" both mean something like ""defender"" and ""defense"".  The meaning drifted over time.  By the late 16th century the meaning of ""speaking in justification"" had drifted to ""speaking in regret"", and by the 18th century this was the primary meaning.  [Source](http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=apology&amp;allowed_in_frame=0).

This is actually rather common in languages--see [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_drift).  Other examples of words that've similarly changed are awful, egregious, and silly.  Interestingly ""awful"" underwent the same shift in Hebrew.  It's even the same derivation--the word meaning ""awe-inspiring"" eventually came to mean ""bad"".  I don't think it's coincidental, though--it may be a calque from English.",null,1,cdpr9zr,1rq7ya,askhistorians,top_day,1
bemonk,"A few reasons:

* In 1the 19th Century there was an ""Austroslavic"" movement to protect Slavic interests against Austrian (German) interests. Both Slovaks and Czechs (and some Yugoslavs) were in this movement together.
* At the outbreak of WWI It wasn't just Masaryk (Czech) but Slovaks like Rastislav Štefánik that were pushing for independence of a unified Czechoslovakia.
*  Czechs had a huge industrial base, while Slovaks were much more rural and agrarian. I think Slovaks realized they would be better off with the much wealthier Czechs. Also Czechs had been independent 300 years before. For Slovaks it was more like 1000 years. Slovakia just didn't have as strong of a claim for independence than they did together as Czechoslovakia.
* In the Treaty of Saint-Germain (sort of like the Versailles treaty, but for Austria-Hungary instead of Germany) when Hungary was given independence and the real union with Austria terminated. This treaty also had a certain philosophy about it to end majority rule in the former Empire. The way they did this was to break up the borders among ethnic lines. It wasn't perfect, but Polish parts were given back to Poland. German speaking parts of Hungary were added to Austria, Bukovina went to Romania, so on and so on... and Czechoslovakia became independent.
Austrians and Hungarians both had been pretty harsh at times to minorities in their countries. The Allies saw this as a way to reduce the likelihood of further ethnic strife in the region. It was also (I would argue at least) punitive to Hungary.
* The majority of Slovaks themselves wanted this. The Slovak people also were far less supportive of the idea of independence in 1993 than the government was.

TL;DR Slovakia was extremely rural, while Czech had a large industrial base. Slovakia hadn't been independent for a millennium. Hungary reduced to 50% of it's formal size on all sides (not just Slovakia) by the treaty after WWI",null,7,cdpylun,1rqafy,askhistorians,top_day,18

mormengil,"They did.  

They conquered Constantinople.  They conquered into the Balkans and Greece.  They made most of Hungary into a colony.  They had client states and colonies on the North Coasts of the Black Sea.  They had colonies, who owed them allegiance in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and Algeria. They took Baghdad in 1535 from the Persians and colonized Iraq and areas around the Persian Gulf and in Arabia. They colonized into Somalia and the Horn of Africa.

When the Portuguese arrived in the Indian Ocean, they found the Ottomans trying to conquer the Christian Kingdom of Ethiopia, and aided the Ethiopians in restoring their kingdom.

The expansionist and colonizing period for the Ottomans began to reverse, however, after the failure of the second siege of Vienna in 1683.  They began to be pushed back by the Hapsburgs, and then the Russians.  They began to lose control of their North African colonies and withdraw from the Horn of Africa.  

As Europe was embarking on a period of colonization, the Ottoman Empire was shrinking out of the colonies it had previously acquired.

mormengil,"Acadia had been French until 1710 when it was conquered by Britain during Queen Anne's war.  The British were worried about the loyalty of the Acadians in subsequent wars, and finally expelled them from Acadia in 1755, when circa 7,000 Acadians were deported.  After this, there was little remaining French population or heritage in Acadia.

Many of the people who replaced the departed Acadians were from New England, and some of this population formed a sizable minority in favor of Independence from Britain during the American Revolution.  They tried and failed to take Fort Cumberland and move some or all of the Nova Scotia colony into the Revolutionary camp.

By the war of 1812, however, the demographics of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick had changed.  20,000 British Empire loyalists fled the US during and after the Revolution to settle in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.  This made the overwhelming majority of the population Loyalist, with no interest in joining the Americans in the War of 1812.

ghotipop,"I'm not an expert on Acadia, but I'll answer why Quebec did not turn on Britain during the War of Independence/War of 1812.  The first thing that you have to remember is that by the 1780s, many Quebecois did not think of themselves as French, just as many Americans did not think of themselves as British.  The Quebecois were in no real rush to restore French rule over New France.  The other thing was that Britain had ingratiated themselves with most Quebecois after the passing of the Quebec Act in 1774.  the Quebec Act almost doubled the size of Quebec, ensured the free practice of Catholicism, and ensured that Quebec would retain its civil law code (which it still does today!).  During the War of Independence, the Quebecois felt that the British would be more accepting than the Americans of their culture.  During the War of 1812, the reasoning was still more or less the same.",null,0,cdq05ma,1rqeoi,askhistorians,top_day,2
