dadudemon,"/u/Money_Acct, here's what you should do next:

Leave one of your socks in one of her shoes. Make sure it is a dirty sock. When you know she got her shoes back, tell your roommate that you are missing a sock and you are positive it fell into her shoe. Say you need it back because it's something silly like a lucky exam sock.

When she hands you the sock back, in your best voice, say, ""DOBBY IS A FREE ELF!!!""

I remember when that happened to me in 7th grade. This kid started making this obnoxious noise like Spsspsspsspsspsspss. Kinda like a hissing sound. And it annoyed me but wasn't a big deal. But the fact that I told him to stop caught on and soon the entire grade was in on it, cornering me, making this noise, laughing while I wept and curled into a ball as I was slowly ostrasiced and tortured by everyone including my friends. Haha! Classic!

And the teachers? Oh it's just a noise, it's no big deal! Haha!

I'm sure those suicidal thoughts and emotional distress were no big deal! Good times...g-...good times... Hah...heh...^^ha...

dadudemon,"Here's the story rewritten to make it easier to read (Grammarians, feedback is strongly welcomed):




This is not my revenge but Zelda's, my 9 year old daughter. To give a bit of a back story, she's been classmates with a girl, Dana, since kindergarten. They have become the best of friends. Dana has Down Syndrome and doesn't have many other friends at school. Zelda always tries to include her in the fun.

Yesterday at first recess this 13 year old boy, John, thought it would be hilarious to make fun of Dana. He called her ""retarded"" and ""ugly""; he also called her ""baby"" for eating baby food at lunch (she does eat baby food but she has to). This made Dana so upset that her mom had to come get her from school.

After recess my daughter was asked to go out to the portable classroom to grab some papers from the other 4th grade class. When she was changing out of her indoor shoes, instead of putting her boots on, she put on the boots that belonged to John. She then got the papers from the portable classroom like her teacher had asked. Then she walked over to a big pile of dog shit; a pile of dog shit that she had noticed earlier. She stepped in it, repeatedly, until crap was all over John's boots. She went back to class, changed back into her shoes, put John's boots back, and did her schoolwork.

Lunchtime came around and all the kids were getting ready to go outside. John sees and smells what's on his boots and promptly starts to bawl. My daughter said, ""stop being such a baby,"" and went to outside on lunch recess to build snowmen.

She came home and told me this story but she thought she would be in trouble. Instead I made her a cup of hot cocoa and let her watch SpongeBob.",null,2,cdpe9dl,1rnco5,pettyrevenge,top_week,6

COLISSAYING,My grandmothers phone number was one digit different then the supermarkets pharmacy number. for some reason the printed labels they put on the bottles the number always came out to look like my grandmothers. we had gotten our own prescriptions there as well and could see how people could make the mistake. she would get calls constantly asking to renew their prescriptions or ask questions. she was a nice old lady and would inform people that they had the wrong number and even give them the correct one. she would then call the pharmacy asking them to either check the ink or fix the label that the number on the bottle looked like hers not theirs. they should have had an 8 but it looked like a 3. they never did anything about it and we would get calls all day and night. finally i just started telling people their prescription would be ready in an hour. i guess they got a lot of complaints cause months later their label was totally different and the number was clear ,null,0,cdpze51,1rq1xi,pettyrevenge,top_week,7
CalculatingCup,"You get my sympathy because I've gotten this type of call almost every year since having a phone (I'm in my 30's for reference). 

Some keep dialing the same number over and over. 

Some hit redial, like yours. 

The ones that kill me are when you've been nice for the first 6 attempts then when your frustration shows on attempt 7 they get an attitude and say, ""There is no need for you to be rude!""

I'm gonna follow your lead from now on and just pretend to be who they ask for. ",null,0,cdpzd3a,1rq1xi,pettyrevenge,top_week,6
tidymaze,"My grandparents' phone number was one-off from a local taxi company. When the phone would ring in the middle of the night (as it invariably did about once a month), my grandfather would politely ask where they were, and where they were going, tell them a cab was en route, then hang up. His reasoning was that if they couldn't pay attention to the greeting (a sleepy Hello? compared to a snippy, ""Valley Cab!"", that wasn't his problem.",null,1,cdpzo1y,1rq1xi,pettyrevenge,top_week,7
