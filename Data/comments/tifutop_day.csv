PimpinIsAHustle,For all those people being surprised that a kid could do this its very very plausible Every time the daughter has observed meals being cooked in the microwave its basically microwaving school for her Imagine how kids learn  they observe and mirror your every move and at this age with little to no input from any other environments than your ownActually putting the poor hamster in the microwave is probably the smartest thing the little girl could do  very cold needs very hot That being said holy shit what an awful experience for you the poor girl amp especially your hamster Tiny condolences ,1,cdph37q,1rozng,tifu,top_day,8,7

Tendtoagree,Oldish guy here My advice is to move on She obviously didnt care about the relationship between you enough as much as it sucks Trust us broken with her now and unless you think you can accept it and push past it the relationship will go further downhill leading to more unnecessary heartacheOn the plus side you will eventually get over it  Youll learn to live with the pain you feel and it will subside  Day by day you will feel a little better until one day you will wake up and be over herIm not going to say something cliché like theres plenty more fish in the sea You will find someone else though Someone better who will cherish your heart and it will be for lack of a better word awesomeChin upEdit she fucked up Not you,10,cdpw1le,1rq3aa,tifu,top_day,57,47

dudesbeingdudes,Im gonna assume youre no older than  Dont hate her for wanting dick girls do that Guys wanna fuck other girls too and youre a fucking liar if you deny it When youre young you think losing your virginity to someone means youre supposed to be with them forever but trust me you need to experience some things It probably hurts now because you feel like the other guy was better than you and thats why she wants to blow him he isnt Hess just different Were wired to seek variety in our genes so its natural to want to test the waters when youre young So enjoy being single homie And as someone whos been on both sides of this I was her twice and you once just chalk it up to her being a fucking kid Youre both just dumb kids that dont know what you want yet no offense Youll move on and look back and realize you needed this to happen but realistically probably not until youve met someone else and inevitably compare the two You might even overcompensate by going for someone whos the complete opposite of her and tricking yourself into believing shes the one Then you start having your doubts a couple months down the road but its already too late you told her you loved her and you cant go back or youll look like an idiot so fuck that you need to prove to Amanda you found someone better and Amandas a bitch But I digress and thats a story for another day You need to make a few mistakes along the way to fine tune what youre really looking forSo grieve about it if you need to but for gods sake dont be the faggot that uses grief to try to get attention from another girl That shit will only attract the equally emotionally damaged which you definitely dont want Unless you want some depraved crazy amazing sex In that case stick your dick in crazy You need to have your life threatened a few times or maybe just your status quo to realize how much you value it Anyway Ive been all over the place with this because I think Im drunker than I think I am Feel free to ask for clarification because Im sure I fucked up someone in hereOnce again enjoy the single life Im sure you have the biggest swinginest dick in all the land OP The other fish in the sea gon learn today DeucesEDIT Id like to add for future reference that breaks are for pussies If you can feel the disconnect already a break isnt going to fix it Break up like a man and dont become that annoying couple thats always on again off again because your boys will stop giving a shit and wont bother to keep up whether youre with her or not at any given time Or go on the break FUck it I said make mistakes right Your call Ill be right behind you ifyouknowwhatimeanjpg all homo,3,cdq2wep,1rq3aa,tifu,top_day,14,11
smileandmeanit,Im not trying to defend her but sometimes people need to experience other things and other people and a bit of freedom before they can really settle down Given that you both lost your virginity to each other youve obviously never explored those different possibilities It doesnt feel like it now when its raw and fresh but this is quite possibly the best thing that could have happened to you You get a somewhat clean break instead of having it drag on and on until youre both bitter and depressed and thus the opportunity to go out and really find yourself and find who you are and who you make yourself without having a right hand lady Im a huge believer in when one door closes it gives opportunity for another potentially even better door to open and I can confidently say that this mantra has proven itself over and over again to me from both my first relationship to second and second to current and having felt like I could have found that guy I wanted to be with forever in each of them All have improved Ive managed to learn things from each and implement to my nextIt hurts now but youll be okay Have faithEdit,4,cdpvygt,1rq3aa,tifu,top_day,15,11

tnv,This might be a bit late for you to notice OP but just a little advice from someone who has felt a fraction of that pain in case you do see it Get rid Theres no reason for you to stay with her if you do youll only be bitter and resent her More importantly take some time being single After a fairly long relationship you really need time to be by yourself again Sure its lonely at first but you will start seeing the benefit soon When youre in a LTR you dont realise yourself changing as a result of your SOs influence This isnt to say shes manipulating you but instead you change simply by being around her And its so gradual you dont even notice like your hair growing or another better example You become suppressed because you tend to show your SO the side of you that you want them to see You need time to be yourself again You became a stale boyfriend for a reason my man Like someone else said cut all ties I cant stress this enough The less you see her pop up on your newsfeed and the like the better You need to be thinking about you After a relationship like this you need to be selfish for a while This doesnt mean taking pregnant ladies seats on the bus or not feeding your pets You need to do stuff for YOU Focus on bettering yourself and moving towards that idealistic image you have of yourself in your head And if you dont have said image get one By taking little steps towards this be it taking a class getting fit or eating better you can take your mind off the pain This doesnt mean avoiding it it sounds like youve agonised over it enough and fair play she was important to you but youll see that improving yourself can be quite therapeuticGood luck youll be fine Youre not going to look back and laugh at this but you will see it as a turning point Get out of that rutessay,0,cdq6pxf,1rq3aa,tifu,top_day,1,1

alhena,We have evolved past the need for monogamy and sexual possession  My boyfriend and I help each other get women and I have no shortage of males  Still who do I live with who do I cook for who do I cancel on anyone else in favor of  My boyfriend  Yeah he fucks other girls but who does he come home to every night  Not saying this is the solution for you but you certainly wouldnt feel so destroyed if you had this attitude  Yes she desires multiple strange cocks and thats perfectly ok normal healthy and she deserves no shame for it  She should just help you get a couple other girls on your dick to make it up to you and then you can go on to have a healthy open but committed relationship  Or you know continue to suffer or find some other girl  All you can control is your attitude,1,cdq5jio,1rq3aa,tifu,top_day,1,0
