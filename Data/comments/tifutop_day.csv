Actually, putting the poor hamster in the microwave is probably the smartest thing the little girl could do - *very cold* needs *very hot*.

On the plus side, you will eventually get over it.  You'll learn to live with the pain you feel and it will subside.  Day by day you will feel a little better until one day you will wake up and be over her.

I'm not going to say something cliché like ""there's plenty more fish in the sea"". You will find someone else though. Someone better who will cherish your heart and it will be (for lack of a better word) awesome.

When you're young you think losing your virginity to someone means you're supposed to be with them forever, but trust me, you need to experience some things. It probably hurts now because you feel like the other guy was better than you and that's why she wants to blow him- he isn't. He'ss just different. We're wired to seek variety in our genes so it's natural to want to test the waters when you're young. 

So enjoy being single homie! And as someone who's been on both sides of this (I was her twice and you once), just chalk it up to her being a fucking kid. You're both just dumb kids that don't know what you want yet, no offense. You'll move on and look back and realize you needed this to happen, but realistically probably not until you've met someone else and inevitably compare the two. You might even overcompensate by going for someone who's the complete opposite of her and tricking yourself into believing she's the one. Then you start having your doubts a couple months down the road but it's already too late; you told her you loved her and you can't go back or you'll look like an idiot so fuck that you need to prove to Amanda you found someone better and Amanda's a bitch! But I digress, and that's a story for another day. You need to make a few mistakes along the way to fine tune what you're really looking for.

So, grieve about it if you need to, but for god's sake don't be the faggot that uses grief to try to get attention from another girl. That shit will only attract the equally emotionally damaged, which you definitely don't want. Unless you want some depraved, crazy, amazing sex. In that case, stick your dick in crazy. You need to have your life threatened a few times (or maybe just your status quo) to realize how much you value it. Anyway, I've been all over the place with this because I think I'm drunker than I think I am. Feel free to ask for clarification because I'm sure I fucked up someone in here.

Once again, enjoy the single life. I'm sure you have the biggest, swinginest dick in all the land OP. The other fish in the sea gon' learn today. Deuces

EDIT: I'd like to add for future reference that ""breaks"" are for pussies. If you can feel the disconnect already, a break isn't going to fix it. Break up like a man and don't become that annoying couple that's always on again off again because your boys will stop giving a shit and won't bother to keep up whether you're with her or not at any given time.

smileandmeanit,"I'm not trying to defend her, but sometimes people need to experience other things and other people and a bit of freedom before they can really settle down. 
Given that you both lost your virginity to each other, you've obviously never explored those different possibilities. 
It doesn't feel like it now, when it's raw and fresh, but this is quite possibly the best thing that could have happened to you. You get a somewhat clean break, instead of having it drag on and on until you're both bitter and depressed, and thus the opportunity to go out and really find yourself and find who you are and who you make yourself, without having a right hand lady. 

I'm a huge believer in ""when one door closes, it gives opportunity for another potentially even better door to open"", and I can confidently say that this mantra has proven itself over and over again to me, from both my first relationship to second, and second to current (*and having felt like I could have found ""that guy I wanted to be with forever"" in each of them). All have improved, I've managed to learn things from each and implement to my next.

It hurts now, but you'll be okay. Have faith

tnv91,"This might be a bit late for you to notice, OP, but just a little advice from someone who has felt a fraction of that pain in case you do see it:

1. Get rid. There's no reason for you to stay with her; if you do you'll only be bitter and resent her.

2. More importantly, take some time being single. After a fairly long relationship you really need time to be by yourself again. Sure, it's lonely at first but you will start seeing the benefit soon. When you're in a LTR you don't realise yourself changing as a result of your SO's influence. This isn't to say she's manipulating you but instead you change simply by being around her. And it's so gradual you don't even notice (like your hair growing or another, better example). You become suppressed because you tend to show your SO the side of you that you want them to see. You need time to be yourself again. You became a 'stale' boyfriend for a reason, my man.

3. Like someone else said, cut all ties. I can't stress this enough. The less you see her pop up on your newsfeed and the like, the better. You need to be thinking about you.

4. After a relationship like this you need to be selfish for a while. This doesn't mean taking pregnant ladies' seats on the bus or not feeding your pets. You need to do stuff for YOU. Focus on bettering yourself and moving towards that idealistic image you have of yourself in your head. And if you don't have said image, get one. By taking little steps towards this (be it taking a class, getting fit or eating better) you can take your mind off the pain. This doesn't mean avoiding it (it sounds like you've agonised over it enough, and fair play, she was important to you) but you'll see that improving yourself can be quite therapeutic.

Good luck, you'll be fine. You're not going to look back and laugh at this but you will see it as a turning point. Get out of that rut!

SquishMitt3n,"This is literally the best thing to happen to you. You may not feel it now, hell I'm probably pissing you off right now, but it's true and will become evident over time.

This girl, who was supposed to love you and went out and fucked a guy *to *spite* you*. That is your first signal that she is emotionally unstable. Spite is a disgusting thing, and anyone that *plans* to spite another should fuck right off.

You're shitty relationship ended. Man, that sucks! You're always going to have a deeply set fondness towards her - virginities are a big thing - and that's fine. But don't let this cloud your judgement - she wronged you in an unforgivable way.

Now, I'm not saying you should move on and experience the other fish in the sea. That's bullshit, because you're going to need time to heal. Take some ""me"" time. Go get a hobby, spank the monkey, learn a new skill, spank the monkey again. Do whatever *you* want. You now have the opportunity to do whatever the fuck you want, whenever you want. 

Hell, go skydiving. Hard to think of bitches when you're hurtling towards the earth.

Don't think ill of her. Sure, it's a shitty situation and to me she's a shitty person, but I'm not you. I didn't lose my virginity and spend a year and a half with her. Remember the good times, but make sure you learn the lessons from the bad times - it'll make you a better person and a better spouse in future relationships.

On the plus side, you will eventually get over it.  You'll learn to live with the pain you feel and it will subside.  Day by day you will feel a little better until one day you will wake up and be over her.

I'm not going to say something cliché like ""there's plenty more fish in the sea"". You will find someone else though. Someone better who will cherish your heart and it will be (for lack of a better word) awesome.

When you're young you think losing your virginity to someone means you're supposed to be with them forever, but trust me, you need to experience some things. It probably hurts now because you feel like the other guy was better than you and that's why she wants to blow him- he isn't. He'ss just different. We're wired to seek variety in our genes so it's natural to want to test the waters when you're young. 

So enjoy being single homie! And as someone who's been on both sides of this (I was her twice and you once), just chalk it up to her being a fucking kid. You're both just dumb kids that don't know what you want yet, no offense. You'll move on and look back and realize you needed this to happen, but realistically probably not until you've met someone else and inevitably compare the two. You might even overcompensate by going for someone who's the complete opposite of her and tricking yourself into believing she's the one. Then you start having your doubts a couple months down the road but it's already too late; you told her you loved her and you can't go back or you'll look like an idiot so fuck that you need to prove to Amanda you found someone better and Amanda's a bitch! But I digress, and that's a story for another day. You need to make a few mistakes along the way to fine tune what you're really looking for.

So, grieve about it if you need to, but for god's sake don't be the faggot that uses grief to try to get attention from another girl. That shit will only attract the equally emotionally damaged, which you definitely don't want. Unless you want some depraved, crazy, amazing sex. In that case, stick your dick in crazy. You need to have your life threatened a few times (or maybe just your status quo) to realize how much you value it. Anyway, I've been all over the place with this because I think I'm drunker than I think I am. Feel free to ask for clarification because I'm sure I fucked up someone in here.

Once again, enjoy the single life. I'm sure you have the biggest, swinginest dick in all the land OP. The other fish in the sea gon' learn today. Deuces

smileandmeanit,"I'm not trying to defend her, but sometimes people need to experience other things and other people and a bit of freedom before they can really settle down. 
Given that you both lost your virginity to each other, you've obviously never explored those different possibilities. 
It doesn't feel like it now, when it's raw and fresh, but this is quite possibly the best thing that could have happened to you. You get a somewhat clean break, instead of having it drag on and on until you're both bitter and depressed, and thus the opportunity to go out and really find yourself and find who you are and who you make yourself, without having a right hand lady. 

I'm a huge believer in ""when one door closes, it gives opportunity for another potentially even better door to open"", and I can confidently say that this mantra has proven itself over and over again to me, from both my first relationship to second, and second to current (*and having felt like I could have found ""that guy I wanted to be with forever"" in each of them). All have improved, I've managed to learn things from each and implement to my next.

It hurts now, but you'll be okay. Have faith

She did betray your trust, no doubt about that. But not every person will agree to be your NSA ""we're taking a break"" main squeeze if she feels there is something better out there and you are the one who initiated the time off. She is justified in her own mind, and honestly, what she does with her orifics not on your watch after you suggested a break is none of your business.

Since you were the only guy she'd ever been with she was probably feeling the need to sew her wild oats.  This is **not** an excuse.  You need to ask yourself two questions: Can I ever trust her again? and Do I still want to be with her?  Ask yourself now, before you or she decide to try to salvage something of your relationship.  This way you have a better chance of thinking with your head and not your heart, or other body part.  If you plan on having sex with her again, demand she be tested for STDs including HIV first.  Note I said FIRST.

tnv91,"This might be a bit late for you to notice, OP, but just a little advice from someone who has felt a fraction of that pain in case you do see it:

1. Get rid. There's no reason for you to stay with her; if you do you'll only be bitter and resent her.

2. More importantly, take some time being single. After a fairly long relationship you really need time to be by yourself again. Sure, it's lonely at first but you will start seeing the benefit soon. When you're in a LTR you don't realise yourself changing as a result of your SO's influence. This isn't to say she's manipulating you but instead you change simply by being around her. And it's so gradual you don't even notice (like your hair growing or another, better example). You become suppressed because you tend to show your SO the side of you that you want them to see. You need time to be yourself again. You became a 'stale' boyfriend for a reason, my man.

3. Like someone else said, cut all ties. I can't stress this enough. The less you see her pop up on your newsfeed and the like, the better. You need to be thinking about you.

4. After a relationship like this you need to be selfish for a while. This doesn't mean taking pregnant ladies' seats on the bus or not feeding your pets. You need to do stuff for YOU. Focus on bettering yourself and moving towards that idealistic image you have of yourself in your head. And if you don't have said image, get one. By taking little steps towards this (be it taking a class, getting fit or eating better) you can take your mind off the pain. This doesn't mean avoiding it (it sounds like you've agonised over it enough, and fair play, she was important to you) but you'll see that improving yourself can be quite therapeutic.

Good luck, you'll be fine. You're not going to look back and laugh at this but you will see it as a turning point. Get out of that rut!

SquishMitt3n,"This is literally the best thing to happen to you. You may not feel it now, hell I'm probably pissing you off right now, but it's true and will become evident over time.

This girl, who was supposed to love you and went out and fucked a guy *to *spite* you*. That is your first signal that she is emotionally unstable. Spite is a disgusting thing, and anyone that *plans* to spite another should fuck right off.

You're shitty relationship ended. Man, that sucks! You're always going to have a deeply set fondness towards her - virginities are a big thing - and that's fine. But don't let this cloud your judgement - she wronged you in an unforgivable way.

Now, I'm not saying you should move on and experience the other fish in the sea. That's bullshit, because you're going to need time to heal. Take some ""me"" time. Go get a hobby, spank the monkey, learn a new skill, spank the monkey again. Do whatever *you* want. You now have the opportunity to do whatever the fuck you want, whenever you want. 

Hell, go skydiving. Hard to think of bitches when you're hurtling towards the earth.

Don't think ill of her. Sure, it's a shitty situation and to me she's a shitty person, but I'm not you. I didn't lose my virginity and spend a year and a half with her. Remember the good times, but make sure you learn the lessons from the bad times - it'll make you a better person and a better spouse in future relationships.
