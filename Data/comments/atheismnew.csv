Borealismeme,gt We can only deny a god that we know the specific traits ofA specific trait  One impossible trait is sufficient we need not complicate matters with additional traits once we find one or two mutually exclusive that cannot be  That said we are not prevented from making a probability assessment based on any trait impossible or otherwise  Worth noting that denying isnt part of the definition that most of us use to describe our atheismgt So ask this question to define the characteristics of the entity we are discussing before admitting there is a small chance that a god exists While this is certainly practical advice its not really required  It just means that if what were talking about is vaguely defined we likely wont be able to come to any meaningful conclusion about it  Could some freaky thing exist  Well sure but freaky is vague  Do you mean one of the known existing freaky things like Ru Paul or Michael Flatleys feet or some vague as yet unmentioned freaky thing  Who knows who cares and why are we talking to people that offer vague definitions,0,c6qtfgp,11z4go,atheism,new,1.0,1

SynysterAcclaim,The one word that is very apparent across all of the reviews is context Even when confronted with the shameful and horrendous side of their stories they still stand by it by screaming that wasnt in context It is pathetic however a majority of religious folks were brought up from a young age so young that they cannot remember their first religious lesson This is the problem They believe it is true because to them it always has been Attempting to persuade them otherwise is impossible See Nazi Germany North Korea etc edit spelling correction,27,cdkgbrm,1r7oks,atheism,new,98.0,71

thenewyorkgod,I went to Jewish school for  years We learned all this in Hebrew and only the good parts were translated into English My rabbis told me certain words we dont know the true meaning so we dont want to offend god by trying to decipher them That was the explanation for the huge chunks of text that were never explained We were told that every letter every word was holy and directly from god Ironically we were also told that if we had any impure thoughts while reading any part of the bible we would go to hell Well how can I not have an impure thought while reading sections about rape incest anal penetration etcGod they really fucked me up I am an atheist now but the damage is done,5,cdkhrtq,1r7oks,atheism,new,15.0,10
Polaris,This is why kids are brain washed at a young age  I didnt start to go to Church until I was   Had no read contact with it other than parents saying God exists and that is it  Once I started going I immediately saw all sides of the bible and not the hero stories kids are taught over and over  God is good god is great god is lovingbut once you hit your later teen years  you start to see the rest  But since you have believed god is so amazing their entire life this  must be good too  It must be the way things are  And no its not like its dumped on you all at once you get it one at a time slowly  The church I used to go to my wife still goesshes been going since she was born says women cant cut their hair  Its shameful to do so and dishonors your husband and God  My daughter who is  cut a bit of her hair off as all kids do and suddenly out comes the lecture about how God was sad and all the rest of the guilt trip and my daughter was horrified  I spoke to her later and and calmed her down  She thought she was going to go to hell for it  ,1,cdki33b,1r7oks,atheism,new,12.0,11

akius,There are so many comments but I feel compelled as a minister for some  years to say that the parents who seemed to be surprised and negative about the illustrated book need to read the Old Testament  If so they will read about Adam and Eve lying to God Cain murdering his brother two brothers who murdered everyone in an entire town because one person kidnapped their sister twelve brothers who almost murdered their younger brother then sold him into slaverylater the twelve tribes of Israel were named after these guyson and on it goesoh did I mention Achan a citizen soldier who brought back some valuables from a battle  God through members of the clan found it killed Achan his wife his kids his relatives and his livestock  So if this little rendition of the Old Testament depicts some violence and immoral behavior ITS BECAUSE THATS WHAT THE OLD TESTAMENT CONTAINS  EDIT garbage in garbage out ,0,cdki1df,1r7oks,atheism,new,10.0,10

NukeThePope,The Abrahamic religions are exceptional in their propensity for violence and intolerance Im guessing Id prefer to live in a society dominated by some Eastern religion to being surrounded by Christians Muslims or JewsBut Hinduism and its ilk all share the highly objectionable main ingredient of all religions Youre expected to respect traditional bullshit as if it were based on realityIf you base important decisions in your life on unsubstantiated bullshit you run a significant risk of acting immorally and causing harm to yourself and others On the other hand if you dont take your religion seriously why bother with it at allI want to see those Indian religions on the trash heap of human history along with all the others,1,cdkfa9f,1r7oqb,atheism,new,4.0,3
geophagus,My view on all religions is the same at its base  Demonstrate the truth of your clams or at least show some evidence for it  If they cannot do so then they should stop believing  Sure some are more harmful than others but I think the world would be at least marginally better without religion or religious thinking,0,cdkffa6,1r7oqb,atheism,new,2.0,2
HermesTheMessenger,The Hindu idea of inclusiveness is interesting but limited I have a neighbor who is a Hindu and we went on a trip to a local Ashram that was fascinating  He talked about the lotus flower and the focus on the many facets of god how all religions pointed towards the same source  So how is that limited  Well of most importance to the folks here it does not include the option for no gods  The focus is on the path to god  There isnt even a philosophical angle  like many deists and pantheists hold  that allows the concept of a god to be used while the individual does not claim anything beyond the concept  This is not to say that someone cant be a Hindu and an atheist its just not that inclusive without ignoring the core idea that revolves around the godSince there arent any reasons to think any gods exist and the gods described by various religious sects and even individuals differ and contradict each other it looks like Hinduism is not any closer than the other groups,0,cdkide0,1r7oqb,atheism,new,2.0,2

imkish,It gets mentioned regularly but The Christian Science Monitor despite the name regularly does quite good reporting After reading the article Im not sure I agree with your assessment of the tone and feel that maybe the name of the publication is causing some bias Absolutely nothing in the article suggests that anyone else has an answer to these questions that the scientists are overlooking and indeed I dont know of any Christian doctrine that would even be remotely related to this though Im sure some creationist is already figuring out a way to claim some random Bible quote answers the questionI apologize if I seemed rude I just used to regularly hit the same bias whenever CSM popped up in my news feed Generally speaking though they are good journalists who rarely if ever let their faith whatever it might be interfere with their stories Maybe Im biased in the other direction by assuming too much decency in people I dunno,1,cdkfu7e,1r7ssu,atheism,new,3.0,2
BuccaneerRex,I grew up in a secular household but in the US you cant really avoid Christianity I think one of the reasons Ive remained unconvinced by any religion is due to a set of Childrens Encyclopedias my uncle bought from a doortodoor salesman when I was around  or soI dont remember the publisher or anything about the actual encyclopedia set What I remember is that along with the reference volumes were some additional books A book of GrecoRoman mythology with beautiful classic artwork and a book of Bible Stories that were illustrated the same way Because they were published by the same company they were written in much the same way Instead of being traditional chapterverse the Bible stories went through the whole book and basically wrote out the stories in prose form without pulling punches or glossing over the details So I had an early comparative religion course right there I read both sets of mythologies and didnt find much difference between them I grasped very quickly that the idea of a deity is just a way to explain the unknown that happens around us and that the more we learn about how reality actually works the less need there is for a deity to explain itSo I asked my mom one day when I was around  or  what God was Her answer was Its what some people think explains why the world is here But there are other explanations that work better,1,cdkjqa4,1r7t2m,atheism,new,4.0,3
datcrazybok,I guess it is pretty trendy or a commonly referenced piece in atheist circles but Bertrand Russells Why I am not a Christian really spoke to me I wasnt allowed to read things like that growing up due to a really strong Christian family But I still had my questions Then when I moved out of the house and started reading atheist literature I read Why I am not a Christian it was like every argument I had ever heard for the existence of God had been taken apart in a much more eloquent manner than I was able to utilize Russell really hit the nail on the head and I think thats why the piece is still relevant generations later ,0,cdkfvxu,1r7t2m,atheism,new,2.0,2
mverobeach,When I was  my grandfather died and on the way to the funeral I asked my mother what happened to him She said he died And were going to say goodbye to him and well never see him again I asked will I die too Yes we all will Then I started to cry and she said but not for a long time When I was  my best friend died from an asthma attack and my grandmother took me twice to see wakes of her friends who had died As a teen I volunteered in a nursing home and everday people were dying I think death is one of the main things that determines someones religiousity Every person I have known who is really religious as in they pray go to church and are hard core spiritual has a story of how they were confronted it seems spontaneously with the realization of their own mortality A beloved relative or friend died or they were drug addicts or alcoholicsthey all have some story like this I think that until they had such an experience they never gave a single thought to how short and precious life they never gave a thought to the fact that one day they would be dead Luckily I was eased into this realization from a young age and had family members who told me the truth rather than saying that the people who had died went to heaven or some other thingI think it would be an interesting project for a psychologist to do to find out how much this has to do with religious belief,0,cdkgikd,1r7t2m,atheism,new,2.0,2

proraver,By satanist do you mean a member of the Church of Satan or someone that actually worships Satan Atheism is the lack of belief in a diety not a lack of belief in Magik or the supernatural  In LaVeyan Satanism there are two main types of Magic Greater Magic and Lesser Magic Greater Magic involves ritual and ceremony to focus ones emotional energy for a specific purpose Lesser Magic consists of nonritual or manipulative magic through use of natural abilities to manipulate other humans and therefore circumstances by wile and guile At the forefront of this effort according to Anton LaVey is knowledge of how to employ appearances to ones advantage,1,cdkhzd1,1r807b,atheism,new,4.0,3
NuclearShadow,Ive read the satanic bible by  LaVey  I want to note I am in no way claiming to be a follower of such and  from my understanding  magic  or terms like psychic vampire which is often also used  is of course not meaning them literally  Its metaphors  like psychic vampires are manipulates that  use psychology to  get what they want from youLaVey seems to have believed in his life that people required a dose of  these sort of  imaginative  thoughts placed upon the natural world   This is why he believed rituals were required not because they truly do anything but rather it does something for the mental state for those involved ,1,cdkiw4i,1r807b,atheism,new,4.0,3

NuclearShadow,Its awfully hard to prove a negative  go ahead and pick any mythological being  and then try to prove that it does not exist  The burden of proof is on the one that makes the claim that something existsAs for the big bang  I prefer the term great expansion  does not disprove a existence of a deity however  it being based on many facts and even observable evidence   Such as the abundance of atoms in the universe which the theory predicts  To the fact that we are not only in a expanding universe but we are actively moving and so is every other galaxy  These facts would only be possible with the great expansionWhat this of course does not match up to is any  preexisting religion on the planet   So we know that all religions that try to make a claim on how existence came to be are incorrect  While this does not disprove a god it certainly discredits the religions  and shows that they can be and are erroneous Leaving absolutely no reason to trust them or their claims  as religions are not science and have no interest to pursue the truth,0,cdkiou3,1r81vh,atheism,new,1.0,1

taterbizkit,This is a great first step but thats all it is  The judges order stays enforcement until after the entire appeals process is completed  That could take yearsAlso oddly the FFRFs summary in the linked article seems to have misread the opinion  The judge only ruled on  and did not rule on   The article treats this as a victory over both exemptions  There are good reasons to believe that  is constitutional despite this opinion Edit I misread FFRFs summary  They make the distinction properly allows exemption of the rental value of a home provided to a clergyperson  Home is owned by the church minister pays no rent allows deduction of a rental stipend paid by the church to the minister who then pays rent on a home not owned by the church parallels an existing IRS policy allowing exemption of the value of a companyprovided home if having the employee live in companyowned housing is for the convenience of the company  Applying this rule to clergy is less discriminatory than applying it only to business employeesAnyhow as frequently occurs with these cases whether or not this ruling is valid may turn on the standing issue  To have standing to sue the government requires that you have suffered an actual factual injury  You have to have incurred a harm or been denied a benefit  Even if a law is blatantly absurdly comically unconstitutional you have to have been injured by it to sue over it  Silly but thats how it worksBeing denied a tax exemption provided to others is a harm as a matter of law so as long as the FFRF plaintiffs have been denied the exemption they have standingWhats not clear unfortunately is whether or not they have been denied  The Government claims that they havent been denied infact because they never claimed it on their tax returns  The Plaintiffs argue that the tax code on its face makes it illegal to claim the benefit thus operates as a denial of that benefit  This is exactly the kind of semantic nuance that judges use to reach the outcome they like the bestIf an appellate judge or SCOTUS justice wants to they can fatuously claim that as a purely technical matter the benefit hasnt been denied because they never claimed it  This would defeat standing and the case would be dismissed regardless of the merits of the plaintiffs arguments  Even though it could constitute a felony perjury tax evasion etc to claim the exemption the court could rule that not claiming it defeats standingThe judge addresses this point in the opinion that this would have the effect of allowing an unconstitutional law to be unchallengeable because it would be impossible to gain standing to challenge it  Unfortunately this kind of thing does happenOne obvious problem with  is that it applies the deduction to ministers of the gospel  which is pretty obviously an endorsement of religion  Long before this case reached a final conclusion its possible that Congress would simply change the language of  to something more neutral that would preserve the exemption in a way that is superficially constitutional but still manages to exclude nonclergytldr  Dont hold your breath folks  I doubt very much that this order is going to result in any clergymember or church paying more in taxes than they do now  There are too many ways to get around thisSource I am not a lawyer  Though I do get my CA bar exam results in just over  hours P ,0,cdkqrzo,1r8k9i,atheism,new,1.0,1

ca,I just attended a book discussion at my local UU church that touched on some of your questions The book under discussion was Mans Search for Meaning by FrankelI think what I took away from that discussion  was the meaning not the purpose of life thats a different question One group member said the purpose was strictly biological as in reproduction of life is making meaning of lifeOr the meaning of your life is to make something meaningful of your lifeFrankel a psychiatrist and neurologist who survived the German concentration camps thought that the meaning of his life was in helping others find meaning in theirs and he developed a psychoteraputic tool he called Logotherapy He noted that those who lost hope or a vision of the future were more likely to succumb to the rigors of concentration camp lifeMy feeling is that I wont live happilyeverafter in some gilded heaven or unhappilyeverafter in a torturous hell so I only have this brief time to enjoy this amazing live I have and to help others enjoy theirs True my impacts wont last generations actually my kids and my work may last a while be recorded in history books or change the world in major ways but that doesnt bother me at all or make my tasks feel less important It just makes me want to make more efforts so my impacts can be felt here and nowI get my primary fulfillment from my very small family Many are not so fortunate to have that I try to focus on relationship and community I also found fulfilling work that makes a real difference in other peoples lives nursing and a fulfilling hobby that does this as well running a community garden teaching others to do so and then and donating to the food bank I think if you cant heal or feed one hundred just try to heal or feed one Even when healing wont happen I can help ease the loss in a kind and professional way I use the garden to allow others to contribute too So best wishes to you I recommend finding something that fills you up and that you can share with others Relationship and community,0,cdkw7sc,1r92wd,atheism,new,2.0,2

SekretOne, How did you deal with the realization that quite nearly all youve believed was if you were not born to atheist parents falseYou feel betrayed and I do not think that is an inappropriate feeling But there two ways you can approach learning in fear an embarrassment believing that each lesson just highlights your ignorance or as a celebration a thrill that there is something that you never even conceived ofThe old world is shattered True It was familiar with clear edges simple rules  that didnt work and hatreds that didnt make sense The world turns out to be a lot bigger with a lot more properties than the little one And the rules all seem to be a bit more nerdy  less gays are all evil and more matter cannot be created or destroyed Seems a bit fairer though dont it  How did you deal with this sense of insignificanceI am a small man I will never eat all the food in the world Does that make eating inconsequential Do I not taste if I dont taste everythingIt is less scary when you get over the shock of not being in the center of the universe and instead be part of the universePersonally I cant see anything making me feel more insignificant than being created solely to acknowledge something else Particularly when that something is insists on testing me when it already knows the answer and baulks if I test it when I dont know the idea that everything needs a beginning and an end I wonder how baffled earlier mankind still applied beginning and end to the surface of the Earth and found out it was a sphere That Earth didnt really have edges The answer may be in the scope of a question we havent even asked But we can find answers and thats exciting But you can only find answers if you ask questions and dont assume youre rightThe most harmful thing Christianity does is it instills this notion that everything you need to know is between the pages It pretends that all that is unknown is unknowable Yet we keep figuring stuff outIts startling to have the familiar fall away and see what appears to be an huge unbound expanse But trust me that confusing but cozy place is nothing nothing compared to whats actually out there Its not a void Its filled with people strange plants weird food music reverberating on strings vocal cords drums and GUI displays an internet that can freaking connect you to people on the other side of the world in a fraction of a second moons in a perpetual state of falling bacteria living without oxygen butted up against volcanic vents blue whales a genetic marker named after Sonic the HedgeHog cartoons robotic limbs and corgis,0,cdkvt7o,1r92wd,atheism,new,1.0,1

oldviscosity,Hear hear Its time to end automatic tax exemptions for religious organizations all together The IRS has demonstrated thoroughly that they have no intention of enforcing the existing law that would if it were enforced today pull the exemption from thousands of religious groups that use the pulpit as a political tool to sway voters So clearly pulling the exemptions universally will cause no more damage to the political landscape than is already being done If religious organizations want to keep the tax exemption status then they should have to demonstrate unequivocally their charitable works in line with all other nonprofits They shouldnt get it automagically just by being a religion,32,cdkwgsm,1r99hi,atheism,new,120.0,88

bigdamhero,Just to clear things up for those commenting who have obviously read no more than the title and perhaps the first few lines of the article the court enjoined the IRS from enforcing  USC  and does nothing to  What this means is that if the decision is not reversed on appeal the IRS is barred from granting a tax exemption on extra income provided to a minister specifically apportioned for the paying of a ministers rent or mortgage  which was untouched still allows a church to purchase a home and allow the minister to live rent free without reporting the market value of such  rental as part of his taxable income This wont greatly effect most smaller older or more rural churches as historically these churches save money on minister salary by paying less and providing a living arrangement by way of a parsonage often gifted to the church or bought by the church long ago rendering it a free addition for he church to make Instead what the removal of  does is to prevent a minister from being able to hide any amount of income that they are able to show was spent on living arrangement which is far more common among the larger churches which get proportionately more wasteful with increased size and grant ministers unreasonably high sums for their homes essentially allowing the Revruns and TD Jakes of the world to live lavish lifestyles while reported relatively little On first reading the headline I was concerned for my father who is a minister however upon further reading I realize that neither he nor any lower income minister I have ever met would be greatly effected by this decision ,0,cdkzh5p,1r99hi,atheism,new,12.0,12

NuclearShadow,Many people believe that morality comes from religion   Its a common trap theists try to use  however is not only easily countered by  our understand of morality  through science on how and why it came to be but  since many theists do not believe in evolution I like to counter it another wayWhat people perceive as good and evil changes person to person   Which shows it is largely a culture  and somewhat of a personal opinionThink of a few religions and then look at how drastically they can view certain issues differently    A modern Christian for example would likely see Mesoamerican  mass human sacrifices to be  immoral  yet obviously the other side of the fence would see it as a good and moral act     But it gets worse for theists as even people of the same faith will often disagree on atleast minor issues  and at times even major issues    The topic of homosexual rights for example  you can find that Christians can have a polar opposite opinion on this subject   Some still think homosexuals should be killed  and they believe this to be the moral thing  Others will can be completely for homosexual rights and be supportive of the LGBT community and have nothing but love for such people Now if religion was the basis of morality this would not happen  especially in the case of those that practice the same religion,1,cdl1ugg,1r9ugf,atheism,new,2.0,1

Daniellassander,i will try to be as concise as i can but give me some slack english is not my native languageThere are many reasons why i dont believe in any religion god or gods first and foremost would be that even if we knew one religion was  true how could we possibly know which one if we have to take it on faith there is no clear way to differentiate between them and we dont know if one religion is true at allSecondly would be that all religions that i have studied never has anything in their texts that reveals  something that we still did not know about the universe or the world we live in at the time it was writtenThird would be that most religions holy texts contradicts itself in certain places so we know for certain that parts are not truecorrect there is no way to discern which is the most accurate and by this we also know that god indeed did not write itFourth if there was a god and he cared about a relationship with us humans he would let us know with evidence and if that god had written any holy text we can be quiet sure that it would be unmatched in the literary world it would be the most perfect thing ever writtenFifth people of all religions often say that their god talks to them and tells them what to do if that god was a real god those people would never find themselves at odds with others of their religion as the god would actually tell them the same thingsi can go on almost endlessly about this but there is one thing that stands out more then anything else science gives us a clear and unbiased way of understanding the natural world we inhabit it has uncovered that lightning comes from a charge building up in clouds by natural processes no god there earthquakes is tensions in the earths crust being released no god there volcanoes are magma under pressure bursting through fissures in the ground untill it reaches the surface no god there science gives us a way of understanding the world we live in that no religion can give us and through all the progress of science we have not yet found something that requires a godedit spelling,0,cdlezmd,1raker,atheism,new,3.0,3

MartinTheRound,Im not sure what you mean by looking for signs and answers Are you trying to have faith and find justification or are you looking for the truth out there If you are looking for faith your quest is completely different you will need to find something to reassure you to feel the spiritual connection In this case I personally suggest something along the lines of being spiritual that is to say just believe that there is a higher power and dont buy into any specific religion search for the good parts of religions If youre looking for the truth on the other hand you need to ask yourself are you ready to find that there is in fact no higher power and the gods people believe in are just manifestations of psychologyAs for damning people to hell for not believing its one of the glaring problems with christianity Think of if this way if there were a loving god hesheittheythem would not condemn people for silly stuff surely But from a critical perspective consider that the jewish faith and the old testament has no concept of heaven or hell And if you read the bible carefully youll find that nothing jesus said mentions heaven specifically Jesus spoke of the kingdom of god on earth and the resurrection of corporeal bodies when the time comes And people are still waiting Also consider that there is no single interpretation of pretty much anything in the bible Or it can be seen that way consider the christians that kill in the name of god despite thou shalt not kill is a commandment from god Also consider that there are countless churches and denominations so being right is out of the question or at least practically out of the question Since if a truth could be found and presented it would not make sense to fracture churchesYou dont need a church or a doctrine to be spiritual And you dont need to have faith in a higher power or spirituality to be good or happy And if youre looking for the truth you might get surprised be ready What do you seek precisely WhyBut I wish you happy seeking And feel free to ask Im on reddit for a short time but there are plenty of people here to give you plenty of points of view vast majority in a welcoming manner,0,cdlhb0q,1ralx0,atheism,new,1.0,1

Quietchr,This is a bit of complex issue that many believe is simple Many times when an individual makes a claim about a belief it is based on a linear definition of Christianity Many many atheists have this over confidence in their belief because of this limited definition of Christian doctrine The problem is also on the Christian side as well Even though atheists have this quite frankly drastic misunderstanding of Christianity Christians have absolutely no idea what they believe and they too have a limited understanding of their own religion This ignorance is a turn off to most and drive many further into atheism searching for anything that remotely seems to refute Christianity based on that limited understanding and even further latching onto those discrepancies despite however weak those discrepancies actually are Between the mass ignorance of Christians and Atheists its no wonder there is so much misunderstanding and perhaps mudslinging towards each other,0,cdm0pfs,1ralx0,atheism,new,1.0,1

cjbrooksie,I grew up in a very religious home and was very serious about my faith until around age   I still considered myself a believer for a few years after that but I stopped going to church around  Because of a girl I watched alot of nature shows and out of interest started reading more and more about animals and eventually about extinct animals  Over time evolution just started making more and more sense to me  Eventually evolution went from being a crazy theory to something I could see everywhere  You can look at related species and see their similar traits and imagine how they diverged at one point  While accepting evolution does have to mean you dont believe in god for me once I fully grasped evolution and could see how our world formed and life came to be the idea of god no longer made sense to me  As I moved further away I saw more and more how the bible was not divinely inspired but was clearly written by men and many of them not very wise  The bible is full of genocide sexism slavery and so on  The divine word of an infinite being would surely be more thought out  If such a being did exist why would he so desperately need our worship  It just doesnt add up and one day it just clicked that I no longer believed in god  Ill also add that while Id never go back losing my faith was the hardest thing I have ever gone through  Ive never been more depressed than the initial  years after that  My family and most of the people I knew were christians  Its all I knew  And a universe without god was lonely and scary  But now my life has more meaning to me then it ever did as a christian  I live for me and those I care about not a jealous god  ,0,cdlazcs,1ramjh,atheism,new,5.0,5

StanFitch,Heres my EXTREMELY VALUABLE input I know youve all been waiting with bated breathIm not religious I dont have anything against religion itself or the people that follow their religion of choice Assuming theyre open minded and dont judge every living creature they encounter ha ha right Ive had my fair share of experiences with several different religions as I was growing up my parents were very open minded and allowed me to experience all sorts of different religions on my own I learned very quickly that it just wasnt for me I would probably consider myself Agnostic or simply Spiritual more than anything elseAs far as our government goes Buildings Currency Monuments etc My opinion is there needs to be an absolute separation of Church and State on all fronts plain and simple We as a society And especially as Redditors have already seen how chaotic and crazy a religious influence can make even the SIMPLEST OF DECISIONS in our government For fucks sake they cant even wipe their asses without referencing some portion of the Bible that states exactly how many wipes is too many not enough and whether you can do it yourself or with someone of the same sex in the same roomOur politicians can barely act on what is best for the people of this country without involving some flawed concept of Christianity or Catholicism They cant vote on a simple idea without bringing in the Bible the Jesus dude or the big guy God himself We cant even vote on a simple law to allow marriage to people who love one another what the fuck is that all about kidsAnyway my point in all this rant is simply that the longer we allow ANY religious references in any of our government activities the longer were going to be fighting this religious battle in a government that should not have any religious affiliations whatsoever If you as an individual would like to think that God has his eye on us and is giving us the strength and the power to be a great nation thats fine by me do your thing But DO NOT INTERFERE with what is best for the nation best for the people best for the majority just because the Bible says its naughty or illadvised  of whats IN YOUR BIBLE is terrible evil insane outdated nonsense that offends even the religious followers whove failed to do their homework ie Reading the fucking book that came with your choice of religion The quicker we abolish these references the quicker we can start to become a nation that focuses on the good of the people All of the people Bam there it is Chicks n MidgetsTLDR  Im completely for abolishing anyall religious references within our local state and federal governments because stuff,1,cdlhhkw,1rapjb,atheism,new,6.0,5

DinoDude,Apparently he needed to feel like everything was designed perfectly in mind for him in order for him to appreciate it Ultimately its an argument as Richard Dawkins put it from Personal Incredulity  I cannot accept that you can love without thinking things are designed therefore there is a designer He interweaves this rather skillfully befitting to his profession with some some glaring nonsequiturs and errors of fact for example personalities and appearance arent random  theyre caused by an easily understood sequence of events occurring in childhood and gene expression respectively Lewis then blindly asserts that it is irrational for music to be pleasurable without having any knowledge himself on what scientific reasons there might be for music existing within cultures in the first place so once again we see argumentum ad ignorantium Furthermore he commits a nonsequitur by implying that because it is irrational you therefore cannot explain it by chance alone  what a load of nonsense Even if my love for ska music and kittens is inexplicable to me that doesnt mean I cant appreciate them or that my feelings for them arent real He makes an assertion there that really amounts to little more than ignorant opinion Theres also a broad implied false dichotomy here along the lines of science without God  total chaos God  order when all the scientific principles we know of operate interact and originate all the same whether or not Gods mentioned in the mix As Laplace famously said I had no need of that hypothesis Essentially what Lewis says here is an artfully crafted carefully written beautifully expressed pile of ignorant horseshit ,0,cdlljhc,1raqhm,atheism,new,1.0,1

Xylemicarious,Moral objectivism The idea that morality is not subjective or a matter of opinion It is true or false and not subject to human feelings or customs Usually the source of said morality is god but philosophies like Utilitarianism could fit in here as well It stands in contrast with moral relativismMoral absolutism The idea that some actions are immoral no matter the consequences or motive This is often religiously based as well but you could be for example a strict practitioner of nonviolence and think that violence was wrong even in selfdefense Absolutism stands in contrast with consequentialism which says that an actions morality depends largely on its context and its consequencesAnyway theyre often overlapping but different Most atheists wouldnt consider themselves to be either though especially the former,0,cdlcuey,1rava8,atheism,new,2.0,2
postoergopostum,Ive been thinking about a new approach to arguments about morality Any thoughts and comments would be greatly appreciatedOne of the foundations of just about all religious doctrine is a moral code Further most of these doctrines are structured such that these rules are generally raised to a higher status than mere human rules and are regarded by the flock as being far more important and carrying more weight than civil lawsThis is then used as leverage to try and force all of society to conform with their individual ideology Think of Sharia in the UK or gay marriage in The USApologists also use our own internal sense of right and wrong as an evidence for God By claiming that the ideas we hold on the subject of how we should behave are not things that we have been taught or even conclusions weve reached on our own the assertion is made that this moral law is a feature of The Universe and it was put there by GodTo make matters worse there is the popular troll that those of us without faith are in some way morally compromisedTo date we heathen have tried to construct scientific or philosophical justifications for a moral code or sense that is independent as it must be of a non existent deityBut what exactly is meant by the term moralityLike spiritual and so many other popular terms of faith including faith the wordmorality is a slave to equivocation Part of the way religious belief is kept unfalsifiable is by using a wide variety key terms ambiguously If the things you say about your beliefs are confusing and difficult to pin down let alone understand then its much more difficult for that belief to be shown as falseWords like morality are too loaded We dont need them and by using them we are giving too much groundAs Hitch used to point out those who are psychopathic or sociopathic seem to exist without any genuine idea of morality and right or wrong So morality as such is not available to everyoneInstead lets talk about behaviourHow human beings behave towards each other is something we can test and measure There is already a wealth of data and it feeds in directly to ideas like Harris thoughts on well being and human flourishingWe already call the subject Ethics It is the scientific study of human social behaviour We even know where it comes from Surprisingly most social conditioning formerly moral instruction is carried out by our siblings and peers right from the very beginning of childhood Fairness is understood the day after we first manage to crawl to the toy box under our own steamTLDRSo my position is to put it succinctlyThere is no such thing as morality Its a term of ecquivocation and only serves to cloud the real issue How should we humans behave towards each other so that we maximise human well being and flourishing,0,cdlepxw,1rava8,atheism,new,1.0,1
Logomac,Objective morality would be moral truths that exist outside of an individual frame of reference and can be objectively measured Absolute morality would be moral truths that remain true regardless of individual situationsTo say that it is inherently wrong to harm someone against their will and this quality of moral wrongness is independent of any participating agents is to make a claim for objective morality To say is is wrong to harm someone period whether it be against their will or not regardless of the situation is to make a claim for absolute morality,0,cdlf1gg,1rava8,atheism,new,1.0,1

HeatDish,There is none Steven Pinker wrote a great dense book called Religion Explained which you could look at for better answers He argues that our brains work by making categories for everything so as to better remember it later We are attracted to supernatural ideas because they fit in some categories they should and shouldnt A ghost may look like a person so your brain says person category which confuses you when you learn this person walked through a wall without breaking it One would remember this story more easily than say an ordinary hunting story But the hunting story can teach one a lot about hunting So ordinary stories and family histories are mixed with supernatural ideas to make them easier to remember and pass to the next generation He talks about a study in which people were given words to read and a week later were called back to tell the researchers which ones they remembered It was always funnysounding words that were spelled weirdlyBasically religion Pinker argues is a sort of culturallyspecific memory system that eventually became what formed societies and made each group its own The problem is God and the supernatural can still exist in this scenario Pinker only explains how our brains remember thingsBoth athiests and religious people as Tacsol aptly pointed out at the moment depend on faith Religious people have their books atheists have the idea that if we can see touch manipulate or understand something then it is real and something that doesnt meet those criteria is not,0,cdlco65,1ravo3,atheism,new,3.0,3

Snabelpaprika,This is basically a scam a pyramid scheme hidden behind a lot of Jesus so people lower their guard and not suspect anything The extremely sketchy employment contract that isnt any kind of employment just a commitment from her to give them a lot of money It is not an employment if you provide your own salary That is recruiting to a pyramid scheme nothing else The use of partnership is also very pyramid schemy Just as the employment it is nothing but how about you give us money but just renamed so it sounds like something it isnt Why not just call it giver It is to instill some kind of duty and loyalty so they can complain and demand stuff which you cant do to people who are just givers  Pyramid schemes forces people to use up all their social contacts milk as much money out of them as possible and then when they and all their friends are dry they just leave them or force them to stop doing it since they cant support themselves any longer This is not a sustainable way to collect money thats why they need to be able to get rid of all these used up people and that is why the employment is completely self funded so they dont need to provide anything or have any kind of responsibilityShe is being used and probably instructed in how to convince all her friends and relatives to give her money The use of Jesus and calling itself nonprofit is just a way to try to get around the fact that pyramid schemes are illegal I would research what they actually do with the money I assume just a fraction goes to anything at all except the pockets of the leader and this is just enough to keep up the illusion of it helping anyone There are loads of organizations like this who prey on naive people who think they are doing something good but are just used by greedy bastards who hide behind religion to stop people from question the purpose ,0,cdlqe4g,1rb7cm,atheism,new,3.0,3

iceuhk,Youre definitely not alone in this thought  Im actually in the process of making my  some odd  video where i talk about how can they TRULY worship God with all their heart and all their mind and spirit and strength  I mean for a group of people that talk about how they love God SOOO much   If you go to church  times a week spend about  hours there and then even the more devoted people  will pray  times a day outside of that   Even then that is SUCH a small portion out of your week  I mean at most you spend what  hours per week thinking of God praying being in his word worship  Thats SUCH a meager time in comparison  For people that say they are putting GOD first in their lives they sure as hell really arent  You cant do that unless you dont work and spend all day praising and worshipping him    Putting him  First in their lives is really nothing more than putting him in a higher priority and then when situations come up that you feel God is moving you to do something you do it   So simply saying they love God more than anything if they are holding a job and spending time with their family  or doing personal things all the time  and at most spending  hours or so a week doing something related to him  they dont love him  MORE than anything,0,cdli9nz,1rbid4,atheism,new,1.0,1

Allogos,Its a bit harsh  but essentially correct  Like other posters I have one or two friends who are Mormons and I would agree wholeheartedly that they are nice people  The tactic of sending out young naive polite and welldressed missionaries seems to work for them  They are trained to be nonconfrontational in debate and not to raise their more crazy beliefs on first encounters  They bend over backwards to be classified as Christians but are not recognized as such by most christian and nonchristian observers  As a European I found it somewhat ironic that in the last US presidential election there were antiObama car stickers saying Vote for the Christian not the Muslim  Im not a huge fan of Obama but if Romney had been elected he would have been the first openly nonChristian President of the USA though he would have declared himself as such  Mormonism is interesting as a case study for how religions can be founded on weak foundations  and yet still flourish,5,cdlu26m,1rc7k9,atheism,new,15.0,10

CesarV,I am always polite to them when I see them but ask them a few questions that no Mormon has ever been able to adequately answer  For instance How do you explain the fact that DNA evidence contradicts the historical narrative in the Book of Mormon  Why is steel mentioned in the BOM but not only has no steel been found that was made by natives in NorthCentralSouth America but no evidence that they had the technology to produce steel  Why are horses and barley mentioned but both were not present or used by natives  Why is it that modern linguistics has demonstrated no connection at all with native languages and the middle east  If you believe in the small population theory why is it that in the BOM there are battles with hundreds of thousands of people killed yet no evidence of these battles   Nine times out of ten they smile nod listen and then ask me to check their website or come to the temple for a chat with an elder  I then tell them that I have already done this and no solid answers  Then comes the canned faith answersGod can do anything evidence is irrelevant when you have faith God communicates with us and proves himself this way without the need of evidence etc   Its to the point now that its getting boring,2,cdltm6x,1rc7k9,atheism,new,9.0,7

youllforgetme,I was a late convert to Mormonism at  I took to it for a few years after my parents converted I left eventually because I could not stop questioning the doctrine I have to say though during my time with them a nicer bunch of people you would be hard pressed to meet No one in the church gets paid for any work they do and  of money given as charity is used for charityLike all places there are a few people that were what I call Sunday Christians but I would say in my area they where in the minorityAs for the missionaries it is crazy what those kids go through mentally I became friends with missioners as we where around the same age and when one went home she was institutionalized She could not leave her room for weeks without another person They live  with another person of the same sex for  to  months so it must be hard being a missionary  So nowadays when I come across them I offer them a lift if they need it I speak to them nicely although I may at times really push them with theological questions they never react with anger or scorn and they have never said I would go to hell for not believing like my own brother who is a Evangelical church member said  to me one dayYes these kids know nothing about the real world but they do try and live there beliefs everyday which can rarely be said about a lot of religious peopleI might also add never has a Mormon called for the death of another for not believing ,3,cdlunjg,1rc7k9,atheism,new,5.0,2

monedula,A careful look at the list of prophesies you refer to quickly shows how nonsensical they are Messiah would be born of a woman Big deal How many men are not Messiah would be born in Bethlehem This is not what the prophecy says it says that he would be born to the clan of Bethlehem  Messiah would be born of a virgin If you read the prophecy in context it is clear that this prophecy has nothing at all to do with Jesus but is referring to the Assyrian invasion centuries earlier And in any case the original Hebrew says young woman  not virgin Messiah would come from the line of Abraham In other words he would be a Jew Big deal and  Matthew and Luke give wildly different lines of descent inspiring no confidence at all in their reliability Furthermore they are male lines of descent And Jesus father was supposed to be God  on which basis he was not a maleline descendant of Isaac etc The whole thing is a complete muddle Messiah would come from the tribe of Judah This contradicts the Micah prophecy that he would come from the tribe of Bethlehem Messiah would be heir to King Davids throne Jesus was never the king of anything All we get is a repeated prophecy that he will be one day Messiahs throne will be anointed and eternal Were still waiting Messiah would be called Immanuel He was called Jesus See also point  Messiah would spend a season in Egypt If you read this in context it isnt even a prophecy And according to Luke he didnt go to EgyptAnd so and so on and so on Its walltowall nonsense,1,cdls5uh,1rc9vr,atheism,new,10.0,9

BuccaneerRex,The nature of epistemology does not allow certainty on some types of claims But the lack of certainty is not a vote for belief in the claim An agnostic atheist simply acknowledges the lack of certainty Some people like to denigrate that as fence sitting or holding out but its really not It is just admitting that the concept of a deity is not one that can ever really be proven or not because of the nature of the claim not because of a failure of knowledge or scienceTheist hypotheses are to paraphrase Wolfgang Pauli Not even wrong They cant be scientifically proven or disproven because theyre not science The supernatural is an oxymoron If something has an effect in the universe it can be studied scientifically If something does not have an effect within the universe it cant be said to existWhat this leads to is the conception of a deity being goalpostshifted until deity is simply defined as the universe itself at which point youve just made the deity irrelevant as an entity within your hypothesis I cant say with perfect certainty that no deity exists anywhere But not because I expect one to be hiding somewhere in the universe its because I dont make any claims regarding a deity I can say that any theist claims Ive ever heard of are ruled out by the nature of reality as exposed through scientific investigation and that I do not accept any theist hypothesis as an explanation for the observed phenomena around me By holding this stance I am not making any claims and therefore leave no rhetorical cracks to get an argument into The burden of proof remains completely on the side of the theist and thanks to Hitchens Razor I can reject claims without evidence without needing any more justificationThe strong or gnostic atheist position strikes me as a doth protest too much assertion It is like including And we have ruled out Leprechauns explicitly as the mechanism for this phenomenon in a scientific paper,1,cdm01w9,1rcjy9,atheism,new,2.0,1

arthurpaliden,Genesis For The Modern Age In the beginning there was only God and he alone created the void that was the Universe Then into the void that was the Universe God placed a infinitesimal part of his being Then he sat back and watched And the void being with out substance was unable to contain this essence of God and so it expanded at a terrible speed releasing unimaginable energies Where upon there was created the four fundamental forces to contain these energies The Strong Nuclear Force the Weak Nuclear Force the Gravitational Force and the Electromagnetic Force And with the establishment of these controlling forces expansion of the Universe slowed and the great energies cooled  the first elementary particles were formed  And from these partials the first atoms were formed The initial one having a single proton and electron and God looked down and said let this be called Hydrogen Then when all the Universe was Hydrogen  the Fundamental Force of Gravity caused groups of these atoms to come together in ever larger masses Where upon when the masses became so large and the Force of Gravity so strong that they started to smash the atoms of Hydrogen together creating new atoms and releasing new energies that  illuminated the Universe And thus Stars were born and there was now light upon the void Then as the forces within the stars created heavier and heavier atoms the energies generated within became great Greater in fact than the Force of Gravity Where upon the very Stars themselves exploded spewing the atoms out in great clouds into the void Again the fundamental forces came into play creating new stars from the lighter atoms and Planets from the heavier ones Starting the  cycle of Star birth and death Now it came to pass that the Planets once formed were much cooler than the Stars allowing the atoms of various types to join together according to the Fundamental forces into molecules Some were simple such as the water that filled the seas some were complex such as the precursor proteins of life itself And with in the waters those combined to produce the first self replicating proteins which then became  the symbiotic proteins and they first living organisms appeared And as population pressure grew life began to change to venture into new habitats to eat new foods and thus evolution began And God marveled at the result of what he had put in motion  which was Man Then God spoke to man thus Do unto others as you would have then do unto yourself Use your intelligence to discover the wonders of this Universe and solve your own problems as it will help you to grow as a species and become better people  And oh ya Dont be jerks Then all was quiet and Man looked about and thought Now where do we start,0,cdmdstm,1rcsy3,atheism,new,1.0,1

JacksmackDave,I am familiar with this issue  I am  and my parents know I dont go to church anymore  I dont come out and say I dont believe the same things I did when I was younger because I respect people who want to keep their beliefs  I have experiences that make me question the biblical version of things but I also have experiences that to me confirm there is more to existence than random chance I suppose Im agnostic since I cant resolve my personal conflicts with the idea of a God that is perfect changing the rules to the game called life multiple times in the bible  I laugh to myself thinking the rules could be changed again once everyone is in heaven but no one sees that obvious possibility in Christianity But my advice is family is family  If the only reason you want to come out to them is to argue your egotistical point about how they are wrong you are going to cause more harm than good  If they ask you be honest but until you can prove them wrong that god didnt do things for them it will be a battle of opinions that neither of you can win and will just drive a spike into your relationship ,0,cdmdrp5,1rdclj,atheism,new,1.0,1

HermesTheMessenger,My personal focus is on mythology so if you are looking for a classic on myth get The Golden Bough by Sir James George Frazer  While it is not explicitly atheistic and it is not as old as Feuerbach let alone Hegel it is a good work on cultural anthropology and he generally states what he thinks along with his well documented research summaryIf you get a printed version do not get the full version with full citations  Get the smaller one  The smaller one is still huge Audio  hours httpslibrivoxorgthegoldenboughbysirjamesfrazer Book about  printed pages httpwwwgutenbergorgebooks The history of religion is a long attempt to reconcile old custom with new reason to find a sound theory for an absurd practice  Sir James George FrazerHeres an excerpt from The Golden Bough with the above quote in context to see if you appreciate his attention to detail and method of presentation Virbius and the HorseWE are now in a position to hazard a conjecture as to the meaning of the tradition that Virbius the first of the divine Kings of the Wood at Aricia had been killed in the character of Hippolytus by horses Having found first that spirits of the corn are not infrequently represented in the form of horses and second that the animal which in later legends is said to have injured the god was sometimes originally the god himself we may conjecture that the horses by which Virbius or Hippolytus was said to have been slain were really embodiments of him as a deity of vegetation The myth that he had been killed by horses was probably invented to explain certain features in his worship amongst others the custom of excluding horses from his sacred grove For myth changes while custom remains constant men continue to do what their fathers did before them though the reasons on which their fathers acted have been long forgotten The history of religion is a long attempt to reconcile old custom with new reason to find a sound theory for an absurd practice In the case before us we may be sure that the myth is more modern than the custom and by no means represents the original reason for excluding horses from the grove From their exclusion it might be inferred that horses could not be the sacred animals or embodiments of the god of the grove But the inference would be rash The goat was at one time a sacred animal or embodiment of Athena as may be inferred from the practice of representing the goddess clad in a goatskin aegis Yet the goat was neither sacrificed to her as a rule nor allowed to enter her great sanctuary the Acropolis at Athens The reason alleged for this was that the goat injured the olive the sacred tree of Athena So far therefore the relation of the goat to Athena is parallel to the relation of the horse to Virbius both animals being excluded from the sanctuary on the ground of injury done by them to the god But from Varro we learn that there was an exception to the rule which excluded the goat from the Acropolis Once a year he says the goat was driven on to the Acropolis for a necessary sacrifice Now as has been remarked before when an animal is sacrificed once and once only in the year it is probably slain not as a victim offered to the god but as a representative of the god himself Therefore we may infer that if a goat was sacrificed on the Acropolis once a year it was sacrificed in the character of Athena herself and it may be conjectured that the skin of the sacrificed animal was placed on the statue of the goddess and formed the aegis which would thus be renewed annually Similarly at Thebes in Egypt rams were sacred and were not sacrificed But on one day in the year a ram was killed and its skin was placed on the statue of the god Ammon Now if we knew the ritual of the Arician grove better we might find that the rule of excluding horses from it like the rule of excluding goats from the Acropolis at Athens was subject to an annual exception a horse being once a year taken into the grove and sacrificed as an embodiment of the god Virbius By the usual misunderstanding the horse thus killed would come in time to be regarded as an enemy offered up in sacrifice to the god whom he had injured like the pig which was sacrificed to Demeter and Osiris or the goat which was sacrificed to Dionysus and possibly to Athena It is so easy for a writer to record a rule without noticing an exception that we need not wonder at finding the rule of the Arician grove recorded without any mention of an exception such as I suppose If we had had only the statements of Athenaeus and Pliny we should have known only the rule which forbade the sacrifice of goats to Athena and excluded them from the Acropolis without being aware of the important exception which the fortunate preservation of Varros work has revealed to usThe conjecture that once a year a horse may have been sacrificed in the Arician grove as a representative of the deity of the grove derives some support from the similar sacrifice of a horse which took place once a year at Rome On the fifteenth of October in each year a chariotrace was run on the Field of Mars Stabbed with a spear the righthand horse of the victorious team was then sacrificed to Mars for the purpose of ensuring good crops and its head was cut off and adorned with a string of loaves Thereupon the inhabitants of two wardsthe Sacred Way and the Suburacontended with each other who should get the head If the people of the Sacred Way got it they fastened it to a wall of the kings house if the people of the Subura got it they fastened it to the Mamilian tower The horses tail was cut off and carried to the kings house with such speed that the blood dripped on the hearth of the house Further it appears that the blood of the horse was caught

thorne,As an Atheist as well I know exactly how confounded people are by the fact that I participate in Christmas This answer may be kind of long but I want to go into why I participate in Christmas even though I fundamentally disagree with the idea of it Btw I want to use the phrase participate in xmas rather than celebrate xmas because although I celebrate the gifts friends and moments of Christmas I dont celebrate ChristFirst of all I want to criticize the Christian idea of Xmas Im sure long ago xmas started out as truly a Christian celebration of their messiah and to some or maybe even most it still is However it has since turned into an industry and an embedded AMERICAN tradition I can only speak for the US One example and I understand this example may be hard to make since almost all the US is Christian Hanukkah As xmas grew in to the huge commercial enterprise it has over the years a relatively insignificant Jewish holiday seems to have had undue importance placed on it to compete with the commercial enterprise of xmas Seemingly indicating that there is an underlying value to the holiday outside of its religious value That other value in my opinion is economic enterprise It ultimately is an enormous American economic enterprise that cant be ignored by other religious preferences within the population Its a time when large segments of the population dont have to work when bonuses are paid and an almost nationallyagreedupon time of year for a day off for lack of a better term The American economy nearly comes to a halt which makes Christmas too big to be ignored But if its too big to be ignored what should we do as Atheists Come up with an Atheistmas and try to apply some type of values to it when the rest of the country is doing something else that way more fun  You could try that and write your own xmastype holiday that takes place at the same time but assign your own traditions to it festivus I think most of us arent as bold as Frank Costanza though and were stuck celebrating an enterprise that has a religious origin but now is simply an American enterpriseAfter all that I want to say I agree with you I like all the festivities the music the gifts and everything that xmas brings I think its fun to celebrate the enterprise that is Christmas but I just exclude the religious elements of itThe last thing I want to say is a warning to Atheists who participate in xmas Like I said I feel xmas is an American industry that we choose to participate in but there is a danger in us participating We belittle the cause of Atheism by participating if we allow the Christian part of xmas appear to be the part of xmas that we participate in If we allow it to be seen by others in that light we seem to admit defeat to go along with the status quo rather than adhering to our beliefs The danger is that we appear to others to not be serious about our cause and lose the little bit of traction that we have in juxtaposition to Christianity in America So I dont feel its bad to participate just that we have to let others know why it is that we do participatetldr Christmas is an American Industry not necessarily a religious holiday   ,0,cdmeqbs,1rdpcq,atheism,new,1.0,1

CirclesforInfinity,I came out to my parents and inlaws in a letter format My wife to be and myself ran into a roadblock with the priest that was to marry us when I started asking questions about leaving the mention of God out of my portion of the vows It was important to me that I not vow something that I didnt intend to hold up and live by and I didnt want to lie to the church by vowing certain things before God More importantly this priest was my god father and was full aware where my journey of faith had taken me over the years and that I had become an atheist as a result Instead it was his way or the highway so we elected to take the highway As such we needed to break the news to our families about what had transpired so I printed out the email exchanges that we had had with him and presented them to the parents Of course they were able to connect the dots and soon became aware of my doubts and rejection of faith and belief in the supernatural It was a tough pill to swallow for my parents and my inlaws absolutely freaked out and wanted to stop the marriage proceedings After my parents talked sense into them the wedding went off without a hitch My inlaws still take issue with my lack of faith but that is an entire different story and long post My parents on the other hand started asking me questions Long story short both of my parents have quite a bit of doubt and continue to be interested in where I am and what my thoughts are regarding certain issues They both read many thoughts and links that I post and expand and challenge their own comfort zone with faith In fact they both recently admitted to me that the only thing that keeps them involved in the church is the sense of community and family that it offers They pretty much admit that nothing in the text makes sense and that science is a far better explanation for things than magicTLDR By coming out as an atheist my parents have challenged their own upbringing and beliefs They now embrace doubt and pretty much reject the teachings of the church,0,cdmoqm4,1re4b2,atheism,new,1.0,1

jams,YESI once thought I was dead and that I was experiencing the afterlife It was fascinatingI was skiing in the Symphony Bowl I think It was a decade ago at Whistler solo and there were some cliff zones under the chair One of them looked promising I couldnt tell you just how tall it was now  taller than the trees anyway but it couldve been anywhere from  to  Anyway I wanted to jump it When I came down and passed under two ropes and past lines of signs signaling a cliff area and a ski area boundary I wound up at the top of the cliff and learned that there wasnt a good launch No space to start with speed and no lip to hop from because the slope just curved to vertical and the rocks below protruded I elected to do a quick turn and go out the side but I was on the steeps and knocked loose the crust under me I went over the side with a very small avalanche of my own making missed the rocks and trees on the way down landed mostly upright with one ski missing  it was stuck at the top of the cliff somehow but promptly lost it yardsaled and tumbled to a stop some hundred feet laterI was buried shallowly with a decent air pocket in front of me and I was hyped on adrenaline and endorphin No injuries  nothing hurt and I felt amazing Also I was comfortably warm After I wiggled my hands and feet I leapt to the conclusion that having just gone through an avalanche and off a cliff apparently unscathed I was very clearly dead  This posed lots of interesting questions for me as I had assumed there was no afterlife It was comfortable but dark and boring so I first wondered if there was any merit to the idea of purgatory which is where I imagine honestly that I would probably go if the myths were substantially accurate having never really done anything bad nor particularly good for that matterMy next thought was that I was actually dying not dead and experiencing timedilation from some kind of neurochemical bonanza in my damaged brainMy next thought was that if I were dead or even if I were just euphoric and trapped in a dying brain that I might be able to either experience or imagine something better than cozy warm darkness I thought I would start by trying to fly So I jumpedI jumped out of the snow  I was under the chairlift at the bottom of a bigass cliff  People started applauding noisilyI got so drunk that night that I almost died again ,1,cdmhey4,1relo7,atheism,new,7.0,6

NukeThePope,Ive kept a link to this expense breakdown for a Catholic churchhttpwwwchristianitytodaycomspecialycresourcespdfexecreportchurchbudgetprioritiespdf  at least thats what I think it isThe breakdown clearly shows that only a small percentage of the incoming money goes to charitable works and servicesIn fairness churches vary wildly in how effective they are at pushing money out to where its needed The best charities according to charity rating sites are  effective Churches tend to be a lot less effective simply because charity is not their primary product  proselytization is Perhaps the report I showed you with its roughly  effectiveness is typicalThat said the Salvation Army had high marks  around the  bracket IIRC from when I last looked I recently read that Catholic Charities had an  rate but I suspect that number is artificially inflated thanks to crosssubsidy from the Catholic Church properThis brings me to a general problem you may encounter with finding financial stats for church income Many churches fiercely resist making their finances transparent In the US they are routinely exempt from IRS audits and are not required to publish financial reports as other nonprofits doThats pretty much all I know on the topic Good luck,0,cdmkamm,1rey85,atheism,new,3.0,3

jmsr,Here now while my first reaction is like everyone else just move out its possible that OP lives in a culture in which the children stay at home until they marry  Now as someone who was raised in north america i know how weird that sounds but ive met multiple people classmates coworkers etc who are the children of first generation immigrants and currently live at home even though theyre freaking  goddamn years old and what the hell rightIn my culture im canadian we expect children to move out at  and make their own way in the world because living on your own teaches independence and maturity and we view people who stay at home as being either weird or immature or suffering significant misfortune like being longterm unemployed However one of my coworkers once explained to me that her culture has the opposite view and basically views parents that kick their children out as abandoning them  Whats more this is the standard model of child rearing throughout the majority of the world  In other words posters have to remember that the north american tradition of moving out at  is unusual and simply moving out may not be an option for the OPTherefore it is incumbent on us to try to think of suggestions for the OP to deal with this situation without belittling himher or saying just move out because that may not be an option for many reasonsIN THAT SPIRIT i would suggest to OP that she tell her mom that she is  years old and that because she is an adult now taking her belongings is technically theft a criminal offense  Further  adults are guaranteed freedom of association and can choose to associate with anyone they want and avoid anyone they choose  As a fellow adult her mom no longer has power over her only influence like freedom of speech though you dont have to listen  THAT SAID perhaps OP can contribute to the household as an adult would say by paying rent  What would mum think of thatIn any case good luck and feel free to vent here anytime jmsr,1,cdmvpsq,1rfcif,atheism,new,3.0,2

shavedneck,gt Hey Science rocksYes yes it doesgt But the worship of evolution theory as a source of our originWhy did you use the word worship there Were not happy that were evolved Evolution doesnt have our best interests in mind It doesnt have any mind at all Its a blind idiot Wed much rather have been designed by an engineer who cared about usbut we werent And it shows If your god did this hes a blind idiotgt is no more science than creationismAside from of course that evolution meets every scientific criteria while creationism meets nonegt There has actually been more written about the Bible than ANY other topic in history And LOTS of books to read on the topic of creationism Second to that is the topic of beekeeping I thinkI dont care how many fiction stories you write in the same setting it doesnt make the setting real All those works youre mentioning would fall under the wild mass guessing section in the comments of any other fanfiction forumgt Id say that people who are not scared of the possibility of a GodWhat a God using an indefinite article with a proper noun Its not that Im scared of the possibility of the god of the Bible being real Its that its already proven not to be the case Im glad there isnt too because the god of the Bible is evil and would have to be destroyed if it existedgt find the Bible just as deep and interesting as those who fear GodIf by deep and interesting you mean shallow primitive and selfcontradictorygt think of any science textbook which supports the theory of evolutionIm specifically going to think of the works cited and references pages which lists experiments and empirical evidence that evolution is real happens and is described by the theory of the same name so that anyone who doubts it can perform the experiments and check for themselvesgt We believe there are just as many or more gaps in macro evolution theory as in creationismI know you believe it Belief comes in two forms though The first form of belief is the belief based on evidence This form of belief is called knowledgeKnowledge allows you to demonstrate that you are rightThe other form of belief is based on ignorance and denial That form of belief is called faith You have faith there are just as many or more gaps in macro evolution theory as in creationism Its faith because you dont have any knowledge or evidence or even know what the terms youre using mean But you say you do anywaysFaith is being wrong on purposegt Hope you will get your head into some of those textbooks for a while before drawing any final conclusionsI do too Nobody should believe anything without evidenceAnd furthermore no conclusion should ever be final Evidence accumulates continuously and beliefs are never certain Things you know can be demonstrated but trying to demonstrate things you only think you know can fail When reality disagrees with you you are wronggt You guys are way too smart to make silly comparisons between the Bible and science textbooks as if everything therein is antithetical oppositesWe dont The theory of evolution and the biblical conjecture are similar in that both can be falsified The difference is the the biblical conjecture has been falsified while the evidence in favor of evolution continues to accumulategt Stop perpetuating anticreationist propaganda if you have no better idea about the origin of our species than anyone elseBut since we do have a better understanding we will continuegt Not every creationist is a literal creationist or a young earth creationistBut every creationist is however wronggt Many of us are HAPPY to integrate scientific findings into our understanding of how our Creator made usUp until you get to the understanding that he cant have made you Then you stop and call evolution a lie Ex See you abovegt Until you can show that something came from nothing I cant believe there is no creatorUntil you can show there is a creator you shouldnt believe there is a creatorUntil you can prove that there was ever a nothing which is a contradiction in terms you shouldnt be asking anyone to prove something came from nothingAnd since the theory of evolution isnt even remotely about the origin of the universe it has nothing to do with if something can come from nothingAnd since your god supposedly made something from nothing you might not want to argue against the point that something can come from nothinggt you are always posting some pretty cool stuff about physics atronomy etc but Ive never seen anything that rules out a creator Have youWell theres the first law of thermodynamics Thats sort of a big onegt The easiest empirical experiment one can do is to see that nothing as we know it comes about from nothingnessThats not an experiment nor is it empirical nor do we have any nothings to check There cant be a nothing Nothing and be are oppositesgt Nothing spontaneously exists There must be a catalystNothing never existsgt We believe a creator is the catalystYou have faith based on a complete ignorance in the face of evidence to the contrary that there could be a nothing nothings cant be that there was a nothing despite that that in this nothing there could be a god nothings cant have things that in this nothing there was a god rather than there being nothing that god used the nothing he didnt have to make something from nothing which you claimed cant happen that since god can make something from nothing there cant be anything else that could special pleading from ignorance that this god is your god and not Azathoth and then having used up all the nothing creating the universe it had to use dirt instead to make a man because even illiterate cavemen knew we werent createdFaith is being wrong on purpose And the more faith you have the more wrong you aregt What

socsa,Not all of those are formal fallacies  Ad hominem for example is perfectly valid for an inductive or relative line of reasoning  It just cannot be used in a formal logic proof  For example citing an academic meta analysis to rebut a statement made by a Fox News pundit is technically ad Hominem because your argument is not deductive  you did not do the actual legwork and perhaps dont comprehend the subject in its entirety so you are relying on a more authoritative source to make your argument     On the other hand if you cite an academic work in rebuttal of another academic work in an area outside your field then the ad Hominem is less valid but it still isnt automatically incorrect ,0,cdnd3l9,1rfws4,atheism,new,2.0,2

AgentSmith,Ive always had a problem with the burden of proof fallacy since it is probably the most fallaciously used fallacy  I think it would be more accurate to say that if people are to believe your position you should put some work into supporting it with facts and logicIt is too often the case that people end up arguing over who is making the claim when the fact is that both sides are making some sorts of claims  In these cases no one is supposed to get an automatic pass and avoid supporting your argumentScience knows this quite well and everyone in the scientific community strives to support their hypothesis with as much hard data and provable facts as they can  For instance evolution has quite a lot of evidence behind it In a fair argument or debate you shouldnt be sidestepping your obligation to present the evidence  You should be presenting it in all its gloryHowever the fact of the matter is that its easier just to put the obligation on someone else  This also puts the other side on the defensive and makes the argument easier to win  Its a good tactic but its often labelled correctly as a disingenuous argument by the other side  If the person asserts X is true they have to support it and if you are asserting Y or even if you are just asserting NOT X you have to support your argument to,0,cdn7gev,1rfws4,atheism,new,1.0,1

BrianJ,uHastyUsernameChoice  I have a question Why is the fallacy appeal to authority a fallacy The Principle of Testimonial Arguments maintains that you should accept a testimonial argument that satisfies the following premises   It is true that the proposition is reasonable to believe   It is true that the proposer is sincere in saying that the proposition is true   It is true that the proposer is knowledgeable in the topic at hand I understand that you shouldnt accept someones argument based solely on the fact that they are an expert without first weighing the reasonability of the claim made and the sincerity of the proposer But this is what this poster states about the authority fallacy gtThe authority that such a person or institution holds does not have any intrinsic bearing upon whether their claims are true or notBut their authority does have an intrinsic bearing on how close to the Truth their claims might be Unless someone makes an unreasonable claim or seemingly has a reason to spread falsities shouldnt we accept testimony on the basis that someone is an expert Consider this Biology Professor A and your crazy uncle on Facebook B who cut a frog open in high school one time have two contradicting arguments A makes a sincere reasonable proposition regarding Biology B though crazy is sincere in refuting it and does so with an equally reasonable statement For the sake of my enlightenment lets pretend that you have absolutely zero knowledge of the topic at hand and therefore are not in a place to weigh the truth of the premises against each other All you know is that both A and B have presented identically reasonable arguments and neither have anything to lose or gain out from establishing their proposition as True Would it therefore be logically fallacious to accept As proposition as deductively or inductively stronger than Bs on the basis that A is a certified expert whereas B is not Because it seems to me that the fallacy of appealing to authority is not a fallacy at all In fact it seems like quite the opposite It seems like it would be logically fallacious to presume that someone who is a nonexpert on the given topic is as capable of proposing a True proposition about the topic as an expert of course with all other premises constant ,0,cdn8fwo,1rfws4,atheism,new,1.0,1

Zamboniman,Sure you can pose that questionHeres my take on this issueThe question itself contains an unproven assumption To ask What is the purpose of life implies that there is one in the first place we just have to figure out what it is and that perhaps this purpose is imposed outside of ourselvesWhy could we or should we make this assumption First we need to determine if there is or must be a purpose before we can even get to your questionAll our current evidence shows that the purpose of life in quotes because I suspect this use of the word may be slightly or radically different than the one in the title is to reproduceThe purpose of our lives or at least of my life as a sentient human being is that which I ascribe to itSo for some it may be to be the best football player on the planet and make lots of money and entertain people Or it may be to heal the sick and save as many people as possible Or it may be to be a good parent and spouse Or perhaps leave a written legacy on some topic for future generationsWe choose our own purpose as human beingsThere is no evidence whatsoever that there is any outside influence or force that would or could ascribe an external purpose to our lives notwithstanding meddlesome parents and others,1,cdmv6zw,1rfzvj,atheism,new,3.0,2

taterbizkit,There are two primary ways to look at purpose in this context  The subjective do YOU have a sense of purpose that is personal to you and fulfills your expectations of what your life should be like and the objective is there a purpose to existence itselfThe second question is usually easy for religious people to answer God has a purpose for each of us even if we dont know what that is  For atheists its not so generally straightforward  Lots of atheists still believe that there is or should be some larger purpose that transcends the individual  Even atheists who will discount a larger purpose when the question comes up directly a lot of us will still make appeals to purpose or direction when the idea comes up obliquely  Youll hear As atheists we should be about making the human race better or questions like what is the next stage for human evolutionThose are both appeals to teleology that is a direction that movesshapes us and our futuresI reject teleology in any form  There is no such thing as should as an expression of objective truth  I can say I should of course because its clear that my own standards are involved  To say we should or you should or they should or People should though implies that there is a necessity that is larger than the individuals being discussedYou see this a lot coming from atheists who think atheism means skepticism or that atheism implies secular humanism or that it at least implies utilitarianism  I even do it sometimes out of habit or because there are some things its difficult to say in English in teleologyneutral termsSo for me of the two types of purpose the only one that does now or has ever had any meaning whatsoever is the purely personal kind  I enter the world with exactly zero obligations to anyone any thing any idea or any doctrine   If I am a utilitarian its because I made that my direction in life  If I want to be an astronaut thats because I chose it  If I want to be a world dictator and dont care how many bodies I leave in my wake thats because I made that my purposeThe term I use is  I am existentially free to be a nice person a caring person a hateful person a serial killer  My purpose is entirely and only my own  And by extension so is yours and everyone elsesThe universe does not has never and will never care that I or you or any human being ever existed  Weve been civilized for a few thousand years  maybe as much as  years  The universe will be many many trillions of years old before it starts winding down  The idea that any human being ever could have a significant role that transcends humanity is preposterous  Even if you found a way to destroy the milky way galaxy there are still at least  billion other galaxies  You dont matter and you never willSo all you can do is live your life for yourself  For most people me included that means some kind of utilitarian moral sense which is why we get along so well in millionplus sized citesAs to the cosmic purpose  I cant even say life is a purpose  Continuing the species  Procreation  Nah  Universe doesnt care and Ill be dead relatively soon so I wont eitherThe closes thing weve got to a purpose beyond the subjective is that were little entropy machines helping to smooth out the universe  Were not even good at it but its the only purpose we have in common with the universe itself,0,cdmw3yu,1rfzvj,atheism,new,1.0,1

lordslag,Young SirI find your ability to genuinely question what youre being told to indicate your curiosity and intelligence that said please let me tell you some things about atheism and atheistsFirstly your teacher is lying to you about everything hes said about atheists  Whether thats intentional or not I cant say because I dont know the contents of his mind or whether or not he knows better  Keep in mind that almost all atheists were indoctrinated with religion as toddlers and children before we knew to question or seek answers for ourselves just like you were  And most of us were threatened with eternal torture for disagreeing with it most likely just like you were  We simply set out to find out what the truth was no matter where the evidence led us or what the consequences of that search would beRegarding morality and ethics we get those things from the same place that everyone does that is from the social instincts were all born with  The necessity to work together in a group to provide for our needs and defense against privation the elements and predators whether that be from animals or other groups of humans  It is very important to realize that religious people DO NOT get their morals from the bible or other holy books  No one stones people to death for working on the sabbath or not being a virgin on their wedding night or being a disobedient child or breaking certain commandments or worshiping other gods all of which is in the bible  Instead evolution equipped us with an inherent sense of right wrong and justice which we codify and adhere to in order to build civilizations we call this sense a conscience and even babies toddlers and animals exhibit it  The reason I bring up those three groups is that they cant possibly know about religion yet have a sense of right and wrong anyway proving my point  Most atheists that I know myself included subscribe to Secular Humanism as a moral framework and I wont belabor that subject here since google will provide you with plenty of resources on that subjectSo far as a soul is concerned no one has ever located one or presented any evidence that one exists  Add a little critical thinking on top of that lack of evidence and one must eschew belief in that concept unless and until better evidence is forthcomingRegarding his accusation that atheists just dont care about anything I think its obvious to you thats just bigoted drivel  We love our family and friends just as much as any other person we strive to be good people do good works for their own sake instead of in pursuit of divine reward feel the pain of sympathy when we see others suffering and enjoy candy music and sex just like any of our fellow humansIn closing please keep questioning everything around you and never accept anything that anyone tells you at face value  Demand they cite evidence in reality to prove what they claim  Search out more evidence for yourself to make sure youre not being lied to  Seek out the educated and wise outside your friends and family who are willing to speak with you because they will have nothing to gain by lying in order to manipulate youStrive seek findand never EVER yield young sir  Good luck on your journey and I can only promise two things about it It will NOT be easy and it will be TOTALLY worth itSincerelySlagTLDR Never believe anything without evidence to back it up  Keep questioning everything everyone tells you including your own instincts and conclusions  The journey will be VERY difficult and even more rewarding,6,cdn1q6j,1rgb8p,atheism,new,21.0,15

guaboy,I want to share something with you as an Atheist person You are obviously very young and therefore interested in what is going on here These are my simple thoughts might help you or maybe not but I am going to shareEntering the churches and thy were Catholic ones since it is a culture in my country where I originate from as a very young guy I had noticed what it is all about It is about death and fear from it What is the most important part in the story of Jesus His death Yes we are a mortal beings and death is a big mystery that any church uses upon us The story of the sins is number  Combined those two stories in a form of the church dogma tells us we are guilty of something therefore we must dieChurch is about our fears That is why it is so successful Being an atheist and denying the sins and fear of dying does not mean rejecting the moral of the humanity On the contrary it is more awareness by accepting of what we are And there is a moral Jesus Christ wanted to formulate some thoughts here like dont do to the others what you do not want to be done to yourself Existent or not he said what every Atheist already knows there is a morale But some guys tell you that you should be paying for thisAre you afraid to die I am not I face my mortality equally like any characteristics that as a human being I have every day I know that my fellow humans have the same characteristics I do not need God to explain me that via some funny dressed guys That ask for money This is how it goes how it went for centuries What is good enough for my ancestors it is good for me And yes if you ask yourself for a higher sense of all of this I will tell you it is a joke There is no higher sense sense is in us dyingFurther reading all that Mark Twain ever wrote and especially Monty Pythons film The meaning of life Hell that is the one you are looking forGreetings,0,cdn2pbw,1rgb8p,atheism,new,5.0,5
HermesTheMessenger,First off I would be glad to talk with your teacher privately  As I have talked with thelogians seminary students evangelicals and more than a few Catholic priests over the span of decades I think his objections to me cant be based on something as arbitrary as how old I am nor how informed and patient I may beSo please if it would not cause you any harm ask your teacher to make an account on Reddit and then click this httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetoHermesTheMessengerI await a cordial and even tempered discussion  not an argument  from themgt Atheists arent like us Catholics They dont know about the difference between right and wrong This struck a lot of us odd as we had just thought of Atheism as another religion people believed in Once he saw our blank looks he added on For example and Atheist would walk up to you and shoot you in the head Why silence Because Atheists dont care A few kids questioned him only to be silenced and we moved onTwo basic points If the Roman Catholic Church has a clear vision of morality a deep understanding then why is it infamous for protecting and shielding those who rape children  Didnt the Pope and the cardinals realize what even the most hardened criminals know  that abusing children is one of the worst crimes of humanity As for any atheist doing what the teacher accuses us of the teacher only needs to demonstrate that what they say is true  If they cant or wont then they have to retract the claim  Failure to do so is an indication that they are either lying andor a bigotgt What bothered me is that this class and his teachings have put me off of religion completelyTake a look at cultural anthropology  Religion is fascinating and as a cultural practice does indeed exist in tens of thousands of variations  I do not think it is a source of greater morality nor do I think that theism describes realityRelated Dr Robert Sapolskys lecture about Biological Underpinnings of ReligiosityhttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvWwAQqWUkpI,1,cdmz1a7,1rgb8p,atheism,new,5.0,4
Zamboniman,Ive always had difficulty understanding why and how religious folks think religion has something to do with moralityEspecially given all of the time effort and research that has been spent on this subject over the past several decadesWe know where human morality comes from at least to some reasonably decent degreeIt isnt from religion It has nothing whatsoever to do with religionYour teacher is dangerously wrong and is spreading misinformation of the worst kind He is either unaware which is sad in and of itself given his profession or is deliberately lying to keep children brainwashed which is horribly evil  ironic given the subject matter at hand,1,cdmz9j9,1rgb8p,atheism,new,4.0,3

shamdalar,As you surmised your teacher is an ignorant jerk To address some specific pointsNo atheism is not just another religion A religion is a set of rites and beliefs associated to a supernatural powerNo an atheist is not going to walk up and shoot you in the head In fact atheists are statistically much less likely to commit crimes than religious peopleYes you might say many atheists have turned away from God those that were at some point theists but obviously we believe we have merely turned away from the concept of God Other atheists have never believed in God so obviously cant be said to have turned away from himFinally a lot of atheists care deeply about right and wrong I think its wrong to poison the minds of children against a whole group of people based on lies and ignorance I think its wrong to threaten eternal damnation for insignificant crimes I think its wrong to murder an innocent person and claim that somehow this murder balances out crimes committed by different people at different times My atheism is based on my evaluation of the evidence but the reasons I care about discussing it and defending it are all moral,2,cdn07cq,1rgb8p,atheism,new,5.0,3

DerberAuner,my  cents on thisim gonna go through the assertions made by your teacher that you published through your post step by step i hope i get them all Atheists arent like us Catholics They dont know about the difference between right and wrongi would say this is just plain wrong my guess is it is based on the assumption that only religious people can know what right and wrong is because atheists dont have a frame of reference to go from personally i would adress this argument as followsa deity is not neccessary for us to have a sense of right and wrong we can use our own minds and think for ourselves about whether or not we think something is good for us or our society or bad a good starting point here is the golden rule do unto others as you would have them do unto you i personally use a variation of it namely treat others as you think they want to be treated i am somewhat conflict averting unless they have shown themselves to be douchebags if they have treat them as they treated you Atheists are people who have turned away from Godjust plain wrong not everybody believes in god or ever believed in god personally i was raised as a protestant but i never truely believed so did i turn away from god you might see it that way but i wouldnt i would say i looked at the idea of god and thought meh seems to be without evidence once i was old enough but i never really believed in the first place others might never have been raised religiously from the start Atheists dont care paraphrasedplain wrong not much more to say about this atheists care about as much as religious people in general we care about the world people and life in general because we are life we are part of the world and how we act towards life will influence how our fellow humans act towards uswhat we dont care about is souls since we dont believe in the concept i hope im not stepping out of line here fellow atheistsi hope this was helpful,0,cdn1oa6,1rgb8p,atheism,new,3.0,3

MxM,OK I am an atheist and for me it is strange that what people think what is morally right and wrong is simply because it is written in the book which is older than thousand years and parts of it are really old  thousands instead of trying to understand for yourself what is right and what is wrong It is also strange for me to think that something is moral and right because somebody told me so priest for example because priests are people and they can make mistakesNo for me right and wrong is result of my thinking about common interests about humanity You can read up on humanism which specifically deals with morals without reference to particular religion To me religion reflects moral values not dictates it Can I make mistake in understanding what is right and what is wrong Sure But I will make everything possible to avoid this by carefully thinking about it not just referring to the book and removing my responsibility from my decisionAlso those books bible if you are a christian contains lots of stuff of questionable morality slavery is OK inequity between people men and women etc which many people even if they call themselves Catholics reject WHAT DO THEY USE TO REJECT THOSE AS IMMORAL Critical thinking So we atheists use critical thinking and feelings to understand what is right and what is wrong Not an ancient textAlso a bit off topic but may be useful for you to understand where we atheists coming from atheism strictly speaking is not belief into absence of God but it is absence of believe into God For many of us there is just not enough evidence to support Gods existence in the way it is described in religious text For example personally for me while I can easily answer the question do you believe into God as no I can not answer the question do you think God exists Because it is meaningless question for me I do not know what God is Ask different peoplereligions you get different explanation of what gods isare Does god exist as it is described in the bible with creation of the world in  days including humans Very likely not since we know from our scientific achievements how the universe was developed and how humans evolve Can this universe be created by something Could be But even in this case how I distinguish just an alien civilization with power to create universes from God What makes God to be God and not advanced civilizationYou see I honestly can not answer the question Does God exist since the word God is just not defined It is meaningless for me I do not reject God I do not know what possibly God can be and I do not have blind faith that something that is called God exists  I just do not see need for that and I see lots of damage that can be done if people use blind faithIn shot we atheist do not reject God per say We reject blind faith and welcome rational thinking about everything including morals,2,cdmz7do,1rgb8p,atheism,new,4.0,2

richertai,Atheists do care  They care about right and wrong  They have to justify it though  Its not just a because I said so justificationgtFor example an Atheist would walk up to you and shoot you in the head WhyBecause some people are sick in the head  You get this with religious people as well  Sometimes the crime can be tied directly to their religious instruction coupled with a sociopathic lack of empathy for others  Those parents that have been killing their kids because of some religious book on childrearing that have come up recently  They didnt care  At least they didnt care about the person  Any moron could see the damage being done but they believed that it had to be right  And whether or not they could justify it to themselves only indicates the level of mental problems they had  They did the damage of their own will  They killed children through negligence outright denial of necessary care or even violencePeople are capable of these things  Motivators like greed and doctrine seem to be the largest perpetrators  Greed can blind you to all others making you unfeeling  Doctrine can blind you but even those with eyes to see the damage are constantly being told and telling themselves that it is worth it  Because this life doesnt matter  They are striving for the next life so all things can be sacrificed on the altar of What We Think God Wants Based On This Book  And it IS a sacrifice of blood of knowledge of pain  This is my book  There are many like it but this one is MINEConfirmation provided me with no answers  I understood scripture better but no real answers to the real questions or mysteries  Occasionally theyd touch on the buzzwords of the day but those are the surface symptoms of deeper issuesThe best thing you can do as a believer is avoid religion  If the truth is manifest in the Bible then you dont need an establishment to interpret and spoonfeed it to you  Read that book from cover to cover  It will drastically change your outlook on what YOU believe and why  You will come across a great many things that you dont agree with  In times like that find out why you dont agree with it  It does help to talk to someone to get a different perspective on the story  Sometimes I genuinely didnt understand the moral of a parable  When I discussed it I understood the meaning more and then either agreed or disagreed with the moral being expounded  Either way it was me judging the book not the book shaping me  It is just a book and can be taken or left at your whim  But you owe it to yourself to understand why you take it or leave it  It tells you more about yourself than any religion ever could  If someone does not answer your question to your satisfaction then delve deeper  Find the source of your dissatisfaction and ask further questions  If they respond with anger or they try to brush it off then they dont know why they believe what they believe and are threatened by your questions  These people are not suitable leaders of any group  Do not look to them for guidance because they have no grounds to provide itFind your own answers and dont be afraid to question others  You will be more at peace about some things and more conflicted about others  This is good  Conflict exists in the presence of opposing forces  These forces are both within you  They are not external  They are not God or the Devil fighting over your soul  They are you trying to figure yourself outThere are external forces that will try to drive you into conflict with yourself and they are most manifest in religion  The pressure of doctrine and the sheeplike nature it fosters and requires is no way for a person to live  You are not yourself  You are what someone else is trying to make you  You will feel it inside  It will be a sense of unease or discomfort  Listen to that  Find out who is wrong and whyNever follow doctrine either political or religious or any other kind  Allowing yourself to be blindly led is no way to live,0,cdn6dw8,1rgb8p,atheism,new,2.0,2

gbuuun,Well the most interesting point to me has been how religious people hate atheists more than other people of other religions If atheists have no morals then surely Muslims and Hindus have false morals If I were to believe that my god was the one true god and that everyone else had it wrong Id be more suspicious of people who fell for easytospot lies about a doctrine than people who didnt believe one way or another I was also raised Catholic except my church was fairly liberal and didnt really talk about hating anybody However I did ask a lot of questions that in hindsight were indicative of my growing skepticism and my questions were often suppressed or mocked as being incredibly stupid I feel my intellectual growth was heavily stunted during my most formative years due to constant rejection by others of what I thought to be common sense Im surprised and happy that some people were put off by this unfair attack From personal experience Catholicism in developed nations is like Christianity Lite Evolution is accepted nobody really follows the doctrines of birth control and nobody really believes in the Bible literally Because Catholic doctrines so rarely matter in real life Catholics end up falling into two general categories of indifference one believes its doctrines are true and accepts that while it cant be proved it cannot be disproved a lot of apologists are Catholic and the other cares so little that heshe can be dissuaded of the doctrines of the church much more easily than the standard Baptist for example Most people fall into the former and once you dont care to really apply yourself its easier to be nasty to a group of people that you were told are evil than to think for yourself I realized that Catholicism had absolutely nothing to do with morality when my mom said to me in high school that I had to confess my sin of not going to church one Sunday I was actually helping out by giving food to the homeless that day and it made me confused that doing some good in the world was still a form of sin Every confession Id have to come up with sins or make what I did seem even worse so I would have something to say Once you realize you dont have to feel guilty for just being alive or that telling your wrongdoings to a priest doesnt absolve you of your responsibilities to other people you begin to see a glimpse of what it truly means to be moral ,0,cdn95ho,1rgb8p,atheism,new,2.0,2

ahf,Atheism is a lack of belief in a deity  As for the definition of those deities thats up to the believer to define  I can only say that for every definition of God that Ive been presented with it has either been presented without convincing evidence or defined in such a way as to be meaninglessFor instance saying that God is existence or reality or the universe doesnt mean much to me  We already have words for those concepts and belief in the existence of the universe is pretty much a given for everyone in it therefore its not meaningful to deify itIf you dont have a belief in any deities then you are in fact an atheist  Atheism is not a belief a movement or a philosophy  Its just the lack of belief in any deities,2,cdmyg91,1rgcfo,atheism,new,5.0,3

ktreanor,The best analogy I ever heard to help explain evolution are how languages changeFrench Spanish Italian are all romance languages meaning they all use Latin as their base  Its easy to imagine how Latin eventual became these different languages  When the Roman Empire fell different areas separated by distance or geological barriers first started having distinct accents much like how Boston and New York City have very different accents  These accents continued to change to the point they became dialects using their own words grammar and pronunciation  Finally after enough time has passed these dialects become their own languages  This is how Latin morphed into Italian over a long period  What never happened was a Latin speaking mother gave birth to an Italian speaking childThats the keymuch like Latin changing into Italian by small shifts over a long period so has life changed by small small amounts over a long period to form all the species we see today,0,cdn3cjl,1rgjae,atheism,new,3.0,3

MartinTheRound,Well perhaps first you should ask her how she understands evolution which is quite probably a flawed understanding Then you can work to correct her misunderstandingOne common misunderstanding is that evolution works on individuals another is that evolution works on entire species In reality it works on groups of individuals You take one species put them in two different environments theyll start diverging separatelyAnother common misunderstanding is about mutation rates many people assume mutations are either good or bad There are mutations that are inert and sometimes several inert mutations in combination will produce an effect So some mutations produce slow changes and others faster changesBut simply evolution is inevitable The logic is this mutations happen this is an observed fact confirmed both in laboratory experiments and in nature they produce change whether the changes are good or bad depends on the environment hot climate less fur cold climate more fur thus changes will produce effects over time Thus well see divergence of populations of organisms The longer the time the larger the effectsThis is of course a very simplified explanation Whole books can be and had been written on the topicMaybe you can start by watching some of the youtube videos recommended then watch some of them with her and asking her what she thinks about what was said and engaging in a debate and finding more information when requiredBut you should probably start by finding out what her notion of evolution is and go from there Good luck and keep posting on your progress,0,cdn9qg7,1rgjae,atheism,new,2.0,2
SpHornet,The theory of evolution If traits are inherited by the next generation If there is variation in those traits If there is a selection pressure on one of those traitsThen Those traits selected for will be more abundant in the genepool each generation as long the selection continuesyou can show  by pointing out that kids look like their parents you can show  by pointing out that people look different except for identical twins you can explain  by explaining that genes are not passed on if they dont have kids and  follows pretty clear out of So in words if a  legged lizard has a higher chance of survival it will on average get more children you give your genes to your children so they will be  legged to all children  or none depending on the genetics but it does not matter that much if you look in detail Because those children have also  legs they to will have better survival and thus more children etc until all lizards of that species have  legs or  legs no longer give an advantage,0,cdnaxec,1rgjae,atheism,new,2.0,2

MartinTheRound,You say she looked at evolution and it didnt make sense to her Im not sure what exactly she missed butAsk her to compare the anatomy of mammals A comparison of skeletal structures of for example a mouse camel human bear tiger and a dolphin might show that either the creator has a severe lack of creativity or that there is a relationship between all of these animalsAsk her to have a look at the similarity of brain structures in mammals She will see the same or similar degree of similarity in general as with the skeletal structuresAsk her to consider that weve mapped the DNA of many animals including humans and we see that there is a similarity that matches the previous conclusions about evolution If humans were created separately from other animals you would expect no similarity Indeed if you assume separate creation of every animal you would expect no similarity between any animalsAsk her to consider that the HIV virus was originally infecting monkeys SIV but their bodies were close enough to ours that the virus could jump and evolve into a new virusAsk her to consider that actual evolution was observed in laboratory environment in bacteria and those experiments can be repeated but creation wasnt observed in laboratory conditions nor can in explain the diversity of life on this planet At least not according to the old jewish bibles story old testament Consider that according to this story the earth was depopulated by god and the only land animals and only humans to survive were on the same ship consider how big a ship would have to be just to house every species of spiders Consider that not many birds can sustain flight for  days so there would have to be a lot of space for birds And there are numerous snakes that wouldnt survive a flood Its neither credible nor verifiable And the evidence for evolution is both credible if you understand it and verifiable You might also tell her to look up the documentary hypothesis Its not about evolution at all its about the literary and historical analysis of the jewish bible aka old testament and it shows that the bible has been edited many christian religious scholars accept it in one form or another and to be sure there is disagreement about the details but not about the fact that whats known as the jewish bibleold testament is a composite work edited with an agenda Ask her to consider how after the great flood all the kangaroos ended up in one place and all the pandas somewhere else And most importantly if only Noah and his bunch survived who owed their existence to this god how come the Incas never heard about him And how from the same bunch of people we ended up with all black people in africa and india all white people in europe asian people in asia etc etc And the only people who ever heard about Noah were the people in the same neighborhood Ask her to consider whats more likely that people invented different gods in different places or that some forgot remembered their god and many others simultaneously forgot and invented new onesI dont know what mental process lead you to stop believing but you might ask her to consider that there are many religions some of which must be invented and wrong because they dont agree with each other So we have a proof that humans create religions or does god want to have a laugh at our expense So when choosing a religion ask her what standards would she apply if she didnt have her mind made up already Then ask her if those standards are fair and if her chosen religion passes them and every other religion fails Then ask her why you should not be allowed to make a choice based on such a comparison and conclude that since many must be invented and you cant see why any would be more true then all are probably invented and decide that living a life without the burden of pleasing a god that isnt willing to show himself in a clear an unambiguous fashionThis is not an explanation of evolution just some points that might undermine her certainty in the things she beliefs in and have been shown incorrect and maybe make her able to listen to an actual explanation Maybe The problem is that religions very often make sustained ignorance into a virtue,0,cdnc6im,1rgjae,atheism,new,2.0,2
eritassisiht,I think the best way to really cut to the heart of it is to point out the difference between the evidence for small changes microevolution ltyes I know there is no real difference between micromacro just timegt and bigger differences like humans being related to apesThe kind of evidence for this is different  Not fruit flies  While the fruit fly stuff is real it just isnt very impressive to most peopleStuff like pseudogenes endogenous retroviruses the fusion of human chromosome These may sound too indepth but they are the best ways of proving that even vastly different animals including us are relatedI have an analogy that helps explain one of the things I mentioned pseudogenesA judge is hearing a case where the defendant is being accused of copying information for their atlas from the plaintiffs copyrighted atlasIf there was only similar information in the defendants atlas there wouldnt be much of a case this is analogous to the defense creationists use to explain similarities between different species  Such as Well a Creator would use similar genes for similar needs of the animalBut what if there were typos in the plaintiffs atlas  If the defendant really did copy directly from the plaintiff and not just research the same information then the same typos would appear in the same places as the plaintiffsThe same scenario is written in our genes  One example is the loss of the ability to produce vitamin CgtVestigial characters should also be found at the molecular level Humans do not have the capability to synthesize ascorbic acid otherwise known as Vitamin C and the unfortunate consequence can be the nutritional deficiency called scurvy However the predicted ancestors of humans had this function as do most other animals except primates and guinea pigs Therefore we predict that humans other primates and guinea pigs should carry evidence of this lost function as a molecular vestigial character nota bene this very prediction was explicitly made by Nishikimi and others and was the impetus for the research detailed below Nishikimi et al  Nishikimi et al gtConfirmationgtRecently the Lgulanoγlactone oxidase gene the gene required for Vitamin C synthesis was found in humans and guinea pigs Nishikimi et al  Nishikimi et al  It exists as a pseudogene present but incapable of functioning see prediction  for more about pseudogenes In fact since this was originally written the vitamin C pseudogene has been found in other primates exactly as predicted by evolutionary theory We now have the DNA sequences for this broken gene in chimpanzees orangutans and macaques Ohta and Nishikimi  And as predicted the malfunctioning human and chimpanzee pseudogenes are the most similar followed by the human and orangutan genes followed by the human and macaque genes precisely as predicted by evolutionary theory Furthermore all of these genes have accumulated mutations at the exact rate predicted the background rate of mutation for neutral DNA regions like pseudogenes Ohta and Nishikimi httpwwwtalkoriginsorgfaqscomdescsectionhtmlmolvestigesThese sorts of evidences are hard to ignore or dismiss  Unless they want to claim that God Jehovah designed our and other animals DNA like this on purpose  That would be a pretty deceptive God to worship though,0,cdnhhez,1rgjae,atheism,new,1.0,1

MartinTheRound,A few more things to considerThe question of our existence can be separated into four different areas of study The emergence of the universe the big bang theory the formation of galaxies cosmology the emergence of life from non living matter abiogenesis the emergence of more complex life from simple life evolutionThe religious answer to all of these questions is god did it which doesnt actually explain anything god did it doesnt give us any information where as investigating the chemical properties of life allows us to gain further knowledgeWe have good theories for each of these A theory in the scientific sense isnt the same as saying we have a definite answer But IMHO having a good answer is better than having an unsubstantiated claim no matter how definite it is especially if that claim doesnt help us in any wayFor example we know about Newtons laws for a long time and today we know they are inaccurate but they are accurate enough to build many of todays structures Some of our technology requires more accurate theories like quantum mechanics microelectornics or the theory of relativity GPS But others work with less precise theories that have since been falsified civil engineering hydraulicsA scientific theory is a hypothesis that explains the observations and makes testable predictions which can be verified A theory that makes more accurate predictions is better a theory that makes predictions that are contradicted by observations is said to be falsified But as I said a theory that has been falsified may still be useful if the error difference between its prediction and a superior theorys prediction is not significant in the specific circumstances and the inferior theory is easier to apply For example newtons laws of motion break down at speeds comparable to the speed of light and or distances great enough But for calculating automobiles we dont need the precision that wed get from using the theory of relativity Since the distances and speeds are way too small and the errors would be smaller than an atomIn terms of evolution the theory of evolution made predictions that were confirmed For example at the time of Darwin we didnt know about DNA and didnt have the capability to directly compare the DNA of various animals The theory of evolution predicted that animals that were considered related for example based on their skeletal anatomy would have more similar than animals that were considered less related Also the prediction was that all animals would share some DNA All of these have been confirmed The theory of evolution also predicted that if we perform an experiment well get a specific result which was confirmed The experiment was this we take the same bacterium we put it into sealed containers and we regularly add two kinds of food one of which would be edible by the bacterium the other wouldnt We would expect one or more of the jars to have at some later point a strand of bacterium that can digest the other kind of food And this was confirmed I may be oversimplifying the experiment but Im sure you can look it upHowever the so called theory of creation doesnt make any predictions that were confirmed The creationists dont make predictions Ive heard of But my interpretation of the theory would be that there wouldnt be any correspondence between us and any other animal since we were separately created But we see anatomical and genetic similarities between us and other animals So we cant be said to be separately created as some sort of crowning achievement which is what were supposed to be And if the creation theory is stated as intelligent design I would ask why an intelligent designer would give some creatures blind eyes And if were supposed to be the crowning achievement I would expect us to have UV and heat vision And what is the intelligent purpose of nipples on males of the species So by the standards of scientific inquiry creation and intelligent design are both uninformative useless and falsifiedIMHO science is better because it accepts and welcomes revisions As I said somewhere before when you successfully argue with religion you get a new denomination if you successfully argue with science you get better science   science is not the sum total of our knowledge its the method by which weve acquired the existing knowledge and by which we expand the knowledge further Engineering is how we apply the knowledge and marketing is how we make people pay for it  And religion is how we exploit gullible people scientology is an obvious example,0,cdo37ce,1rgjae,atheism,new,1.0,1

Snabelpaprika,One function in our brain is to think of predictable things and events as dead and also to imagine a purpose or agenda behind everything that acts irrational or unpredictable When something moves our brain screams its alive no matter what it is We see rocks and they are dead We can throw them fling them or let them fall It always acts the way we expect them to Our brain is comfortable with this and think it is safe because everything is under controlBut as soon as something is unpredictable we assume a mind behind it This is a consequence of being a social animal We need to all the time consider and interact with other beings often with hidden motives and goals Our biggest fear is someone who is dead and then he suddenly open his eyes Our brain freaks out and is clearly not comfortable with being surprised with predicable things suddenly being alive and unpredictable This would indicate that the brain did a mistake and need to remember this so it is not repeated And everyone remember things that freak them out We often cant sleep for days after being seriously frightenedBut there are a lot of things in nature that is unpredictable And until we find a pattern or a way to predict it our brains need to be careful and watch those unpredictable things so they dont surprise us Weather earthquakes accidents luck fights Everything is extremely unpredictable and dangerous So of course our brains think well something must be behind these weird things and then it takes the step to well someONE might be behind it But we cant find that someone But we know that he is incredibly powerful he can control earthquakes He must be magical just like our shaman that made all those colors appear when we tasted his weird mushrooms last year Maybe its someone who controls the weather and lightning And then someone else controls earthquakes and someone wars disease destruction luck the ocean plants the abundance of animals in the forest They are all very powerful and magical so they probably know each otherThen a few thousand years later someone comes up with maybe it is a single one who controls all those uncontrollable things Bet he is the most powerful thing it is Probably powerful enough to create everything I asked him for a favor before hunting yesterday and i immediately found a deer Im going to keep asking him for stuff But i must be friendly to him so he likes me just like i behave to all my friends Maybe he wants some of the meat from the deer yesterday How do i give it to him The only time i hear him is with thunder and the only time i see him is in the beautiful clouds that change all the time Bet he lives there The only way i can get the meat there is to turn it into smoke like we do when we cook it Lets burn some of the meat so it pleases the magic guy thats upthere somewhere,0,cdn5rjk,1rgqt7,atheism,new,1.0,1

BeakOfTheFinch,P Z Meyers handles this question well explaining to  year old girl that asked were you there to a NASA tour guide showing moon rocksDear EmmaI read your account of seeing a  billion year old moon rock and how you asked the person displaying it Were you there the question that Ken Ham taught you to ask scientists Im glad you were asking questions  thats what scientists are supposed to do  but I have to explain to you that that wasnt a very good question and that Ken Ham is a poor teacher There are better questions you could have askedOne serious problem with the Were you there question is that it is not very sincere You knew the answer already You knew that woman had not been to the moon and you definitely knew that she had not been around to see the rock forming  billion years ago You knew the only answer she could give was no which is not very informativeAnother problem is that if we can only trust what we have seen with our own two eyes in our short lives then theres very little we can know at all You probably know that there are penguins in Antarctica and that the Civil War was fought in the s and that there are fish swimming deep in the ocean and you also believe that Jesus was crucified two thousand years ago but if I asked you Were you there about each of those facts youd also have to answer no to each one Does that mean they are all falseOf course not You know those things because you have other kinds of evidence There are photographs and movies of penguins and fish there are documents from the time of the Civil War as well as the fact that in many places you can still find old bullets and cannon balls buried in the ground from the time of the war and you have a book the Bible that tells stories about Jesus You have evidence other than that you personally witnessed somethingThis is important because we live in a big ol beautiful world far older than your  years and theres so much to learn about it  far more than youll ever be able to see for yourself Theres a gigantic universe beyond South Carolina and while you probably wont ever visit a distant star or go inside a cell there are instruments we can use to see farther and deeper than your eyes can go and there are books that describe all kinds of wonders Dont close yourself off to them simply because you werent thereId like to teach you a different easy question one that is far far more useful than Ken Hams silly Were you there The question you can always ask is How do you know thatRight away you should be able to see the difference You already knew the answer to the Were you there question but you dont know the answer to the How do you know that question That means the person answering it will tell you something you dont know and you will learn something new And that is the coolest thing everYou could have asked the lady at the exhibit How do you know that moon rock is  billion years old and she would have explained it to you Maybe you would disagree with her maybe youd think theres a better answer maybe youd still want to believe Ken Ham who is not a scientist but the important thing is that youd have learned why she thought the rock was that old and why scientists have said that it is that old and how they worked out the age even if they werent there And youd be a little bit more knowledgeable todayIll assume youre actually interested in knowing how they figured out the age of the rock so Ill try to explain it to youThe technique scientists use is called radiometric dating It uses the fact that some radioactive elements slowly fall apart turning into other elements For instance a radioactive isotope of potassium will decay over time into an isotope of another element argonOne way to think of it is that its like an hourglass You know how they work you start with all the sand in the top half of the hourglass and it slowly trickles into the bottom half If you see an hourglass with all the sand at the top and none at the bottom you know it was recently flipped over If you see one with half the sand in the top and half in the bottom you know its about halfway through the time it will run And if you look at how quickly the sand moves through the neck of the hourglass you could even figure out how long until it all runs outIn radiometric dating the scientists are looking at how far along all the radioactive potassium is in the process of turning into argon The amount of potassium is like the amount of sand in the top half of the hourglass while the amount of argon is like the amount in the bottom half By measuring the relative amounts of the two elements and by measuring how fast radioactive potassium turns into argon we can figure out how long its been since the rock solidifiedIt takes a very long time for the decay to occur It takes  and a quarter billion years for half the potassium to turn into argon When they measured those elements in the moon rocks they found that the radiometric hourglass had mostly run out so they knew that it was very very oldScientists doublecheck everything They also looked at other elements like how quickly uranium turns into lead or rubidium into strontium and they all agree on the date even though these are decay processes that run at different rates All the radiometric hourglasses theyve used give the same answer  billion years None of them say  yearsI think youre off to a great start  being brave enough to ask older people to explain themselves is exactly what you need to do to learn more and more and open up the whole new exciting world of science for yourself But that means you have to ask good questions to get good answers so that you will learn moreDont use Ken Hams bad question and most importantly dont pay attention to Ken Hams bad answers Theres a wealth of wonderful truths that reveal so much more about our universe out there and you do not want to close your eyes to them Maybe someday you could be a woman who does go to the moon and sees the rocks there or a geologist who sees how rocks erode and form here on earth or the biologist who observes life in exotic parts of the worldbut you wont achieve any of those things if you limit your mind to the dogma of Answers in GenesisBest wishes for future learningP Z MeyersSourcehttpscienceblogscompharynguladearemmab,2,cdncigl,1rh877,atheism,new,4.0,2

Assgasket,And not only are they logically unsound as have been ably demonstrated herein but pretty much every one of his premises ie Nothing can be at once in both actuality and potentiality in the same respect or if a previous efficient cause does not exist neither does the thing that results has been scientifically disproven  quantum physics is odd stuff and on a very basic level in the universe things like causality and nothing can be in two states at once just go right out the window     ,0,cdnefbm,1rhvy1,atheism,new,2.0,2
Hambone,okay the first argumentgt Our senses prove that some things are in motion grantedgt Things move when potential motion becomes actual motion grantedgt Only an actual motion can convert a potential motion into an actual motion This is a very Newtonian view of the world but alrightgt Nothing can be at once in both actuality and potentiality in the same respect ie if both actual and potential it is actual in one respect and potential in another the existence of the superposition of quantum states proves this assertion to be falsegt Therefore nothing can move itself not granted it is not possible for subatomic particles NOT to be moving the uncertainty principle means that it is physically impossible for any particles momentum to be zerogt Therefore each thing in motion is moved by something else whatever well grant it and get to the conclusiongt The sequence of motion cannot extend ad infinitum grantedgt Therefore it is necessary to arrive at a first mover put in motion by no other and this everyone understands to be God the existence of a first cause is obvious  causal chains cannot extend indefinitely because we know the age of the universe to be finite you cannot fit an infinite causal sequance into a finite universe ergo a first cause must be present this proof is only valid for proving the existence of some form of first cause It is not valid for proving the existence of a theistic godthe second proof is basically the same argument Okay we accept the need for there to be a first cause Again this argument fails to prove that first cause  god There is a nonsequitur involved It follows that there is a first cause It does NOT follow that said first cause must be a theistic godThe third proof is debunked by the existence of evolutionary forces In a universe in which things can evolve there is no need for there to be a sentient agent at all timesthe very first premise of the fourth proof isgt There is a gradation to be found in things some are better or worse than othersThis is not granted A big stone is not better than a small stone nor is up better than down humans are not better than mice we are simply different Any evaluation of a thing as being better than something else is a purely subjective one and prejudiced a hotter star is not a better star it is simply a hotter star The first premise is completely flawed I reject it outright and with it all subsequent reasoningThe fifth proof is similarly flawed from the outsetgt We see that natural bodies work toward some goal and do not do so by chance This is the teleological argument What is the goal of a mountain Or of an asteroid What is the goal of a comet orbiting a distant star in a system containing no worlds with any form of life What is the goal of a quasar billions of light years away What is the goal of a hydrogen atom lost in intergalactic space What is the goal of water or of solar flaresClouds are not for raining they dont have the goal of raining to water crops The fact that clouds DO rain and that crops are watered as a result can be explained as an emergent phenomenon of natural forces without having to invoke the notion that this was the clouds objectiveAquinas was ignorant to the possibility that natural forces can play out in a sequential nonrandom way without the need for conscious direction An arrow fired from a bow does not fly because the human wishes it  the human is instead exploiting an emergent property of the laws of physics Aquinas has the relationship between action and intent backwards  humans do not cause the phenomenon they exploit it,0,cdni317,1rhvy1,atheism,new,2.0,2

KublaKhan,Although I was baptized a Catholic and most of my family are practicing Catholics I was pretty much raised as a Baptist  Considering that half of my mothers family are also Jehovas Witnesses and we had a few Presbyterian family members here and there I got a very accurate viewpoint of religion quite earlier than most other people  This actually helped to question doctrine and eventually wean me off of religion altogetheranother positive thing that was brought about thanks to being raised a Baptist is that my particular church was hugely into charity which was a real eye opener  the church would often have fundraising events for poor community members and for Christmas we would do food drives and collect toys for indigenous villages in Mexico  seeing firsthand the extent of poverty that these people lived in and the effects of this poverty on their culture really gave me insight on the issues that plague our society and honestly it was humbling  You can rationalize that poverty is bad and that marginalizing a huge section of society is wrong but you dont really feel that until you actually see it for yourself in person  For that I thank the church,0,cdniz66,1rhz5o,atheism,new,1.0,1

SpHornet,Many organisms have similar genes that differ in sequence in certain unimportant structuralcoding regions of that gene Some of those sequences look more similar then others So you get clusters of sequences that look more similar and other clusters that are similar within their cluster but more different then other clusters and some sequences that just are very different from the restthis could just be coincidence when you look at differences in a group you will always find this But the problem is for creationists that we didnt just look at  gene we looked at many and all those genes showed the same clustering This shows all organisms are ordered in a specific way and not because these sequences have slghtly different functions and contribute to small changes that define the groups Like I said in the beginning these are unimportant parts of the genes we can change them and nothing changes in the organisms themselfesNow the argument If god or anyone intelligent created the DNA he would not use slightly different genes that are also slightly different in unimportant parts in a way that suggested similar animals would have the same changes we would expect the unimportant DNA to either be all the same or differ at randomYet we find that not only that those clusters match in every gene those clusters also correspond to same evolutionairy tree that was already proposed by morphological analysis of species And again very important these small differences are not responcible for the morphological differences because we can change them at will and nothing changesFor god to have created DNA like this he would have intended to make it appear organisms evolved So either life evolved or god wanted to make it seem it did either way why wouldnt you believe it didAlso the more they are related the more these genes seem to line up along the chromosomes,0,cdnpt40,1rixqa,atheism,new,2.0,2

kzielinski,  Reading what the bible actually says I cant agree with this assertion Matthew   Citations needed what specific scientific claims are you labeling as unconfirmed This looks to me suspiciously like a wedge that you intent to use to get creationism into the argument   The problem is that we have different standards of debate And its rathedr hard to find a middle ground For instance either the bible is a reliable source or it isnt  As an athest I have no comment to make here  Atheists and Christians have a fundamental disagreement about reality  and how the world works You cannot have a constructive dialogue with a person who sincerely believes that you are going to hell,0,cdns2jn,1rj55l,atheism,new,3.0,3
Mechaniacal, Im not sure what you point here is Death seems a huge factor of Christs story Its the central theme Death assumption of guild and rebirth Death is also the finish line so to speak for Christians specifically to succeed in their Great Commission to be Fishers of men Care to give some examples Im not sure what science it is youre referring to that isnt backed up Im curious as to the details of your experience with those arguments though About the ad homs  this may well happen but just as often Im being generous here in my experience is much more often Theists often tie their sense of self to their doctrine criticism of a religion or the justification of it by a follower is often taken as a comment about the adherent Most people dont possess that sort of awareness of the progression of arguments This isnt a theist atheist thing and from my experience the majority of discussions between the two groups begin with charged emotions and only get worse They dont start in a stoic discussion over cordials in the library Aside from that the basic assumptions of valid arguments from either side are so disparate that its always a struggle to find common ground of any sort when it comes applying standards to a conversation It seems to me that theists deny religion not because they are afraid that it contradicts the claims of doctrine but because they know it does Thats the entire basis of apologetics I live in the US  every day Im shown that this is less and less likely to happen with about  of the population of theists because their book trumps many basic ideas in the modern world Civil issues finances gender roles etc The next third can agree on  on some basic science and are beginning to come around on social issues They basically have the attitude of Keep it over there youre responsible for yourself but i cant condone it Its not an actual harm so I dont feel comfortable banning it either The last third are the Liberal Theists who I prefer to term as Spiritualists who really just use religion and doctrine as the vehicle of a narrative of understanding some sort of vague wishywashy deity or presence Personally I made my way from one end of the spectrum to the other over the course of about a decade starting in high school Im now an atheist I dont really see much of specific point being made here by you It seems like a recourse to tone policing than anything else,0,cdns6e0,1rj55l,atheism,new,2.0,2

Redpoint,As a strong atheist I have to say you need to tread carefully as to why you think people are religious  My experience shows that intelligence is not a key factor  The main reason people stay religious is that they are no willing to change  Humans are habitual by nature and we hate change  Religious people use religion as means to justify their current lifestyle They have been indoctrinate to think that their religion guides their lifestyle however the reality is the opposite their lifestyle guides their religion    So it depends on how you get a long with your family which will determine how you see them  I love my family so when I became an atheist I saw them not as stupid or crazy I saw them as indoctrinated victims of a cult that they had not say in it  That is all they knew that is how they grew up I could not fault them for that  So I made it my duty to free them it took  years of energy and patience but I did it   Im not saying you need to do this but just think about it a little more than just thinking why would they believe in such crazy stories if they are intelligent   If intelligence were the determining factor then I would have by now been a nobel prize winning scientist   And only scientists would be atheists we know that is not true,0,cdnytl9,1rjpjk,atheism,new,2.0,2

Redpoint,There is not unifying reason why people become atheists  The only one thing we atheists have in common is that we lack a belief in gods that is it  Why and how we have that lack is unique to every atheist   Personally I was born Catholic but eventually left religion because I found the most religious people where the most hypocritical  One main point that believers could not answer was the following  Explain why were the Sumerianshttpwwwsacredtextscomanesum writing about the key biblical stories thousands of years before the bible or torah were even a concept  And they were telling these stories as they happened thousands of years before their time  example    gt    The story of our poem briefly sketched runs as follows Once upon a time there was a hulupputree perhaps a willow it was planted on the banks of the Euphrates it was nurtured by the waters of the Euphrates But the South Wind tore at it root and crown while the Euphrates flooded it with its waters Inanna queen of heaven walking by took the tree in her hand and brought it to Erech the seat of her main sanctuary and planted it in her holy garden There she tended it most carefully For when the tree grew big she planned to make of its wood a chair for herself and a couch   gt    Years passed the tree matured and grew big But Inanna found herself unable to cut down the tree For at its base the snake who knows no charm had built its nest In its crown the Zubirda mythological creature which at times wrought mischiefhad placed its young In the middle Lilith the maid of desolation had built her house And so poor Inanna the lighthearted and ever joyful maid shed bitter tears And as the dawn broke and her brother the sungod Utu arose from his sleeping chamber she repeated to him tearfully all that had befallen her hulupputree   gt    Now Gilgamesh the great Sumerian hero the forerunner of the Greek Heracles who lived in Erech overheard Inannas weeping complaint and chivalrously came to her rescue He donned his armour weighing fifty minasabout fifty poundsand with his ax of the road   Example   gt    All the windstorms exceedingly powerful attacked as one      The deluge raged over the surface of the earth      After for seven days and seven nights      The deluge had raged in the land      And the huge boat had been tossed about on the great waters      Utu came forth who sheds light on heaven and earth      Ziusudra opened a window of the huge boat      Ziusudra the king      Before Utu prostrated himself      The king kills an ox slaughters a sheep  ,0,cdnyj7v,1rjsdx,atheism,new,1.0,1

ReyTheRed,It is pretty damn silly to be an agnostic theist That would mean saying that you dont know if a god exists or not but believe anyway Lots of people do it but they are sillyYou were right initially with the burden of proof it is on him And unless you are arguing that there is no god you dont have a burden of proof The position I take is that I dont know what caused the universe to exist and until I know I wont believe in either an intelligent or nonintelligent causeAnd you dont even have to let him get away with assuming causality Go ahead and ask him to prove that the universe has a causeUltimately first cause arguments boil down to special pleading He wants to say that it was a god that caused the universe but it could just as easily been something that isnt a god If everything needs a cause then gods need to be caused too If gods could exist eternally then why cant the universe do it just as easily,0,cdo46kl,1rjw56,atheism,new,1.0,1

shavedneck,Morality is by mutual consent of those using the language the question of what does or does not harm sentient beingsBecause we live in a physical universe with a physical state of mind running on physical brains housed in physical bodies there is an objective physical answer to this question However because our bodies and minds and interactions with each other and our environment are hideously complex these questions are difficult and intractable This does not make them subjective it makes them complicatedPeople who expect morality to ignore the situation for a certain thing to be wrong in any and all circumstances are like people who expect two plus any other number to always equal seven Addition isnt subjective either but the answer can change depending on the inputs because the addition function takes multiple argumentsWere guessing at the objective morality because its complicated and difficult but also pretty damn important It took us a while to realize certain answers we had about morality were just wrong But we wont be going back to those wrong answers Our progress is incremental like it is in every field of studyAnd even though we dont have the complete right answer theres some pretty blatant ways to factor that problem For example stabbing Pretty much always bad Dont stab people kay And again there are objective examples where that is okay for objective reasons Youre a doctor you have the good knife and stabbing them just so makes them better by getting rid of the bad thing hurting them Time to stab,0,cdo0nte,1rjwjd,atheism,new,5.0,5

MisanthropicScott,Whose death is a good question that should not be ignoredWhen dealing with the death of a loved one there are three possibilities The person died after a long bout of suffering Having seen upcloseandpersonal that there are indeed fates worth than death death can sometimes be a relief Imagine quality of life as a scale from  to  where  is perfect health and  is death hence not part of the quality of life Quality of life can actually go negative This is when life is worse than death In such cases death is an improvement in condition Read the lyrics to the theme from MASH which were never played on the TV show Theyre quite uplifting and comforting for those of us who have seen worse than death An untimely death These are the worst deaths with which we sometimes must deal There is precious little comfort to be had from religion or nonreligion in such times Family members of mine have lost faith at times like these All one can do is cling to the loved ones who are still with us and grieve together I dont have any great advice here However I can say that religion in such times is actually downright scary Were I to have religion at this point Id be thinking that some god or other actively had it in for me and my family Id be looking over my shoulder wondering what was coming next In a better place With the sick god who just took my loved one from me Thats not a better place Thats worse Someone who goes peacefully at an appropriate time There are times when someone has not suffered unduly has never had their quality of life go negative and simply dies preferably in their sleep Here I would grieve the loss of life of course And yet I would honestly feel some hope that I might have the same opportunity when my time comesLastly there is ones own death Many people fear death and have trouble dealing with the fact that death means oblivion To me I just imagine the way that I felt before I was born or even conceived Why would I fear that As I was for the first  billion years of the universe so I shall be againI do not fear deathI do however fear fates worse than death My big fears are always about the road toward death and what it may entail near the end To that end I have made a living will I hope that my lawyer has correctly worded my living will to say the legal equivalent of If youre reading my living will pull the plugThe idea of having air pumped through the meat that used to be me for many months or until my money runs out is my own biggest fear I take comfort in the fact that as an insulin dependent diabetic I have a reasonably painless way out involving a very large dose of insulin far larger than the one that left Sunny von Bulow in a coma for  years Unfortunately this requires me to be conscious and in control at the timeBTW for atheists writing up advanced directives talk to your lawyer about the fact that hospitals need not honor them One extra bit of protection that may or may not help is to put in a clause that if you are ever taken to a hospital that will not honor your directives you wish to be moved to one that will as soon as possible This may help give your family some leverage to get you out of a Catholic or other religious hospital that believes in preserving life at all costsDeath is always a tough one I hope Ive given a bit of help Atheism will never give you the questionable benefit of being able to deny mortality On the upside it does make life more precious when you know that this life is all we have,0,cdo1w1n,1rk2ps,atheism,new,3.0,3

Scottland,Sometimes enough is enough already and death is a relief  Usually it means an end to pain  If someone dies at an advanced age then there is not as much cause for sadness  You may miss them but you both always knew they werent going to be around forever and that death is an important element to existence  If someone has an untimely death then it is tragic and the afterlife doesnt make it less so  The problem with finding comfort in the idea of the afterlife besides not being able to tell if there is such a thing is that you will still be without the people you want to be with  And if you do get reunited in heaven it will probably be with people whos absence youve come to terms with  Its the people you left on Earth that you want to be with  ,0,cdo1as2,1rk2ps,atheism,new,1.0,1

gbuuun,As a former Catholic myself have you considered the fact that if evolution is true  and the Catholic Churchs official position is that it is  then there was no first human and therefore the entire part about original sin goes out the window making it so that there was no point in Jesus dying in the first place I could perhaps understand if you were something like a Southern Baptist but evolution just demolishes Catholicism without even needing to go further from the first and most important premiseTo answer your question however atheism is not a belief Atheism is a lack of active belief like notbowling is not a hobby There is a tendency for SOME atheists to take their cues from science or philosophy though this is is not a requirement to be an atheist Atheists do not exert that there is no god but that we have no reason to believe one exists Moral philosophy is quite difficult and reading Hume Hobbes Williams and a lot of contemporary philosophers shows that there is no consensus there However I do think that Sam Harris is spot on on the topic of how we should treat others we should treat others not the way wed like to be treated but how theyd like to be treated Harris doesnt say this exactly but I think this is the logical conclusion of what his argument must be If we lived in a universe with only two people and two types of resources rocks and paper and person A liked rocks and person B liked paper does it make sense for person A to give person B rocks If person A deprived person B of paper and gave person B rocks is this a moral society To be clear once more this is NOT what Harris says but an interpretation of the implications All people are different There are things that make us similar in many ways but people have different needs and preferences Some people like jelly donuts others like cream donuts some people like video games and others like books People are very often biased because they play the game of life in firstperson mode They each feel like the main character and quite often they feel that they are not only incapable of making mistakes but also incapable of not understanding what is good for every single person in the world Treat each person as an individual not the caricature of the person you think he is or want him to be ,0,cdo3y14,1rk4vw,atheism,new,7.0,7

Wingflier,Ive definitely rethought monogamy since I became an atheist For many years after I left Christianity the concept of monogamy never even occurred to me as potentially flawed It was only after I began to study the divorce rates of industrialized nations that I really began to notice that there was a problemTo me the question is whether monogamy actually produces the most happiness and success for the individuals There is also the question of children and what is most beneficial for them as well However as a person who has no plans on having children this is not a factor for me I recently read a study which seems to prove that unmarried couples are happier in general than married couples httpnewshealthcomlivingtogethermaybementallyhealthierthanmarriagestudyThere have also been societies in the past which did not put such a strong or mandatory emphasis on monogamous relationships and which were quite successful in spite of thatOne reason I despise the idea of monogamy in the st world is that nobody is truly monogamous anyway What we have is known in psychology as serial monogamy In other words were monogamous with one person until were tired of them or theyre tired of us and then we search for someone else to be monogamous with When you look at it from this perspective monogamy just seems ridiculous to me Ive seen so many examples of women men too who are extremely nice and caring to me and who I have daily conversations with until they get a boyfriend after which they disappear off the face of the Earth They will continue to avoid contact with me until that relationship with their new boyfriend ends after which they will come back into my life acting like nothing ever happened This wouldnt be that concerning if it had happened only once or twice but it has happened to me countless times In fact I think its a bigger part of our American cultureAs a person who studies and adheres to the Buddhist philosophy and as a person who is mastering in Psychology I think that jealousy and possessiveness are two of the worst characteristics any person can display especially when it comes to their mental and emotional health and the heath of the relationship While I also disagree with polygamy as I feel that it puts women in most cases into the position of secondclass citizens I do wish people in America and other st world countries would reevaluate their stances on marriage and monogamy when clearly they do not work exclusively speaking Perhaps a culture that was more loving less jealous and less possessive would be a healthier happier one,0,cdo6py7,1rk5z6,atheism,new,2.0,2

skinnyatheist,In a word NoIMHO jealousy and dishonesty are part of the human condition The only difference between a monogamous relationship and a polyamorous one is your spouse if heshe is the jealous type will be jealous of the other spouse instead of your potential mistresses Her ire will be the same just much more focusedNow as for raising kids Raising a kid isnt a fulltime job but it isnt a hobby either its more like a parttime job And no one person can be expected to be there for his kid whenever he is needed  every day of every year put simply shit happens For this reason I believe that ideally every child should have at least two parental figures in his or her life Unfortunately it isnt an ideal world Some people marry the wrong person or find the right person but cant get married to him Other people get pregnant while single and choose not to get an abortion or for whatever reason cant get oneIm not saying that if youre a single you need to grab the nearest available partner and slap a ring on him Or if you are in an unhappyabusive marriage you must stay together for the sake of your children What I am saying is raising a child should be something that you plan for ahead of time with another person whom you have a stable longterm relationship with preferably someone who lives with you,0,cdofsob,1rk5z6,atheism,new,1.0,1

Cyraneth,After reading through most of the comments and your replies in this thread it seems youre taking the natural world for grantedIf youre asking yourself how something can be that beautiful without some higher power making it so then youre basically discrediting whatever it is you find beautiful You deny it the ability to be so touching and instead attribute it to something or someone you feel is more worthy of that regardless of whether that entity actually is worthy of it or even exists in the first placeIm wagering once you come to the realisation that landscapes can be that beautiful without outside help music can be that touching and events in your life can be that profound youll come to really cherish the time you have your surroundings your friends and family and the work of other humans as what it is instead of simply writing it off as god did it,0,cdo3m7s,1rk5zc,atheism,new,1.0,1
MartinTheRound,Well you can either just accept you have perfectly natural feelings and enjoy them or try to understand the nature of each feeling and still enjoy them We have many different feelings some of which have straightforward evolutionary reasons others somewhat quirkier ones some are side effects Does it matter to you which quirk of evolution gave you the ability to enjoy your time with your lover Or the ability to look at some nice work of art and wonder in amazement I can explain some of the feelings and it doesnt detract one bit from them Whats sad in my case is that understanding how my depression works doesnt make it any easier not to feel desperately lonely and want to kill myself I know its only chemicals I know which part of my brain is making it so but the feeling isnt any less severe Nor was my enjoyment of love any less powerful when I was loving and loved Just because I could tell what chemicals were involved didnt make my feelings any less enjoyable and doesnt make my current feelings any less hopeless And my ability to explain what makes me want to express myself takes away from my wanting to give you a response So Id say other than attributing your feelings to the wrong cause youre doing all right You are rational and you can realize that majesty can be found all around you even without the majesty being put there for your benefit And you can just enjoy it when you see it Majesty is not whats out there majesty is what you perceive Just like god people believe in god and god isnt out there its in their minds And has real effects on their lives But only because its in their minds Does that get you closer to what you want,0,cdo4p06,1rk5zc,atheism,new,1.0,1

MalakElohim,As a fellow Australian and Atheist keep your grades up Since youre planning on getting a university education and going white collar dont give a crap about school captains student council etc at high school Employers arent going to look at what you did in High School if they have  years at uni to look atThis isnt like the states where quality universities will go through your achievements and tuttut over them Ensure your ATAR or equivalent is high enough to get into the course you want or at least a related course then you should get a CSP and be done with all the religious crapThat said if you go to the right government school their education is as good if not better than the religious schools I did High School in Victoria in Bendigo in particular and there were  schools in total where I could do my VCE HSC equivalent Bendigo Senior Secondary College Girton Grammar Catholic College Girton was Anglican Girton had by far the best average marks across the board but their marks were matched by BSSC on raw numbers Of course BSSC had far more people and accepted anyone Catholic College had an average similar to BSSC but no where near as many high performersDo your research you might be lucky and have a decent government school nearby or you only have access to shit ones its a lottery but if you do think about moving there it sounds like it might be worth it to get away from the bullshit religionThat said if you want a high paying job to improve your chances go into a STEM degree especially Engineering or Medicine or Law Essentially professional degrees where they directly qualify you for a jobits illegal to do the job without the relevant degree Aim for a Group of  University if possible Will the education be any better than a nonGo uni Probably not if youre dedicated But that doesnt really matter for that first job its getting in the door and reputations count for a lotIf youre looking for an ArtsCommerce degree good luck getting a job unless youre rocking Acturial studies or are doing it as a double degree that said CommerceArts is GREAT as a double with Engineering it gives you downtime from Engineering subjects lessens the stress levels and gives you the opportunity to study things that are interesting to you Also heres an example Im an Engineer which is why my examples all revolve around it If you cant get into say an Engineering degree do a closely related Science degree to the type of Engineering you want to do It might push your degree back  semester which can be made up over summer breaks but it gets you in the door Getting INTO uni is the hardest part of getting into the degree you want Keep your grades up through the first  months to a year and you can transfer uniscourses tldr focus on getting into uni for your goals your school activities are virtually meaningless to getting into uni and eventually final employment,0,cdo4l2g,1rkfxo,atheism,new,2.0,2

scornucopia,gt Atheists say that the burden of proof lies with the person making a positive claim that something exists Again many other alternatives Not really Whether something exists or not is a purely empirical matter Either there is evidence that it exists or there is notWhen entertaining such claims there are essentially only two rules we can apply either we work on the assumption that an existential claim X exists is false until we have empirical evidence that it is true or we assume that it is true until we have empirical evidence that it is falseIf someone says leprechauns exist we assume thats false until someone shows us a leprechaun If we apply this rule consistently we dont have to admit the existence of fairies or goblins or gods without evidenceIf however someone says God exists suddenly the shoe is on the other foot and were expected to assume that its true until we can show evidence that its not But if we apply that rule consistently we then have to admit leprechauns and goblins until we can disprove them too This is untenableThe only rational rule for existential claims is that we assume that they are false until there is empirical evidence for the claimed thingIf you apply one rule to leprechauns and goblins and the other rule to God you are guilty of special pleadinghttpenwikipediaorgwikiSpecialpleading,0,cdoget6,1rl7kh,atheism,new,4.0,4

Thestrangeone,Once again depends on how you define god And if youre trying to define god into existence then it is not begging the question as you had assumed but rather moving the goalposts You see we can argue against the bible and its claims of infallibility inaccurate historical descriptions and all around just some absolutely awful advice so if you define god as the bible or Koran or book of Mormon or some other holy text then it is easy to disprove him But when you define god as a bland and generic creator or higher power thats when moving the goalposts come in Because a bland creatorhigher power does nothing to speak to any of the claims of the bible or any other similar holy text Also most if not all of the arguments for the existence of even such a poorly defined and vague god are riddled with logical fallacies If you want to believe in a god that is your choice but simply know that it is indeed a choice It is not a decision made out of a rational consideration of the evidence but on a purely emotional level and in some cases despite the evidence You choose the god that is familiar to you just as the muslim chooses the god that his parents taught him or the Hindu chooses the gods that were taught to him Even if you werent born in a religious family the supposedly tolerant America tends to have an attitude that Christianity is the only true religion and all others are false So if you are in an emotionally vulnerable place the first person that is going to race to stuff your mind full of nonsense will most likely be a Christian Theres a reason conversion stories often have a bottoming out part Its the emotionally vulnerable place where intellect is put aside for the sake of pure emotion So many arguments from the cosmological argument to the watchmaker argument to the ontological argument all involve pure appeals to emotion rather then any actual data supporting any one religion Yet all monotheistic religions claim to be the only true religion Gets a little suspicious after a while,1,cdotr3u,1rl7kh,atheism,new,3.0,2

xrancorx,We are heterotrophs we must eat to survive  No matter what if we want to keep living something must die plants are alive after all  But that doesnt mean that for us to live something has to suffer  Plants cannot suffer because they have no nervous systems  Insects probably cannot suffer because they have a brain structure too primitive to feel or understand pain as we know itBut what about a cow pig deer cat or dog  Do they feel and understand pain and fear  Are they aware to the point where they can experience suffering  I would say yes,0,cdok4ct,1rly3i,atheism,new,3.0,3

ELSenorGuapo,Back story I grew up in a Christian household hell I went to a Christian School until I was in th grade I ended up marrying a girl from that school with  children nowfor me it was my Dad dying of Cancer it was the first death I was ever exposed to It really really shook me and for the first time in my life I asked why did he deserve this He smoked earlier in his life but had quit for years the next question was simply what kind of loving god would put someone through this and from there I got angry because the answers I found were it was because of original sin Simply put my Dad died of Cancer because some bitch and asshole ate an apple they shouldnt of  years ago From there it was very simple I started questioning everything from the basic stories of the Arc to Jonah to Jesus I mean seriously for years how the fuck did I believe someone got every animal on the planet into  boat and fed them for over a month and kept them or a fish swalled a man for  days and he was ok or shit a woman somehow became pregnant magically I mean seriously we all know what it takes for a child to be conceived From there it I realized just how much of a bigot I was for having a belief that homosexuality was wrong that they were going to burn in hell for what they are I then thought about other religions and how each religion thinks they are right and then thought why I am right it was chance I was born where i was so a person living in a remote jungle on the other side of the world who is not exposed to Christianity would burn in hell because they were not exposed to itFor me really came down to  basic question Does this make sense I then applied it to a lot of what I was taught and came to the conclusion that I could no longer accept that there was a specific religious god i actually do not believe there is any kind of supreme being because frankly it did not make any sense Im still very early in the process of becoming an atheist so its all new to me but thats how i got here,0,cdonucc,1rm8c1,atheism,new,2.0,2

MartinTheRound,What is she like If shes educated tolerant loving she would understand more easily Maybe you could sit down with her and go slow explain to her what made you question your faith and come to your conclusions and listen to her Its not going to be easy and depending on her in may or may not work But its possible for religious people to love and live with nonreligious people Youll need to be patient This will be a shock to her In part thats a perfectly normal reaction after all she has a complete picture right or wrong of what it means to be a christian and what it means not to be one and she also has a picture of who you are and she thinks of you not believing any more as if youd suddenly changed Youll need to overcome all of that There is a lot of emotion invested in our world view and in our loved ones especially And youll have to overcome many indoctrinated views on top of that Many christians cant imagine a person being moral without the bible Those can be helped more easily Some christians would say they are afraid for your soul Thats more difficult to argue against without arguing against religion You can say that if there is a good and loving god he would know what I deserve But it may or may not work But bottom line is its a large emotional adjustment for her Youll need to be super patient Youll need to be super reassuring I wish you the best luck,0,cdpfq9i,1rmb0r,atheism,new,1.0,1
MartinTheRound,As for raising children to some degree its a matter of negotiation between you and your spouse Theyre her children as much as yours vice versa But children dont just learn at home and dont just learn in church and dont just learn in school and dont just learn from one parent Another thing to consider is that religion is just one part of a person Ive met perfectly nice and perfectly reasonable believers kind and generous And Ive met complete assholes intolerant miserly bigots My mother was religious and she taught me to value education and to help She never once said I should do anything because of a religion I learned from her words and her example You can teach them to be critical in their thinking while they believe there isnt as much of an inherent contradiction as some people imagine Sure there is some contradiction but not as much as some intolerant people would like us to believe But as long as you give them the ability and the desire to seek questions theyll be able to Thats my humble opinion Teach them so they might learn Nurture them so they might grow Support them so they might succeedPS your children are people too they have just as much of a right to be religious as they do to be atheist or to follow a different religion Just because I am an atheist and am sure religion is BS doesnt give me the right to deny people a personal choice I argue against religion all the time but I respect sincere choice And Id point out that upbringing isnt the same thing as choice My humble opinion tm,0,cdpfvjw,1rmb0r,atheism,new,1.0,1

Rhyshian,Heres how I see it your brother is certainly afraid of being found out but the fact that hes presumably actively insulting in front of your family is not cool At all Its one thing to avoid being lumped into a group by not participating and another to join in with insults in order to feel like one of the group Dont call out your brother in front of the family We shouldnt act like assholes Thats going to make him feel betrayed or escalate his behavior It may even start your family picking on him as well Even though it would be equal treatment you would have made things worseWhat you can do is just talk to him like you did when you two were alone Dont just get over it This is a bully mentality if a kid was being bullied and his friend didnt want to be lumped with the bullies we would all agree that he would become just like the bullies for a time if that friend joined in even if he wasnt REALLY a bully Talk to him face to face Tell him how you feel Even if your brother is the annoying brother type he should be open to receiving you But dont accuse him or anything just explain to him that he is not helping Use the bully analogy if you want But make sure you are heartfelt and not aggressive this turns people away This is more a psychology issue but truthfully psychology is one of the greatest ways to get to people Then if it goes well you should ask him to do whatever you want him to do to stop what hes doing Just pay attention to his comfort level as well its hard to act when you are afraidTLDR your brother is acting like a bully because hes afraid and you should talk to him alone but honestly and gently And move on from thereIm not a psychologist or anything though Id like to be so even if people tell me that my advice is almost always sound you should still take it with your situation in mind Trust your judgement if you think something might go wrong because sometimes experience trumphs in sensitive cases If he truly is a fellow atheist he should care about what he does to people cause this is it We are supposed to educate ourselves and Learn when we are wrong You can give him an important lesson in courtesy and kindness,0,cdowiq8,1rmf5v,atheism,new,1.0,1

adamwho,If you dont want to click on an FTB link here is the articlePart Neither Veil nor SubmissionMaryam NamazieThe niqab and burqa must be banned to protect womens rights and secularism  and not just out of concern for security Its a shroud strait jacket and mobile prison for women and girls who are bound and gagged and made invisible According to Algerian writer Karima Bennoune the veil represents the everencroaching fabric erasure of womens bodiesCalling it a right and choice is as formal as formal can be when it is often deemed compulsory and imposed and policed by Islamists  often using brute force Also lets not forget the veil is a tool like many others to control and restrict women and girls To me saying it is a right and choice is like saying FGM the chastity belt footbinding or Suttee are suchA ban is not a violation of the right to religion Whilst the right to religion and belief is absolute the right to manifest and express ones beliefs can be and is at times restricted for a number of reasons including protecting public security health order and the fundamental rights and freedoms of othersMen in Shia Islam might have the right and choice to marry four permanent wives and unlimited temporary wives for example but it is nonetheless banned in many places because it is deemed to be exploitative Uniforms are another way in which the right to dress is restricted in society for health reasonsThe European Court of Human Rights confirmed this when it ruled in favour of Turkeys right to ban the veil at universities now under question due to Erdogans efforts to Islamicise the country If dress can be restricted to protect health or public safety why not to protect womens rights and secularismMoreover rights often conflict with one another What about the adverse impact of the niqab and burqa on the rights and choices of unveiled or differently veiled women It is not as harmless as is often portrayed In the Shabina Begum case the House of Lords granted that restricting Shabina from wearing the jilbab to school was permissible in order to protect the rights of others who feared being coerced into veiling As Algerian sociologist Marieme Helie Lucas says The right to veil is always followed with the right to beat up women who do not Clearly the right to veil has a corresponding right to unveil or not veil at all The unveiled or improperly veiled woman is always held up adversely in comparison to the chaste veiled womanMoreover this is more than merely a question of dress It is important to remember that the niqab as well as the burqa and the veil in general is a highly contested political and social symbol Many Muslims or those labelled as such are at the forefront of the fight against the burqa niqab and veil  often at great risk to themselvesIn Iran the slogan neither veil nor submission has become a rallying cry in the ongoing fight between women and Islamic regimes morality police In another recent case in Sudan Amira Osman Hamed who faces flogging for refusing to wear the hijab says Im Sudanese Im Muslim and Im not going to cover my headIn this day and age the veil in general and the burka and niqab in particular are associated with Islamisms efforts to limit rights and impose Sharia law The enormous increase of veiled women and girls across the world and in Europe is a direct result of the rise of the contemporary Islamist movement and the ensuing pressure on women and girls to veil Women are always the first targets of Islamism And veiling restrictions on women is a particular signifier of things to come The lawyer putting forth Turkeys case for restricting the veil at universities said it well the hijab is not just a dress but a sign of political conviction it shows near and present dangerA good case in point is Madani Free school in Derby where girls as young as  have to wear the burqa all teachers including nonMuslims must wear the veil Those who criticise the fuss over a piece of clothing miss the point The niqab and burqa are the most visible signs of Islamisms war on women It also represents sex apartheid and Sharia law and all that follows In Madani School burqaclad girls must sit in the back of the classroom On school trips they must give way to boys and male teachers who cut in front of them in queues Music is banned As an aside child veiling is tantamount to child abuse In the same way that children are not labelled Conservative or Marxist children because of their parents political beliefs children should also be free of religious labels and faith schools until they are ready to make a choice of their own upon reaching Calling for a ban on the niqab or burqa is not about criminalising Muslim women anymore than banning FGM criminalises girls and women who are mutilated Whilst a ban wont solve everything there has yet to be a single prosecution with regards FGM changes in the law including bans are important steps in changing culture and attitudes and defending rightsMoreover calling for a ban is not about cultural imperialism or colonialism Islamist efforts in many places are forms of colonialism too The burqa and niqab are not traditional forms of dress but newly imposed ones for a majority of contexts Plus there are bans on the niqab or veil in a number of countries outside of Europe This is not about East versus West In Egypt the Ministry of Health has prohibited the wearing of the niqab by nurses in hospitals Egypts top Islamic school alAzhar has issued a ban on wearing the niqab in classrooms and dormitories of all its affiliate schools and educational institutes Al Azhar also obliges women to show their faces in court via a decree issued in  In Iraq the niqab has been banned by a fatwa In Kuwait women wearing the niqab have been banned from driving In Azerbaijan and Tunisia veils are banned from public buildings and schools In Syria until recently teachers were banned from wearing the niqabUnfortunately many secularists in Europe have shown a lack of clarity and moral courage when it comes to banning the burqa and niqab Secularism is a human right as philosopher AC Grayling says and one that needs to be actively defended promoted and articulated it is a fundamental precondition for womens rights and equalitySecularists have a responsibility to seize the initiative particularly given the farRights attempts at hijacking the issue to promote their antiimmigrant and antiMuslim bigotry Calling for a ban is not in and of itself racist though racism and prejudice are very real and need to be opposed on par with sex discriminationA ban has nothing to do with a clash of civilisations it has everything to do with a global struggle between secularists including many Muslims on the one hand and theocrats and the religiousRight on the otherA Manifesto against Totalitarianism which I signed in  with  others including Salman Rushdie on the Danish cartoon controversy still applies todayWe reject the cultural relativism which implies an acceptance that men and women of Muslim culture are deprived of the right to equality freedom and secularism in the name of the respect for certain cultures and traditionsWe refuse to renounce our critical spirit out of fear of being accused of Islamophobia a wretched concept that confuses criticism of Islam as a religion and stigmatisation of those who believe in itAnd to that I must add the wretched concept that confuses a criticism of the niqab burqa and veil as a stigmatisation of those who believe in it and wear

HermesTheMessenger,Do religious organizations foster good deeds  YesDo people act positively in society for religious reasons  YesThats not in dispute  Though is there a good reason to promote religious organizations and individuals beyond how they already promote their own virtues Is religion a netpositive on societyI say it is not and I think that the case that it is not can be made with using the best available evidenceHere are some of my notes and some databases that can be used to check the evidence httpwhywontgodhealamputeescomforumsindexphptopicAlso we can ask questions about morality  Here is a repost of mine on that topicWhat you are asking is that we trade good deeds done to one group for bad deeds done to another  or in this case done to the same group  While I see the need to compromise I want you to realize that what you are asking is unethical even if it results in some people benefitingConsider this If religion is a netnegative and I think it is demonstrably a netnegative then why not criticize it as a whole without having to constantly say there are some good things about it  There are plenty of good things about the tobacco industry yet that does not mean that those good things should be emphasized in all discussions to have some sort of balance or fairness  My notes including databases that can be used to examine the issue httpwhywontgodhealamputeescomforumsindexphptopic In addition I pose this question to many religious theists How many good deeds done to one group of people make up for the bad deeds done to anotherThe answer may seem so obvious that it is silly  It should seem obvious  Yet it is not  The issue of vicarious redemption or forgiveness permeates some religions ex Jesus died for your sins you can ask God for forgiveness for deeds done to others Here are some comments that I made in another thread with the above part in contextIf you walk out of a grocery store and a kids club has a table where they are selling cookies should you buy the cookiesIf you know nothing about the kids club you will casually make an assessment and buy them depending on your mood what your views of kids clubs are andor what they are selling There are no special responsibilities involved and no deep moral issuesYou may even get a lift out of supporting what you see is a small contribution to the grand effort at building tomorrows leaders You feel responsible for their success however small your individual contribution Every bit counts after allYet lets say that you learned earlier in the day that the kids club will use the profits of the cookie sales for their summer camp program to help with a soup kitchen and to fund new robes for the local chapter of the KKK Ku Klux KlanAssuming that you see the last item on the list as a bad thing do you have any responsibility for that bad deed  supporting the KKK  if you buy the cookies Are you only responsible for the good Do you have no responsibilities either way If so did that change from before your learning where the money went toTo expand on the example lets say that you were a kids club group leader and up to this point in time you were completely unaware of the group giving donations to the KKK for the robes As a group leader in the club do you have a responsibility for the donations from before What about the donations from this time forward If you do and you think that the KKK robes are a bad thing then what do you do to meet your responsibilities Do you even have any Where do you draw the lineTo put it another way How many good deeds are needed to pay for the bad deeds done to other peopleAs an example if I mug you and put you in the hospital is that OK if I work as a volunteer in a recovery clinic helping other people but not you fix their disabilities,0,cdp02lr,1rncsw,atheism,new,2.0,2

MartinTheRound, When europeans came to the americas they encountered an entire continent full of people that didnt have the same spiritual connection They had a different spiritual connection Some people have a spiritual connection to nature and not gods Some people have a connection to art that could be called spiritual That only means that as social animals we have certain needs to feel connected to something As for the probabilities he simply doesnt understand what hes talking about  But when I see many religions each claiming to be the only answer and none of them providing anything better than I am right because I have a book that is right that says that the book is right what I conclude is that all of them are equally invented If and when one of them can be verified externally I would reconsider but extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence If someone told you yesterday I ate grapes you wouldnt find it difficult to believe but if he continued with and then I went to the toilet and when I was done what I found out what came out was solid gold you would have a hard time to believe it If someone said there was a guy who preached I find it easy to believe and if he continues with they killed him and he came back to life I find it hard to believe What would it take for your pastor to believe I excrete gold after eating grapes If he believes it just based on my claim I have some more claims for him God could have given Adam a choice without giving him a choice to sin God could have prevented Adam from sinning like when he demanded the sons life but at the last moment he made it stop But god didnt  But wishing there was a nice little story doesnt mean there is one some of those letters are forgeries many of the christian traditions were purposely thrown out because of an editing process well after jesus and every of his followers were dead What about the council of nicea why was there a council needed to establish what the truth is What about Marceon who made his own bible What he should do is study the history of the bible from a historical point of view and not just choosing what he accepts based on what he already believesAnd I believe the bible says somewhere that some of the people around jesus would live to see the kingdom of god Someone please help me with which passage that is That verse alone proves that either the bible is wrong jesus lied we already live in this kingdom or we have some very old people running around Which one is it,0,cdpda0o,1rncwt,atheism,new,1.0,1

Nunleft,First off my I suggest having a look at several political leaning documentaries Bowling for Columbine Michael Moore Expelled Ben Stien or Zeitgeist Analyze them carefully look at how they craft a story uses juxtaposition and highlights certain aspects You may not agree with their message or think it is objectionable But take notes how they try to lead the discussion any sway viewersSecondly What are you focusing on The amount of topics covered by the topic religion is to many Pick a focus and build a story Hypothetically here is a documentary I would makeTopic Religion impacting Politics Title sequence display clips of politicians claiming religious views Interview a secularist give a history lesson on a religious swing McCarthy Show Religious activists in action interview them at a rally if possible Monolog on the harm religion has done transition Interview several religious leaders on the role of religion juxtapose with footage of right wing pastors Return to the first interview to give the secular person a response closing monolog with an appeal to secular values creditsIt is simple and shows why you believe religion is harmful the questions you raise would be worded in a particular way There would be someone leading the documentary and the discussion I would edit it to have a grim feel to it to try to convey how serious some of the people areHere are some aspects which you should be able to get a decent documentary out of Women Either in or outside the Church Sex Multiculturalism Both Ethnically and Religiously Abortion SecularismDominionism Education The battle over Good Science in schools Religious Home Schooling VaccinationReligious exemptions in medicineFinally Please do not do what Ray Comfort Most documentaries with politicalsocial leanings do edit interviews Give full context let people speak Let them make their own points instead of you twisting their words and changing their meaning,0,cdp8mph,1ro81o,atheism,new,2.0,2

BuccaneerRex,Your first problem is thisgtAs atheists we can proudly say that we have questioned the existence of God and certainly religion itself We have used our critical thinking skills and curiosity to look beyond what others have told usThis is not the case for everyone Some people never accepted the existence of a deity in the first place therefore have nothing to question Some of us have never been a member of a religion And as annoying as it is some people are atheists merely because nobody ever taught them religion they never reasoned their way into or out of anythingYou do not require a deity to have a religion this is true But your definition of religion is more of a definition of Abrahamic religion not all possible religions Not all religions include afterlives Not all have a central text Not all believe their deity is the creator They do all generally include moral prescripts so thats one Not all include eternal punishments of the ones that do include afterlives And some do not believe that any deities interveneIts a good start and defining terms should really be the first effort of any intellectual activityBut religion is an extremely broad catchall term and you cant really define all possible members of the category in five bullet points,0,cdp9sre,1roh7u,atheism,new,6.0,6

TheMaddMan,Young Unitarian Universalist here If youre looking for a place where you can do whatever the hell you want In a loving and affirming way Id suggest UUism as a viable way to spend your Sunday afternoons Its not only a church its a very supportive community complete with discussion groups social action events and sometimes potlucks UUist beliefs at their core are spirituality not necessarily connected to a certain dogma If you want more insight look up the  principles or go to the newcomers table that most UU churches have Concerning your sexuality the members of the congregation couldnt care less Unitarian   Universalism centers around your individuality and beliefs and gives you the resources to practice them comfortably Concerning how to tell your parents just say that you have found a church that you are satisfied with and you are at peace spiritually,0,cdpe5yp,1roorq,atheism,new,4.0,4

weshallrise,In my opinionThe historical Jesus of Nazareth was an apocalyptic JewishhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiApocalypticliterature preacher who was charismatic enough to gain a bit of a following I believe he may have thought of himself as a Jewish messiahhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiJewishmessianism of sorts and that he would raise an army of his fellow Jews to fight and defeat the Roman occupiers thus establishing Gods kingdom in Judea After entering Jerusalem and attempting to provoke the authorities however he was arrested for claiming to be the King of the Jews This was seen as a direct challenge to the authority of Caesar and was a crime punishable by death As a result he was crucified by the RomansAs for the mythical Jesus Christ we cant really say what if anything written in the New Testament is true The earliest books in that canon are those of Paul who never personally knew Jesus The earliest gospel is Mark written sometime after  ce by someone who could not have known Jesus Consider also that the writings of the New Testament have been changed and edited countless times since they were written and that none of the original copies exist The bottom line here is that we simply do not know what this character named Jesus actually said or taught other than that it was probably apocalyptic in natureIf you consider his teachings to be socialistic in nature as the teachings in Matthew suggest then they are really no different than those of most other great teachers throughout history The only thing that ever made Jesus of Nazareth special was the myth of his resurrection Without that Jesus was just another preacher and that is where history should have left him,0,cdpomvi,1ror9x,atheism,new,1.0,1

Thestrangeone,I think a better place to start is why you chose Christianity Because I cant truly address your misconceptions if I dont know what they are But starting with the limited information I have I will address the exact words you said Your first misconception which is rather common is that atheism is a choice implying it is a religion It is neither of those things Atheism is first and foremost the rejection of all deistic claims If you ask me why I reject the god of the bible which I assume the title of Christianity means that specific god I would first ask you why you reject Allah or Vishnu or Xenu or Zues Because if your answer has anything to do with faith let me tell you something there are people out there who have the exact same amount of faith and certainty that you do in fact some of them even more that believe that one of these gods are real So now the question becomes how do you determine which is true Because that is what would matter if it mattered at all I mean if the bible is wrong and Islam was true then you could see where calling yourself a Christian could become a problem for youThink about the radical muslims who engage in acts of terror How much faith do you have to have in order to strap a bomb to your chest and detonate it I bet you that guy is pretty damn convinced that his religion is true And if it is true and yours is wrong once again you can see where you might end up running into a problem somewhere You see the thing that you dont understand is that you are actually an atheist as well You do not believe in Allah you do not believe in Zues you do not believe in Vishnu Im betting you know pretty much next to nothing about hinduism yet you instantly reject it without knowing a single thing about it Back in the Roman times the christians were the athiests as they were denying the deistic claims of the emperor All Christians are actually atheists as they deny many many deistic claims often without ever considering them There is only one difference between you and me and that is I deny  one more god then you do By the way nondenominational many Christians would view you no better then an atheist as they would believe you to have just another one of the wrong religions Some Christians take those denominations very seriously to the point that they view everyone who doesnt agree with them as heritics see baptists and catholics and going back to your point about seeing no problem with science that doesnt actually tell me anything I know another christian that tells me that same thing yet he also believes in a literal  day creation along with the idea that Noahs flood actually happened and all of the other supernatural events of the bible actually happened So Im going to need a little more than that So Id like to know your position first in order to properly explain my position as I cannot explain something if I dont know what you actually know yet You are coming in with some very clear and obvious misconceptions and I need to know what those are before we end up having a big misunderstanding about what we actually think A nondenominational christian who sees no problem with science really doesnt tell me that much about what you actually think or why you think it And I need to know that I need to know what your methods are for determining truth and whether or not you care if what you believe is true,0,cdpezv8,1roxnm,atheism,new,54.0,54

Aberu,I will spare the common answer to this which isnt the answer you are seeking The whole we didnt choose atheism kind of thingTo answer the question how did I become an atheist which is the implication of your question it was because I wanted to rationalize the things I believed I was raised Southern Baptist Moved around to many nondenominational churches seeking answers for conflicts that I saw in each branch that I had arrived at previously I converted Mormon since a good friend of mine was Mormon and opened me up to listening to the missionaries They had answers for why the bible seemed conflicting edited for power and profit grabs etc Then the next logical step was to question the Mormon church after being baptised for some reason my skepticism wasnt honed fully yet I found it difficult to question the Mormon church without every source being tainted by Christian apologist writers and their criticisms or Mormon apologists and their responsese of those criticisms I couldnt find a verifiable independent source I dont remember what I found since its been about  years but I found a pretty independent source and it opened me up to thinking very critically about what I believed I used to wear a religion like a badge amongst many badges on my vest and I never felt like it was the most important thing to know anything about Just one of many things I felt I was expected to have an opinion on and expected to have a belief in something And I thought it was a given to believe in God but I always assumed everyone else believed in God in some form or anotherAfter questioning Mormonism I approached a kind of Deism and was firmly opposed to religious institution I had a deist friend bridge that gap comfortably for me in the same circle of friends as the Mormon friend Then I discussed my ideas with a coworker who I respected greatly a british born Californian punk rock bassist who was there washing dishes with me at the pizza place as a fellow delivery driver He got me to the point to ask myself How do I know what I think I know In other words he was requiring me to rationally justify the existence of a deistic god to him through logic I couldnt and I started sliding slowly into becoming an Atheist over the next year First time I admitted I was an atheist was after hearing a debate that Christopher Hitchens did I dont remember who it was against it was a while ago and he just made very good arguments to embrace what I had already been feeling that I was an atheist He was a brave voice that made me much more comfortable with being outspoken about it and outspoken publically against irrational beliefs That was my introduction to me enlightenment I dont like calling it this but I dont know a bettter wordHope that gives you a unique perspective but I assume most others peoples posts are similar in essence,0,cdpkm72,1roxnm,atheism,new,1.0,1

gidikh,Mine started with the  commandments  The one thing in the bible that god supposedly wrote himself  He starts off by saying for I the LORD your God am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me  then proceeds to wrap up the commandments by telling us not to be jealousenvious of our neighborsThe first thing that struck me was that this supposedly perfect being gets jealous  I dont get jealous beyond thinking someone is a dbag for hitting on my wife in front of me  But this all powerful all benevolent god gets jealous enough that he punishes children grandchildren and great grandchildren if someone doesnt love himI then proceeded to start reading the bible objectively and wow the god of the old testament is such a dick  Even if you skip all the parts where god is helping his chosen people btw choosing a small tribe of illiterate nomads out of the entire world as your favorite seems a little weird to me but whatever floods your planet kill rape and pillage their neighbors you still have stories of god screwing people over for no other reason that to prove how great he is  Read exodus pharaoh is ready to give up and let everyone go but god hardens pharaohs heart just so god can unless his plagues and get the credit for freeing the slaves  Those plagues by the way include slaughtering the first born of each family include babies unless of course you painted your door with lambs blood because god apparently couldnt tell the difference between his people and the egyptians  This is just one example of manyThen we move into the new testament and suddenly god isnt as much as a dick any more  If god is perfect why would he have a mideternity crisis and suddenly become the cool dad  Jesus shows up and has some pretty good things to say but then they have to throw in some pretty pathetic miracles   Your average doctor has cured more diseases and saved more lives by several orders of magnitude greater than jesus did  My favorite was using his omnipotent powers to save a run to the liquor store during a weddingSo after being thoroughly disenfranchised I started looking at some of the other major religions and found flaws with those as well  I then came to the realization that if there was an all powerful deity that cared whether or not we knew of it and worshiped it there wouldnt be any sort of doubt  It could easily come up with a way to get all its laws and such distributed to its creations that doesnt include having a bunch of illiterate desert dwellers witness something that takes them several decades before they find someone to actually write it downThis lead me to the conclusion that if there is a super powerful intelligent being that created everything it doesnt care about us Or much more likely we are just a random fluke of natural processes,0,cdpnbfm,1roxnm,atheism,new,1.0,1

Greghole,Theres nothing in the bible that says you should baptise babies  Baptism in the bible was a way for people to publicly declare their faith and trust in god  Its something you do not something that is done to you  The Catholic tradition of infant baptism was a loophole to get dead babies who never had a chance to accept Jesus into heaven instead of purgatory  The official position of the church has changed and they no longer teach that unbaptized children get punished  Basically anyone under five years old goes directly to heaven  If youre not willing to tell your grandparents that youre not a catholic just tell them you dont see any point to infant baptism since they decided to let dead babies into heaven,0,cdpzoyn,1rpngg,atheism,new,1.0,1

ReyTheRed,There are two ways of knowing that I am aware of Deductive logic starts from a few assumptions for example we assume that inference works that modus ponens holds etc and there are other axioms that can be adopted for various purposes and then under those assumptions we can prove things with certainty The weakness of this system is that it relies on our rejection of absurdity Our axioms are considered strongest when the negation is most absurdScientific reasoning is a bit different in scientific reasoning we come up with the simplest possible explanation then expand the field of testing as widely as possible In science we accept things tentatively and do our best to get them thrown out Each real test a theory passes strengthens it But again this is based on the rejection of absurdity and also on a more practical usabilityWhen it comes down to it the only two modes of reasoning that Ive seen make any sense rely on rejecting absurdityAnd if you dont reject absurdity there is no god because tomato is left brick,0,cdpmqjd,1rpqas,atheism,new,1.0,1

busterfixxitt,Ive encountered this too  For me this is simply a problem of logic at its most basic form AA  For the word know to have any meaning it must reflect reflect reality  You cannot know that   Youre simply wrong and your certainty to the contrary should not be considered knowingReligion and science are not  ways of knowing they are  ways of attaining certainty  Science simply has a better track record of its certainties reflecting reality,0,cdpp6e4,1rpqas,atheism,new,1.0,1

titscum,gtI considered one of the alternatives to be divine revelation or inspiration and am discounting it as useless because its not testableverifiable and indistinguishable from insanity or deceptionInterestingly though no epistemic system could ever escape from insanity or deception The fundamental problem many people on this subreddit seem to ignore when they profess themselves radical followers of scientific realism is that you have to assume as axiomatic the at least partial reliability of your own senses as well as the method of verification you derived from them Since sensory input is the only source of human knowledge it must also be the foundation of our techniques of natural deduction and verification Therefore no proof of soundness or completeness could ever be given with regard to the senses our very source of knowledge is inherently unreliable and any workaround to that fact eg Kants a priori knowledge instrumentalism pragmatism structuralism etc can only attempt to convince you through examples of its practical success not some sort of formal irrefutable proofThe fundamental subjectivity of our individual perception of reality prevents any absolute claim to knowledge So yes there are infinitely many other ways of knowing since it all depends on what your personal criteria are to label something a justified true belief,0,cdpu588,1rpqas,atheism,new,1.0,1
Canuckleball,I think what you may be looking for is proof by logical reasoning which is what the field of philosophy is concerned with While there is no physical evidence something can be determined by reasoning This Something is usually an intangible more abstract concept like morality but if it can be proved by logical evidence it can also be disproved by logical evidence So yes and no Physical evidence is not required but at the very least sound reasoning is ,0,cdpvtpb,1rpqas,atheism,new,1.0,1
Greghole,I would say the definition of the word evidence is the best reply  I assume the person who said this was talking about faith or God speaking to them or something like that  If those sorts of things were reliable ways of knowing what is true and what is false we would call them evidence  They arent reliable so we dont call them evidence,0,cdpvzvb,1rpqas,atheism,new,1.0,1

mverobeach,Read Becoming an Ex The Process of Role Exit by Helen Rose Fuchs Ebaugh Its about the phenomena of people who are deeply involved in some social role who then leave that role and their lives after theyve left are mainly defined by the fact that they are an ex The ex itself becomes a social role The author herself is an exnun and has a strong identity as an exnun and argues that the deeper the role the deeper their identity as an ex will be after theyve left that roleI think this is similar to the fact that the more religious a persons upbringing the more they have to rebel against and the more they define themselves as members of an atheist subculture Its an interesting observation that I think can be demonstrated as true ,0,cdpst1e,1rpu9l,atheism,new,1.0,1

DrClW,I believe you misunderstand a basic concept of atheism its not that we believe in something else its that we have chosen to not believe in any of the world religions because as humanity has developed slowly over the past couple hundred years and discovered the workings of the world we have found these absolute provable facts in front of us to be inconsistent from what was written in a book thousands of years ago leading us to question the origin of the writing and whether or not it is legitimate  Also the flying spaghetti monster theory is used by some atheists as an example of the amount of tangible evidence that exists surrounding gods most atheists dont actually believe in a flying spaghetti monsterTLDRAtheist is a term for someone who chooses not to believe there is no overarching belief  Flying spaghetti monster is a joke,0,cdppuyz,1rq2pi,atheism,new,3.0,3
Rixxali,Atheists dont believe in godsThats it Thats it about our beliefs As for your question I will answer not as an atheist since the question has nothing to do with my nonbelief in gods but as someone with a little bit of knowledge about scienceA theory in science means that the idea has a LOT of evidence and NO evidence that contradicts it A hypothesis is an idea that does NOT have a lot of evidence for it If evidence is gathered for the hypothesis it eventually becomes a theory if all evidence shows it to be correct However people usually use the word theory to mean any old guess or idea that explains something As you can see the word theory means two different thingsTherefore it is unfair to use the word theory in one sentence with two separate meanings Theory for scientists is NOT the same as theory in the common vernacular The Flying Spaghetti Monster is NOT a scientific theory At best its an unproven hypothesis Just like any other religion If scientists and mathematicians are looking for a grand unified theory it means that they have some reasonevidence to believe that it MIGHT exist And to determine whether it really exists or not they are doing experiments and such looking for evidenceComparing scientists who are experimenting and figuring out how reality works and trying to determine the truth of whether a certain concept exists or not is NOT the same as believing an idea with absolutely zero evidence that its true So no believing that a unified field theory may exist and looking for it  is NOT the same as believing in a supernatural being,0,cdpq05e,1rq2pi,atheism,new,3.0,3

berfner,It seems to me that you have lost your faith in the enterprise of Religion not in the innate understanding of something larger out there  When you look around at the world and universe it seems so completely improbable that this was all the happy accident of some big bang that we cannot explain  However this human understanding of something larger has been hijacked into religion for two purposes to control people and make money  Just because you dont have faith in religion should not stop your quest to come to an understanding with the universal question of what is the purpose of lifeThis is not a blackwhite issue either accept the doctrine of religion completely or accept that there is nothing  There are infinite alternatives between these two positions  ,2,cdpt1rz,1rqgkk,atheism,new,2.0,0

tomatojam,At the Catholic funerals Ive attended when the sacraments are brought up several importantsentimental items of the deceased are also brought up and laid by the casket  For instance my grandfather had this beautiful hand carved cane that was brought up with the sacraments Does your familys church do this If so maybe you can switch with someone to bring up a nonsacrament If not maybe theyll like the ideaI always thought this was nice because it brings the mass back to the person for whom the mass is being said ,0,cdpwmde,1rqkff,atheism,new,1.0,1
Brokenshatner,As several others have said funerals arent really the place to pick bones with family I say explain to the priest where you stand if you feel its that important Otherwise just ask him specifically whats expected of you then show up on time and perform Have you ever been in a wedding held in a church This is no different Sure youre there to console a grieving widow rather than fulfill the whims of a bride but essentially its the same Ask the priest where you should stand what you should wear and if you have any lines when you hand off the bread and grapejuice Even if your only line is Amen stand and deliverThe thought youre giving this shows that youre a person of conviction even if faith isnt really your thing If putting on this kind of act is more theatre than you care to engage in just let the priest know and Im sure they can find somebody else If you feel that doing so could alienate family though well if thats priority one youll just have to bite the bullet Im afraid Good luck though either way,0,cdpzw8n,1rqkff,atheism,new,1.0,1

Zimmer,Its always weird seeing how religious parents raise their children and the dynamics involved weird in the sense of I dont exactly know how I should feel about it  I can agree that the parent as in this situation is making an honorable decision that the child drew the picture However I still judge that parent for not accepting the same bullshit they feed their children  Sometimes I wonder how anyone will know if Jesus actually comes back again as some claim Ive seen a lot of dudes who look like Jesus and Ive seen a lot of media on guys who claim to be Jesus while also looking like Jesus The way God wants to test Christians faith that bum on the street claiming to be Jesus seems to correlate well of how it would actually happen I start to get really deep in thought about all of this and then I remember its all a hoax and go fap,0,cdpzdxu,1rqn1l,atheism,new,3.0,3
