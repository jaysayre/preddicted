gohomecatyouaredrunk,"If it's anything like every physician's office I have been to, she will just be added to the day's list, be promptly seen in the slot my appointment was for, will talk to the doctor for an hour+, and I will be stuck waiting in the waiting room now until after the doctor comes back from lunch. 

But that is my luck. 

Hopefully she gets an office with strict policies that will refuse to see her. 

Wait a week and call her back with some bad news. Tell her you are referring her to a specialist and ask her what time is good for her to have her appointment. Make sure to tell her you will arrange it and call her back with the details. 

Send her to a funeral home in the next town over. ",null,20,cdpu231,1rq1xi,pettyrevenge,top_day,126

RenaKunisaki,"If you really want to screw with someone in this sutation: put them on hold. Get another phone and call the doctor's office. Relay everything back and forth between the two, except schedule their appointment an hour or two earlier than they're asking for. They'll show up late to their appointment and have to either wait or rebook, and potentially be charged for it.

Or if you want to be a little less mean, schedule it an hour later than they're asking, so they get to spend extra time waiting.

You can do this even if the doctor is the one choosing the time; just continue relaying everything he says except changing the time.

Just be careful that one caller can't hear you talking to the other. Maybe mute the phone you're not talking into.",null,4,cdpvp0q,1rq1xi,pettyrevenge,top_day,22

COLISSAYING,My grandmothers phone number was one digit different then the supermarkets pharmacy number. for some reason the printed labels they put on the bottles the number always came out to look like my grandmothers. we had gotten our own prescriptions there as well and could see how people could make the mistake. she would get calls constantly asking to renew their prescriptions or ask questions. she was a nice old lady and would inform people that they had the wrong number and even give them the correct one. she would then call the pharmacy asking them to either check the ink or fix the label that the number on the bottle looked like hers not theirs. they should have had an 8 but it looked like a 3. they never did anything about it and we would get calls all day and night. finally i just started telling people their prescription would be ready in an hour. i guess they got a lot of complaints cause months later their label was totally different and the number was clear ,null,0,cdpze51,1rq1xi,pettyrevenge,top_day,7
