dadudemon,Seems like the petty revenge was coming from the store As clerk and not your father The clerk could tell it this way A mean man came into the store being extremely demanding and short with me we make headstones I was the only one working that day and I got another call The caller is grumpy and demanding as well The first grumpy guy then threatens to leave if I dont give him attention now or hell take his business elsewhere He doesnt know that the owner of the store next to us also owns this store and is my father So I said Yeah good luck with taking your business elsewhere So he left and went next door and bought a  headstoneYour story could be helped if you included what the clerk was talking about on the phone Was it personal or businessWhat if the call was about a bus  load of people that just died and he was negotiating a deal with an organization that was going to pay for ask their headstones The clerk could have handled the situation better obviously I just think I am missing something important for this story to click for me ,24,cdpoa48,1rpfe5,pettyrevenge,top_day,24,0
duzitickle,Thats actually a pretty shitty thing to do  It was thanksgiving night and that driver probably was on pizza delivery  or  seriously wanting to just go home and enjoy leftovers Something that could have been handled with a little compassion and the few steps to your fridge instead probably resulted in compounding an already stressful situation Shame on your brother May he one day be a delivery driver who is forced to work a holiday and have to deal with customers just like him,0,cdpn4qa,1rpmbh,pettyrevenge,top_day,2,2

gohomecatyouaredrunk,If its anything like every physicians office I have been to she will just be added to the days list be promptly seen in the slot my appointment was for will talk to the doctor for an hour and I will be stuck waiting in the waiting room now until after the doctor comes back from lunch But that is my luck Hopefully she gets an office with strict policies that will refuse to see her Wait a week and call her back with some bad news Tell her you are referring her to a specialist and ask her what time is good for her to have her appointment Make sure to tell her you will arrange it and call her back with the details Send her to a funeral home in the next town over ,20,cdpu231,1rq1xi,pettyrevenge,top_day,126,106

RenaKunisaki,If you really want to screw with someone in this sutation put them on hold Get another phone and call the doctors office Relay everything back and forth between the two except schedule their appointment an hour or two earlier than theyre asking for Theyll show up late to their appointment and have to either wait or rebook and potentially be charged for itOr if you want to be a little less mean schedule it an hour later than theyre asking so they get to spend extra time waitingYou can do this even if the doctor is the one choosing the time just continue relaying everything he says except changing the timeJust be careful that one caller cant hear you talking to the other Maybe mute the phone youre not talking into,4,cdpvp0q,1rq1xi,pettyrevenge,top_day,22,18

COLISSAYING,My grandmothers phone number was one digit different then the supermarkets pharmacy number for some reason the printed labels they put on the bottles the number always came out to look like my grandmothers we had gotten our own prescriptions there as well and could see how people could make the mistake she would get calls constantly asking to renew their prescriptions or ask questions she was a nice old lady and would inform people that they had the wrong number and even give them the correct one she would then call the pharmacy asking them to either check the ink or fix the label that the number on the bottle looked like hers not theirs they should have had an  but it looked like a  they never did anything about it and we would get calls all day and night finally i just started telling people their prescription would be ready in an hour i guess they got a lot of complaints cause months later their label was totally different and the number was clear ,0,cdpze51,1rq1xi,pettyrevenge,top_day,7,7
