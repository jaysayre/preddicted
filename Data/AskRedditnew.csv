PavelDatsyuk1,12,,1,1riufz,,0,"I'm living in a college town and there is a big rivalry football game coming up. I was super bored over the weekend and browsing around the gigs section of my local craigslist. I notice an odd title labeled, ""female model 18 and up for ______ Party."" I figured what the hell and clicked on it, out of boredom.

Basically, some guy put this ad out for a local girl to hang out with him during the day, go to a tailgate party with him, and crash in his hotel room that he is paying for. The guy has uploaded pictures of college-age girls, all sporting the university's logo. 

Here's the creepy part: the first few photos were pretty generic and could have been found anywhere on the internet. But then I recognize a few of the girls in the following pictures, some of them I knew personally and considered friends when we were in college. This guy has clearly taken these photos from Facebook and uploaded them on his ad. How creepy!

Should I flag his post on Craigslist? Not sure if it's illegal, but sure is creepy. Am I supposed to tell these girls personally on Facebook that some random ad is using their photo? Should I just reply to the ad and call the guy out for being a creeper? 

What should I do? Or should I do nothing?

RenderedCreed,7,,1,1rirdt,,1,"This has a story to it, I will sum it up at the end but it would help if you read the whole thing.
Ok, so it all started when my cousin went away to the USA, (don't remember where exactly, not important anyway). He went for school and was staying there for the duration of the semester. While he was staying there he was staying with a friend from the gym he worked at, lets call him Bill. 

Now this is where it starts to get weird and supernatural so if you despise ghost and stuff you can leave now but before he told me this stuff I didn't believe in ghosts either. I should note that my cousin does not use any drugs other than alcohol and neither him nor his room mate are sleep walkers, and he wouldn't bullshit this kind of stuff.

Anyways back to the story. Bill is letting my cousin stay in his house and my cousin starts noticing some weird things, like stuff being moved. But the strangest thing was that the bananas that got left out overnight would behalf eaten when they woke up. And not like a mouse nibbled these things half way up, just half gone peel and all, the other half just left sitting there. Now my cousin got to talking with his room mate and he just dismisses it as mice or something similar. The strangest thing to happen to him was he woke up in the middle of the night there was someone standing in his room, it was completely dark so he only saw the outline, when he sat up it ran off down the hall, when he followed it it was gone. Thinking that it was Bill he went to his room to find him fast asleep and took him a fair bit to wake him. He decided to talk to him about it when they got back the next day. But when he got talking to another of Bill's friends he was told to say nothing. When he asked why he was told that Bill's mother had died a few years ago, and told him about Bill's last girlfriend, who was sitting in his living room watching tv or something, while she was doing that a woman walked in and told her to tell Bill something (which I can't recall). When Bill came back he found her crying, (she new his mother was dead and that the woman who came in was his mother or her twin sister, which she didn't have) when she told Bill that this woman came in he flipped shit, broke up with her and kicked her out. All over her seeing his dead mother(which was probably the right thing to do if you don't believe in ghosts). The other thing my cousin learned from Bill's friend was that he favourite fruit was bananas, which were still being half eaten in the night. He can't move out cause he can't afford to live anywhere else at the moment.

SO basically what I'm asking is how does someone deal with that situation? Talk to your friend about the haunting or deal with it cause you have no where else to live?

Hey everyone
I am 27 years old.  I have been reading some philosophy books, religious books, futurist books, and reading about what it means to be a part of the different parties in the American system, as well as other systems of government. And now I have come to a crossroads. I relaize that much of what I believe is sprinkled throughout a bit of everything which makes me even more confused.  My family calls me a ""liberal"" but I have ""conservative"" views. I don't just like an individual because he or she is a ""liberal"" and I'm not even sure terms I'm using like ""liberal"" or ""conservative"" or ""socialist"" ir whatever else identifies me at all. So what do you all believe? Ill throw a couple on the table. (Just a note. These beliefs I'm throwing down are from an ideal view. I don't know if I support obame care. I'm not here to ague whether guns kills people or people kill people....etc, etx )

This may all seem very well ""liberal."" Maybe some of you have a label for me. But ive found things i don't like in just about everything. So I cant whole heartedly commit to one ""label"" can any of us?

1. I believe in the right to bare arms.
2. I beleieve in free healthcare
3. I believe in human rights
4. I believe that we need to transcend the current way we view capitalism.
5. I believe in gay marriage
6. I believe that the people should be the voice of the world, not elected officials who may not have or best interests in mind.
7. I beleieve technology and the Internet could save humanity from itself
8. I believe that leading by example as a society is the only way to make change.

Below are my personal beliefs and I would like to know anybody else's:
I dont believe In a literal concept of a tyrannical hierarchy that rules the cosmos and grants individual beings salvation when they pass into the after life. I believe &amp; support the basic moral &amp; foundational principles that the christ stood &amp; died for. Now did he actually walk the earth historically, who knows. Its about the lessons that were taught and if you have enough moral dignity to follow such simple principles and become a better human being. Im not saying one has to follow those exact principles, the 10 commandments, but what other set of life guiding ideologys pose a better way of life in the aspect of morality? Dont kill, steal, all that. I havent read a more ancient document that proposes anything better. Although I do find much good in other 'holy texts' such as the gitas or the dao de jing I implement their teachings into my life as well. For me, like It should be in my humble opinion with everybody else. Stop fighting over when or what happened and why It happened and create these pseudo religious wars and hatred. Take from what the books preach and learn something of moral value. Who cares if the christ went into rome in 1964, or whatever year you wish to argue over.

Same goes if we help someone out, we know it's some thing good to do because that person is going to have a smile, and we naturally feel better when we help people out.

If you find yourself on a bridge and strong gusts of wind are constantly blowing from one direction, let's say they're over 100+ mph...what are the chances of you getting blown off?

I'm being serious. All the damages winds do to property, is there a way to ""calculate"" how strong a wind your car could endure before getting flipped over?

I also ask this question because few years ago I drove over a bridge that was under heavy blows of wind but it was not closed to traffic...I was in a bus and when we got to the middle of the bridge, the wind pushed the bus on the left side of the road and the bus driver couldn't steer the bus back on the right side for 300 ft...but thankfully nobody was on that side of the road at that moment...

thefoxsay,5,,3,1rielj,,0,"In high school, my Home Ec. teacher was blind in one eye and deaf in the opposite ear. She was messed with each and every day. Most things were harmless..I guess.

We had a BBQ day and two people in my group were in ISS and one skipped school. It was just me and one other person. My task was the macaroni salad.

The recipe read:
...
Mayonaise - 1/2 cup for taste salt and peper

There was no punctuation between the the 1/2 cup for taste and salt and pepper. I mixed in a half cup of salt and pepper knowing that she will taste anything if you ask. The Salad turned black from the pepper.

I asked her what was wrong. She tasted it and her face went twisted. She looked at me as her eyes began to tear up a little. she said, ""what did you do?"" I responded with, ""I followed the recipe.""

I pointed out the most recent step I followed (the salt and pepper portion). Playing dumb, I said, ""Oooh! I see where I messed up! This is written incorrectly."" She said, ""Dang, I will go fix that.""

Here is one I witnessed and semi took part in.

Everyday the first kid (let's call him Luke) in the class would walk in while the teacher waited out in hall to monitor the students.
Luke took almost every chair and put them on top of the fridges in the class room. There are six fridges. When the teacher would enter the room she would find over half of the class standing. 

This went on for about two weeks. Finally she had enough and stormed out. we figured she was going to the Principals office. We were correct.

Immediately after she left we grabbed the chairs down and all sat quietly. When she returned with the principal, he just stood there, said nothing, and left.",What is your funniest thing you have done/or witnessed being done to a teacher?,2,AskReddit
