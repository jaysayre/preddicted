SexxSyrup,206,,252,1rhoin,,712,"**Context:** Happened last week. I teach English abroad and this had been a topic of conversation in a hostel dorm room for several people.

I checked into a hostel, got up to my dorm, and quickly introduced to myself to the other 2 people in the room, lets call them Mary and Sue. Mary was a nice girl from Germany who got to chatting with me. I said hello to Sue, but she pretended not to hear me.

*fast forward*

I start noticing some strange things about Sue: She lit a candle and blew it out again and again. When we finally fall asleep, she starts having night terrors, screaming things like ""DON'T TOUCH ME, GET AWAY FROM ME, NO NO NO,!"" The next morning, Mary tells me that Sue had been crying the whole day before. I start to think she had gone through some abuse recently.

*fast forward*

We're all in the room, she starts to cry again, and I asked, ""Are you okay?"" with no response. I said it again, and oh boy did I make a mistake. She went into this rant about how all English teachers do is rape their children, rape their students, rob their host countries, and neglect to learn the culture or language. She continued to say that if I would like to speak to her, I should speak to her in her native tongue, Finnish (ignoring the irony of conveying this message in perfect English). I was told to stop bullying her, that I denied her the right to lay in her bed, that I couldn't possibly have anything valuable to retort because I'm English (I'm American).

That night, I feared for my life.

**TL;DR:** Asked a girl if she was okay and got called a child rapist.

suppermick,18,,8,1rgvds,,61,"So my good friend is having a small get together at a directors house for her birthday. For context she just turned 21 and this is a director from a theater she interned at, so he's around 40. Super nice house. I agreed to be her DD so she could have her fun. I'm sipping on my only beer, completely sober, and just shooting the shit with everyone. I'm leaning in the doorway, stand up to readjust my weight, and go to lean back on the doorway. 

Except I lean on a top heavy shelf that's completely unsecured.....

The whole shelf starts to tip over. Luckily I had quick reflexes and was able to catch the shelf before it fell over completely, but it wasn't fast enough to keep ALL of his fancy martini glasses and fancy alcohol bottles from sliding off and shattering on the floor (including a random plant). The room falls into dead silence. Everybody stares at the dirt and glass on the floor and nobody knows what to do. Finally somebody gains control and starts cleaning everything up. The director is dead quiet, goes into the other room, and yells ""my GRANDMOTHER gave me those glasses!"" I'm absolutely horrified. I help clean everything up and offer to pay for whatever needs to be replaced. 

I sit down on the couch, mortified. I really want to bail the fuck out and come back later. However I was the birthday girls only ride and she wasn't ready to leave yet. She walks over to the director and gives him a hug, and I hear the tears in his voice. Muffled sobs into the girls shoulder is the only audible noise in the whole house. I stare at the only other person who had just arrived in time for my catastrophe and she gives me a ""don't worry we all fuck up"" look. The birthday girl then decides she wants to watch two fucking episodes of Dr. Who, and all the while the director is in his room, most likely crying, and doesn't come out for the rest of the night. 

When I finally get to leave and drive this girl home, he comes out, shakes my hand, and says ""Thanks for coming""

ecstatic1,11,,3,1rhz0q,,25,"Little bit of back story:

Girl and I have been friends for going on 4 years now. We've really dragged each other through some shit over that time, failed relationships, a mutual friend's divorce, problems with school and work and life, etc. She's always been there for me when I needed someone to listen, and I've always tried to help her through whatever problems crop up in her life.

Me? I'm a habitual fuck-up when it comes to anything involving emotions or expressing myself, and I tend to repress feelings of frustration and aggression. I think it's a coping mechanism for when I don't feel like I've got control of my life, like I choose not to feel instead of actually confronting the thing that's causing me to feel that way. She's the kind of girl that wears her heart on her sleeve, essentially, and that's a very endearing quality to me because it helps me associate with my own emotions. It's been very helpful over the past 7 or 8 months since I've moved across the country to start a new job. It's lonely here and my friends back home, her especially, have been so supportive and helpful.

Anyway, that bit is important because for about a year now I've been trying to convince myself that I'm not romantically interested in Girl, despite the fact that I've caught myself looking at her in a way that I typically reserve for lovers. And we have fooled around in the past so I didn't think much about it (just hormones, etc.). Last time I was in town (October) we ended up having sex, after which she drove me to the airport and we said our goodbyes. Neither one of us has really mentioned the event, but I've been thinking about her more and more over the past month as I've been helping her deal with school related problems. 

So last night:

I came back from my evening run feeling the worse for wear. I'm trying to train up for a 15k back home this coming Saturday that Girl has asked me to run with her. Fuck me I'm not a runner! But she's worth the effort so here I am pushing myself through cold and rain. Well, I get home and I text her that I want to Facetime and talk a bit. She replies back that she's got a meeting real soon and she can't, but she really wants to talk to me because she's stressed and also that *she wants to tell me about this* **new guy** *she met*. What? Fuck? I thought I had more time!

I was planning on telling her how I felt this weekend, and I think I panicked a little. She caught on that something was amiss and called me up. So there I am, heart pounding, legs tight and fingers numb, looking into the face of a girl who doesn't know the train wreck that's about to crash into her from a thousand miles away.

I play it cool. ""So, I've got a problem I think you can help me out with."" ""Ok, I'll try,"" she says to me with a look on her face like she has more pressing concerns on her mind. And I could tell she wasn't expecting anything, which just made it harder. But I'm already in this far, can't back out now. I go on to tell her that there's this girl I like and I don't know how to tell her how I feel. We go back and forth on some questions, and she figures out pretty quickly that I'm being a coy motherfucker and calls me out. 

""Is it me...?"" Lump in my throat. ""...Maybe?"" *Wry smile and puppy dog eyes*. Silence. Silence grows into awkward pause. Then the next 5 minutes is her looking like she's recovering from a car crash and me desperately trying to explain that I can't help how I feel. ""Maybe I'm just being an idiot,"" I say. ""I didn't want to tell you like this, but I can't help how I feel and I wanted you to know."" And she's obviously distraught, and our conversation keeps getting interrupted as her sister enters and exits her room so the awkwardness only exasperates. Finally I just go and say, ""I can't help the way I feel. *I love you and I can't change that.*"" She looks like a deer in headlights. ""I have to go to my meeting, I'm really sorry I don't know what to say right now..."" Boom. Done. Conversation ends.

And here I am today, wearing my dunce hat and feeling like a total selfish asshole. I've fucked up a lot in my life, Reddit. But last night, I think, was my crowning glory. Please induct me into the Hall of Fucked.

QWOP_Expert,5,,3,1rg5mn,,13,"A little backstory: I am living in this tiny apartment for a while, and because it is so small the only available space for my PC-tower is a space behind my desk. In order for the cables to reach my tower had to be facing away from me. 

Fast forward to today. I am copying about 300GB of data (pictures and stuff mostly) from one drive to another, when I accidentally hit the power switch for my PC with my foot. After powering  back up I notice 2 of my drives are missing from the system overview (2x2TB WD green drives, both of which were pretty full). After a lot of work I have managed to recover about 600GB from one of the drives. Still haven't gotten anything good off of the other one yet, although I am still working on it using Recuva and TestDisk.

tokewithnick,6,,3,1ribv3,,6,"Well I had the bright idea to not use the bathroom at work and wait till I got to my aunt's store. All the stores around share one bathroom which is for employees only, but I use it anyways. It's really small, I can actually sit on the toilet and wash my hands on the sink at the same time just to give you an idea. Well there I was, sitting on the toilet going colon bowlin' when suddenly I remembered that the plumbing for this toilet is really bad which forces me to flush at least 4 times before the water is clear. So after I was done doing my thing I bend over to turn the little red valve under to the toilet to get some more water pressure but as I was going down I hear someone turning the door knob... The door opens and this girl is just standing there trying to make sense of what's going on. My pants were down and my elongated white ass was facing her. I can only imagine what she saw from the face she made. I could feel her staring directly at the dark hairy abyss that is my rectum.

SP1993,0,,2,1rgzxn,,4,"Im currently a third year in college and the last time I wrote an essay since my first year.  I've always been pretty terrible at writing and reading in general which is why I am a science major (to this day I question how I was admitted into any school).  The reason I suck at writing analytical essays is because I can't analyze text its that simple.  I take everything very literal and don't question anything.  

My paper was only 800 words so its basically not even a college paper.  The same week it was due I had 3 very difficult midterms for my major so I went to my ta and told her how difficult of a week id been having.  I told her I sucked at writing and was very illiterate (I meant literal), she immediately began laughing and I didn't know why.  I explained how I sucked at analyzing stuff and she just kept laughing.  As I was walking out she asked what my major, I said BioPsych and she then said, ""That explains everything!""  

I then went home really confused as to why she had laughed and told my roommates I had said to her that I suck at reading context clues and said I was illiterate, then began laughing and told me that I had basically told her I couldn't read instead of saying literal. 

I almost wanted to send her email and apologize for being half stupid but I couldn't get myself to do it.

I grabbed a cup from the counter and started scooping water out of the toilet and into the sink. After a couple minutes of that when the sink was full too, I realized the fucking sink was clogged also! So I started pouring it into the shower. Once the water stopped flowing and I scooped out enough water so that it wouldn't overflow, I took a bunch of toilet paper to try and clean up the flooded floor. After a few minutes of wiping I realized I couldn't even flush the soaked toilet paper down the toilet... So I had this nasty pile of soaking toilet paper sitting on the floor. So now the sink is full. The toilet is clogged. The shower is all wet. The floor is flooded. And there's a bunch of wet toilet paper on the floor.

So I get out my notebook, look at the board, and see the homework. I decide to start. I am in the back of the classroom; hard to get to. So whenever they came around, I just covered it with the graph paper. I was doing **NONE** of the classwork, just the homework.

So at the end of the class, the teacher says:

*""Every year, someone feels they are just, just too smart for my class.""*

My cheeks redden...

*""So they do the homework during class. This upsets me...""*

I am jumping in my seat.

*""Emily, this year, has decided to be that person.""*

I am relieved as he takes her paper from her. Now she has to do it herself. But then I remember! *I get time to finish my homework in class!* Not enough to do all of it, but what would the teacher say? *""Done already?""*

So, from there I went on auto-pilot. I said:

""Mr. Doe (real name secret), [pause] I must confess. I did just that.""

So he gets up, takes my paper, and tells me:

*""wessles, you were honest, so I will take your paper, but also award you with a 'doing the right thing' award""*

The 'doing the right thing' award, is when they call you out on being a good person. So, at that point, completely forgetting why I told him, I get out a piece of paper, and do my homework again. I finish, class is over (no homwork free-time), and I get my paper back, surprisingly.) 

*""I'll give you it back. You did the right thing. Thanks wessles!""*

I go on to tell her that there's this girl I like and I don't know how to tell her how I feel. We go back and forth on some questions, and she figures out pretty quickly that I'm being a coy motherfucker and calls me out. 

""Is it me...?"" Lump in my throat. ""...Maybe?"" *Wry smile and puppy dog eyes*. Silence. Silence grows into awkward pause. Then the next 5 minutes is her looking like she's recovering from a car crash and me desperately trying to explain that I can't help how I feel. ""Maybe I'm just being an idiot,"" I say. ""I didn't want to tell you like this, but I can't help how I feel and I wanted you to know."" And she's obviously distraught, and our conversation keeps getting interrupted as her sister enters and exits her room so the awkwardness only exasperates.

I've always been pretty terrible at writing and reading in general which is why I am a science major (to this day I question how I was admitted into any school).  The reason I suck at writing analytical essays is because I can't analyze text its that simple.  I take everything very literal and don't question anything.  

My paper was only 800 words so its basically not even a college paper.  The same week it was due I had 3 very difficult midterms for my major so I went to my ta and told her how difficult of a week id been having.  I told her I sucked at writing and was very illiterate (I meant literal), she immediately began laughing and I didn't know why.  I explained how I sucked at analyzing stuff and she just kept laughing.  As I was walking out she asked what my major, I said BioPsych and she then said, ""That explains everything!""  

I then went home really confused as to why she had laughed and told my roommates I had said to her that I suck at reading context clues and said I was illiterate, then began laughing and told me that I had basically told her I couldn't read instead of saying literal.

I grabbed a cup from the counter and started scooping water out of the toilet and into the sink. After a couple minutes of that when the sink was full too, I realized the fucking sink was clogged also! So I started pouring it into the shower. Once the water stopped flowing and I scooped out enough water so that it wouldn't overflow, I took a bunch of toilet paper to try and clean up the flooded floor. After a few minutes of wiping I realized I couldn't even flush the soaked toilet paper down the toilet... So I had this nasty pile of soaking toilet paper sitting on the floor. So now the sink is full. The toilet is clogged. The shower is all wet. The floor is flooded. And there's a bunch of wet toilet paper on the floor.

wessles,4,,6,1rgwyv,,0,"So, I was in class, and was bored. I know all about this stuffs!

So I get out my notebook, look at the board, and see the homework. I decide to start. I am in the back of the classroom; hard to get to. So whenever they came around, I just covered it with the graph paper. I was doing **NONE** of the classwork, just the homework.

So at the end of the class, the teacher says:

*""Every year, someone feels they are just, just too smart for my class.""*

My cheeks redden...

*""So they do the homework during class. This upsets me...""*

I am jumping in my seat.

*""Emily, this year, has decided to be that person.""*

I am relieved as he takes her paper from her. Now she has to do it herself. But then I remember! *I get time to finish my homework in class!* Not enough to do all of it, but what would the teacher say? *""Done already?""*

So, from there I went on auto-pilot. I said:

""Mr. Doe (real name secret), [pause] I must confess. I did just that.""

So he gets up, takes my paper, and tells me:

*""wessles, you were honest, so I will take your paper, but also award you with a 'doing the right thing' award""*

The 'doing the right thing' award, is when they call you out on being a good person. So, at that point, completely forgetting why I told him, I get out a piece of paper, and do my homework again. I finish, class is over (no homwork free-time), and I get my paper back, surprisingly.) 

*""I'll give you it back. You did the right thing. Thanks wessles!""*

So I am completely happy about what happened, but I realize:

**I just got awarded for being a jerk to the teacher, twice, once without him knowing it.**

I checked into a hostel, got up to my dorm, and quickly introduced to myself to the other 2 people in the room, lets call them Mary and Sue. Mary was a nice girl from Germany who got to chatting with me. I said hello to Sue, but she pretended not to hear me.

We're all in the room, she starts to cry again, and I asked, ""Are you okay?"" with no response. I said it again, and oh boy did I make a mistake. She went into this rant about how all English teachers do is rape their children, rape their students, rob their host countries, and neglect to learn the culture or language. She continued to say that if I would like to speak to her, I should speak to her in her native tongue, Finnish (ignoring the irony of conveying this message in perfect English).

For context she just turned 21 and this is a director from a theater she interned at, so he's around 40. Super nice house. I agreed to be her DD so she could have her fun. I'm sipping on my only beer, completely sober, and just shooting the shit with everyone. I'm leaning in the doorway, stand up to readjust my weight, and go to lean back on the doorway. 

Except I lean on a top heavy shelf that's completely unsecured.....

Luckily I had quick reflexes and was able to catch the shelf before it fell over completely, but it wasn't fast enough to keep ALL of his fancy martini glasses and fancy alcohol bottles from sliding off and shattering on the floor (including a random plant).

The director is dead quiet, goes into the other room, and yells ""my GRANDMOTHER gave me those glasses!"" I'm absolutely horrified. I help clean everything up and offer to pay for whatever needs to be replaced. 

I sit down on the couch, mortified. I really want to bail the fuck out and come back later. However I was the birthday girls only ride and she wasn't ready to leave yet. She walks over to the director and gives him a hug, and I hear the tears in his voice. Muffled sobs into the girls shoulder is the only audible noise in the whole house.

ecstatic1,11,,3,1rhz0q,,25,"Little bit of back story:

Girl and I have been friends for going on 4 years now. We've really dragged each other through some shit over that time, failed relationships, a mutual friend's divorce, problems with school and work and life, etc. She's always been there for me when I needed someone to listen, and I've always tried to help her through whatever problems crop up in her life.

Me? I'm a habitual fuck-up when it comes to anything involving emotions or expressing myself, and I tend to repress feelings of frustration and aggression. I think it's a coping mechanism for when I don't feel like I've got control of my life, like I choose not to feel instead of actually confronting the thing that's causing me to feel that way. She's the kind of girl that wears her heart on her sleeve, essentially, and that's a very endearing quality to me because it helps me associate with my own emotions. It's been very helpful over the past 7 or 8 months since I've moved across the country to start a new job. It's lonely here and my friends back home, her especially, have been so supportive and helpful.

Anyway, that bit is important because for about a year now I've been trying to convince myself that I'm not romantically interested in Girl, despite the fact that I've caught myself looking at her in a way that I typically reserve for lovers. And we have fooled around in the past so I didn't think much about it (just hormones, etc.). Last time I was in town (October) we ended up having sex, after which she drove me to the airport and we said our goodbyes. Neither one of us has really mentioned the event, but I've been thinking about her more and more over the past month as I've been helping her deal with school related problems. 

So last night:

I came back from my evening run feeling the worse for wear. I'm trying to train up for a 15k back home this coming Saturday that Girl has asked me to run with her. Fuck me I'm not a runner! But she's worth the effort so here I am pushing myself through cold and rain. Well, I get home and I text her that I want to Facetime and talk a bit. She replies back that she's got a meeting real soon and she can't, but she really wants to talk to me because she's stressed and also that *she wants to tell me about this* **new guy** *she met*. What? Fuck? I thought I had more time!

I was planning on telling her how I felt this weekend, and I think I panicked a little. She caught on that something was amiss and called me up. So there I am, heart pounding, legs tight and fingers numb, looking into the face of a girl who doesn't know the train wreck that's about to crash into her from a thousand miles away.

*""wessles, you were honest, so I will take your paper, but also award you with a 'doing the right thing' award""*

SexxSyrup,207,,254,1rhoin,,712,"**Context:** Happened last week. I teach English abroad and this had been a topic of conversation in a hostel dorm room for several people.

I checked into a hostel, got up to my dorm, and quickly introduced to myself to the other 2 people in the room, lets call them Mary and Sue. Mary was a nice girl from Germany who got to chatting with me. I said hello to Sue, but she pretended not to hear me.

*fast forward*

I start noticing some strange things about Sue: She lit a candle and blew it out again and again. When we finally fall asleep, she starts having night terrors, screaming things like ""DON'T TOUCH ME, GET AWAY FROM ME, NO NO NO,!"" The next morning, Mary tells me that Sue had been crying the whole day before. I start to think she had gone through some abuse recently.

*fast forward*

We're all in the room, she starts to cry again, and I asked, ""Are you okay?"" with no response. I said it again, and oh boy did I make a mistake. She went into this rant about how all English teachers do is rape their children, rape their students, rob their host countries, and neglect to learn the culture or language. She continued to say that if I would like to speak to her, I should speak to her in her native tongue, Finnish (ignoring the irony of conveying this message in perfect English). I was told to stop bullying her, that I denied her the right to lay in her bed, that I couldn't possibly have anything valuable to retort because I'm English (I'm American).

suppermick,18,,12,1rgvds,,59,"So my good friend is having a small get together at a directors house for her birthday. For context she just turned 21 and this is a director from a theater she interned at, so he's around 40. Super nice house. I agreed to be her DD so she could have her fun. I'm sipping on my only beer, completely sober, and just shooting the shit with everyone. I'm leaning in the doorway, stand up to readjust my weight, and go to lean back on the doorway. 

Except I lean on a top heavy shelf that's completely unsecured.....

The whole shelf starts to tip over. Luckily I had quick reflexes and was able to catch the shelf before it fell over completely, but it wasn't fast enough to keep ALL of his fancy martini glasses and fancy alcohol bottles from sliding off and shattering on the floor (including a random plant). The room falls into dead silence. Everybody stares at the dirt and glass on the floor and nobody knows what to do. Finally somebody gains control and starts cleaning everything up. The director is dead quiet, goes into the other room, and yells ""my GRANDMOTHER gave me those glasses!"" I'm absolutely horrified. I help clean everything up and offer to pay for whatever needs to be replaced. 

I sit down on the couch, mortified. I really want to bail the fuck out and come back later. However I was the birthday girls only ride and she wasn't ready to leave yet. She walks over to the director and gives him a hug, and I hear the tears in his voice. Muffled sobs into the girls shoulder is the only audible noise in the whole house. I stare at the only other person who had just arrived in time for my catastrophe and she gives me a ""don't worry we all fuck up"" look. The birthday girl then decides she wants to watch two fucking episodes of Dr. Who, and all the while the director is in his room, most likely crying, and doesn't come out for the rest of the night.

ecstatic1,11,,3,1rhz0q,,25,"Little bit of back story:

Girl and I have been friends for going on 4 years now. We've really dragged each other through some shit over that time, failed relationships, a mutual friend's divorce, problems with school and work and life, etc. She's always been there for me when I needed someone to listen, and I've always tried to help her through whatever problems crop up in her life.

Me? I'm a habitual fuck-up when it comes to anything involving emotions or expressing myself, and I tend to repress feelings of frustration and aggression. I think it's a coping mechanism for when I don't feel like I've got control of my life, like I choose not to feel instead of actually confronting the thing that's causing me to feel that way. She's the kind of girl that wears her heart on her sleeve, essentially, and that's a very endearing quality to me because it helps me associate with my own emotions. It's been very helpful over the past 7 or 8 months since I've moved across the country to start a new job. It's lonely here and my friends back home, her especially, have been so supportive and helpful.

Anyway, that bit is important because for about a year now I've been trying to convince myself that I'm not romantically interested in Girl, despite the fact that I've caught myself looking at her in a way that I typically reserve for lovers. And we have fooled around in the past so I didn't think much about it (just hormones, etc.). Last time I was in town (October) we ended up having sex, after which she drove me to the airport and we said our goodbyes. Neither one of us has really mentioned the event, but I've been thinking about her more and more over the past month as I've been helping her deal with school related problems. 

So last night:

I came back from my evening run feeling the worse for wear. I'm trying to train up for a 15k back home this coming Saturday that Girl has asked me to run with her. Fuck me I'm not a runner! But she's worth the effort so here I am pushing myself through cold and rain. Well, I get home and I text her that I want to Facetime and talk a bit. She replies back that she's got a meeting real soon and she can't, but she really wants to talk to me because she's stressed and also that *she wants to tell me about this* **new guy** *she met*. What? Fuck? I thought I had more time!

I was planning on telling her how I felt this weekend, and I think I panicked a little. She caught on that something was amiss and called me up. So there I am, heart pounding, legs tight and fingers numb, looking into the face of a girl who doesn't know the train wreck that's about to crash into her from a thousand miles away.

I play it cool. ""So, I've got a problem I think you can help me out with."" ""Ok, I'll try,"" she says to me with a look on her face like she has more pressing concerns on her mind. And I could tell she wasn't expecting anything, which just made it harder. But I'm already in this far, can't back out now. I go on to tell her that there's this girl I like and I don't know how to tell her how I feel. We go back and forth on some questions, and she figures out pretty quickly that I'm being a coy motherfucker and calls me out. 

""Is it me...?"" Lump in my throat. ""...Maybe?"" *Wry smile and puppy dog eyes*. Silence. Silence grows into awkward pause. Then the next 5 minutes is her looking like she's recovering from a car crash and me desperately trying to explain that I can't help how I feel. ""Maybe I'm just being an idiot,"" I say. ""I didn't want to tell you like this, but I can't help how I feel and I wanted you to know."" And she's obviously distraught, and our conversation keeps getting interrupted as her sister enters and exits her room so the awkwardness only exasperates. Finally I just go and say, ""I can't help the way I feel. *I love you and I can't change that.*"" She looks like a deer in headlights. ""I have to go to my meeting, I'm really sorry I don't know what to say right now..."" Boom. Done. Conversation ends.

And here I am today, wearing my dunce hat and feeling like a total selfish asshole. I've fucked up a lot in my life, Reddit. But last night, I think, was my crowning glory. Please induct me into the Hall of Fucked.

suppermick,18,,12,1rgvds,,59,"So my good friend is having a small get together at a directors house for her birthday. For context she just turned 21 and this is a director from a theater she interned at, so he's around 40. Super nice house. I agreed to be her DD so she could have her fun. I'm sipping on my only beer, completely sober, and just shooting the shit with everyone. I'm leaning in the doorway, stand up to readjust my weight, and go to lean back on the doorway.

I help clean everything up and offer to pay for whatever needs to be replaced. 

I sit down on the couch, mortified. I really want to bail the fuck out and come back later. However I was the birthday girls only ride and she wasn't ready to leave yet.

ecstatic1,11,,3,1rhz0q,,25,"Little bit of back story:

Girl and I have been friends for going on 4 years now. We've really dragged each other through some shit over that time, failed relationships, a mutual friend's divorce, problems with school and work and life, etc. She's always been there for me when I needed someone to listen, and I've always tried to help her through whatever problems crop up in her life.

Me? I'm a habitual fuck-up when it comes to anything involving emotions or expressing myself, and I tend to repress feelings of frustration and aggression. I think it's a coping mechanism for when I don't feel like I've got control of my life, like I choose not to feel instead of actually confronting the thing that's causing me to feel that way. She's the kind of girl that wears her heart on her sleeve, essentially, and that's a very endearing quality to me because it helps me associate with my own emotions. It's been very helpful over the past 7 or 8 months since I've moved across the country to start a new job. It's lonely here and my friends back home, her especially, have been so supportive and helpful.

Anyway, that bit is important because for about a year now I've been trying to convince myself that I'm not romantically interested in Girl, despite the fact that I've caught myself looking at her in a way that I typically reserve for lovers. And we have fooled around in the past so I didn't think much about it (just hormones, etc.). Last time I was in town (October) we ended up having sex, after which she drove me to the airport and we said our goodbyes. Neither one of us has really mentioned the event, but I've been thinking about her more and more over the past month as I've been helping her deal with school related problems. 

So last night:

I came back from my evening run feeling the worse for wear. I'm trying to train up for a 15k back home this coming Saturday that Girl has asked me to run with her. Fuck me I'm not a runner! But she's worth the effort so here I am pushing myself through cold and rain. Well, I get home and I text her that I want to Facetime and talk a bit. She replies back that she's got a meeting real soon and she can't, but she really wants to talk to me because she's stressed and also that *she wants to tell me about this* **new guy** *she met*. What? Fuck? I thought I had more time!

I was planning on telling her how I felt this weekend, and I think I panicked a little. She caught on that something was amiss and called me up. So there I am, heart pounding, legs tight and fingers numb, looking into the face of a girl who doesn't know the train wreck that's about to crash into her from a thousand miles away.

I play it cool. ""So, I've got a problem I think you can help me out with."" ""Ok, I'll try,"" she says to me with a look on her face like she has more pressing concerns on her mind. And I could tell she wasn't expecting anything, which just made it harder. But I'm already in this far, can't back out now. I go on to tell her that there's this girl I like and I don't know how to tell her how I feel. We go back and forth on some questions, and she figures out pretty quickly that I'm being a coy motherfucker and calls me out. 

""Is it me...?"" Lump in my throat. ""...Maybe?"" *Wry smile and puppy dog eyes*. Silence. Silence grows into awkward pause. Then the next 5 minutes is her looking like she's recovering from a car crash and me desperately trying to explain that I can't help how I feel. ""Maybe I'm just being an idiot,"" I say. ""I didn't want to tell you like this, but I can't help how I feel and I wanted you to know."" And she's obviously distraught, and our conversation keeps getting interrupted as her sister enters and exits her room so the awkwardness only exasperates. Finally I just go and say, ""I can't help the way I feel. *I love you and I can't change that.*"" She looks like a deer in headlights. ""I have to go to my meeting, I'm really sorry I don't know what to say right now..."" Boom. Done. Conversation ends.

And here I am today, wearing my dunce hat and feeling like a total selfish asshole. I've fucked up a lot in my life, Reddit. But last night, I think, was my crowning glory. Please induct me into the Hall of Fucked.

I then went home really confused as to why she had laughed and told my roommates I had said to her that I suck at reading context clues and said I was illiterate, then began laughing and told me that I had basically told her I couldn't read instead of saying literal.

I think it's a coping mechanism for when I don't feel like I've got control of my life, like I choose not to feel instead of actually confronting the thing that's causing me to feel that way. She's the kind of girl that wears her heart on her sleeve, essentially, and that's a very endearing quality to me because it helps me associate with my own emotions. It's been very helpful over the past 7 or 8 months since I've moved across the country to start a new job. It's lonely here and my friends back home, her especially, have been so supportive and helpful.

Anyway, that bit is important because for about a year now I've been trying to convince myself that I'm not romantically interested in Girl, despite the fact that I've caught myself looking at her in a way that I typically reserve for lovers. And we have fooled around in the past so I didn't think much about it (just hormones, etc.). Last time I was in town (October) we ended up having sex, after which she drove me to the airport and we said our goodbyes. Neither one of us has really mentioned the event, but I've been thinking about her more and more over the past month as I've been helping her deal with school related problems. 

So last night:

I came back from my evening run feeling the worse for wear. I'm trying to train up for a 15k back home this coming Saturday that Girl has asked me to run with her. Fuck me I'm not a runner! But she's worth the effort so here I am pushing myself through cold and rain. Well, I get home and I text her that I want to Facetime and talk a bit. She replies back that she's got a meeting real soon and she can't, but she really wants to talk to me because she's stressed and also that *she wants to tell me about this* **new guy** *she met*. What? Fuck? I thought I had more time!

I was planning on telling her how I felt this weekend, and I think I panicked a little. She caught on that something was amiss and called me up. So there I am, heart pounding, legs tight and fingers numb, looking into the face of a girl who doesn't know the train wreck that's about to crash into her from a thousand miles away.

I play it cool. ""So, I've got a problem I think you can help me out with."" ""Ok, I'll try,"" she says to me with a look on her face like she has more pressing concerns on her mind. And I could tell she wasn't expecting anything, which just made it harder. But I'm already in this far, can't back out now. I go on to tell her that there's this girl I like and I don't know how to tell her how I feel. We go back and forth on some questions, and she figures out pretty quickly that I'm being a coy motherfucker and calls me out. 

""Is it me...?"" Lump in my throat. ""...Maybe?"" *Wry smile and puppy dog eyes*. Silence. Silence grows into awkward pause. Then the next 5 minutes is her looking like she's recovering from a car crash and me desperately trying to explain that I can't help how I feel. ""Maybe I'm just being an idiot,"" I say. ""I didn't want to tell you like this, but I can't help how I feel and I wanted you to know."" And she's obviously distraught, and our conversation keeps getting interrupted as her sister enters and exits her room so the awkwardness only exasperates. Finally I just go and say, ""I can't help the way I feel. *I love you and I can't change that.*"" She looks like a deer in headlights. ""I have to go to my meeting, I'm really sorry I don't know what to say right now..."" Boom. Done. Conversation ends.

I've always been pretty terrible at writing and reading in general which is why I am a science major (to this day I question how I was admitted into any school).

My paper was only 800 words so its basically not even a college paper.  The same week it was due I had 3 very difficult midterms for my major so I went to my ta and told her how difficult of a week id been having.  I told her I sucked at writing and was very illiterate (I meant literal), she immediately began laughing and I didn't know why.  I explained how I sucked at analyzing stuff and she just kept laughing.  As I was walking out she asked what my major, I said BioPsych and she then said, ""That explains everything!""  

I then went home really confused as to why she had laughed and told my roommates I had said to her that I suck at reading context clues and said I was illiterate, then began laughing and told me that I had basically told her I couldn't read instead of saying literal.

I grabbed a cup from the counter and started scooping water out of the toilet and into the sink. After a couple minutes of that when the sink was full too, I realized the fucking sink was clogged also! So I started pouring it into the shower. Once the water stopped flowing and I scooped out enough water so that it wouldn't overflow, I took a bunch of toilet paper to try and clean up the flooded floor. After a few minutes of wiping I realized I couldn't even flush the soaked toilet paper down the toilet... So I had this nasty pile of soaking toilet paper sitting on the floor. So now the sink is full. The toilet is clogged. The shower is all wet. The floor is flooded. And there's a bunch of wet toilet paper on the floor.

So I get out my notebook, look at the board, and see the homework. I decide to start. I am in the back of the classroom; hard to get to. So whenever they came around, I just covered it with the graph paper. I was doing **NONE** of the classwork, just the homework.

So at the end of the class, the teacher says:

*""Every year, someone feels they are just, just too smart for my class.""*

My cheeks redden...

*""So they do the homework during class. This upsets me...""*

I am jumping in my seat.

*""Emily, this year, has decided to be that person.""*

I am relieved as he takes her paper from her. Now she has to do it herself. But then I remember! *I get time to finish my homework in class!* Not enough to do all of it, but what would the teacher say? *""Done already?""*

So, from there I went on auto-pilot. I said:

""Mr. Doe (real name secret), [pause] I must confess. I did just that.""

So he gets up, takes my paper, and tells me:

*""wessles, you were honest, so I will take your paper, but also award you with a 'doing the right thing' award""*

The 'doing the right thing' award, is when they call you out on being a good person. So, at that point, completely forgetting why I told him, I get out a piece of paper, and do my homework again. I finish, class is over (no homwork free-time), and I get my paper back, surprisingly.) 

*""I'll give you it back. You did the right thing. Thanks wessles!""*

I sit down on the couch, mortified. I really want to bail the fuck out and come back later. However I was the birthday girls only ride and she wasn't ready to leave yet.

wessles,4,,6,1rgwyv,,0,"So, I was in class, and was bored. I know all about this stuffs!

So I get out my notebook, look at the board, and see the homework. I decide to start. I am in the back of the classroom; hard to get to. So whenever they came around, I just covered it with the graph paper. I was doing **NONE** of the classwork, just the homework.

So at the end of the class, the teacher says:

*""Every year, someone feels they are just, just too smart for my class.""*

My cheeks redden...

*""So they do the homework during class. This upsets me...""*

I am jumping in my seat.

*""Emily, this year, has decided to be that person.""*

I am relieved as he takes her paper from her. Now she has to do it herself. But then I remember! *I get time to finish my homework in class!* Not enough to do all of it, but what would the teacher say? *""Done already?""*

So, from there I went on auto-pilot. I said:

""Mr. Doe (real name secret), [pause] I must confess. I did just that.""

So he gets up, takes my paper, and tells me:

*""wessles, you were honest, so I will take your paper, but also award you with a 'doing the right thing' award""*

The 'doing the right thing' award, is when they call you out on being a good person. So, at that point, completely forgetting why I told him, I get out a piece of paper, and do my homework again. I finish, class is over (no homwork free-time), and I get my paper back, surprisingly.) 

*""I'll give you it back. You did the right thing. Thanks wessles!""*

So I am completely happy about what happened, but I realize:

**I just got awarded for being a jerk to the teacher, twice, once without him knowing it.**

I am the biggest jerk in the world...

SexxSyrup,207,,254,1rhoin,,712,"**Context:** Happened last week. I teach English abroad and this had been a topic of conversation in a hostel dorm room for several people.

I checked into a hostel, got up to my dorm, and quickly introduced to myself to the other 2 people in the room, lets call them Mary and Sue. Mary was a nice girl from Germany who got to chatting with me. I said hello to Sue, but she pretended not to hear me.

*fast forward*

I start noticing some strange things about Sue: She lit a candle and blew it out again and again. When we finally fall asleep, she starts having night terrors, screaming things like ""DON'T TOUCH ME, GET AWAY FROM ME, NO NO NO,!"" The next morning, Mary tells me that Sue had been crying the whole day before. I start to think she had gone through some abuse recently.

*fast forward*

We're all in the room, she starts to cry again, and I asked, ""Are you okay?"" with no response. I said it again, and oh boy did I make a mistake. She went into this rant about how all English teachers do is rape their children, rape their students, rob their host countries, and neglect to learn the culture or language. She continued to say that if I would like to speak to her, I should speak to her in her native tongue, Finnish (ignoring the irony of conveying this message in perfect English). I was told to stop bullying her, that I denied her the right to lay in her bed, that I couldn't possibly have anything valuable to retort because I'm English (I'm American).

That night, I feared for my life.

suppermick,18,,12,1rgvds,,59,"So my good friend is having a small get together at a directors house for her birthday. For context she just turned 21 and this is a director from a theater she interned at, so he's around 40. Super nice house. I agreed to be her DD so she could have her fun. I'm sipping on my only beer, completely sober, and just shooting the shit with everyone. I'm leaning in the doorway, stand up to readjust my weight, and go to lean back on the doorway. 

Except I lean on a top heavy shelf that's completely unsecured.....

The whole shelf starts to tip over. Luckily I had quick reflexes and was able to catch the shelf before it fell over completely, but it wasn't fast enough to keep ALL of his fancy martini glasses and fancy alcohol bottles from sliding off and shattering on the floor (including a random plant). The room falls into dead silence. Everybody stares at the dirt and glass on the floor and nobody knows what to do. Finally somebody gains control and starts cleaning everything up. The director is dead quiet, goes into the other room, and yells ""my GRANDMOTHER gave me those glasses!"" I'm absolutely horrified. I help clean everything up and offer to pay for whatever needs to be replaced. 

I sit down on the couch, mortified. I really want to bail the fuck out and come back later. However I was the birthday girls only ride and she wasn't ready to leave yet. She walks over to the director and gives him a hug, and I hear the tears in his voice. Muffled sobs into the girls shoulder is the only audible noise in the whole house. I stare at the only other person who had just arrived in time for my catastrophe and she gives me a ""don't worry we all fuck up"" look. The birthday girl then decides she wants to watch two fucking episodes of Dr. Who, and all the while the director is in his room, most likely crying, and doesn't come out for the rest of the night. 

When I finally get to leave and drive this girl home, he comes out, shakes my hand, and says ""Thanks for coming""

ecstatic1,11,,3,1rhz0q,,25,"Little bit of back story:

Girl and I have been friends for going on 4 years now. We've really dragged each other through some shit over that time, failed relationships, a mutual friend's divorce, problems with school and work and life, etc. She's always been there for me when I needed someone to listen, and I've always tried to help her through whatever problems crop up in her life.

Me? I'm a habitual fuck-up when it comes to anything involving emotions or expressing myself, and I tend to repress feelings of frustration and aggression. I think it's a coping mechanism for when I don't feel like I've got control of my life, like I choose not to feel instead of actually confronting the thing that's causing me to feel that way. She's the kind of girl that wears her heart on her sleeve, essentially, and that's a very endearing quality to me because it helps me associate with my own emotions. It's been very helpful over the past 7 or 8 months since I've moved across the country to start a new job. It's lonely here and my friends back home, her especially, have been so supportive and helpful.

Anyway, that bit is important because for about a year now I've been trying to convince myself that I'm not romantically interested in Girl, despite the fact that I've caught myself looking at her in a way that I typically reserve for lovers. And we have fooled around in the past so I didn't think much about it (just hormones, etc.). Last time I was in town (October) we ended up having sex, after which she drove me to the airport and we said our goodbyes. Neither one of us has really mentioned the event, but I've been thinking about her more and more over the past month as I've been helping her deal with school related problems. 

So last night:

I came back from my evening run feeling the worse for wear. I'm trying to train up for a 15k back home this coming Saturday that Girl has asked me to run with her. Fuck me I'm not a runner! But she's worth the effort so here I am pushing myself through cold and rain. Well, I get home and I text her that I want to Facetime and talk a bit. She replies back that she's got a meeting real soon and she can't, but she really wants to talk to me because she's stressed and also that *she wants to tell me about this* **new guy** *she met*. What? Fuck? I thought I had more time!

I was planning on telling her how I felt this weekend, and I think I panicked a little. She caught on that something was amiss and called me up. So there I am, heart pounding, legs tight and fingers numb, looking into the face of a girl who doesn't know the train wreck that's about to crash into her from a thousand miles away.

I play it cool. ""So, I've got a problem I think you can help me out with."" ""Ok, I'll try,"" she says to me with a look on her face like she has more pressing concerns on her mind. And I could tell she wasn't expecting anything, which just made it harder. But I'm already in this far, can't back out now. I go on to tell her that there's this girl I like and I don't know how to tell her how I feel. We go back and forth on some questions, and she figures out pretty quickly that I'm being a coy motherfucker and calls me out. 

""Is it me...?"" Lump in my throat. ""...Maybe?"" *Wry smile and puppy dog eyes*. Silence. Silence grows into awkward pause. Then the next 5 minutes is her looking like she's recovering from a car crash and me desperately trying to explain that I can't help how I feel. ""Maybe I'm just being an idiot,"" I say. ""I didn't want to tell you like this, but I can't help how I feel and I wanted you to know."" And she's obviously distraught, and our conversation keeps getting interrupted as her sister enters and exits her room so the awkwardness only exasperates. Finally I just go and say, ""I can't help the way I feel. *I love you and I can't change that.*"" She looks like a deer in headlights. ""I have to go to my meeting, I'm really sorry I don't know what to say right now..."" Boom. Done. Conversation ends.

And here I am today, wearing my dunce hat and feeling like a total selfish asshole. I've fucked up a lot in my life, Reddit. But last night, I think, was my crowning glory. Please induct me into the Hall of Fucked.

suppermick,18,,12,1rgvds,,59,"So my good friend is having a small get together at a directors house for her birthday. For context she just turned 21 and this is a director from a theater she interned at, so he's around 40. Super nice house. I agreed to be her DD so she could have her fun. I'm sipping on my only beer, completely sober, and just shooting the shit with everyone. I'm leaning in the doorway, stand up to readjust my weight, and go to lean back on the doorway. 

Except I lean on a top heavy shelf that's completely unsecured.....

Luckily I had quick reflexes and was able to catch the shelf before it fell over completely, but it wasn't fast enough to keep ALL of his fancy martini glasses and fancy alcohol bottles from sliding off and shattering on the floor (including a random plant).

The director is dead quiet, goes into the other room, and yells ""my GRANDMOTHER gave me those glasses!"" I'm absolutely horrified. I help clean everything up and offer to pay for whatever needs to be replaced. 

I sit down on the couch, mortified. I really want to bail the fuck out and come back later. However I was the birthday girls only ride and she wasn't ready to leave yet. She walks over to the director and gives him a hug, and I hear the tears in his voice. Muffled sobs into the girls shoulder is the only audible noise in the whole house. I stare at the only other person who had just arrived in time for my catastrophe and she gives me a ""don't worry we all fuck up"" look.

ecstatic1,11,,3,1rhz0q,,25,"Little bit of back story:

Girl and I have been friends for going on 4 years now. We've really dragged each other through some shit over that time, failed relationships, a mutual friend's divorce, problems with school and work and life, etc. She's always been there for me when I needed someone to listen, and I've always tried to help her through whatever problems crop up in her life.

Me? I'm a habitual fuck-up when it comes to anything involving emotions or expressing myself, and I tend to repress feelings of frustration and aggression. I think it's a coping mechanism for when I don't feel like I've got control of my life, like I choose not to feel instead of actually confronting the thing that's causing me to feel that way. She's the kind of girl that wears her heart on her sleeve, essentially, and that's a very endearing quality to me because it helps me associate with my own emotions. It's been very helpful over the past 7 or 8 months since I've moved across the country to start a new job. It's lonely here and my friends back home, her especially, have been so supportive and helpful.

Anyway, that bit is important because for about a year now I've been trying to convince myself that I'm not romantically interested in Girl, despite the fact that I've caught myself looking at her in a way that I typically reserve for lovers. And we have fooled around in the past so I didn't think much about it (just hormones, etc.). Last time I was in town (October) we ended up having sex, after which she drove me to the airport and we said our goodbyes. Neither one of us has really mentioned the event, but I've been thinking about her more and more over the past month as I've been helping her deal with school related problems. 

So last night:

I came back from my evening run feeling the worse for wear. I'm trying to train up for a 15k back home this coming Saturday that Girl has asked me to run with her. Fuck me I'm not a runner! But she's worth the effort so here I am pushing myself through cold and rain. Well, I get home and I text her that I want to Facetime and talk a bit. She replies back that she's got a meeting real soon and she can't, but she really wants to talk to me because she's stressed and also that *she wants to tell me about this* **new guy** *she met*. What? Fuck? I thought I had more time!

I was planning on telling her how I felt this weekend, and I think I panicked a little. She caught on that something was amiss and called me up. So there I am, heart pounding, legs tight and fingers numb, looking into the face of a girl who doesn't know the train wreck that's about to crash into her from a thousand miles away.

I play it cool. ""So, I've got a problem I think you can help me out with."" ""Ok, I'll try,"" she says to me with a look on her face like she has more pressing concerns on her mind. And I could tell she wasn't expecting anything, which just made it harder. But I'm already in this far, can't back out now. I go on to tell her that there's this girl I like and I don't know how to tell her how I feel. We go back and forth on some questions, and she figures out pretty quickly that I'm being a coy motherfucker and calls me out. 

""Is it me...?"" Lump in my throat. ""...Maybe?"" *Wry smile and puppy dog eyes*. Silence. Silence grows into awkward pause. Then the next 5 minutes is her looking like she's recovering from a car crash and me desperately trying to explain that I can't help how I feel. ""Maybe I'm just being an idiot,"" I say. ""I didn't want to tell you like this, but I can't help how I feel and I wanted you to know."" And she's obviously distraught, and our conversation keeps getting interrupted as her sister enters and exits her room so the awkwardness only exasperates. Finally I just go and say, ""I can't help the way I feel. *I love you and I can't change that.*"" She looks like a deer in headlights. ""I have to go to my meeting, I'm really sorry I don't know what to say right now..."" Boom. Done. Conversation ends.

And here I am today, wearing my dunce hat and feeling like a total selfish asshole. I've fucked up a lot in my life, Reddit. But last night, I think, was my crowning glory. Please induct me into the Hall of Fucked.

I stare at the only other person who had just arrived in time for my catastrophe and she gives me a ""don't worry we all fuck up"" look. The birthday girl then decides she wants to watch two fucking episodes of Dr. Who, and all the while the director is in his room, most likely crying, and doesn't come out for the rest of the night. 

When I finally get to leave and drive this girl home, he comes out, shakes my hand, and says ""Thanks for coming""

Gutting took no time at all. So I go to start putting new insulation in. After hours of the remolding I decided to take a shower.

Now swamp ass got going during the remodel and being the classy guy I am, I decide to soap up my hand and shove my hand between my ass cheeks. Rubbing and scrubbing away, I start to feel a tingle. My ass crack is on fire. It feel like shards of glass are shooting in and out. I grab the shower head and shove it in my ass. No relief. Cold water. No relief.

ecstatic1,11,,3,1rhz0q,,25,"Little bit of back story:

Girl and I have been friends for going on 4 years now. We've really dragged each other through some shit over that time, failed relationships, a mutual friend's divorce, problems with school and work and life, etc. She's always been there for me when I needed someone to listen, and I've always tried to help her through whatever problems crop up in her life.

Me? I'm a habitual fuck-up when it comes to anything involving emotions or expressing myself, and I tend to repress feelings of frustration and aggression. I think it's a coping mechanism for when I don't feel like I've got control of my life, like I choose not to feel instead of actually confronting the thing that's causing me to feel that way. She's the kind of girl that wears her heart on her sleeve, essentially, and that's a very endearing quality to me because it helps me associate with my own emotions. It's been very helpful over the past 7 or 8 months since I've moved across the country to start a new job. It's lonely here and my friends back home, her especially, have been so supportive and helpful.

Anyway, that bit is important because for about a year now I've been trying to convince myself that I'm not romantically interested in Girl, despite the fact that I've caught myself looking at her in a way that I typically reserve for lovers. And we have fooled around in the past so I didn't think much about it (just hormones, etc.). Last time I was in town (October) we ended up having sex, after which she drove me to the airport and we said our goodbyes. Neither one of us has really mentioned the event, but I've been thinking about her more and more over the past month as I've been helping her deal with school related problems. 

So last night:

I came back from my evening run feeling the worse for wear. I'm trying to train up for a 15k back home this coming Saturday that Girl has asked me to run with her. Fuck me I'm not a runner! But she's worth the effort so here I am pushing myself through cold and rain. Well, I get home and I text her that I want to Facetime and talk a bit. She replies back that she's got a meeting real soon and she can't, but she really wants to talk to me because she's stressed and also that *she wants to tell me about this* **new guy** *she met*. What? Fuck? I thought I had more time!

I was planning on telling her how I felt this weekend, and I think I panicked a little. She caught on that something was amiss and called me up. So there I am, heart pounding, legs tight and fingers numb, looking into the face of a girl who doesn't know the train wreck that's about to crash into her from a thousand miles away.

I play it cool. ""So, I've got a problem I think you can help me out with."" ""Ok, I'll try,"" she says to me with a look on her face like she has more pressing concerns on her mind. And I could tell she wasn't expecting anything, which just made it harder. But I'm already in this far, can't back out now. I go on to tell her that there's this girl I like and I don't know how to tell her how I feel. We go back and forth on some questions, and she figures out pretty quickly that I'm being a coy motherfucker and calls me out. 

""Is it me...?"" Lump in my throat. ""...Maybe?"" *Wry smile and puppy dog eyes*. Silence. Silence grows into awkward pause. Then the next 5 minutes is her looking like she's recovering from a car crash and me desperately trying to explain that I can't help how I feel. ""Maybe I'm just being an idiot,"" I say. ""I didn't want to tell you like this, but I can't help how I feel and I wanted you to know."" And she's obviously distraught, and our conversation keeps getting interrupted as her sister enters and exits her room so the awkwardness only exasperates. Finally I just go and say, ""I can't help the way I feel. *I love you and I can't change that.*"" She looks like a deer in headlights. ""I have to go to my meeting, I'm really sorry I don't know what to say right now..."" Boom. Done. Conversation ends.

And here I am today, wearing my dunce hat and feeling like a total selfish asshole. I've fucked up a lot in my life, Reddit. But last night, I think, was my crowning glory. Please induct me into the Hall of Fucked.

QWOP_Expert,5,,3,1rg5mn,,13,"A little backstory: I am living in this tiny apartment for a while, and because it is so small the only available space for my PC-tower is a space behind my desk. In order for the cables to reach my tower had to be facing away from me. 

Fast forward to today. I am copying about 300GB of data (pictures and stuff mostly) from one drive to another, when I accidentally hit the power switch for my PC with my foot. After powering  back up I notice 2 of my drives are missing from the system overview (2x2TB WD green drives, both of which were pretty full). After a lot of work I have managed to recover about 600GB from one of the drives. Still haven't gotten anything good off of the other one yet, although I am still working on it using Recuva and TestDisk.

tokewithnick,6,,3,1ribv3,,6,"Well I had the bright idea to not use the bathroom at work and wait till I got to my aunt's store. All the stores around share one bathroom which is for employees only, but I use it anyways. It's really small, I can actually sit on the toilet and wash my hands on the sink at the same time just to give you an idea. Well there I was, sitting on the toilet going colon bowlin' when suddenly I remembered that the plumbing for this toilet is really bad which forces me to flush at least 4 times before the water is clear. So after I was done doing my thing I bend over to turn the little red valve under to the toilet to get some more water pressure but as I was going down I hear someone turning the door knob...

SP1993,0,,2,1rgzxn,,4,"Im currently a third year in college and the last time I wrote an essay since my first year.  I've always been pretty terrible at writing and reading in general which is why I am a science major (to this day I question how I was admitted into any school).  The reason I suck at writing analytical essays is because I can't analyze text its that simple.  I take everything very literal and don't question anything.  

My paper was only 800 words so its basically not even a college paper.  The same week it was due I had 3 very difficult midterms for my major so I went to my ta and told her how difficult of a week id been having.  I told her I sucked at writing and was very illiterate (I meant literal), she immediately began laughing and I didn't know why.  I explained how I sucked at analyzing stuff and she just kept laughing.  As I was walking out she asked what my major, I said BioPsych and she then said, ""That explains everything!""  

I then went home really confused as to why she had laughed and told my roommates I had said to her that I suck at reading context clues and said I was illiterate, then began laughing and told me that I had basically told her I couldn't read instead of saying literal. 

I almost wanted to send her email and apologize for being half stupid but I couldn't get myself to do it.

I grabbed a cup from the counter and started scooping water out of the toilet and into the sink. After a couple minutes of that when the sink was full too, I realized the fucking sink was clogged also! So I started pouring it into the shower. Once the water stopped flowing and I scooped out enough water so that it wouldn't overflow, I took a bunch of toilet paper to try and clean up the flooded floor. After a few minutes of wiping I realized I couldn't even flush the soaked toilet paper down the toilet... So I had this nasty pile of soaking toilet paper sitting on the floor. So now the sink is full. The toilet is clogged. The shower is all wet. The floor is flooded. And there's a bunch of wet toilet paper on the floor.

wessles,4,,6,1rgwyv,,0,"So, I was in class, and was bored. I know all about this stuffs!

So I get out my notebook, look at the board, and see the homework. I decide to start. I am in the back of the classroom; hard to get to. So whenever they came around, I just covered it with the graph paper. I was doing **NONE** of the classwork, just the homework.

So at the end of the class, the teacher says:

*""Every year, someone feels they are just, just too smart for my class.""*

My cheeks redden...

*""So they do the homework during class. This upsets me...""*

I am jumping in my seat.

*""Emily, this year, has decided to be that person.""*

I am relieved as he takes her paper from her. Now she has to do it herself. But then I remember! *I get time to finish my homework in class!* Not enough to do all of it, but what would the teacher say? *""Done already?""*

So, from there I went on auto-pilot. I said:

""Mr. Doe (real name secret), [pause] I must confess. I did just that.""

So he gets up, takes my paper, and tells me:

*""wessles, you were honest, so I will take your paper, but also award you with a 'doing the right thing' award""*

The 'doing the right thing' award, is when they call you out on being a good person. So, at that point, completely forgetting why I told him, I get out a piece of paper, and do my homework again. I finish, class is over (no homwork free-time), and I get my paper back, surprisingly.) 

*""I'll give you it back. You did the right thing. Thanks wessles!""*
