eternalkerri,350,1296,12wfcz,2554,In the past two days we have had two threads one about Puerto Rico statehood and one about Why is the South so ConservativeBoth threads were rather popular but both were full of empty answers stereotypes pun threads circlejerking outright bad information wild baseless speculation political soapboxing and outright awfulnessBoth threads have been nuked from orbitWe have had a massive influx of new users who apparently have not bothered to familiarize themselves with the culture of this sub  The top tierlower tier answer and casual comment rule is being wildly abused  Subjects are drifting WAY off topic  There is to many unsupportable answers  There is to much of getting up on a soap box to lecture the sub about your political beliefsSimply put it is being abused and the moderators are going to have to play Social Worker   Unless the jokes are relevant they will be removedand even that is getting pushed to the breaking point  Meta threads are really the only place where we are looser with the rules on this Stay on topic or relevant  Your trip to the gas station today or the pizza you ate today had better be relevant or it goes Keep it in rpolitics  No seriously Im not kidding  Any discussion of modern politics after the early s will be nuked  It has to be VERY RELEVANT to be allowed after that Posts had better start being backed up no more idle speculation  There are far to many posts that are just random wild guesses halfinformed or are based on what is honestly a gradeschool level of understanding of the material  This sub has grown massively based on its reputation and we are going to maintain it  You the user base has to help maintain that reputation downvote posts that are not fitting of this subs standards report spam and garbage posts and hold each other to a higher standard  The moderation team does not want to have to turn this completely into raskscience in its strict posting standards but if we cannot trust the user base to police itself we will have to continue to enact tougher and tougher standards until this sub becomes what is honestly an overly dry and boring place,Meta  Okay Im going to explain this for the last time,3850,askhistorians,99793,8349
Idratherbeeating,352,947,1247fn,2416,I find the idea of Law Enforcement fascinating  We take for granted that if a law is broken there will be a group of well funded motivated people to discover who is responsible and hand out justice  I know that a public police force is a relatively new development in history but also assume that most cultures have been against having friends and family killed  So what was the process to figure out who did it without the modern police  I assume most murders happen in private  If someone killed my brother Id want to know who was responsible  Its in everyones best interest to catch the person  Any special methods or rights given to investigatorsAny famous detectives throughout history even if they werent known as such at the time  Any famous killers that were never caught  Any insights would be appreciatedEdit  Front page  Damn  Ive arrived,Its year XXXX of your specialty  A dead body is discovered in the middle of a well populated area and the overwhelming evidence suggests he was murdered  Is anyone in charge of finding the killer  What is the attitude of the public and is there an expectation of justice ,3363,askhistorians,0,0

eternalkerri,1693,767,1bd62c,1661,Over the past year rAskHistorians has grown from a small community of historinerds to a subreddit that gets touted on rAskReddit as a musthave While the consistent influx of new subscribers K per month on average over the past  months has brought new contributors and new viewpoints it has also meant that a lot of the same historical ground gets covered recovered and covered againThe mods of rAskHistorians have attempted to contain this repetition by pointing questioners to our FAQ and many contributors to this sub have done the same for which we thank you This has not been enough though and certain topics get brought up so frequently as to drown out other areas of inquiry We mods have thought long and hard about how to handle this but have unanimously settled on the following rule changes as the only viable solution to the problem  No more questions about Hitler  We are constantly saturated by questions about what did Hitler think of cap and trade the infield fly rule Coke or Pepsi  It delves into the absurd at times and honestly blocks the access to better questions  Therefore in order to improve the quality of the sub we will spin all Hitler questions off into raskaboutHitler  A sub completely dedicated to the history of Adolf Hitler  Starting next week  rAskHistorians will no longer be accepting questions about World War II Those posted will be removed  This may seem like a drastic measure  we mods acknowledge this  but we also feel that it is the only way to keep our community asking fresh and interesting questions about history At this point there is simply nothing left to ask and answer about WWII in this subreddit everything has been covered already In the future we may phase out other topics that have been frequently and completely covered such as Rome and Vikings In the meantime make sure to visit the new queue and upvote intriguing and novel questions there Just not ones about Nazis  Please visit the future raskaboutWWII for your questions  Poll type questions will return with a twist  We removed poll type questions like Which General had the nicest uniform or Which King was the most Kingly because they were heavily subjective and full of bad information  However they were also immensely popular  So we decided to reallow them with a twist  If you want to ask a poll question as the OP you must now keep editing your post to keep a tally of all the answers and reasons within your top post  This allows people to keep from repeating answers  Jesus is real  End of story  After constant incessant and heated argument in order to prevent further discord we have decided to go with the majority opinion of the historical community and state that Historical Jesus is real  If he was the son of God is still debatable but it is outside of the purview of this sub  We will delete any further questions or assertions that Jesus did not historically exist  All first hand sources from Greece or Rome must be posted in the original language  Due to the heavily contentious nature at times of various translations and word usage only citations of Greece and Roman literature must be in the original language so that we may see and be able to interpret the wording that you are using  This allows us to further analyse the first person source  We will be partnering with rlinguistics to properly interpret these posts    Going forward all conspiracy nuts racists homophobes and sexists will be preemptively banned  Going forward AnOldHope Eternalkerri and AlgernonAsimov will begin going through sexist racist and biggoted subs collecting user names and preemptively banning those users before they can participate in this sub and try to sneak in bad history  Artrw will be stepping down as mod at the end of May  Art will be backpacking through Europe this summer and not have access to the internet regularly  This will leave me as the senior moderator on this sub  I know this might be a source of concern for you but I assure you all the other moderators support this and will usher in some major changes in the sub going forward  We will be allowing pictures from rhistoricalrage and Historic LOLshttproflrazzicheezburgercomhistory  People have often complained that we are to serious here so we will begin experimenting with allowing a few meme jokes  This will allow us to not be seen as such a stuffy and unfun sub  We want users to enjoy themselves and feel that these are relative comics and can serve a decent purpose here  Due to complaints from multiple users all dates must be cited in both Gregorian but culturally specific dates  This means all dates involving Muslims must be cited in the Muslim Calender Chinese the Chinese calender Jewish dates in the Jewish calender etc  We do not wish to offend any users culture and are doing this to accommodate them and bridge a cultural divide   Sports questions are exempt from the  year rule  Due to the growing disinterest in academic study of sports we are exempting all sports from the  year rule  This will hopefully increase the academic interest in athletics not only currently but in the study of the pastWe understand the gravity of these changes and understand that they will be contentious that is why they will not be implemented for a week  This will allow the community to adapt to these changes and discuss it amongst themselves  However they will not be subject to being disallowed the moderation team has discussed this heartily in back channels and agree that these changes are for the best for the subThank you and enjoy your Easter  God BlessEDIT  I know some of you are very pissed off about these changes but any impolite dissent will be removedEDIT   I know youre mad but an Inquisition isnt so

spikebrennan,149,206,1ce7f7,833,I am aware that many ancient cultures have practiced human sacrifice at various times such as CanaaniteCarthaginian child sacrifice the Celtic wicker man burnings bog bodies the Viking funeral account by  Ahmad ibn Fadlan Polynesians and so forthBut I have the impression that the Mesoamericans and the MexicaAztecs in particular practiced human sacrifice both more frequently and with more intense cruelty than other cultures  including certain practices that involved the intentional infliction of as much pain and suffering as possibleIs this really a fair characterization of that culture or were they unfairly libeled by the Spanish and others who first documented the cultureEDIT I probably should not have used words like cruel and bloodthirsty that send up red flags about cultural relativism  What I am really interested in asking is is it true that the Aztecs engaged in human sacrifice with great frequency thousands or tens of thousands of victims per year and sometimes at even greater frequency for particular religious days or for the dedication of important temples and is it true that they did things like single out pregnant women for particular sacrifices deliberately torture small children to death in order to produce tears for Tlaloc and practice cannibalism,Is it really fair to characterize the Aztec religion as being particularly cruel and bloodthirsty or was it not bad as is commonly assumed,1039,askhistorians,1132,853

read this posthttpwwwcrackedcomforumsindexphptopicmsgmsg on the Cracked forumsgtMost of us are incapable of fathoming such evil that is child molestation especially incest  And so we almost never suspect it even under the most dire evidence  I read once that the misconception that its possible to catch an STD from a toilet seat arose because of such obliviousness  Doctors couldnt understand why children were catching the same infections their parents had  It seemed the only possible answerThat post caught my eye when I first saw it but I never looked into it For whatever reason I recently remembered it and decided to do a bit of researchFrom Lynn SaccohttpworksbepresscomlynnsaccohttpwwwfaqsorgchildhoodThWVenerealDiseasehtmlgtDoctors were vexed as to how so many girls had become infected particularly those from white middle and upper class families which white professionals considered respectable Many white professionals believed that only foreign or ignorant men abused their daughters and so assumed that INCEST occurred only in poor workingclass immigrant or AfricanAmerican families When the evidence increasingly pointed to men from their own class doctors public health officials social reformers and educators speculated that girls could become infected from nonsexual contacts with toilet seats towels or beddingmodes of transmission doctors had already rejected for adults and boys Doctors based their speculation on the fact that the epithelial lining of girls genitals is so thin that it provides little protection against bacteria They knew it was unlikely that soiled objects could spread gonorrhea because the bacteria dry quickly when exposed to air yet without proof that even one girl had become infected after using the school toilet from  to the s health care professionals ignored the possibility of sexual assault and insisted instead that girls faced the greatest risk of exposure in the school lavatoryhttpwwwfaqsorgchildhoodInKeIncesthtmlgtHistorians have shown how twentiethcentury rhetoric may have hidden more abuse than it exposed The strangerperpetrator so threateningly portrayed in midtwentiethcentury media diverted attention from more likely perpetrators in the home Freuds notion of childrens innate sexuality and his belief that memories of sexual abuse represented unconscious wishes stressed the erotic nature of children and caused many professionals to question the validity of memories of sexual abuse Even as concern about sexual abuse grew throughout most of the

Daeres,225,177,1cjatl,591,Rules Post Part the FirstRecently there has been a growth in posts asking extremely general questions These questions often sound extremely similar and in particular many of them use the phrase in your area of expertise Though the questions themselves are wellintentioned we have received numerous complaints about them They encourage extremely short replies and often extremely bad answers This then often requires moderator intervention due to the large number of responses ignoring our guidelines and rules The subreddit is intended to be a source of indepth historical knowledge and these questions are not taking advantage of that  The mod team has therefore agreed that we want to take direct action much as we did previously regarding poll questions we are going to be removing these extremely general threads from now on The aim is twofold to have less generalised questions posted in the subreddit and to redirect those generalised inquiries to more appropriate places  For those seeking clarification about what more appropriate places means we have two weekly meta threads which suit more triviaoriented questions and answers the Tuesday Trivia thread and the FridayFreeforAll The former has a particular topic each week but the latter is explicitly designed to fit questions that dont quite fit elsewhereThese are the guidelines that we will be using when removing these kinds of questionsOne of our key principles regarding questions is that they should be as precise as possible we do not want threads that will attract only bad answers or are so generalised that they cannot be answered We will therefore remove questions that are seeking trivia rather than informed answersOur guiding rubric is if a thread can be summarised as tell me random stuff about X through history then it falls into this category of trivia rather than looking for indepth answers which are this communitys main focus Questions likely to be removed are those asking about all periods and all places at once If your question begins with the phrase In your area of expertise strongly reconsider posting it or consider making it more specific For example perhaps narrowing your question to a specific time period or area or focusing your topic to enable more informative answersRules Post Part the SecondFollowing our recent meta thread on the issue found here we have also decided to implement some measures regarding NSFW threads For anyone unfamiliar with the term we mean questions whose content can cause problems in nonprivate environmentsWe would like anyone asking a NSFW question to put the nsfw tag on their question after posting it and we would like them to make the title as SFW safe for work as possible If questions violate this they will be removed and we will message the OP about reposting that question with a changed title We are operating on a we know it when we see it principle regarding NSFW content in titlesThis is only ever likely to be relevant to a small number of threads as NSFW questions are not asked that often here But our aim is to help anyone browsing the subreddit for whom NSFW text may be a problem In addition our only concern here is the titles of threads When it comes to the actual posts within the thread we arent concerned about NSFW content at all These rules are about allowing people to a know that a thread has NSFW content before looking at the comments and b making sure noone gets in trouble for accidentally viewing a NSFW title,Meta A pair of rules announcements,768,askhistorians,27718,1

gtDear Mr AndropovgtMy name is Samantha Smith I am ten years old Congratulations on your new job I have been worrying about Russia and the United States getting into a nuclear war Are you going to vote to have a war or not If you arent please tell me how you are going to help to not have a war This question you do not have to answer but I would like to know why you want to conquer the world or at least our country God made the world for us to live together in peace and not to fightgtSincerely  Samantha SmithAs you may read from the linked article the letter was published in a popular Soviet newspaper and while Andropov did not reply immediately he did respond with thisgtDear SamanthagtI received your letter which is like many others that have reached me recently from your country and from other countries around the worldgtIt seems to me  I can tell by your letter  that you are a courageous and honest girl resembling Becky the friend of Tom Sawyer in the famous book of your compatriot Mark Twain This book is well known and loved in our country by all boys and girlsgtYou write that you are anxious about whether there will be a nuclear war between our two countries And you ask are we doing anything so that war will not break outgtYour question is the most important of those that every thinking man can pose I will reply to you seriously and honestlygtYes Samantha we in the Soviet Union are trying to do everything so that there will not be war on Earth This is what every Soviet man wants This is what the great founder of our state Vladimir Lenin taught usgtSoviet people well know what a terrible thing war is Fortytwo years ago Nazi Germany which strove for supremacy over the whole world attacked our country burned and destroyed many thousands of our towns and villages killed millions of Soviet men women and childrengtIn that war which ended with our victory we were in alliance with the United States together we fought for the liberation of many people from the Nazi invaders I hope that you know about this from your history lessons in school And today we want very much to live in peace to trade and cooperate with all our neighbors on this earthwith those far away and those near by And certainly with such a great country as the United States of AmericagtIn America and in our country there are nuclear weaponsterrible weapons that can kill millions of people in an instant But we do not want them to be ever used Thats precisely why the Soviet Union solemnly declared throughout the entire world that neverneverwill it use nuclear weapons first against any country In general we propose to discontinue further production of them and to proceed to the abolition of all the stockpiles on EarthgtIt seems to me that this is a sufficient answer to your second question Why do you want to wage war against the whole world or at least the United States We want nothing of the kind No one in our country neither workers peasants writers nor doctors neither grownups nor children nor members of the governmentwant either a big or little wargtWe want peacethere is something that we are occupied with growing wheat building and inventing writing books and flying into space We want peace for ourselves and for all peoples of the planet For our children and for you SamanthagtI invite you if your parents will let you to come to our country the best time being this summer You will find out about our country meet with your contemporaries visit an international childrens camp  Artek  on the sea And see for yourself in the Soviet Union everyone is for peace and friendship among peoplesgtThank you for your letter I wish you all the best in your young lifegtY AndropovNoting the escalated tensions during that period it was a blessing for the Soviet leader once cast as a threat to world stability to declare straight that their main priority is not to wage war but instead to focus on economy The entire operation played a large part in humanising Soviets and Americans from each side and may have played a part in defusing aforementioned tensionsTheres also something else if you guys dont mind a second

at the wall and at the six checkpoints between East and West demanding that border guards immediately open the gates The surprised and overwhelmed guards made many hectic telephone calls to their superiors about the problem At first they were ordered to find the more aggressive people gathered at the gates and stamp their passports with a special stamp that barred them from returning to East Germanyin effect revoking their citizenship However this still left thousands of people demanding to be let through as Schabowski said we cangtIt soon became clear that no one among the East German authorities would take personal responsibility for issuing orders to use lethal force so the vastly outnumbered soldiers had no way to hold back the huge crowd of East German citizens Finally at  pm the guards yielded opening the checkpoints and allowing people through with little or no identity checking As the Ossis swarmed through they were greeted by Wessis waiting with flowers and champagne

title by Author dateoptional short twotothree sentence description hereDo not put author name first Do not give just a list of books Do not put your descriptions in the first person no I really like this book because rather this book is good becauseMake sure the description is actually descriptive Dont just write this is a great book on early modern France Obviously it is because this list should consist of exclusively really great books and I am after all putting it in the Early Modern France section In general more detail is better than lessif someone is planning on reading an entire book on the subject have faith they can wade through a few sentences on the bookGeneralHistoriographyGeneral The Human Past by Chris Scarre ed A very readable although also very expensive overview of all of human history from an archaeological perspective Its very detailed and used as an introductory book in many universities Still updated How Humans Evolved by Boyd and Silk Everything is also discussed by The Human Past but Boyd and Silk have slightly different opinions and reading both keeps you updated not only on how it was but most importantly what the current debate is and what arguments are used Also very readable and almost compulsory for everyone into evolutionary anythingModernGeneral The Birth of the Modern World Global Connections and Comparisons  by CA Bayly The book written by someone who is not a specialist in Western Europe shows the myriad modernities that started emerging in the long th century and showing how the Western eventually dominant one interacted with them It also raises the issue of this age as the first true globalization Replenishing the Earth The Settler Revolution and the Rise of the Angloworld  by John Belich Why is it that British colonialism made the largest impact in terms of lasting sense of Angloconnections whether with America or Australia In a somewhat controversial book Belich draws attention both to the economic cycles that made the British Empire the paramount power and the revolution in settlerism as an ideology that allowed for a wideranging cultural expansion The Red Flag A History of Communism by David Priestland One of the dominant modern ideologies communism has often been treated in just its Soviet guise This book however creates a theoretical framework for understanding its different manifestations dividing it into three large currents  romantic radical and modernist and pays close attention to Chinese Cuban and other communisms rather than concentrating on Moscow alone The Global Cold War Third World Interventions and the Making of Our Times by Odd Arne Westad Tracing the origins of modern Third World interactions with the developed world to the geopolitics of the Cold War Westad also greatly expands the scope of Cold War history to move beyond Europe He also takes the ideological clash between the USA USSR and eventually political Islam more seriously than many scholars The age of series by Eric Hobsbawm This series of books the Age of Revolution Age of Empire and Age of Extremes is one of and is thought by some to be the best introduction to modern history A phenomenally well researched and analysed series of books from the greatest Marxist historian of the last centuryWWI See NMWs incredible list herehttpwwwredditcomrAskHistorianscommentslaskhistoriansmasterbooklistiicpg The First World War by John Keegan  a fine singlevolume introduction and one of the most accessible Keegan was one of the best popular military historians going and he was generally believed to be at the height of his game in this particular work It situates the war in the senseless tragedy school of cultural memory but this is hardly a fringe position Still very good The First World War by Hew Strachan  offers a remarkably international view of the conflict and in a compact single volume at that This was meant as a companion piece to the also quite good television documentary series of the same name which he oversaw Still if you want more look to his much larger The First World War  Vol I To Arms   the first of a projected three volumes and absolutely staggering in its depth This first volume alone runs to  pages The First World War A Complete History by Martin Gilbert nd Ed  The title is a bit of a lie but this work from Winston Churchills official biography is as lucid and sensitive as anything else hes written Gilbert takes great pains to situate the operations described within the context of their human cost  not everyone has always found this to be a satisfying tactic when it comes to the critical distance of the scholar but its a decision for which good arguments can be madeWWII The Struggle for Europe by Chester Wilmot A detailed account of the European theater during World War II starting with the allied preparations for DDay subsequent invasion of Normandy and major battles  strategies of the rest of the warEurope The West Postwar by Tony Judt  a fantastic indepth history of Europe after the second world war moreorless up to the present day by one of the greatest historians of Modern Europe There are some fantastic insights like a chapter on the formation of welfare states as well as a general overview of the period to be found here Dark Continent Europes th Century by Mark Mazower Less a comprehensive history of the continent than a piece to explain how civilized Europe became the bloodiest continent in that century Mazower brings fascism back into the picture as a really competing opponent to communism and capitalism and looks at how imperial practices cultivated abroad were copied and applied to Europe itselfEastern Europe Magnetic Mountain Stalinism as Civilization by Stephen Kotkin The book takes the building of Magnitogorsk an industrial city built from scratch as a way to show how people learned to speak Bolshevik and thus both survive within and use the regime thus it complicates hugely the usual topdown view of the Soviet UnionWestern Europe Lourdes Body and Spirit in the Secular Age by Ruth Harris Taking the Lourdes site and the original visions supposedly seen there in  Harris uses this as a microcosm to tell us a lot about emerging civic and patriotic identities in France raises questions of science versus religion in the age of modernisation and the question of faith and belief It is a beautifully written book and goes far beyond what the title suggests A History of Contemporary Italy Society and Politics  by Paul Ginsborg Examines the Italian society from the end of World War II to  with particular emphasis on the transformation of the Italian economy and Italian social structure A History of Western Society by McKay Hill and others  A good overview picks up where The Human Past left off with an overlap in antiquity and provides the historical rather than archaeological perspective Very readable and though its a textbook and thus most suitable for students with plenty of summaries and lists of important key words Id still recommend it to people who are interested in history without having access to the formal education and to archaeologists who only study prehistory The Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy by David Cannadine A massive  pages look at everything to do with the downfall of the British aristocracy at the end of the th century Im not done it yet but so far its absolutely engaging The French Enlightenment and the Jews The Origins of Modern AntiSemitism by Arthur Hertzberg This work focuses on the development of modern secular antisemitism ie antisemitism not based in religious beliefs examining how ostensibly humanist Enlightenment thinkers could justify the continued exclusion of a group Fascinating reading not only for its investigation of Jewish history but also for examining an aspect of the Enlightenment that doesnt often get to the general public The Conquest of Nature Water Landscape and the Making of Modern Germany by David Blackbourn An excellent investigation of how industry and society shaped and were shaped by bodies of water in modern Germany Starts in the s and goes to the twentieth century with really interesting sections on Frederick the Great the reshaping of the Rhine and how Nazi racial and environmental policy intersectedAustralia The Federal Story by Alfred Deakin  A behindthescenes description of the events and people involved in bringing Australia to federation written by a man who was at the centre of it all Deakin wrote this manuscript over a period of years as the events happened This is history in real time with no hindsight or afterthefact analysis Alfred Deakin by Professor J A La Nauze  A biography of Alfred Deakin a central figure in Australian federation and later threetime Prime Minister of Australia Federation Fathers by L F Crisp  A collection of essays about various key people involved in the Australian federation movement The First Decade of the Australian Commonwealth by H G Turner  Turners personable history of federal politics following federation describing the people and events that moulded the new country during its first years His bias against the labour movement and the deluded Labor Party is a bit obvious in places but its sweet Australians by Thomas Keneally    This trilogy which is still being written is essential reading for anyone interested in Australian history Keneally the author responsible for The Chant of Jimmy Blacksmith made into a classic Aussie movie and Schindlers Ark filmed as Schindlers List shares the stories of the little people in Australias past These are real stories of real people set in their proper context of Australias larger history and described with a novelists styleHolocaust War amp Genocide A Concise History of the Holocaust by Doris L Bergen A brief yet comprehensive and accessible overview of the Holocaust tracing from the prewar Nazi ascent to power through the end of World War II Written by one of the best academics currently working on the subject Includes a good amount of analysis of postwar Holocaust scholarship too The Destruction of the European Jews by Raul Hilberg Basically the original work on the Holocaust by the father of Holocaust studies Originally published in  and revised in  it is available in both an abridged version and as three volumes Hilberg was a stellar scholar and while some of it is naturally out of date it still holds up well today Ordinary Men Reserve Police Battalion  and the Final Solution in Poland by Christopher R Browning This focused case study investigates the nature of German killers in the Holocaust and concludes that the majority at least in the unit surveyed were ordinary guys without any particular ideological commitment to Nazism or antisemitismAfrica The Fate of Africa by Martin Meredith  I think this is the best single readable volume on postcolonial Africa Entertaining largely because of the ridiculous behavior of many of the characters It runs  pages but its worth it if you want recent African history We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families by Philip Gourevitch  Probably the best account of the Rwanda genocide of  Across the Red River by Christian Jennings  Another very good look at the Rwanda genocideIn the Footsteps of Mr Kurtz Living on the Brink of Disaster in Mobutus Congo by Micheala Wrong  A close look at the rise and fall of Zaires dictator Very readableEast Asia Daily Lives of Civilians in Wartime Asia From the Taiping Rebellion to the Vietnam War by Stewart Lone Fairly straightforward Not just China but basically every major Asian conflict It is a behemoth of information that has been collected from far and wide for the readers convenience It covers history provides detailed and cited statistics and gives insight to culture art social chances and upheavals family and even romantic impact from living during all these wars An excellent reference English in Singapore by Lisa Lim et al Discussion of the evolution of the English language in Singapore after independence related domestic policy how it affects education social movements and chances and even how it affects foreign policy and international standing in economics and business It also gives a solid history on the developments of Singapores economy and political system Awesome readChina Chinas Rise in Historical Perspective edited by Brantly Womack fishstickuffs note If I had to suggest just one book to read from this list this would be it If anyone is seriously interested in what trends have shaped the current Chinese political landscape this is the book to read The perspectives of the contributors are diverse and so are the topics covered which include religious cosmology identity crises in wake of the revolution ecological issues and international relations Chen Village by Chan Madsen and Unger nd ed  This is a beautiful book that traces the life and growth of a village in Southeast China through the entirety of the communist revolution until  Its ambition is incredible and its execution satisfies its aims It is effectively an anthropological ethnography written by historians and the work reflects some of the best of both disciplines Rarely have I felt as connected to historical characters as I have in learning of the exploits of lowlevel unimportant peasant officials in Chen Village This book communicates the trends in political and social change in China in the last  years in a way that is hard to replicate from pure analysis TaiwanChina A Most Ticklish Standoff edited by Adam W Clarke Besides having the most fantastic name of any academic work on the subject Ive seen this book provides a survey of the triangle of relationships between the US China and Taiwan through a mixture of excerpts from declassifiedpublic primary sources and academic analysis Managing SinoAmerican Crises Case Studies and Analysis edited by Michael Swaine and Zhang Tuosheng Pretty much THE book on the issue By far the most extensive analysis of crisis behavior by China and America during SinoAmerican crises that I know of Begins with the posWWII period and continues to  US Taiwan Strait Policy The Origins of Strategic Ambiguity by Dean P Chen This book actually came out this year and Im very excited about it It provides a fantastic summary of the US approach toward China in regards to the Taiwan issue and is the first major book to do so in regards to the Obama administrations policies However certainly not for casual reading This is an academic analysis of the policy making process and is making an argument for how to conduct US policy into the future But in the course of its analysis it provides a fantastic history of the relationship between the US and the Taiwan issue Charm Offensive by Joshua Kurlantzick An excellent history and analysis of the Peoples Republic of Chinas PRC international politics plays in the geopolitical arena and how foreign policy affects domestic policy as well as vice versa It is a concise and thorough introduction to the PRCs commitment to the soft power grand strategy and a must read for any student of the PRCs foreign policy historyKorea The Koreans Who They Are What They Want Where Their Future Lies by Michael Breen This is the primer for all things South Korean history during the th century Starting with the history and effects of the long embedded Japanese occupation then moving through the Korean War the rebuilding the Korean economic development and social amp political upheaval the Seoul Olympics which was instrumental to South Koreas rise to the global stage and North amp South relations through out A must read Nothing to Envy by Barbara Demick A heart wrenching piece on the effects of the North Korean regime on the lives of regular North Korean people Its half based on oral accounts that were taken down by Demick as she interviewed many defectors from the North The other half is grounded in well researched statistics diplomatic papers and economic studies of the North It is a very compelling read more focused on telling a narrative of famine oppression and strange social constructs than standing as a historical reference but one of the essentials on getting a ground eye view of what life was like in the North The North Korean Economy by Nicholas Eberstadt Focusing on the economic history of North Korea this text in my opinion is essential to understanding how the North started so strong but is today practically a failed state Eberstadt worked tirelessly to check and recheck then check again all of his numbers because North Korea is notorious for inflating or deflating numbers as they see fit so much that often the records that they present to the outside world cannot be trusted nor can they be verified The economics of the North affected every other aspect of life in the North as well as shaping its political domestic and foreign policy because of necessity The extensive and easily digested statistics often presented in text and reinforced visually with many graphs tables and charts give credence to the analysis of the two Koreas by Eberstadt starting from the division in  all the way to todayJapan The Making of Modern Japan by Marius Jansen This is the definitive work of modern era Japan Jansens work is a chronicle of not just the rise of railroads of factories the modern firearm electricity and gas the telegraph milk and other interesting developments of early modern Japan He gives background history cultural and political analysis event and timeline breakdowns and more An expansive work that takes the reader through decades upon decades of Japanese development and progress that happened at break neck speeds but can now be looked at retrospectively at our leisure guided by Jansens steady hand Inventing Japan by Ian Buruma Ive joked to friends before by calling this The Making of Modern Japan Lite but this is essentially an extremely succinct look at the changes and developments Japan went through and its metamorphosis as a nation as it moved from the th century into the th This book is seriously tiny a slip of a book and you could breeze through it in one sitting but its depth of content is surprising for its deceptively small size I highly recommend this book as a solid introduction a way to get your foot in the door of the maze that is early modern Japanese history Early Japanese Railways  Engineering Triumphs That Transformed Meijiera Japan by Dan Free Surprisingly enough is not just a book on trains It is definitely a must read for studies on the Meiji Period and the development going on at the time It details the massive influx of modern technologies that various Japanese companies were more than happy to incorporate and invest resources intoPremondernWestern EurasiaPrehistory The Horse the Wheel and Language by David Anthony A slightly polemic book from  providing his view on the spread of IndoEuropean language and in his opinion culture at the beginning of the Bronze Age The most current version and most factual and least political of the IndoEuropean debate for critical readers its still very valuable because of the large amount of archaeological data that is presented while the polemic writing style makes it accessible to nonspecialists as wellMesopotamia A History of the Ancient Near East ca  BC Marc van der Mieroop Its an expansive history of the region that at once shows off its scale but also avoids overwhelming with information Its a must read to acquire a sense of perspective over the regions historyIron Age Europe The Celts by Nora Chadwick Introduction to Celtic studies Its an older book first published in  and focuses on a wide range of Celtic topics including religion both pre and post Christian culture art and society It also does a fantastic job of explaining how Celtic isnt a homogenous entity but rather many different cultures over a large area over a large period of timeCarthage Carthage Must Be Destroyed The Rise and Fall of an Ancient Civilization by Richard Miles One of the few general histories of Carthage with a decent detour into syncretism of the Herculean and other cults Cant fully vouch for the accuracy as this isnt my specialization but it appears well researched with a decent amount of cross reference to the archaeological evidenceClassical Greece A History of the Greek CityStates  BC by Raphael Sealey whilst the developments of Greek cultures are presented in a narrative fashion the book is arguably more focused on introducing the reader to problems within understanding Greek history Its therefore a good way to both understand changes in Greek history over time and the reality of interpreting it academically A Social and Economic History of the Greek World by M Rostovtzeff for those interested in ancient economics this book is a must have and a good introduction into how ancient Greeces economics have been interpreted It is a little dry so do not take this as a casual read Ancient Greece From Prehistoric to Hellenistic Times by Thomas R Martin This provides a survey of Greek history focusing mostly on political and military events Good for those looking for an introduction but also provides fairly in depth analysis of key subjectsRome The World of Pompeii edited by John J Dobbins and Pedar W Foss a comprehensive collection of papers on every aspect of Pompeii as a city and all written relatively recently Its very up to date and deals with a lot of aspects of Pompeiis archaeology that dont get much coverage outside of the field itself Ancient Rome A Military and Political History by Christopher S Mackay This is another survey from the ancient world this one is primarily political and military history It provides a solid understanding of events their significance and implications on the Roman state It covers both empire and republic very efficientlyMedieval Europe The Viking World by Stefan Brink A  book which combines many short chapters on any topic relevant to Vikings or the Scandinavian late Iron Age Strong point is that many chapters are written by the relevant specialists instead of a single author who is trying to specialise in everything Bad point is that this means that theres not much of a central theme connecting the chapters which makes this more of a reference work than a bedtime story The Discovery of the Individual  by Colin Morris This is an older work but represents a shift in thought regarding the individual on a personal level Framed within the context of Western Christianity Morris looks at the th century renaissance as a period of heightened awareneess and self expression Britain After Rome by Robin Fleming A comprehensive guide to AngloSaxon England Its kinda hard to jump into it assumes you already know the politics wars and events but does a fantastic job of creating a narrative tale of the AngloSaxon people More of an archeological look than a historical lookEarly Modern Europe Tudor England by John Guy a really good introduction to the period with plenty of detailed analysis of the major events that occurred under the Tudor monarchs Henry VIIIElizabeth I The th Century edited by Patrick Collinson Good god three of the four people Ive recommended here have died in the last  years A fantastic collection of essays relating to the Tudors including some really insightful ones on culture religion and the fringe areas of the British Isles  great for both dipping in for short chapterlength essays but also for detailed study Reformation Europes House Divided  By Diarmaid MacCulloch  pretty much the definitive book on the European Reformation a sweeping detailed and actually readable account of the European Reformation The Elizabethan Puritan Movement By Patrick Collinson  a bit more specific but the best account of perhaps the most interesting period of religious change in English History by one of its greatest historians though it is quite a dense book Montaillou by E Le Roy Ladurie One of the first and best microhistorical books this is a highly interesting account of the inquisition of the small village of Montaillou in the th century and the insights it can reveal to us France Night Hawks fantastic list on FrancehttpwwwredditcomrAskHistorianscommentslaskhistoriansmasterbooklistiictq A History of Modern France Jeremy Popkin exactly what it sounds like Its not one where you can just sit down and read for fun like these other ones are  its a textbook and its written like one Very dense and not much verve but extremely useful in providing context for a lot of these other books and clearing up their ambiguities The Village of Cannibals Alain Corbin a microhistory of a small town in southern France during the FrancoPrussian War and how the local peasantry reacts to the ousting of Napoleon III His writing style is a little hard to get used to but its an interesting tale of shifting ideas of social class and political thought in a particular setting Bonus feature gory murders of French noblemen well one French nobleman but you cant have everything Peasants into Frenchmen The Modernization of Rural France  Eugen Weber a classic if there ever was one Its easy to get enamored with Paris and the Eiffel Tower and the Belle Epoque when we think of this period but France has always been tricky its much more rural than you think especially the southern half Weber does a great job explaining how France was rural and how the Third Republic worked to bring rural France into the fold peasants into Frenchmen Marianne in Chains Robert Gildea how did people actually navigate Vichy France Gildeas case study of one region in occupied France helps clear the air on this question  like Nemirovskys work hes asking about collaboration and resistance and has some really interesting points to make on historical memory after the war as well Not a political history  he references Pétain and Laval on some occasions but the most political he gets is going into local governments Suite Francaise Irene Nemirovsky I throw this book at everyone who asks about Vichy France because it is such a fantastic picture of the choices people had to make during wartime What is collaboration What is resistance Can you be both a collaborator and a resister Its a thoughtprovoking historical study and a good novel in its own right Unfortunately Nemirovsky died before she had a chance to properly finish it so what we have is constructed from her drafts and her unfinished notesSouth Asia Forging the Raj Essays on British India in the Heyday of Empire by Thomas R Metcalf Very good book if you want to really look into how the  revolt changed the way Britain acted in India The book breaks down the essays into sections which include Land PolicyLand tenure architecture and much more It gives a good view into the different Rajs or mini princes in India Lots of tine going into detail on an an individual one and their life before and after the revoltAfrica Africa in History by Basil Davidson revised ed  This is a broad survey of African historyprehistory The first edition is often considered the first culturally neutral attempt to document African history The African Slave Trade by Basil Davidson revised ed  As he was an expert in Portuguese colonies his research and knowledge are particularly strong in that area The Strong Brown God by Sanche de Gramont  The history of early European attempts to reach Timbuktu and to map the entire Niger River in the th century Its a highly entertaining read I strongly recommend it to all audiencesEast AsiaChina Cambridge Illustrated History of China by Patricia Buckley Ebrey nd ed  Fantastic general survey of Chinese history and a standard in college courses I put this under the Imperial section because there are better resources dealing strictly with modern China Chinese Civilzation A Sourcebook edited by Patricia Buckley Ebrey Another standard find in intro Chinese history courses in college This is a great introduction to Soldiers of the Dragon edited by CJ Peers Osprey publishers have a wide variety of awesome military histories You wouldnt be likely to find this in a college classroom but that can be a plus Its not a hard read but extremely informative This Is China The First  Years by Haiwang Yuan This should be the standard text in every introductory class to Chinese history It is an incredibly short brief book that is a crash course on Chinese history to the uninitiated as well as a solid quick reference for the more experienced It is a work that runs over the surface of almost everything Chinese history has to offer and dips its head under the water at select places to try to give the reader a real taste of what lies before them More than cover Chinese history it is a great book to illustrate the fact that trying to understand all of Chinese history at once is impossible and is as much art and dynamic dialogue as it is inexact science and lively academia Another must have The Archaeology of China From the Late Paleolithic to the Early Bronze Age by Li Liu and Xingcan Chen Only recently having finished reading this myself I highly recommend this book for its compelling points about well everything It sheds light on topics ranging from the structures of societies agriculture tools and warfare regional and intercultural influences on development to even diet and health Most of the research comes from archaeological studies as well as interpreting inscriptions artifacts and other reputable academic sources Chinese Ceramics From the Paleolithic Period through the Qing Dynasty by Laurie Barnes et al This incredible work not only talks about porcelain and other Chinese pottery which are all exquisite but also its impact on culture life trade and politics It is an extremely good book for general Chinese history as well as an in depth look at Chinese art over the centuries which relates heavily to Chinese cultural philosophical and religious thought all through the lens of pottery Daily Life in Traditional China The Tang Dynasty by Charles Benn Extremely accessible book that is based completely on secondary sources and cites other reference books It is a very handy introductory primer to what life generally was like for the average Chinese person While obviously focused on the Tang Dynasty it is a solid place for a start as serious readershistory buffs can build off of this solid foundation as they research more on their own It is a very light read compared to the more academic texts that I usually recommend but personally this one of my favoritesJapan The Samurai Sourcebook by Stephen Turnbull and any other book by Turnbull for that matter An extremely detailed and thorough yet highly readable work on all that is samurai the warrior class that shaped Japan It covers everything anyone ever wanted to know about samurai from daily life during piece life during war equipment pay rank military organization politics to things like diet music and art high culture amp low culture This is the samurai book The Economic Aspects of the History of the Civilization of Japan by Takekoshi Yosaburou Exhaustive in its breadth and scope it covers the economics of Japan throughout the centuries A monstrous book filled with more numbers names places and dates than one could ever hope to find in one consolidated text this is everything you ever wanted to know about Japanese money economics and value and more I recently went back to this monster of a book to fulfill a request to find out what the kokumeasure of wealth value of all the individual Japanese provinces were Sure enough it was only a matter of picking out the relevant statistics and information compiling and a short outing with the calculator and BAM Incredible resource for the impact of money on salaries prices access to goods by various people of society etc Simply amazingThe AmericasMesoamerica Codex Chimalpopoca by John Bierhorst  This text actually contains two sources the Annals of Cuauhtitlan and The Legend of the Suns Readers unfamiliar with religious features of Mesoamerica may find this book a little confounding however it does have a notable place in academic understandings of precolumbian faiths Bierhorst was also kind enough to include the original Nahuatl which is useful for students of the languageNorth America Archaeology of the Southwest by Linda Cordell and Maxine McBrinn Third Edition is from  A comprehensive look by two of the most respected names in the field The Chaco Meridian by Stephen Lekson  One of the most interesting and innovative books about the area by one of its most famous scholars  he posits a unified theory of the Pueblo world centred on Chaco Canyon Archaeology Without Borders Contact Commerce and Change in the US

know enough about the period Boyarins work is easily the most revolutionary thesis about the parting of the waysbetween Judaism and Christianityto come out in recent memory He argues that in fact neither Judaism nor Christianity existed before they constructed each other See also Judith Lieus Neither Jew nor Greek  The Parting of the Ways between Christianity and Judaism and their significance for the character of Christianity by James D G Dunn  nd ed  a thorough survey of the status of Judaism at the time of Jesus and how Christianity slowly positioned itself as not Jewish A readable classic in the field The Quest of the Historical Jesus a critical study of its progress from Reimarus to Wrede by Albert Schweitzer  German original although weighed down by overfaithful English translations Schweitzers book is literally the beginning of all contemporary attempts to understand Jesus in a nontheological light to the point that the historiography of historical Jesus research in split into quests the first of which begins with Reimarus and ends with Wrede and Schweitzer This book is essentially a historiography of the Jesus question and introduced one of the most enduring questions in Jesus research was Jesus eschatologically minded The Five Gospels What Did Jesus Really Say The Search for the authentic sayings of Jesus by the Robert Funk Roy Hoover and the Jesus Seminar  This is effectively the result of a panel of experts assembled by Funk to determine the authentic teachings of Jesus by voting on each one with coloured beads This book contains both their own translation the Scholars Translation of the four canonical gospels and the Gospel of Thomas coloured sayings of Jesus and a guide to their methodology Incredibly controversial both within and without the field the Jesus Seminars work is best appreciated when compared to the work of others in the Third Quest A brief introduction to the New Testament by Bart D Ehrman  a very good introduction to the methods and contexts of New Testament studies going bookbybook Written at the level of an interested undergraduate studentChinese Death Ritual in Late Imperial and Modern China Edited by James Watson and Evelyn S Rawski A rigorously researched academic treatment of its subject based on both ethnographic fieldwork and collection of primary resources Three Ways of Thought in Ancient China by Arthur Waley  This book has been criticized and expanded upon with the increased study of the intellectual history of China and suffers from the traditional failure of historians to take Chinese layreligion into account when evaluating the broader intellectual trends in China Nevertheless it is an excellent introduction to Chinese religious and philosophical thought Religion in China Today edited by Daniel L Overmyer A wonderfully informative collection of articles on the resurgence of Chinese religion under communist rule Academic in nature but not a terribly difficult read Anyone interested in how China has attemped and failed to repress religious practices in the last  years should read this bookIntellectual History Religion and the Decline of Magic By Keith Thomas

Loidis,131,143,15y9fe,514,I did a course on Western medicine through the ages in school and we were taught that scientific progress was largely blocked by the Church in the Middle Ages though they did allow students to study medical texts from Antiquity As I understand it the Roman Catholic Church forbade dissections disliked doctors with medical knowledge or innovative ideas about health as a threat to their authority and instead encouraging a focus on prayer My teachers also told us that though much Greek and Roman medical knowledge was lost in Western Europe some such as Galen remained and was held as the ultimate truth of human anatomy From a textbook although students did debate the ideas of Galen any new ideas were judged on the debating skills of the student not on scientific proof The Church said that Galens ideas were so correct that there was no need to investigate any further Chaucer also mentions his Doctor was wellversed in Aesculpaius too  And what Hippocrates and Rufus knew And Disocorides now dead and gone  Galen and Rhazes Hali Serapion It seems that Classical medical thinkers were held in the greatest esteem in the Middle AgesFrom this I have a few questions Why was the Church more accepting of sources from Greece and Rome presumably more fallible than contemporary Christian doctors Did this attitude apply across the arts sciences and philosophy If the Church saw the Greeks and Romans as the pinnacle of human achievement and knowledge did they consider later times to be in a downward decline What if any influence to the Arabic world have on Medieval understanding of science and human progress through their contact with the Middle East during the CrusadesI hope these questions make sense and I apologise if Ive used some terms incorrectly Also I read that people in the Middle Ages had a much more elastic view of history and frequently conceptualised Biblical events as happening within their own geosocial context Benedict Anderson Imagined Communities Therefore I can understand why it might be inappropriate to imagine Medieval people having a historical lens to view human progress,Did people in medieval times consider themselves to be on a downward decline compared to Greek or Roman thinkers,657,askhistorians,5153,1102

eternalkerri,112,123,16r63g,440,Okay folks lets talkWe have seen a recent amount of sizable growth in the past few months with our repeated posting to rbestof and winning Best Large Sub from truebestof   We are flattered and excited by this growth but at the same time have seen some growing pains occurring so we wanted to go ahead and address themLately we have seen quite a few rules debates occurring around here  They have gotten so bad that they ended up exceeding the actual number of posts that actually addressed the issue  Its fine that you want to debate the rules however if you feel passionately enough about them contact the moderators and ask for a clarification or ask to take them to a meta thread  We are here to answer questions not bog down a thread with debates over the definition of isNow let me go ahead and clarify a few thing outright  The rules are the absolute bare minimum that must be metMost top tier posts fit these guidelines  However we have seen quite a few mediocre posts using those terms loosely  We prefer that you exceed the rules  Copy pasta of an article is lazy posting and spammySomeone the other day simply copy and pasted the text of a wiki article as their entire post  Firstly always assume that the OP has read the bare minimum of information to include Wikipedia  You can quote it in your answer but as your only answer its just spammy and lazy  This leads me to  Simply throwing a link up is also a bit lazy If you are linking to a web site or another raskhistorians thread that already answered this question please give a TLDR for the links    Dont post just to save for later  There is a save link feature to redditPlease use it  You are just spamming up the thread  If you cant answer now dont answerIf you do not have to the time to answer dont throw up a I know the answer but I cant answer now  Just wait until you can answer please  Its not a race to karma and even though your answer may not end up at the top you can still use it later to get your flair if that is what you are after  If your answer begins with Im guessing or I dont know but I think or god forbid I was told by a guy I once knew just dont postIf you are not  sure of your answer just dont bother  It spams up the thread  This isnt a test you are taking and its not a contest to answer  I myself have stopped halfway through more posts than I have finished here because I wasnt  sure of my answer  Quit guessing you arent being graded  Source PLEASE if asked especially if you are not flairedIf you are being asked for a source it completely behooves you to find something to back up your claims especially if you are not a flaired user  Flaired users have shown that they are reliable and are able to substantiate their claims  Nonflaired users should really substantiate their claims with a source  No it doesnt need to be a citation down to the page but something should be available if you are asked  You probably arent the only person to read that book so it allows people to check your work  In any debate the mods pretty much are the final wordUnlike many other subs the moderator team here are actual experts in their fields varying from college professors to grad students to published writers to highly read amateurs  We also spend much of the day debating back and forth about new policies new rules and the way controversial posts are handled  Very little is done arbitrarily by power tripping mods outside of elimination of posts that blatantly violate the rules  When a mod says the post is not good enough and deletes it and you want to object take it to mod mail  When a mod asks for a source they are doing so for a reason just give sources  If you have any problems send it to mod mail do not spam up a thread with your Braveheart style FREEEDOM TO POST speechAnd before you ask yes mods here have changed their minds about things after they have been clarified  UPVOTED FOR AWESOME  You rock etc are spam  Stop itNuff said  Let your upvotes speak  Two sentences does not an answer make  If you are going to answer the question give an in depth quality answerIf your answer is something like this exchange Q What did pirates really sound like A Pirates came from like all over and they really wouldnt have sounded like you think they do  Then you have given a bad answer  You need to explain yourself clarify things show why  Anyone can write a two sentence answer someone who actually cares writes a paragraph  Actually answer the question  Quit trying to redefine the question for them and obfuscate that you dont actually know the answer  Just bloody answer itLately I have seen a lot of hand waving that doesnt actually answer the question  For example I myself asked the other day How many members of a Roman Legion were from the upper classes  The response I got was telling me all about how you had to be a leader in the legions to gain high office  Yes thats nice and all but it doesnt answer the question  If someone asks Why did Hitler have a mustache dont answer with a bunch of half thought statements about the history of facial hair answer that specific question    Stop with the nonsequitors  Only post something that is relevantSimilar to   If OP asks about the history of Islam in the Philippines dont say something like Bangladesh is Muslim too  Its irrelevant and makes you sound like Ralph Wiggum,Meta Some reminders and clarifications about answers,563,askhistorians,99793,8349

with their answer  Default statusAskhistorians WILL NEVER BECOME A DEFAULT SUB IF WE HAVE ANY SAY SO  I believe the way we put it in moderator discussion was I would rather burn this sub to the ground than let it become a default sub  That was me I said that and everyone agreed  We have already set the system to not allow this sub to become part of the default set  More postersWe recognize that there are more people posting here  Therefore we have a few things in place  Firstly we will be contacting users we have singled out for their quality posting to become moderators  This will bring the team up to about  moderators  This will allow moderators to participate as well as moderate as it will take some of the stress off of them  Additionally we would like to direct you to the Panel threadhttpwwwredditcomrAskHistorianscommentskurwthepanelofhistoriansiv and the Quality Contributor threadhttpwwwredditcomrAskHistorianscommentshjgdmetaflaireduserslistqualitycontributorflair  If you feel that you would like to receive flair or nominate someone for flair feel free to use these links to nominate yourself or othersAdditionally more posters means more users unfamiliar with this subreddits rules and culture  So let me direct you again to OUR RULEShttpwwwredditcomrAskHistorianswikirules as well as our GUIDELINES FOR RULEShttpwwwredditcomrAskHistorianscommentsrgmetasomeremindersandclarificationsabout  Think of them like this the Rules  Constitution Clarification  The Laws  Both are enforceable and will beWe also request that you view the POPULAR QUESTIONShttpwwwredditcomrAskHistorianswikifaq thread before you askNow we need to also make a few of our rules clear to you guys again  These are the important rules   year rule  If it has occurred in the past twenty years it is off limits pending moderator review  NO RACISM SEXISM HOMOPHOBIA OR OTHER BIGOTED BEHAVIORI am so not kidding  Do not think you are being clever we have many historians in this sub who actually specialize in racial sexual or gender history INCLUDING A MOD  We have had more than enough experience in recognizing the behavior  Yes if you come here and post something racist and you are from one of the several racist or other biggoted subreddits we will not only thoroughly thrash your propaganda but we will also ban you  Yes we will read through your posting history to see if you have a history of bigotry  No soapboxing or speechifyingYou hate America  Fine go somewhere else  You a die hard college communist  Great  Go somewhere else  This is not the place to recruit to rabble rouse to instigate  At this point we have plenty of experience spotting that too  You will have your post removed  Copy Pasting ANY SOURCE as your only way of posting is VERBOTEN  People come here to receive quality in depth analysis from historians history students and history buffs  Please assume the OP of the question isnt a complete moron and has googled for the answer  Additionally this is raskhistorians not raskgoogle  Yes you can copy and paste a source and give a summary of that link and source  but simply throwing up a link or a wall of copied text is intellectually lazy and will result in the post being removed  On topic relevant humor only  No memes advice animals reaction gifs or funny videos are allowed  The humor cannot be top tiered comments  Humor is allowed to stray more off topic in meta threads only  Jokes otherwise must be relevant on topic and hopefully funny  I personally hate puns  Topic drift  The original Godwins

Tiako,211,61,timi4,307,This is for above average general readers If the book averages two or more footnotes per page think twice and justify its inclusion Secondary and tertiary sources are strongly favored this is for general readers Feel free to ignore these suggestions but include reasons for why you are ignoring it ie This is an academic work but is highly readable As Agentdcf pointed out we dont want this turning into the History section at the Barnes amp Noble but also bare in mind that these works should be accessible both in terms of content and in terms of availability Anything however is acceptable with sufficient justificationSo without further adoGeneral Why the West Rules for Now by Ian Morris An excellent overview of both Western and Eastern history Morris combines a readable style and an ability to explain historical concepts in an easy manner with a historians rigor An excellent introduction to the topic of historical studies A Little History of the World by Ernst Gombrich It is essentially a summary of human history to around the s I read this when I was younger  its aimed perfectly at interested children and manages to be accessible and entertaining without being condescending Cities by John Reader A social history of the development of cities  particularly good chapters on the Renaissance and Mexico City stick in my mind Winchesters Atlantic is a very interesting history of the Atlantic Ocean and particularly of the relationship between Britain and the Americas It is somewhat similar to Kurlansky and Brysons work but still enjoyable Winchester has also written a book on the invention of the dictionary  I havent read it but its supposed to be excellent The Mediterranean in the Time of Philip the Second by Fernand Braudel Possibly the most important work of history of the th cen I probably wouldnt argue this but my point is the case can and has been made Its a major major work  and tremendously written When we talk about Jared Diamond were talking about big long slow processes as determining the shape of history Thats Braudel in a nutshellexcept he tried to deal with everything from trade warfare religion urbanism naval technology culture individual agency etc He may not have succeeded in explaining everything but he literally changed the game in France in the s and s and s in America when his work was translated into English Empires of the Word by Nicholas Oster A great work of general world history for the general public Exploring history through the lens of languages give a new perspective on many eras As a bonus a historians work is often based around reading primary sources  knowing why the primary sources are in a particular language helps you appreciate them all the more The Prize by Daniel Yergin Describes the history of the oil industry beginning in the s through the s Combines many historical narrative types to create a sweeping global narrative of how oil has impacted all aspects of society Particularly good at explaining the science aspect of the oil industryhow oil is found and produced how oil varies from region to region etcHistoriography Who Owns Antiquity by James Cuno Title is selfexplanatory  discusses issues of nationality and imperialism in the management of historical artefacts The author is making an argument against nationalistic retention but still provides a very good overview The Landscape of History John Lewis Gaddis If you are interested in how History and Historians view the world around them and the world of the past this is for you Youll often hear references to thinking like a lawyer or some other profession Gaddis sums up what it means to think like a historian He also provides a strong line in the sand between historical inquiry and the social sciences and I personally enjoyed him sort of tearing into the objectivity and the scientific approach that social scientists shroud themselves in What is History E H Carr Read this for the same reason you would read Gibbons decline and fall Its extremely eloquent and flat out beautiful in its prose at times E H Carr was a leading man in the historical field in the mid th century He treads a middle line between empiricism and idealism To quote from a review Arguably the central ideas in the book constitute todays mainstream thinking on British historical practice History A very short introduction John H Arnold Its short Its less a true historiography in that it doesnt get into method or theory and is more a history of history Again I will quote a far more able reviewerThis is an extremely engaging book lively enthusiastic and highly readable which presents some of the fundamental problems of historical writing in a lucid and accessible manner As an invitation to the study of history it should be difficult to resistPeter Burke Emmanuel College Cambridge That Noble Dream The Objectivity Question and the American Historical Profession by Peter Novick Addresses the naivete of the ideal of objectivity A nice complement to Gaddis in some respects though Gaddis is probably the better volumeModern HistoryThe study of history beginning with the th century globalizationEast Asia A Modern History of Japan by Andrew Gordon War without Mercy by John Dower is pretty much the best comparative look at race and ideology in the Pacific War Its long and a bit academic but theres none better WWII Americas Geisha Ally by Naoko Shibusawa Is a very readable account of the cultural and media politics of the US occupation of Japan It examines the transformation of Japan from implacable enemy to geisha ally in US eyes and in doing so explains much of Japans current relationship with the US US occupation of Japan Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader by Bradley K Martin It blends into journalism by the end plenty of descriptions of current happenings but his explanations of Japanese occupation revolution and Kim IlSungs rise to power was quite good Embracing Defeat by John Dower The benchmark book on immediate postwar culture in Japan It is a bit more readable than War Without Mercy Immediate PostWWII Rearranging the Landscape of the Gods by Sarah Thal Nominally this work is about the Konpira Shrine and its changes from the late Sengoku to the modern world But it goes far deeper and provides a vivid illustration of the extraordinary changes in Japanese socity particularly during the tumultuous times after the Meiji RestorationEuropeThe West Cod and Salt by Mark Kurlansky are similar to Bryson  both use a somewhat obscure but still fascinating subject matter to narrate the rise of America among other things His work is very readable The Balkans by Mark Mazower A Brief Summary of Balkan history to the present day but nevertheless very insightful A great starting point to see why people tend to have been wrong about the Balkans Yugosavia Twice there was a Country by John Lampe A great overview of the turbulent th century and the brief existence of a Yugoslav state Postwar A history of Europe since  by Tony Judt Very detailed and good overview of Europes post war history George Nicholas and Wilhelm by Miranda Carter A very good account of the politics leading up to WWI Carters thesis is that the actions of George V of England Nicholas II of Russia and Wilhelm of Germany had repercussions and led the countries to war It helps if you have an understanding of late th century politics but its not necessary Carters writing is pretty scholarly but I caught myself laughing a few times while reading  really readableEastern Europe Bloodlands Europe between Hitler and Stalin by Timothy Snyder Very readable account of the events in countries caught between the Soviet Union and Hitlers Germany during the beginnings of WWII starting with Ukraines Holodomor and the political tensions that rose from Stalins paranoia of outside influence during those events Really gives you a sense of the suffering of the people The Dictators by Richard Overy This is not quite a readable as Snyder but a very wellwritten and welldocumented comparative history of the regimes of Hitler and Stalin highly recommended for the enthusiast already familiar with the general details of each regimes history and wanting to really gain an understanding of their similarities and differences Darkness at Dawn The Rise of the Russian Criminal State by Satter Very readable and recent history of the rise of the criminal influence in Russian government following the downfall of the Soviet Union Really uses his understanding of Russian psychology gained by years as the Moscow correspondent for the WSJ to give insight into what happened and why Three books by Richard Pipes Russia Under the Old Regime The Russian Revolution and Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime Pipes has a somewhat conservative take on events but the writing clearly quarantines his opinion away from his facts and well for someone who still remembers standing in line around the block for stale bread in winter of  like myself his harsh criticism is not unjustified The Russian Revolution by Sheila Fitzpatrick is a shorter summary of the Revolution which is extremely readable The Oligarchs Wealth and Power in the New Russia by Davis Hoffman A very wellwritten account of the rise of the current Russian innercircle in the highest echelons of power under Putin in the years during the downfall of the Soviet Union Starts with short biographies of the  main players in this history and then gives a fascinating detailed account of their accumulation of and fights for powerNorth America  The Civil War Awakening by Adam Goodheart A popular history book that discusses the mood of the nation in the leadup to the Civil War Arc of Justice A Saga of Race Civil Rights and Murder in the Jazz Age by Kevin Boyle Winner of a National Book Award this book is a great introduction to housing discrimination and racial tensions in Detroit in the early part of the th century Red Hills and Cotton An Upcountry Memory by Ben Robertson Provides a history of the upcountry of South Carolina as memoirs Black Majority Negroes in Colonial South Carolina from  through the Stono Rebellion by Peter H Wood Discusses the early history of African slaves in Colonial South Carolina to the plantation period The Glorious Cause by Robert Middlekauf Rather by definition the master book on the Revolution Not formative or revolutionary in its approach but a comprehensive look at the entire war Who Killed Canadian History  Jack Granatstein If you want to go in to any depth in Canadian history reading Granatstein is a must This is one of his more controversial books its always under fire from other scholars which makes it an interesting read about Canadian history The Empire Within  Sean Mills Important because it provides detailed information about the rise and existence of the FLQ Important to show that Quebec has a distinct history from the rest of the country Towards Defining the Prairies Region Culture and History A Collection of Essays about the Canadian West from Gerald Friesen to WC Morton Way more academic Shows how unique the Canadian west is and much like Quebec how it has its own distinct history John Adams by David McCullough Very readable account of an often misunderstood man Particularly great at juxtaposing Adamss vanity with his genuine belief in the ideas of the American Revolution Battle Cry of Freedom by James McPherson Widely considered as the seminal onevolume work on the Civil War period focusing holistically on the economic social political and military aspects of the time Oxford History of the United States series of which I dont think I have seen anything negative written about any of the books in the series Parting the Waters America in the King Years  by Taylor Branch a Pulitzer Prize winning book detailing as the title implies the civil rights movement in the United StatesMiddle East Palestine and the ArabIsraeli Conflict a history with documents by Smith This is a nice concise history of the conflict that contains accessible documents that are relevant to the previous section It is largely lowbias and perfectly captures both sides of the debate Turkey A Modern History by Zurcher This book while lacking in primary source references in some spots is the most expansive modern history of a country that Ive ever read It manages its events in a clear way and connects the important events to the overall history of the middle east A History of the Arab Peoples Albert Hourani a classic in the discipline The Modern Middle East A History James Gelvin I think this book wants to avoid being a textbook but ends up in the same place but does it better and in fewer pages than Cleveland A Brief History of the Late Ottoman Empire M Şükrü Hanioğlu because none of the other synthetic histories of the late Ottoman Empire are as brief or succinctly worded as this one Osmans Dream A History of the Ottoman Empire by Caroline Finkel the best and really only singlevolume history of the OE Most of the rest are a snore to read A Quiet Revolution The First Palestinian Intifada and Nonviolent Resistance by Mary E KingThe title is fairly self explanatory but I think it gives a good analysis of the events Also the focus on the nonviolence movement and its effect are frequently missing from the popular discourse on the matter The Middle East A Brief History of the Last  Years by Bernard Lewis This is a very readable book by the fields leading scholar A History of Iran Empire of the Mind by Michael Axworthy Rule Of Experts Egypt Technopolitics and Modernity by Timothy Mitchell an innovative take on the history of the modern world in eight interlocking essays about Egypt in the th century which deal with everything from land surveys to the plagiarisms of midcentury anthropology to a history of the Aswan Dam from the perspective of a mosquito This book challenges traditional ways of talking about history by deemphasizing human agency and focusing on the formative power of knowledge practices and technology Afghanistan A Cultural and Political History by Thomas Barfield Broad history detailing the political changes that have taken place within Afghanistan over the past few centuries along with a readable description of the various ethnic groups residing within the country All the Shahs Men by Stephen Kinzer A great read about the overthrow of Irans shah the role of the US in that coup and the eventual rise of the revolutionary movement in the regionWestern EurasiaThe study of civilizations ultimately derived from Mesopotamian agricultureNear East Persian Fire by Tom Holland is a really great introduction whilst also being a great book about Greek History at the same time Now because he is deliberately constructing a comprehensive world for readers he is having to fill in quite a few gaps and in my opinion not always correctly But nonetheless his style of writing will leave you with a very clear image of the cultures he writes about  Rise and Fall of Egypt by Toby Wilkinson Its very well written with a superb narrative style and from an academic perspective its predominantly spot on It tends to gloss over some of the debates which are still ongoing but only to maintain a cohesive narrative The Twilight of Ancient Egypt by Karol Mysliwiec It covers the cultural melting pot in the Nile valley quite nicely and is very accessible in terms of style Not quite as general a history as Toby Wilkinson though The Tomb in Ancient Egypt by Salima Ikram which is comprehensive and full of beautiful pictures to properly track evolution of funerary culture  Complete Pyramids by Mark Lehner Of a similar ilk but more focused on the old kingdom complexes The Bible Unearthed by Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman Among the most popular introductory level books on any biblical subject ever written Just be a little bit careful Finkelstein works in his low chronology without preface which is good for his inteded audience but bad for a broader view as it remains contentious Its worth picking up Grabbes book to help spot where he does so Did God Have a Wife by William Dever Dever has a decidedly more conservative flair but trumps other more conservative scholars by being an archaeologist andfor the most partgiving the archaeology priority Israels History and the History of Israel by Mario Liverani Liverani stands out as being perhaps the truest scholar of the Ancient Near East generally to write on the history of Israel and this is valuable on that basis alone Ancient Israel What do we know and how do we know it by Lester Grabbe Despite the somewhat colloquial feel of the title this is not light reading Nor is it intended to be it provides a succinct easily understandable discussion of all of the major debates in Israelite archaeology today It wonderfully fills a fairly obvious gap for a quick and dirty reference for recent discoveries Biblical History and Israels Past Megan B Moore and Brad E Kelle  I cant say enough about how fantastic this book is The breadth and accessibility of this overview of the current state of research is incredible The suggested reading at the end of each chapter provides a wonderful selection of equally readable texts at least among ones Ive read Just  fantasticClassical CivilizationIron Age Europe The World of the Celts by Simon James Provides a condensed overview of the Celtic world including everything from theoretical beginnings to the idea of modern Celts and from fighting Rome to farming practices The Atlantic Celts Ancient People or Modern Invention by Simon James A very short book which outlines the development of the Celtic myth Its conclusions are fairly controversial but some very interesting light is shone on the creation of national identitiesGreece Thundering Zeus The Making of Hellenistic Bactria by Frank L Holt  Its quite a current book its well researched its a great introduction to Bactria and to Central Asia as an entity From Samarkhand to Sardis by Susan Sherwin White and Amelie Kuhrt Its very well written it introduced the approach of looking at the Hellenistic world and Seleucid Empire in their own right as opposed to just an extension of Classical Greece and it is very comprehensiveRome Why Rome Fell by Adrian Goldsworthy Goldsworthy is the author of numerous works of popular history and is very familiar with the form He provides and excellent and detailed narrative as well as an analysis focused on political systems The Fires of Vesuvius by Mary Beard Readable and lively Beard captures the vivacious character of Pompeii along with providing an introduction to the field of classical archaeology Rubicon by Tom Holland A great read that really brings Republican Rome to life Mediterranean Anarchy Interstate War and the Rise of Rome by Arthur Eckstein Im probably biased because Dr Eckstein is one of my professors but this book brought up an idea of why Rome came to be the preeminent Mediterranean power that hadnt really been explored extensively yet Eckstein chose to explain it in modern Realist terms of political relations and alliances rather than the raw brutality and tendencies towards violence which characterized the period  something he argues was not unique to Rome at all nor were they better at it than anyone as was the prevailing theory The Fall of Rome and End of Civilization by Bryan WardPerkins A work that has quickly become a standard it uses archaeology to provocatively draw a harsh line between the Roman and postRoman world It also functions as an excellent introduction to archaeology and the Roman economyMedieval The Year  by Robert Lacey and Danny Danziger a fascinating narrative history of the year  It is short and certainly aimed at a mass market but still informative and entertaining Exploring the World of the Vikings by Richard Hall Written by the former head of the archaeological digs in York its the best and most uptodate overview of the Viking age Its a bit archaeologyheavy but in that field thats a must due to the basically nonexisting genuine historical tradition The Crusades The Authoritative History of the War for the Holy Land by Thomas Asbridge Asbridge is one of the leading modern scholars of the crusades and this books is not only expansive in its scope covering the crusading movement from genesis to the aftermath of the fall of Acre but it is also quite readable Plus its quite inexpensive for a scholarly work Heavily focused on the Third Crusade particularly on Saladin and Richard The Grand Strategy of the Byzantine Empire by Edward Luttwak Luttwak focuses on the general narrative of Byzantium in this book He spends time detailing the military social political and cultural realities of the Byzantine Empire and outlines why it was able to function as long as it did in spite of a great many internal and external stressors The Civilization of the Middle Ages A Completely Revised and Expanded Edition of Medieval History by Norman F Cantor he is able to explain the schism of the Catholic church very well as well as the various societies He also presents a theory on why Eastern Europe opposed the use of iconsEarly Modern Natashas Dance by Orlando Figes is a very readable record of Russian history and cultural identity from Peter the Great to the Soviet Union The Origins of Modern Europe  by James L White Readable summary of European history during that period  Ive only used a few chapters for papers but it was extremely useful Crucible of War The Seven Years War and the Fate of Empire in British North America  by Fred Anderson It was a great book about the events that proceeded and Anderson asserts helped to bring about the American Revolution while also touching upon the broader war between Britain and France throughout the world Havana the Philippines India Europe But dont be fooled this is mainly focused on the invasion of Canada and what would become the Midwest and the immediate aftermath The Dutch Republic Its Rise Greatness and Fall  by Jonathan Israel An impressive scholarly welldocumented account of the history of the Low Countries in relation to the rest of Early Modern Europe Yet very accessible for the general reader The Rise of Modern Warfare  by HW Koch Absolutely full of etchings portraits and diagrams Divided into several sections based on country England France Russia etc as well as general discussion of modern warfare Each section discusses uniform armament and tactics Suitable for indepth study or just looking at the pictures For Russian history anything by Robert Massie Peter the Great Catherine the Great The Romanovs Very readable wellwritten wellresearched very detailed and indepth and yet never boring accounts of Russian history History of Russia by Vernadsky A readable overview of Russian history from Kievan Rus through WWII if you get one of the later editions the earliest edition was published in  Much better written than Riasanovskys stillinprint book of the same name which I could never understand why people enjoy reading The Return of Martin Guerre by Natalie Zemon Davis Heavy archival research backs an exploration of common culture in a thcentury French village Particularly present are questions of identity evidence and community This is a very popular work by a celebrated American cultural historian of early modern France The Cheese and the Worms The Cosmos of a SixteenthCentury Miller by Carlo Ginzburg The author uses archival research to address questions of how common people lived in early modern northern Italy The book offers a glimpse of the ways common people participated in the discourse of ideas in counterreformation ItalyEarly Modern Colonial Mayflower by Nathaniel Philbrick  a very good book about the founding of Plymouth Plantation and the first  years afterwards Mayflower Bastard  An interesting book about a young boy on the Mayflower and his life afterwards up to and including the Salem Witch Trials The style of the book is offputting to some and the author has been criticised for including too much supposition but it is worth a read Savage Kingdom by Benjamin Woolley  a very well written account of the Jamestown colony including a lot of detailed build up explaining the background to the colonys founding Almost as much of the book is set in England as it is in the new colony Big Chief Elizabeth by Giles Milton  Giles Milton is definitely popular rather than academic history but he has a great readable style and his books seem to be well researched This book is about the precursors to the Jamestown colony in Virginia including the lost colony of Roanoke The Island at the Centre of the World by Russell Shorto  the story of the founding of New York New Amsterdam based on th century Dutch records which have only recently been discoveredtranslated An extremely good book A Voyage Long and Strange by Anthony Horowitz  a popular history book about early European colonisation attempts of America before the successful Jamestown colony Written as a semitravelogue by the author but an interesting read The Age of Reconnaissance by J H Parry A formidable classic on the Western Expansion and the age of exploration Parry provides a dense but excellent description of how the west was able to conquer and their motivations His section on the development of scientific navigation is particularly goodEast Asian HistoryThe study of civilizations ultimately derived from the Yellow River ValleyChina China A New History by John K Fairbank An excellent introduction to the topic by the doyen of American Sinology Chinas modern history is the main concern but the earlier periods are treated sufficiently The Search for Modern China by Jonathan Spence Its a pretty good overview that starts with the Ming and goes through the late s Covers all the bases Nothing is covered in exceptional depth with a subject like China it rarely can be in a single book but for a general idea of recent Chinese history its more than adequate Also a very readable book A History of Chinese Civilization by Jacques Gernet A readable and detailed survey of Chinese history that is notable for not prejudicing modern history over earlier periods It heavily focuses on intellectual and cultural history and at times the details of the political history get ignored but any survey this ambitious must make cuts The account of the nineteenth century is particularly vivid Chinas Cosmopolitan Empire The Tang Dynasty by Mark Edward Lewis Divided between sections on history geography the economy society and culture this book is comprehensive without being overloadedwhether your interests are agriculture the status of women or the nature of the poet in society you will find information here It also does well at torpedoing national mythologyJapan As We Saw Them by Masao Miyoshi is a highly readable account of the first Japanese mission to the west It offers an interesting reversal of the typical narrative of Westerners observing inscrutable Orientals  Civilization and Monsters by Gerald Figal an academic book but extremely readable in my opinion the one amazon reviewer disagrees Its central thesis that discourse on monsters ghosts the supernatural was central to the formation of modern Japan is surprisingly innovative and fun to read Meiji periodMongolia Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World Entertaining interesting and good for history geeks and the general population There are some misrepresentations that the author makes and I also think that he relies on the Secret History a little too much but all in all awesomeSouth Asian History Modern South Asia

Asia with a wellrounded perspective of the subsequent nationalist movementsNative American PeoplesPreColumbian  by Charles Mann A popular history book that covers the general history of Native Americans until European contact It discusses both North and South America Although Mann is not a professional historian his work is very thoughtprovoking and approachable for a layaudience He also has a followup book  which covers interactions between Europeans and Native Americans postcontactPostColumbian The Cherokee Cases This book isnt too difficult and it adds in a great deal about President Jackson which is always a crowd pleaser Although this might sadden a great deal of Jackson lovers This book details the politics behind Worcester v Georgia and Cherokee Nation v Georgia which are the cornerstones of Native American Law Custer Died For Your Sins by Vine Deloria Jr This book went a long way in shifting the focus of Anthropology and History away from Indians as objects and victims towards Indians as active participants Written in  I make sure students read this before they are allowed to talk about Native History Indians have fantastic senses of humor and this book really shows it Landscape Traveled by Coyote and Crane by Rodney Frey This is is a representation of the perfect way in which to work with tribes to do Anthropology and History He uses old stories and modern stories told by living Coeur dAlene people to contextualize everything he writes He involves the Coeur dAlene people without losing his focus or professionalism Trail of Tears The Rise and Fall

photograph as well as biographies of other pioneers and an indepth discussion of their techniques Picture Machine The Rise of American Newspictures by William Hannigan and Ken Johnston While mostly a

Italy as a case study Cultural forces like patronage and identity have large roles in protoscientific circles Playboy and the Making of the Good Life in America by Elizabeth Fraterrigo and Bachelors

s You dont even have to have read Playboy to understand themExploration The Last Expedition Stanleys Mad Journey Through the Congo by Daniel Liebowitz and Charles Pearson This is the ideal book for anyone interested in Exploration Stanley represents the end of the colonial explorer because of the intense and frightening stories brought back to England Over the Edge of the World by Laurence Bergreen Bergreen is not a professional historian but he presents the story of Magellans circumnavigation in an entertaining way He doesnt add anything new to the table but I can respect someone who can take primary documents and make them enjoyable to read Longitude by Dava Sobel This book details how the world figured to procedure of finding longitudinal coordinates in the world Great Britain offered a huge cash prize to anyone able to work out a way to find longitude Without a way to track longitude reliably ships had been getting lost and running aground The Worst Journey in the World by

terrorism from the ancient world to the present day with a particularly lucid section differentiating terrorism from other acts of violence academic A History of Terrorism by Walter Laqueur Another broad history of terrorism Laqueur takes an interesting stance arguing that history and the social sciences cant accurately explain terrorism instead he believes studying literature is the best method for arriving at accurate conclusions about the phenomenon Inside Terrorism by Bruce Hoffman Maybe considered the best work on terrorism Holistic study explaining the era of modern terrorism present with particularly adept analysis of the relationship between the media and terrorist groups academic The Looming Tower by Lawrence Wright Excellent narrative history of the birth and rise of alQaeda

by E P Sanders A popularization of his important work Jesus and Judaism Intended for nonspecialists which may find the former incomprehensible The Historical Jesus Life of a Mediterranean Jewish Peasant by John Crossan I personally disagree with pretty well every word Crossan writes But even when hes wrong hes wonderfully productive A contrast to Sanders view representing two sides of one of the major debates of the last quarter century or so Paul A Very Short Introduction by E P Sanders Sanders work on Paul in his more academic books revolutionized Pauline studies over the last half century The VSI series is always excellent and this is no exception A wonderful introduction to recent work on Paul and the socalled New Perspective on PaulHistory of Science The Pasteurization of France by Bruno Latour I think Latour does a good job at showing the social and cultural prerequisites necessary to encourage the French to accept Pasteurs microbes as revealed truth as well as the process by which these conditions are obscured in favor of the Great Man thesis  A Social History of Truth Civility and Science in SeventeenthCentury England by Steve Shapin Shapin deftly argues that the practice of science in seventeenthcentury England relied heavily on the reliable word of experts in a particular field as experiments were expensive and laborious to reproduce Trust emerges as a critical element in the production of scientific knowledge and Shapin demonstrates that what we assume to be objective in science often rests on this foundation of trust in the scientist as it does in every academic field Galileo Courtier The Practice of Science in the Culture of Absolutism by Mario Biagioli Biagioli shows how crucial the patronclient relationship was for scientists in early modern Europe  particularly for Galileo and his principal patron Pope Urban VIII Again this is another work that unpacks the social networks that undergirded scientific study Objectivity by Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison The book traces a critical problem of representation in the Scientific Revolution particularly relating to representing objects of scientific study in atlases For example when making an entry for oak trees in a botany book what kind of picture should one include No two oak trees will look the same though they will look similar so how does the artist draw it so that it can be easily recognized in real life by referencing the atlas How do you draw something like cloud formations in an atlas to demonstrate the difference between Cirrus and Cumulus clouds even though clouds are constantly changing shape Daston and Galison do a great job explaining the context of these debates and anxieties and what they reveal about the practice of science,The AskHistorians Master Book

Fogge,21,67,1nw9mg,234,Hi Askhistorians longtime reader occasional contributor and firsttime askerI often raise Ibn Battuta as an example of unknown explorers that should be more known when I talk about the Age of discovery andor Marco PoloChristopher Columbusand all that with my students Today it struck me I have no idea about some more practical detailsSome of the facts of his life suggests to me that he came from a decently wealthy background legal scholars and he got to study so it is not surprising that he would manage to undertake a pilgrimage The travels to Mecca took  months mainly due to detours and I guess it is at least feasible that a sum of money that will last that long can be taken in normal travel luggage However when he arrived in Mecca and was done instead of travelling home he decided to keep traveling and did so an enourmously long time Whatever leftover cash was intended for the journey home cant have lasted long the amount of enlistment possibilities working as a caravan guard or aboard a ship mostly covers travels expenses so  what givesFinding a place to sleep without paying is one thing but how did he afford food and presumably travel costs and as the travels dragged on new clothes and such He even marriedEDIT I should clarify that I am mostly interested in the  time frame as his later travels mostly were done while being employed,How did someone such as Ibn Battuta practically and logistically travel and keep travelling,301,askhistorians,13302,1005
eternalkerri,82,61,13vmq6,232,I love movies  Love them love them love them  So with my rather long list of films from all eras Ive seen its interesting to me to see how acting in the films themselves changedFilms from the beginning of the talkies up until about the mid to late s have an especially different flavor  The dialogue is more formal enunciation is more pronounced fight scenes are stiffer with more exaggerated moves the wind up and punch faces dont seem to be as expressive and the voice seems to carry more expression  Also the actors seem to be much louder or at least their voices carry a lot of weight behind themMy personal theory is that many of the actors from that era came from theater where facial expression is not as important as vocal expression  Additionally movements had to be more pronounced to be visible to the entire audience  Additionally the audio recording equipment of the time was not as high of a quality as it is today requiring the actors be be more formal in their pronunciation  By the time the late s into the s and beyond a new generation of actors and directors had arrived in Hollywood who were more exposed to film than theater causing them to shift to a more naturalistic styleAm I off base on this one,Why is film acting from the s s and s so much different than acting from the late s to today,293,askhistorians,99794,8349
