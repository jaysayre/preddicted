Have a look at this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5Q5rFf-aZI#t=156) as a sort of visual aid to what i'm talking about. 

How is the circuit complete if the electrons being emitted from the cathode travel through the hole in the centre of the anode? How are the electrons “replenished” on the cathode? Are they not replaced in the power source? I understand how the electrons are released from the cathode using laser light or thermionic emission. Surely keeping the cathode at high voltage is not sustainable? Or is there a finite number of electrons that can be ejected from the cathode?

So nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. And the closer something does travel to the speed of light, the slower time goes relative to that object. Is this correct? So theoretically, if something travels faster than the speed of light, this object would travel back in time. I was hoping someone could explain to me why light and time are directly related.

I believe my confusion arises because I find myself comparing light to sound. For example, if someone fires a gun, it takes time before that sound reaches you. If you outrun the sound, you will not hear the gunshot for a second, but it doesn't mean the gunshot never happened.

Why is it different for light? Using a similar example, if a star explodes, it takes time before that light reaches you. I would assume that if you outran the light, it would only mean that you wouldn't see that happen for a bit, and not that you were outrunning the event itself.

- Fill fuel tank right to the very top, so it's literally at the cap when it's closed
- Roll car over to the side of the petrol station
- Car is gradually warmed up (to say +30c)

Now, using some more reputable sources than the above link I was able to find the following:

&gt; A collection of galaxies that is a whopping four billion light years long is the biggest cosmic structure ever seen. The group is roughly one-twentieth the diameter of the observable universe – *big enough to challenge a principle dating back to Einstein, that, on large scales, the universe looks the same in every direction.* 

- NewScientist in summary of a paper from Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, DOI: 10.1093/mnras/sts497

There is on the flip side another paper ""Seeing patterns in noise: Gigaparsec-scale `structures' that do not violate homogeneity"" (arXiv:1306.1700 [astro-ph.CO] [[Link](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.1700v2.pdf)]) which states in the abstract:

&gt; If true, this would represent a serious challenge to the standard cosmological model. However, the homogeneity scale is an average property which is not necessarily affected by the discovery of a single large structure. I clarify this point and provide the first fractal dimension analysis of the DR7 quasar catalogue to demonstrate that it is in fact homogeneous above scales of at most 130 Mpc/h, which is much less than the upper limit for \Lambda CDM. In addition, I show that the algorithm used to identify the Huge-LQG regularly finds even larger clusters of points, extending over Gpc scales, in explicitly homogeneous simulations of a Poisson point process with the same density as the quasar catalogue. This provides a simple null test to be applied to any cluster thus found in a real catalogue, and suggests that the interpretation of LQGs as `structures' is misleading.

Has the discovery of U1.27 actually cast any doubt on the cosmological principle, is there actually any serious debate on this subject, and are there any additional resources that may cast light on the subject?

Do we have to technology to do such a thing? How could we even go about it? I know the article mentioned something about Mars not having a magnetic field and that is why is can't protect itself. Could we make one? Or in the near future will we have the technology to do so?

However he doesn't explain whether stable orbits under non-Newtonian relativistic gravity are impossible even in theory, or just impossible based on the kind of orbits we have in our particular solar system.  Is it possible to construct an orbit that is permanently stable?  If if it, is this kind of orbit unstable according to possible unproven harmonizations of gravity with quantum theories (String/M-Theory or Loop Quantum Gravity)?","Under relativity, is a stable orbit even theoretically possible?",8

I would expect that such a particle could interact with others at any location instantaneously regardless of distance.

I was hoping that someone would be able to explain this in relatively simple terms, and provide some insight into how this functions to the benefit of the distribution of primes.

My basic understanding thus far is that the Riemann Zeta function is deeply tied to the prime number theorem - and that the prime number theorem essentially states that the distribution of prime numbers is greater as the number of considered integers, 'n', becomes increasingly large. I also know that the PNT has a predictive capability of the form 1/(ln(x)) which becomes more accurate as 'n' becomes large.

Poddster,3,1,1qja8u,8,"When explaining the concept of number bases other than decimal to someone else (e.g. binary, octal, hex), I suddenly thought about the notion of *bitwise operators* and if they exist in other number systems. Naturally I didn't let that thought be part of the explanation, as I didn't want to confuse. 

So now I get to confuse you, ask science. 

3 examples of bitwise operators are `AND`, `OR` and `XOR`.  An example of their use:

|AND | 0 | 1  |
|---|--|---|       
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |       

|OR | 0 | 1  |
|---|--|---|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

|XOR | 0 | 1  |
|---|--|---|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |

(similar to a multiplication table or an addition table).


The question is: Does such a concept of bitwise (or I suppose digit-wise) operator exist in other base systems? Are there any operations in decimal that operate across pairs of digits in equal-length numbers? What about any other exotic bases?

Note: I'm not talking about doing something you might see in programming languages, e.g. in C `244 | 1` or `0x100 &amp; 0xFFF`, as those decimal and hexadecimal literal operands are still operated on in terms of binary bitwise operators, rather than in terms of decimal or hexdecimal digitwise operators. They're simply 'converted' to binary first (in as much as they're never not binary in a computer system, but I hope you get my drift)

So in decimal:

|??? | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 
|----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0  | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| 1  | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| 2  | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| 3  | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| 4  | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? |

| 8  | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? |

So, maybe if you drink half a gallon of 40 proof vodka and don't eat anything else, you won't get morbidly obese, but anything more than that and it seems you'd be getting a lot of calories. I mean, calories are calories and will be converted to fat regardless of the source, right?

john_alan,4,0,1qg0bz,2,"Hi,

I've been wondering about this for a while, let's take say a simple iPhone application, like the contacts app.

It's just a scrollable table full of names. I understand how this is composed, a table view that's supplied an array of names, and I understand the app is informed of events like touches and scroll gestures.

My question:

I've seen basic source code for these kind of apps and my question is, when they are idle (ie. no touch events/ gesture events to handle) are they in a constant loop polling for events?

To explain why i'm asking lets take some examples,


1) A simple c app that adds two ints, and is written entirely in the main function willl add two numbers and end instantly.

2) If I write an app that has a never ending **for** loop, it will ramp one of my cpu cores up to 100%

3) All applications end, unless they are in some kind of loop

So to my question,

Why are iPhone apps/desktop apps that are totally idle not eating up an entire core of cpu as they blisteringly loop as fast as possible though source code?


In the iOS app source I mentioned above I can't even see a loop, it's just a load of methods, so why doesn't it just end as soon as it reaches the end of it's ""main"" and if it is infact looping continuously how come it uses basically ZERO cpu unlike my never ending for loop which is also looping forever?

Dancat1238,6,1,1qgekc,5,"A few points to help clarify.  I realize that the solar system model has been thrown out.  I also realize that an electron only has a probability to exist in a given position, spin, orbital, shape, etc.  That being said, Newtonian physics tells us that planets stay in orbit because there are two components to their motion- a tangential velocity component, and a radial acceleration.  We're the radial forces (gravity) to be turned off, the planet would fly off in a straight line, and were the tangential velocity stopped, the planet would fall directly into the other body.  

So, with electrons, we know there is an attractive force due to the negative charge of electron and the positive charge of the proton.  Also, although the mass is negligible, perhaps at these minute distances there is a radial gravitational force. So that makes two radial forces.  Additionally, these things are zipping around extremely fast- a tangential component perhaps.  So what's all the confusion about? Have I just solve the conundrum and resolved the differences between quantum mechanics and classical physics?  What is inherently wrong about this analysis?

Side question- just learned about the shape of sub orbitals, and besides the ""s"" orbital, they seem to jut out to the side of the nucleus.  So does this mean the other orbitals do not actually orbit (as in go completely around) the nucleus, merely hover in their given space?

NingPoHo,2,1,1qf5cd,1,"Dear Science Experts, 

This may be obvious, but I’ve pondered this question for a long time and have never found a satisfactory answer.  The Hubble Ultra Deep Sky View caught images of proto galaxies forming 13.2 billions years ago.  Wiki states that the best measurement of the age of the universe is 13.798±0.037 billion years (elsewhere 15-20 billion years) since the Big Bang.  We can find this is by correlating the redshift of different galaxies with their distance from earth, then calculate backwards to a point of origin in time.  Granted there are other ways to estimate the age of the universe (such as analyzing the cosmic background radiation left over from the Big Bang) so my question is limited to visual astronomy.

Here’s my problem.  Common sense tells us that the earth is not the center of the universe or the big bang, although we’re not on the edge of it, either.  Wouldn’t looking back 13.2 billion light years in one direction imply a radius of far greater width?  What happens to the age of the universe if we add the distance to the edge of the universe in the opposite direction?  

Thank you,

This is the experiment I had in mind, I've assigned arbitrary values, to help me understand the problem (and any solutions you suggest) better, please feel free to suggest your own, if that will help. 

Experiment: I am swinging a weight of 1Kilo around my hand, on a string of length 1Metre. There is a spring balance (like this one: http://visual.merriam-webster.com/images/science/measuring-devices/measure-weight/spring-balance.jpg ) attached to the string*.

1. What would the reading on the scale be when: The spring balance is fixed at (a)25, (b)50 and (c)75 centimetres.

2. How do the calculations change based on how fast I swing the weight?

What I would eventually want to know is:
A. Do the centripetal and centrifugal forces cancel each other out at any point along the length of the string? My guess is that they do, at the point where the weight is attached to the string. 

B. Does the relationship change depending on how fast I am swinging the object? 
While the logical answer is that the relationship shouldn't change, since the centrifugal and centripetal forces are both increasing proportionately (right?), common sense tells me that at one point centrifugal force will overwhelm the centripetal force, causing the string to snap, and the object to fly off at a tangent (which I guess is similar to 'escape velocity')

I've looked up articles on how stuff works and even some other askscience threads about orbits and orbital velocities, but couldn't find anything specifically addressing my first question. I'd greatly appreciate it if you could show me the 'working' of your solutions, so I could understand the process better, but any answers at all would be awesome.

Also, I'm not sure if I've made myself clear at all, If there is an error in the question or I'm being unclear about something, comment or PM me and I'll try to resolve/explain as best as I can.

Pluvialis,6,6,1qc6h1,12,"Is there a hard dividing line between gas and liquid, in principle?

I was thinking about the inhaling in space question someone asked earlier and got to wondering about water evaporating in a vacuum again (as you do).

As I understand it, liquid water sits in my saucepan because, although the molecules are 'loose', they don't have enough energy to overpower the Earth's atmospheric pressure. That's why in a vacuum liquid water will immediately evaporate. One might naively hypothesise that gravity would keep it in, but in fact it's only atmospheric pressure that normally maintains a liquid phase. I hope I'm right so far.

So if I had water vapour in a canister or something, and slowly compressed it, eventually I'd get a canister of liquid water. But how would it transition? Would a pool of water, or droplets, i.e. something with a surface, slowly form? If so, why? What would happen if you expanded it again slowly? Wouldn't the water molecules all just gradually get further and further apart, belying the distinction we normally make between gas and liquid?

For some reason that image seems wrong, but I don't know why it shouldn't happen. I feel like probably it would instead 'boil'. But which one is it, and why?

EDIT: Bonus question (I don't know if that's allowed but...) - How much do atmospheric gas molecules simply follow free-falling trajectories, versus being jostled about by neighbouring gaseous molecules? Would a molecule of oxygen fly up from the surface of the Earth, slowing down until gravity pulls it back down, or does it just get smacked about a relatively smaller volume by other molecules?

Well, I have been trying to analyze a wide variety of people's agility in various circumstances. But I have been mainly focusing on soccer and American football. 

I have been comparing the agilities in players such as Lionel Messi (about ~5'7"") and Cristiano Ronaldo (~6'1"") in addition to a wide variety of running-backs and wide-receivers in the NFL.  Thinking in terms of soccer may help. I do know for sure that people who are taller than 6'4"" or 6'3"" will have trouble making cuts versus people who are, in example 5'7"".

I guess my question is this: What heights in general would allow someone to have virtually the same agility as someone who is about 5'7""? 
Could someone who is 6'2"" be JUST as agile as someone at 5'10""? 
What heights are the upper limit in terms of good agility?
(I guess if you used the soccer POV: could someone who is 6'2"" make cuts JUST AS well as someone who is 5'7""?; what is the tallest height someone could be before they are not as agile as someone who is 5'7""?)

So far, I've done the math, applying the boundary conditions to get the displacement as a function of x and t:

&gt; y(x,t) =  Σ(n→∞) A*sin(nπx/L) *e^iωt

Where A and ω are also dependent on n (I can't seem to get subscripts to work).

For initial conditions, I assume that the string is going to be plucked, and so ∂y/∂t = 0 for all x at t=0, and y(x,0) will look something like this:

 http://i.imgur.com/8is1rXG.png

Where h is the displacement where the string is plucked, L is the length of the string, and aL is the location where the string is plucked (so a is some number between 0 and 1).

I worked out what the amplitudes A should be using Fourier analysis. I won't write out the formula for the amplitudes because it's kind of messy, but I'm pretty sure I've got it right, because here is what I get for a string of length 10, displaced by 1 unit when plucked in the middle (first 32 modes):

Or would it be a sufficient approximation to calculate the fundamental angular frequency, ω1=k1c=πc/2L, plus those of (say) the first 31 overtones, and just add together sinusoids of those frequencies to get the final sound wave?

And if so, which sinusoidal functions should I use? My time-dependent function is e^iωt. Should I just use the real part of that (i.e., cos(ωt))?

I vaguely recall some of that little bit of electrochemistry from gen chem, but it's been a couple of years.  I'm hoping someone can give me some perspective on what some of this means, especially as it might apply to scaling it up so that's practical.

""The standard redox voltage per electron for carbon dioxide splitting is 1.33V at 25oC/1 atm.  The thermoneutral voltage is about 1.47V, which is nearly the same as that for water electrolysis.  When the Ohmic losses are added to thermoneutral voltage, a cell voltage of about 2 V or more is generally required to drive the reaction in aqueous electrolytes.""

Suppose a charge oscillates between P and Q inside a star. What determines the ""amplitude"" of the pulse?*

I imagine a fist punching a massive block of Jell-O. The force/energy of the punch is determined by the mass of the fist and it's speed, the time it takes to travel from P to Q. The fist momentarily squeezes some of the Jell-O, causing it to bulge at the top and starting the traveling sine wave pattern we usually think of as ""wave"". The physical wave pulse traveling through the Jell-O has an amplitude proportional to the energy of the punch and the strength of the chemical bonds between Jell-O molecules.

In the star, the ""fist"" is a charge, and the ""punch"" is the charge oscillating between P and Q. The amplitude of the wave is proportional to the electric potential energy between P and Q, I think.
The wave pulse travels through space to a radio antenna on Earth.

Now at a radio telescope on Earth or at the opposite edge of the Jell-O block we can measure the energy of the wave, and derive the amplitude. Right?

Fun fact: I was just watching Cosmos (episode 2) where Carl Sagan says the energy of all the radio waves we have received in all the radio telescopes on Earth is less than the energy of a single snowflake hitting the ground.

*Just had a thought about controlling the amplitude of a pulse: by increasing or decreasing the charge at P. Right?

Example: my computer with an LCD monitor consumes on average 200W.

Most of the electric energy consumption transfers ""directly"" into heat energy.

But some of the energy output is of course electromagnetic (light from the monitor), sound from the speakers and fans, mechanical (vibrations, HDD platters etc) and magnetic (motors/fans) etc.

Light from the monitor, sound waves, and mechanical vibrations would all transfer into heat energy eventually, or am I wrong?

Does this mean that a 200W computer does more or less the same job as a 200W heating element (i.e. an electric heater), or is there a lot less heat output in a computer system if you do a direct comparison?
