lewe,0,0,1r9824,1,"My mother insists that we must boil our meat and skim the broth before cooking it because it removes the blood. This blood is apparently the major source of the 腥气 (which means the stench of meat basically). However, I looked this up and according to the FDA,

&gt;Many people think the red liquid in packaged fresh beef is blood. However, blood is removed from beef during slaughter and only a small amount remains within the muscle tissue. Since beef is about 3/4 water, this natural moisture combined with protein is the source of the liquid in the package.

Basically this idea of boiling the meat and skimming the blood-froth turned out to be a myth. The meat is what causes the ""stench"" and nothing else.

Kloud1112,0,0,1r96gx,2,"Hello. First off, I am new to Reddit so if I did this wrong, please forgive me.

Second, my actual post: I am a twenty-two year old male who is writing a novel that takes place in the 1990's. Technically I grew up in the 90's (I was born in '91), but I really need a larger perspective on the decade. So what I need before I begin writing is research on the culture of the nineties. I’ve read a bunch of books, but I’d like some first-hand accounts. More specifically, I’d like to talk with people who were either in high school, college or their young adult years during the nineties to hear their side of the stories. I suppose that would put you in the age range of thirties/forties.

Here’s a quick blurb of the actual novel: 

“Take a trip to Soundheim, Pennsylvania, circa 1993. Grunge is on the rise, The Gulf War is over, flannel shirts are all the rage and the world is about to change, but Brian Toddler couldn’t be more depressed. His parents have recently divorced and he is about to turn fifteen—he stands on the threshold of change, but is completely consumed by a sweltering rage. As he enters high school he embarks on a quest for identity that takes him through failed love affairs, fantasy games and a fateful decision that could have life-altering consequences.

Meanwhile, his friends face their own internal challenges: C.J. Denner, a fantasy-obsessed aspiring filmmaker, must reconcile his own illusions with the harsh reality surrounding him; Raymond Harris, a trailer-park kid, is abused by his stepfather as he experiments with a world of sexual deviancy and Spencer Elsworth grapples with his religious beliefs while seeking freedom from the tyrannical rule of his oppressive father.

And once the enigmatic Becky Strausberg enters the picture, the boys’ lives are changed forever. Sharp and insightful, she instantly attracts the attention of C.J. They embark on a whirlwind relationship fraught with passion and tragedy. She teaches the boys the importance of life, but houses a dark secret that forces them to confront their darkest fear: growing up…”

I wanna know your favorite shows, games, movies, extra-curricular activities. What were some of your favorite restaurants to go to? Music to listen to? What did you and your friends like to do? Hobbies? Sports? Food?

I’d like to know about fads. What did you like to wear? What did others like to wear? What did most people look like (in your eyes)?

And about culture. What were some big events you remember? What affected you?

And most importantly I want to know who YOU were back then. Feel free to share ANYTHING. 

If there's something you don't feel like sharing in the open forum of Reddit, feel free to private message me! It would be cool to have a correspondent(s) to help me out with verisimilitude as I go through the writing process. 

Introduce yourself, your name, age, what you do, where you grew up, etc. I want to know all kinds of stories about you and your friends—parties you went to, pranks you pulled, struggles you had to deal with, etc. Seriously, don’t hold back. Sex stories. Drug trips. Crimes committed. Give it to me (I’m not a cop and I’ll preserve all anonymity). Whether it was sex, drugs, or rock-n-roll, I want to hear it ALL!

Some specific things I’d to hear about (although certainly not limited to): mental illnesses (how were you treated, how did you feel, why did you feel, how you coped, etc.), concerts (what were they like, who were your favs, etc.), film (this is a biggie—did you go to film school? What kind of equipment did you use?, How did you make your films?, how did cameras work then?, what kinds?, etc.), abortion (how did you go about getting one? How much did they cost back then?), wrestling, divorce and religion. Maybe these seem odd, but they play important parts in the novel, so I’d like to know more.

Also, the book takes place in Soundheim, Pennsylvania, which is an analog for my hometown Pottstown, Pennsylvania. So if you happened to grow up in Pottstown, even better—give me all the details on what it was like! But if not, and you just grew up in any other sort of Pennsylvania town, that’s fine too. Or any other town in America works too! 

Don’t feel like if you don’t fall into any of these specifications you can’t share—they’re just certain things I’m particularly interested in. But there’s a ton more I’m sure you can enlighten me about!!!

Reminisce, share, spill your guts!

Excited to here from you!

Anyways.. I’m not here to advertise my business, just get some advice. When I first opened my shop I had an “okay” amount of sales, and now business is dead. I sell custom engraved iPhone &amp; iPad cases and I feel as though this would be a very popular item to sell. However, there are hardly any views on my items and no sells at all.
I put almost all the money I had into this business (engraving machine, cases, etc). Lets just say it was around 2 stacks.

I understand the idea of a minimum, but am not sure that I actually sympathize with it. $10 is a lot to spend at a corner store, so I left and bought the butter at a grocery store.

My question is:

1) Do the transaction fees materially impact your ability to turn a profit? Isn't it a nominal percentage per transaction? Wouldn't you just pay a certain percent of whatever I buy? Not sure why a minimum is necessary if that's the case.

2) How do you set the minimum? It seems arbitrary at a lot of places.

3) Have the credit card companies ever contacted you saying that you were reported for having a minimum? I've read it's against the merchant agreement and would never call because it's a massive waste of time...just curious about that.

Completely understand the uphill battle of the small business owner, but hopefully this will temper the rage that fills my body when I'm told I can't buy a $5 item because there's a $10 minimum on credit and debit cards.

My wife's mom lost her 4th battle with cancer this last year and needless to say, things have been quite rough for the entire family but especially for my wife as she was the youngest child and her mom was quite literally her best friend. I have been married to my wife for a few years and the birthday thing is something that I feel like I have continually come up short on for her, mainly because her mom had always made her birthday so special and would always put so much time and effort into the day and I have just never been one to do much in regards to birthdays until I met her. Last year her mom was in the final stages of her illness and my wife's birthday was a pretty bittersweet experience. I know birthday's are not a big deal for a lot of people(myself included) but they are a big deal for her. So, I want to try and do whatever I can to make this year special for her as it is her first birthday without her mom. It has been an extremely stressful year for her and I just want to make her day as special as possible with what I have to work with.

I am mainly trying to come up with ideas that do not cost money as I/we are extremely broke at the moment. Her expectations are not super high because of this so I DO have that working in my favor. I would like to come up with something though that would be a pleasant surprise. I think I have about $20 I will be able to use to buy her the new David Sedaris book so I will at least have a present to go along with whatever I can come up with.

I know this question is kinda vague but I am just struggling to think of something to do for her. I had some ideas about taking her to do some nature type things but we just had a pretty big cold snap hit and I think that it is probably going to put a damper on the plans I had. Any ideas/advice would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if I can provide any more details that could help form ideas.

I had major back surgery in 2010. I remember going into the hospital the morning of the surgery, then I woke up 10 days later at home. Turns out I had a reaction to the liquid Valium used on me during the surgery, and it took 10 days for it to get out of my system. For 10 days, I was a completely different person, nasty, argumentative, sarcastic, just a mean bastard, plus I was doing all kinds of crazy stuff I would never normally do. I had been married 12 years, had never raised my voice to my wife, but for 10 days I yelled at her, put her down, treated her like dirt. When I “woke up”, I was sitting in my recliner at home watching TV. I looked at my wife, and before I even said a word, she said, “Welcome back”. That’s how much of a different person I was, she could tell I was back to normal just by looking at me.

That was 3 years ago. About a week ago, I had to have two teeth pulled. I was given Xanax to take before going to the dentist, which I did. The next day I realized that I couldn’t remember anything about the day before. I asked my wife what happened, and she told me I had turned to the dark side again. Luckily this time, it only lasted about 24 hours.

Now I want to be prepared in case this ever happens again, so I figured I would write myself a letter and give it to my wife to give to me if it happens again. But what do I write? I turn into a complete lunatic, I don’t know if a letter would just piss me off, if I wouldn’t believe it and think my wife was playing a joke on me or something. I don’t want to make things worse, but I figure I have to try something. Plus, I want to know what’s going on in my mind when I’m altered, I figured I could make a question and answer sheet, or some kind of mental test, and tell myself in the letter to fill it out. But what do I ask?

So that’s the question: What would you say to yourself in a letter that would convince you that you were temporarily crazy, and that you shouldn’t leave the house for any reason until your wife told you it was OK? And what kind of questions would you ask yourself, or tests you would leave for yourself, so that when your brain returned to normal you could get an idea as to what was going on in your head while you were crazy?","If you had a split personality, and wanted to write a letter to your other self explaining that if you were reading the letter you were temporarily crazy, what would you write?

 Yesterday I felt that I was about to get sick because of a light sore throat. The next day I woke up in bed feeling really shitty. A headache, runny/stuffy nose, and a really bad sore throat. I got up to take some medicine and make some green tea. After making the tea, I sat down and started playing some games on my phone. Until I was about halfway done with my cup of tea is when I started to feel a little queasy and light headed. I immediately went to the bathroom and tried to take a shit, but nothing came out. I came back outside and sat near the bathroom while on my phone just in case I had another emergency. I repeated this about three more times until I had the worst experience ever. I got up to go to the bathroom and this time my stomach was feeling *really* bad. I rested my head on my arm over the sink and threw up about five times. It felt like a demon was escaping my soul through my mouth. It came out looking like a oranger shade of blood. I spat out the remaining bits of medicine and tea into the sink. At last, I'm finally relieved of this pain and torture. Nope, not yet. A rumble comes from my stomach. Thinking it was a just a fart, I let it go. *Oh no*. I felt the hot liquid touch my ass and leak down my thigh. I check my underwear to see if what I feel is actually true. Yup, I see the dark brown stain and the streak going down my thigh.

While on layover, flight was delayed then cancelled entirely.  Talked to gate agent and was offered to fly next day (not an option) or fly to Phoenix and drove 5-6 hours to Vegas. 

We chose to go to Phoenix and drive.  We just needed to get there.  They assured us our bags would follow us.  Then we could get our bags and make our way.  As we arrived in Phoenix it was found that they never loaded out bags and held them to send on a future vegas flight. 

No bags with shoes, makeup, nothing.  Cue the crying bride. 

Baggage agent said we could pick them up at the airport.  After significant arguing we got them to agree to deliver to or hotel at least.  If they arrive...

We are now in a car on the way to Vegas,  expected arrival of 8-10 hours after our original arrival.  We are still unsure of whether or not we will have our belongings and it's not making this fun at all. 

We have lost an entire day of our four day trip.  We had to cancel reservations for dinner, our limo, wedding planner, are missing out on family (who is there without us at the moment), everything.  An entire day gone. And still with a stunned wife-to-be with a frozen expression that is painful to look at.

When I was really into checking out the story 20 years ago, with so many unanswered questions about Oswald, JFK, and the 1960s in general, it seemed unlikely Oswald just up and shot him given all the forces swirling around the President (Cold War-pressures from Khrushchev and the [Cuban Missile Crisis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_missile_crisis) aftermath, plots to [kill Castro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_attempts_on_Fidel_Castro), Southern racists unhappy about JFK's civil rights stance, the Kennedy family's ties to various mafia figures, etc.) it seemed much more likely a conspiracy killed JFK rather than Oswald alone (or at all).

Now, I think it's reasonably clear what happened, and to my surprise, Oswald appears to have done it alone.

**For a time, it was reasonable to believe in a conspiracy** We know conspiracies inside and outside of government exist. The [plot to kill Lincoln.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Abraham_Lincoln) The [9-11 attacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_of_the_September_11_attacks). Nixon running [dirty tricks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_tricks) on his enemies. People plot messed up stuff. It's reasonable to question in an area like this. But when questions have answers, reasonable people reassess their beliefs.

**Computer modeling:** With the rise of computer graphics, you might expect it be easier to mess with JFK images. That's true. But it's also possible to examine them to a greater extent and find new data. But I think they actually solve the physics questions of the [Magic bullet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_bullet_theory), and clarify why something that seems hard to believe is actually the truth.

What swayed me originally was [this presentation](http://youtu.be/r613IImTR_M?t=1m17s) of Dale Myers's work, broadcast by Peter Jennings in the early 2000s. He followed it up with this [video synchronizing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thSPu57vaWg) all the cameras in Dealey Plaza.

**New forensic evidence** What re-confirmed, expanded and laid to rest my final questions, like JFK's body movements in the [Zapruder film](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapruder_film), reports of [more than three shots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_assassination_conspiracy_theories) is summed up ver well on a recent NOVA program you can [see here](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/tech/cold-case-jfk.html)

**Oswald and Ruby were messed up** Given what we unfortunately have learned about loner and impulsive killers over the last 50-years, the psychological traits for doing what they did were well within Oswald and Ruby when they did their killing. Or me, their both summed up well in Philip Shenon's [A Cruel and Shocking Act](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17740743-a-cruel-and-shocking-act).

**Human Psychology:** Conspiracy stories are ALWAYS better stories. [Scientific American](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-people-believe-conspiracy-theoies) touched on this here. Conspiracies are always more emotionally satisfying. They imply bigger villains, more intelligence in the world, meaning to the meaningless, etc. So when reality is simple, horrible and boring, we have a harder time believing.

So where are we now, 50-years after? Have facts been uncovered to accumulate into something like a real answer? But reasonable people have disagreed for years. What say you?

I watched Paranormal Witness on Syfy this week about Father Vince Lampert and Father Carmine De Filippis who are supposedly real exorcists. I was curious to read stories of people that have had ""demons"" in them and how they were exorcised (I guess that's the right word!). 

The episode made it seem like there are tons of people getting exorcisms all the time...which leaves me wondering - where are the stories from the person's point of view that has/had the demon in them?? 

I'm fascinated by the idea of the paranormal (although I'm not entirely sure where my beliefs lie), and have read plenty of ufo/abuction/ghost stories/experiences on reddit, but can't seem to find any stories about someone saying they believe they were actually possessed and telling their side.

We found a third roommate (M 26) who took our third bedroom.
