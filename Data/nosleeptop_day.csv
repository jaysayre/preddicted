kimmiekissies,13,32,1rgt5c,118,I never even met him I didnt know his name or face I was blissfully unaware of his very existence I will never know why or when it started Im glad for that I guess I moved into my very small apartment in February last year My landlord Olivia was a sweet older woman who would cook to much and bring me much appreciated leftovers She was great to me even after telling her my problem Im antisocial but she didnt mind renting to a reclusive young girl who reminded her of her daughter Every few weeks she would knock on my door then leave letting me know she was leaving something for me I loved that Not even my family would cook so well The next morning I wash and leave her empty containers outside my door and by an hour or so she would take them back again My other neighbors seemed fine but I never talked or visited with them I work from home so anytime I ever was forced to go out I rushed out and into my apartment avoiding an uncomfortable situation I loved living alone it was everything I hoped for I could just breathe By April though I started noticing things were not right They were moving or plain disappearing I was convinced it was just anxiety caused by my new medication and the move another side affect was it would make me so drowsy Since I hated seeing the doctor I just dealt I took naps during the day now and eventually stopped caring Until one incident doubled my paranoia Olivia brought me some sort of greek tossed salad and dressing for lunch one day and I enjoyed it with my friend netflix I fell asleep in the middle of Portlandia and woke up that evening at pm Per usual what was not usual was my bedding on the opposite side of me was disturbed I only sleep on the right side Always Even more it felt warm My first thought was I must have rolled around a lot but I knew it was to odd to dismiss I got up and searched my apartment gripping my phone with  typed in Nothing else was disturbed everything was exactly like it should be I let it go for the next few weeks everything was normal pardon the occasional misplaced shoe or drawn back shower curtain I thought about telling someone my parents maybe Olivia but if its not life or death I am not reaching out to anyone I wasnt scared I was nervous maybe a little stubborn But I stayed I am not letting some stupid anxiety ruin my lovely lonely world May came and It was getting worse My panties toothbrush hell even my food was being misplaced Every time I woke up there was this strange odor in the air I finally realized this wont go away by ignoring it I called my mom and begged to come stay a few days when I got home I told them everything Saying it out loud solidified any creepy suspicions That weekend my dad went to my apartment and what was found was true horror Written all over that walls COME BACK BABY PLEASE He ran out and called the police There was no one living in my apartment but someone definitely had access besides me The investigation revealed a man Henry the son of my landlord Olivia was in a projected relationship with me They showed me his confession on tape He admitted coming into my apartment every night and everyday with his mothers extra key He claims we were in love and he had my permission He drugged his mothers food she left out for me causing my drowsiness and falling asleep so he could come in and watch me sleep touch my hair kiss my shoulder The leftovers I had in the fridge were tested and confirmed I was absolutely horrified and disgusted A man I never knew existed collected my drain hair clothes and trash and practically lived in my apartment for four monthsedit paragraphing,I used to live by myself,150,nosleep,top_day
tellmewhatiswrong,39,47,1rhbuc,112,OriginalPosthttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsreivzneedsomeadvicemywifeseemstobeinsomeThanks to everyone for your responses I have taken a lot of your adviceIll just give you all a quick update on what happened after I posted yesterday She ended up having a nap after sitting in front of the TV for a few hours I was going to walk our dog Zeus but I decided to wait until she woke up just in case she woke up and was confusedShe woke up after a couple of hours and waswell Happy Really really happy Almost manic She woke up full of beans and smiling like a maniac I was initially relieved I asked would she like to come for a walk with Zeus and I and she happily agreed We set off for our normal walk and she was extremely energetic bounding off in front of Zeus and I Zeus is a Labrador and although he is a big boy hes still a pup We usually just meander along on these walks while he sniffs at everything along the way But she set a cracking pace and Zeus and I struggled to keep up We got up to this park where we usually let him off his lead for a while as were trying to train him to not run off on us and to be sociable Its always been a real task getting him back on the leash though he never ever comes when hes called Anyway we let him off and hes running around and smelling everything and peeing on anything that stands still long enough My wife shes picking flowers and sniffing them and singing She gets on the swings at the park and I push her for a bit as she sings under her breath I was feeling quite content at this point Figured she must have just been over tiredShes swinging vigourously when all of a sudden she comes to a dead halt She yells in an almost unfamiliar masculine voice Zeus Here and points in front of her feetI stood in disbelief as I watched Zeus the most disobedient rascal of a dog I know solemnly trot over to where shes pointing sit in front of her and stare up into her face They both sat there for a split second very still looking at each other I picked my jaw up off the floor and asked her Umwhat the hell How did you manage that and that seemed to break both their concentration and Zeus shot off like a bat out of hell again and she started swinging again  Oh she said I used my mind to call out to himits something new I learnedShe seemed kind of sheepish about it to be honest I pressed her for more details but the more questions I asked the more defensive she got She knows I dont believe that for a second Im just happy that Zeus is finally starting to be trained Thats really the only explanation I asked her to do it again but she refused so I think we both know it was a flukeThe rest of the afternoon wasnice Kind of odd Its like theres something thats amiss Like when you walk into your messy bedroom and you can tell that something is not how it should be but you cant pin point whatWe talked a bit about the seminar She said that it was very intense The days were very long She said that the premise of the seminar is to get to the root of any emotional upset to explore the root causes for whats going on in your life I asked if any hypnosis was used as suggested by you guys and she said no They talked a lot and were assigned to small groups and encouraged to open up and explore their inner beings She said she felt a lot better since attendingStill something was not quite right For instance we were talking about my sister who lives in another state and how she had recently got a new job A few minutes later my phone rang and it was her I picked it up and said Emma Speak of the devil and my wife smashed me up the side of the head causing me to drop the phone and shouted Emma is NOT the devil How could you say that Emma is NOT THE DEVIL I told Emma I would call her back and tried to get my wife to calm down She was very upset at what I had said She sort of went silent again and was very still She seemed rather annoyed at me but by this point I was nearing exhaustion myself so I let her beShe fell asleep early about pm on the couch I covered her with a blanket and noticed that her eyes are kind of half opened I used to have a friend who slept like that at school and Ive never noticed it before I think that in my state of hyper vigilance I am being overly perceptive of small details I read more of my original post and all your comments and decided to step outside and call our therapist just to find out more about the seminar as I knew she was there assistingI walked out onto our back porch and lit a cigarette and rang her She answered on my first ring What she said has really weirded me out Only because although she gave me a lot of information she has raised many more questions as well as answered them She said these seminars are more like interactive workshops run by a man named Brian and his wife Linda who are both selfappointed psychotherapists She said that there are psychologists such as herself on stand by to assist because sometimes when people are in such a vulnerable state they may need assistance She said she has referred a lot of her clients to attend these workshops and has found them to be helpful in most cases Basically the course is about discovering your inner self and using different methods to connect to your inner voice to find out what the cause of your worries are She said that it is incredibly demanding and intense Each session goes for  hours with only an hour break During these sessions many different activities and topics are explored including regression Apparently Brian does this  hour session on the second last day where he gets everyone to meditate and be still and he regresses them back to childhood or even in some extreme cases past lives Our therapist said it was so intense that she had to fight from being regressed herself She did make comment that she had been concerned initially about how my wife would handle that but that she seemed brighter had a clarity about her after this experience They discussed what my wife had gone back to in her mind and the therapist was happy that it hadnt caused her any great distress but reminded me she couldnt discuss the specifics She said when she wakes tomorrow I could gently try and open the lines of communication with her and she may explain her experience I told her about my wifes strange behaviour She said it is normal to be a little out of sorts after one of these sessions but nothing major I dont know if its just me but I could sense a tiny bit of alarm in her voice I dont know maybe I imagined it She said to call her if theres any further problems I hung up and as I was putting out my cigarette I turned to go inside and my wifes standing there staring at me I jump and say Jesus Christ honey you scared me and she replied Not as fucking much as Im going to scare you Ummm ok I had to physically turn her and direct her into the house In the moonlight she almost looked like a stranger to me Her long blonde hair was hanging in her face and her face was fixed in this awful scowl I figured she must still be pissed at me from before I put her to bed and she goes back to sleep And well thats where she is now she was supposed to be off work today too but I was meant to go back to my job But when my alarm went off I just had this weird feeling that I should stick around and make sure she was ok I rang in sick for work and Im just doing some household jobs waiting to see if shes better when she wakes up and googling what regression means and what these intense emotional exercises can do to someone Still nothing that convincing though I dont know Maybe Im too skeptical I just dont believe this crapThe whole thing sounds a bit stupid to me if Im honest But I have to say it has caused some kind of change in my wife She is very extreme in her emotions at the moment and Im worried because we both have to go back to work tomorrow and her work environment is very proper She is always a perfect employee and very dedicated to her work I cant help but feel concerned that she might wake up tomorrow and still be in thismood Do you guys know anything about this regressionis it the same as hypnosis She was adamant she wasnt hypnotised but it sounds like it to meEDIT Ok now Im getting really freaked out I went to check on her and she was talking and singing her sleep I cant quit work out what song shes singing Ive never heard it before But shes saying something about being someone called Azara or something Its really fucking unnerving it doesnt even sound like her Ill try and get a recording and see if you guys can shed some light EDIT TWO Ok I managed to record a bit of itshes singing but I dont know what has anyone heard this before Ignore the TV in the background I was watching it in the lounge room to drown her out and it was really unnerving when I turned it off and all I could hear was her Im kind freaked out now Ill admit it Here it ishttpsoundcloudcomuseraynmqytetesjECMW,UPDATE Need some advice My wife seems to be in some weird tranceZombie like state Not sure what to do or if Im over reacting,159,nosleep,top_day
floydnimrod,21,25,1rhxtb,113,Id just come from church for some reason Im not sure why Id gone into the church but it was the weirdest service Id ever been too Everybody was there It was a packed house Rich people poor people criminals middle class folk It was all people who didnt normally go to church I looked into the coat room as I walked in and some guy was snorting cocaine on this little counter top Right in a church I was like what the hell Ive never see thatI sat in a pew and looked up There was no minister They were just playing a movie of an old church service on the screen Some little old lady was playing a hymn on an organ and the minister was applauding her She seemed happy But the audience was restless not really paying attention not sitting down just kind of wandering around talking to everybody And then I saw a woman I used to know someone I worked with years ago I went to sit down next to her and she sort of jumped on my lap and hugged me saying she was so glad to see me I wasnt sure if she was sad or drunk or terrified or just lonely but she whispered in my ear offering me sex saying shes always wanted me ever since shed known me I sort of pushed her off my lap thinking this was hardly the place for that kind of cheap pickup And then I got up and walked out There wasnt really a church service going on anyway I dont even think it was SundayAnd then for some reason I was in a car with this old lady I dont even know who it was or why I was with her She was old like my grandma Freddie but it wasnt her We were driving down the street She was driving too slow because she was kind of lost I dont think I was in Winnipeg I was on a large street almost the size of Portage with several lanes But they all seemed to be deserted like very early on a Sunday morning Im not sure if it was early in the morning or near sunset but the sun was low in the sky I think it was late in the day The streets were mostly clear thoughThe lady pulled over and for some reason she got out of the car I think she was going to ask somebody for directions I looked at the GPS thing she had on her dashboard and suddenly the direction went all fuzzy and scrambled like the satellite was confused or just no longer there And then the whole sky got this weird greenish tint to it for about ten seconds It basically turned green instead of blue but only for a moment and then it was back to normal Everybody stopped and looked upI was still in the car but I leaned forward and looked out the window The sun was over in the west low in the sky And I saw what looked like a second moon fly over the sky in a direction that was diagonal to the suns normal path It was huge And my stomach got queasy for a moment It made your stomach sick because it was so big it actually pulled on you with its own gravity like the moon pulls on the tides but much bigger and everything inside you just got tugged aroundBut it went straight across the sky without hitting When I realized how close it was though I knew it was gonna hit somewhere probably on the other side of the world The gravity of the earth pulled it in and it slingshotted around to the other side somewhere I jumped out of the car and grabbed the old ladys armCome on We have to find shelter Its gonna hit We just abandoned the car in the street and I dragged her toward a nearby fire station or hydro office or whatever it was Im not sure which it was but there were large utility trucks with lifts on them It was also deserted for some reason except for two guys loading one of the trucks We banged on the doors but it was locked up We ran from door to door trying to get in but everything was locked And then I felt a great rumble under my feet It nearly knocked me down Ive never been in an earthquake so I dont know what its like but it felt like the entire planet shivered Car alarms started going off in every direction and I heard a weird sound like gravel tumbling down a hillside except there were no hills I think it was pieces falling off houses in all directions We were able to stay on our feet though A few moments later the sky in the north went dark If I assume the sun was setting in the west and the meteor or asteroid or whatever flew over the sky in a northwest to southeast direction then it was north the black came from And I mean the entire sky Like a wall of blackness smoke and ash suddenly filling the view from the ground to the upper atmosphere from west to east as far as you could see in one huge wall of black cloud And it was coming toward us Well sort of going towards everyone everywhere I guess It came over the horizon like an charging army fast and steady advancingIt hit on the other side of the world somewhere Come on we have to get indoors We wont be able to breatheThe air started turning yellow Ash started raining down and bits of rock and debris from the blast where ever it hit I took a deep breath and held it as I was running I could already smell a weird burning rock smell like sulphur like burnt matches but more metallic Me and the lady finally got into some doors but it was just a little foyer We ran in and shut the doors behind us The inside doors were locked But it was somewhere to hide There was a fire alarm I pulled it not really knowing why I was bothering But I was sort of in a panic and not thinking straight The sign said In Case of Emergency so I pulled it The alarm went off and we looked out the window The yellow air turned brown and then dark red Then everything went black The black cloud fell over the whole sky with a clattering rumble that sounded like it was raining gravel instead of water And all light went out of the worldThe world as we knew it was over Even if we survived life as we know it would never be the same Wed be set back  years reduced to hunter gatherers again living out of caves If we survived the impact that is I honestly dont think anybody would have survived the shockwave Something with that much gravity hitting the earth would pretty much end the story for everybodyOf course thats when I woke up,I just dreamed of the apocalypse I probably wont sleep for a few days

Charliesfriend,20,9,1rhapg,79,A friend of mine posted a story here not too long ago and he was pretty well received by your wonderful community so I decided to create an account to share mineWhen I was a little girl about nine years old my family purchased a small ranch in western Kansas My father had just gotten out of the Army and I suppose after seven years of trotting around the world and spending two of those years in active combat zones my dad just wanted to go somewhere the world would leave him alone He couldnt have found a better location for this purpose anyone whos ever followed Interstate  westward through that area knows there isnt much between Topeka and DenverI still remember the day we my mom dad older sister and I moved into that old ranch house It had been built in the early s and being something of a history buff I was pretty excited to live in a house that had stood through prohibition the depression both world wars and everything since The house itself sat at the bottom of a small incline from the main road backed literally into a hill This setup meant the back half of the home sat underground buried in the hillside Outside the house was a little grassy yard area and across this yard was an old barn We didnt have any horses but my dad held a particular love for classic cars and he turned that barn into an amateur autoshop where he worked refurbishing old cars from the junk yard in his spare timeMy sister and I were given seperate but adjoining rooms upstairs while my parents took the master bedroom oddly on the first floor My sister and Is rooms opened onto a sort of landing that looked out over the living room and kitchen and the stairs led down from thereIt was only our second or third night in the house that I began to notice some strange things occurring I was unable to sleep one night and I laid awake in bed long after I heard my parents and sister go to bed The house was incredibly quiet both from being in the middle of a very isolated area and by virtue of being half buried Just as I was reaching the halfsleep stateSLAM I heard a door downstairs slam shut At first I tried convincing myself I had just dreamed it but I couldnt make myself believe that And the next thing I heard chilled me to my core I heard footsteps coming up the stairway I could tell from the sound that the individual must be wearing shoes so it probably wasnt my parents coming up to check on me I heard the steps reach the top of the stairs and then begin down the landing I was frozen with fear when I heard them arrive outside my door pause for a moment and then continue on When the stranger was apparently in front of my sisters room he paused again and again he continued He reached the far end of the landing and then turned around and came back the way he came He continued for what seemed like an eternity pacing around outside my sister and Is rooms I finally worked up some nineyearold courage and crawled to the door I could still hear footsteps coming from just outside I waited until he was moving away from me and I was between him and the stairs planning on making a mad dash for my parents room when his back was turned I barely cracked open the door and looked out and sawnothing The footsteps had stopped and the whole house was empty and still I was confused and afraid but even then I knew if I ran to my parents they would think I was nuts So I slid a chair in front of my door and crept into bed A minute later the footsteps started again back and forth all along the landing Eventually they lulled me to sleep I didnt mention the noises that night to anyone fearful of my parents thinking I was a whacko and of being made fun of by my sister But over the next few weeks everyone in my family began to notice strange happenings on our ranch Objects moved on their own Small things would disappear for days only to be returned exactly where theyd gone missing from It was what I guess youd call typical poltergeist activity nothing harmful or malevolent just noises here and there and odds and ends moving around And practically every night I heard those footsteps outside my room My family eventually began referring to this entity as Charlie He seemed to be a harmless ghost and sometimes downright helpful Occasionally my parents would wake early in the morning for work only to find a freshly brewed pot of coffee waiting in the kitchen The coffee maker had no automatic timer Sometimes when one of us had misplaced something like car keys or the like wed search the house frantically only to turn around and find what wed been searching for laying on the ground behind us And sometimes Charlie would slam a door or walk around loudly or turn a sink on seemingly just to let us know he was there And always those footsteps at nightCharlie always seemed particularly active in my dads auto shop My dad would occasionally find car parts hed been working on had been tinkered with despite the fact that he was the only one who ever went in there Sometimes tools would go missing only to be returned a short time later Once my dad came in from his shop one evening as white as a sheet When we asked what was wrong he just said Charlie was walking around out thereJesus I thought you all were just hearing things I wasnt sure why Charlie loved that shop so much but incidentally that was where I caught my first sight of him It was a Saturday and my Dad was hard at work putting together an old Chevy Fleetline My mom mad him a sandwich as a working lunch and asked me to take it to him I eased open the barn door and saw my dad seated at his work bench his back to me And I saw another man next to the car also out of my dads field of vision He was about  with dark hair and eyes He was dressed in what looked like typical s clothing black slacks a pinstripe vest over a grey work shirt and topped off by a brown paper boy hat cocked to one side He looked right at me for a second a big mischievous grin on his face and then he simply disappeared I didnt even realized I was still holding my dads sandwich and continued to stare at the spot Charlie had stood until my dad snapped me back to realitySo passed the next few months My family was happy on our little haunted ranch Charlie seemed happy enough to share the space with us and life was good And his nightly vigil outside my room began to seem almost comforting One night in late November however I learned just how utterly terrifying Charlie could beMy dad had some kind of dinner event for work in Topeka almost two hours away and since my Sister was almost  by then and there was virtually no crime in our rural area my parents figured we would do fine by ourselves until they returned the next morning Of course to my sister and I it meant we could stay up as late as we wanted watch scary movies all the kid stuff you cant do with your parents around At around midnight I was in my Sisters room with her watching some movie on her TV when we heard a loud CRASH from the living room My first thought was that it was Charlie playing another prank by this felt different somehow Charlies noises were simply little bumps to remind you he was home But this noise sounded violent and angry Before I could really react we heard another loud crash and another My sister cautiously peeked out of her door and down into the living room I swear I saw her go white She began trembling and her hand covered her mouth I peeked around her to see what she saw and felt y blood run cold We could just barely see two men outside our from door One of them was kicking it in As we watched a final smash from this man caused the door jam to give out and they both entered our home shining long flashlights all over My sister and I crawled under her bed and held each other tight This was easily the most terrified I have ever felt But as the two men began to go through the living room another loud crash came from the kitchen One of the cabinets had opened and slammed shut a favorite trick of Charlies The man who seemed to be leading the show shined his flashlight into the kitchen and shouted Is there anyone in here If you are you better come out now We will find you and we will FUCK you up My sister and I had to cover our mouths to keep from screaming out loud At the mans words though Charlie apparently got angry We heard another loud crash and a skittering of metal on the floor as one of our silverware drawers apparently threw itself across the room I heard one of the men say Whatthe FUCK And then Charlie decided he was do e fucking around All at once every door window and cabinet in our home began opening and closing violently and loudly Small objects all over the house began to fling themselves into walls across the floor even at the intruders At this point the one in charge just yelled FUCK this and turned and ran out his buddy close behindAs soon as the men were out of the door everything stopped and the house was again silent It was a long long time before either my sister or myself finally worked up the courage to move She had left her cell phone downstairs and and she needed it to call the police and our parents She began slowly creeping downstairs to get it and since there was no way in hell I was being left alone I followed As we got to the bottom I looked into the kitchen and for just a moment Charlie was standing there exactly as I saw him before with the same grin on his face A moment later he was goneThe police arrived shortly and my parents not far behind The cops determined that the disorder in the home was caused by the robbers ransacking the place for valuables and they must have been scared off by a passing car Lucky for us My sister and I didnt even try to tell them what really happened and within thirty minutes both men were caught still fleeing After that night hearing Charlies walk around my floor gave me a serene sense of security every night When he played his little pranks I would always look for him And every now and then I would catch just a glimpse of him and smileSeveral years later when I was a junior in high school I was working on a school report at the local library The topic was the history of our town and I wanted to see if the library had any old news clippings that mentioned my familys ranch I typed our address on the search bar and the first result stopped me dead in my tracks The date of the old article was July   and at the top was a picture of a man about  with dark hair and eyes It was unmistakably Charlie The title of the article read Local Man Murdered While Defending Daughter It seems the man we called Charlie was actually named Brian Davis He had lived alone in the ranch with his only child a daughter after losing his wife to a bad case of the Flu On the night of July  the article said Mr Davis was returning home from his job as an auto mechanic in town When he pulled up to the house he found the door had been forced open He ran inside and found a man on top of his daughter The girl was sobbing her dress had been ripped open and the attacker held a knife to her throat In a moment of sheer instinct Mr Davis threw himself at the intruder tackling him of his daughter and as he held the attacker Mr Davis yelled for the girl to run to the neighbors and call the police The girl made it the mile and a half to the closest neighbor who promptly called the sheriff When deputies arrived they were able to apprehend the attacker who had been beaten half to death Unfortunately he had stabbed Mr Davis three times in the chest Brian Davis died right on our kitchen floor,Charlie,88,nosleep,top_day

childrenofsamhain,9,3,1rhdoj,37,My friend Jaime purchased a new home about six years ago when his wife was pregnant with their first child Until recently he lived there with his wife Claire and their two daughters Sarah and Emily Sarah is now five years old and Emily is three Within the first two years living in the house Jaime said that he never experienced anything out of the ordinary It wasnt until his daughter Sarah was around two years old that he started to notice she talked to herself Jamie thought nothing of it she was just learning to talk and he figured she was just entertaining herself One afternoon when Claire was out at the grocery store Jaime overheard his daughter in the upstairs hallway whispering and giggling Curious he asked Sweetie who are you talking to Sarah replied The woman standing in the hallwayIs she your imaginary friendI guess Amused he went upstairs to find her staring blankly at a wall whispering quietly Whats your friends name he asked her Her name is Helen Mary she said And what are you two whispering about Sarah looked at him and paused before she piped Im not supposed to tell you Suddenly the front door opened downstairs and they heard Claire come through the door Sarah rushed down the stairs to greet her Jaime didnt think about that again for a few weeks Over time the two noticed that Sarahs interactions with Helen Mary became more frequent but they attributed this to the fact that they had just given her the news that she was going to be a big sister About two weeks before Claire gave birth to Emily Jaime was at home alone with Sarah He heard her playing upstairs chatting away with her imaginary friend when suddenly he heard glass breaking He ran upstairs as quickly as possible to find his daughter standing in the hallway holding a hammer She was staring up at the wall of family pictures that were now smashed to pieces There was glass everywhere Jaime picked his daughter up and carried her down the stairs He told her to stay put as he returned to the upstairs hallway to clean up the shattered fragments of their family portraits When he returned to the living room he asked her directly Sweetie why would you smash all of our family pictures She looked at him Helen Mary told me to do itWhen Claire returned home that evening from her girls night with friends Jaime told her about the incident The crept up the stairs so as not to wake their daughter so Claire could view the damage with her own eyes She gasped silently at the sight When they returned downstairs to the kitchen they started to discuss possible explanations for her behavior Suddenly the color ran out of Claires face and she looked at Jaime Theres no way she could have done that aloneWhatThere is no way she could have smashed all of those pictures by herselfJaime was confused I told you I caught her with the hammer She told me that she did itBut it wasnt until his wife said it aloud that it dawned on him But some of those pictures are almost five feet off the ground How could she have reached thoseHis mind was racing She must have moved a chair or somethingShe was adamant There are no chairs upstairs that she is strong enough to move without you hearing it and you would have seen her carry one upstairs rightJaime was silent He didnt have an answer They went to bed that night without any answers The following morning their daughter had little recollection of smashing the pictures and Jamie wrote it off as sleepwalking Though he didnt have much time to think about it as two weeks later his second little girl was bornEmily was two years old in the summer of  and one afternoon when Claire was at home alone with the girls she heard Emily alone upstairs whispering She called up to her Who you talking to kiddoThe woman standing in the hallwayClaire thought that her Sarah must have told her about her imaginary friend and that she was simply trying to emulate her big sister Then she spoke againShe doesnt like you MommyWhy doesnt she like me Claire responded surprised I dont know Suddenly her daughter came bounding down the stairs as if nothing had happened Even though both Jaime and Claire both found this slightly creepy nothing about the situation ever felt threatening or malevolent Until one night last monthJaime had put the kids to sleep around eight oclock in the evening and he and Claire had got into bed soon after Exhausted Jaime and his wife fell asleep extremely quickly Jaime was awoken by the sound of screaming He was disoriented and had no idea what time it was but he could tell that it was his wife screaming right next to him He turned to see what was wrong and saw it His  year old daughter Emily standing beside the bed with a hammer in her hand Blood poured from Claires forehead Jamie jumped out of bed and grabbed the hammer out of his daughters hand He turned to his wife She had stopped screaming now and Jaime grabbed a towel from the bathroom and wiped the blood away from her face She was going to be alright but she did have a deep cut to her forehead Jaime picked up his daughter and carried her out of the room He went and checked on Sarah who had awoken to the screaming but was clearly unharmed He told her that everything was alright and closed her door He was standing alone with his daughter in the upstairs hallway and he finally asked her Emily why would you hurt MommyShe told me to DaddyWho told you to The woman standing right behind you She told me to hurt Mommy And then Jaime felt a chill run up his spine when his daughter leaned into his ear and

lamenteddreams,4,8,1rgqu8,14,I love the dark I really doI dont mean going gothic and pagan and all that but I do like the dark I like to sit in my room for hours on end into the night watching videos researching diseases and the supernatural and writing storiesAnyways Ive recently come across a quote from a game called Knock Knock And let me say its utterly terrifying for not just the player but the watcher too Theres nothing but this overwhelming sense of dread throughout all of the gameYou thought about it and now it is inside Knock KnockThat quote has seemed to have seeped into my brain Multiple broken theories have been written down in my notebooks and journals and Ive seemed to have come to a conclusionThe mind isnt wrong Reality is And with that imagination often holds more truth than what we acceptThink about it When you were a small child things like fairytales and horror stories were much more real to your innocent mind In fact there is a theory that children have a sixth sense that they gradually lose as they progress into adulthood Also when you were a child you thought of monsters and what they would do to you as well as how terrifying they lookedAnd when you thought about these things you didnt want to turn around Why Because what if for the slightest moment you were right All those lone yellow eyes in the darkness the sinking feeling of being watched out of all those times what if this was the moment you were right Or moreover what if you were always right and they just didnt want you to know until nowBecause honestly we used to think the Earth was flat Then that it had the sun revolving around us So what makes us so absolutely sure that we are the only ones out there nowThis is my theoryI shared with one of my colleagues about two weeks ago and five days later she called me screaming about how there was something in her house The police showed up and they took her to the hospital She had three slash marks down her back resembling that of almost a wolf She also had multiple bruises on her neck They said there was no signs of break in and the wrecking of the house was most likely the result of her having a psychotic episodeThis could be true but I dont like how unsettlingly close it is to when I told her about my theoryYou thought about it and now it is insideThis is the phrase that keeps me from imagining creatures When I went to the hospital to visit her she was curled up in the bed shaking with her knees up as close to her chest as possible When I asked her what happened she wouldnt tell me who only that it got inside She just had this empty look in her eyes something very uncommon since she was always so hyper and nice When I asked how she just said I thought about it and it came inKeep in mind I never told her about the quote at all Those were her own words So this is more than unsettling for me It may be possible that this theory spooked her enough for all of this to happen but I dont like the coincidencesWhat do you think,The Theory,22,nosleep,top_day
angelcot,3,1,1rh91p,12,Hi rnosleep This is kind of embarrassing to post but heres a few stories of things that happened to me as a kid I was a pretty anxious kid and a lot of weird stuff happened to me Nothing paranormal though Theres more than just these stories but I thought Id at least start with thisEver since I was a kid Ive been afraid of windows Thats not saying much though I was afraid of just about everything else too But growing up my house was full of big windows Floortoceiling windows in the family room two sliding glass doors in the dining room a huge window that looked out from our kitchen into the front yard My mom never bought curtains or blinds for any of the windows other than the ones in our bedrooms because shed get depressed if it were too dark in our house I had light blue curtains in my bedroom that my grandmother sewed for me since my windows were an irregular size Every night I would pull them closed then pin them down to the walls with a pushpin so that I wasnt able to see even a sliver of the outside out of the corner of my eye My bedroom window looked out on the backyard I remember being so irritated whenever someone would accidentally leave the back porch light on The light would shine through my light blue curtains and play shadows on my wall Id cover my head with my pillow so that I could fall asleep without worrying if I would be able to make out the silhouette of someone trying to peer through my curtains still pinned to the wall From a young age I had problems with insomnia My mom struggled with it too I remember my dad telling me stories of when my parents were still married when my mom would wake him up just to talk because she still wasnt asleep at    in the morning I remembered feeling envious that I didnt have someone to do that to I listened to books on tape at bedtime to fill the silence Sometimes I would sneak into my brothers room and lay on their floor hoping for sleep to come Being uncomfortably aware of how their curtains werent drawn completely closed When I was  I moved from my room which overlooked the backyard to my brothers room and my brothers separated and took over my room and the office My new room was at the front of the house If my curtains were open someone could easily look in as they walked up the path to our front door During the day I didnt mind it I could watch for my friends or packages from the postman At night it made me so anxious I began to develop a habit of vomiting nightly My mom was sympathetic but didnt know what to do about it A year later I was moved back into my old room and my older brother moved back into his I stopped vomiting every night I feel like I had a reason for being so afraid of windows One night I must have been about  or  I was up late as usual listening to Ralph S Mouse on tape for the billionth time I had emptied the glass of water that my mom had gotten for me so I got up to refill it I was already wary of windows so I kept my head down on my way to the kitchen Id often see things out of the corner of my eye something moving or something that could have been the shadow of a human but would later try to convince myself it was nothingEven with my head down something outside caught my attention A car parked in front of my house I lived at the very bottom of a culdesac so we didnt have a lot of people drive down our street at night and stop to reorient themselves The car had its headlights on and I could tell there was someone sitting in the car Looking at my house I dont know if they were looking at me but my paranoia told me they were I stood there for a long time forgetting about my glass of water I didnt look away Paralyzed until my mom came in the kitchen Shed seen my door was open and wondered what I was doing up When she noticed the car in front of our house she quieted and gently pushed me out of the kitchen and back to my bedroom I noticed the car started to drive away as I was ushered away from the window This staring contest with the person in the car in front of my house happened twice more although over the course of a few months Once they switched their headlights off and stayed for what might have been  minutes Although my memory might be exaggerating I still dont understand why I was so afraid of seeing someone in my bedroom window but how I could fearlessly stare out of the kitchen window at the person in the parked car Maybe I felt less vulnerable in the kitchen Maybe I was comforted by the fact that they were so far away Even though the walk from where they parked was just a few seconds from my front door and the window I was looking out The third and final time I saw the car the person got out of their car They were tall and I could see them standing on the other side of their car but I still wasnt able to make out their face When they started to walk around their car and I assume towards my front door I scurried back to my bed I never liked sleepovers as a kid Staying over at a friends house meant laying awake on their floor for hours with nothing to listen to but the sound of their calm breathing Nothing to look at except for the sliver of their window I could see from behind their curtains Having friends at my house was just as stressful Usually wed sleep in the family room because it had a TV in it It also had the floortoceiling windows Usually I would sneak off to my own room after my friends had fallen asleep so that I could sleep peacefully away from those big windows When I was about  years old I was having a sleepover with a few of my friends It was after  so my friends were starting to fall asleep I knew I still had at least two or three more hours of being wide awake I was laying on the couch swaddled in my blanket The TV was still on but Id turned the volume down for my sleeping friends to something barely audible Usually I tried to keep my eyes away from the windows But that night my cat caught my attention meowing and hissing at something outside I cautiously looked out the window worried about what my cat might have seen out there Just another cat skittering in front of the window Relieved I looked out at my dark backyard Was that it There was a man in my backyard walking around Even with the distance I distinctly remember he was frowning He had his hands in his pockets I did not know this man I woke up one of my friends whispering in her ear and telling her there was somebody in the backyard She stirred quickly obviously alarmed and looked outside She saw him too Im not sure if he felt our little eyes on him or what but he turned to face us Neither of us made a move not to lay back down and pretend we were asleep not even to look at each other or look away There were a pair of french doors that lead to the back patio in my family room right in the middle of the wall of windows The man walked up to the doors and tapped on one of the small window panes The handle of what looked to be a heavy flashlight hung out of the pocket of his sweatshirt He smiled at us Not a deranged smile not a smile that looked too wide for his face Just a calm warm smile He mouthed something and pointed at the doorknob I was never very good at reading lips I stared straight ahead unblinking not responding I could hear my friends breath heavy and shaking He spoke the sound of his voice muffled through the glass Open the door A pause he knit his eyebrows together like he was concerned Im visiting your parent Let me in My heart was beating out of my chest I was a paranoid enough little kid to not fall for this line I mustered up every ounce of courage I had in my little anxious yearold body and got up off the couch For a moment they man at the door looked relieved I ran out of the room screaming for my mom I could hear my friend call out at me that he was leaving and the rest of my friends starting to stir I told my mom what had happened She turned on all the outside lights and called the police while my stepdad looked out every window for any signs of the man All of the girls at my sleepover had their moms come over and pick them up I cried and stayed the night in my parents bed although Im pretty sure I didnt sleepIn my moms bathroom there was a big window that looked out at the sideyard The glass was distorted though so my mom never bothered putting a curtain over it You couldnt see into the bathroom if you were just passing by the window If you stopped to press your face against the glass you could see in or out but everyone in the house knew not to do that when they were in the sideyard I remember my mom shrieking one night running out of the bathroom saying shed seen something through the glass A rat climbing up the windowsill and staring into the bathroomI always liked my moms shower more than the one in my bathroom My bathroom didnt have a fan in it so the whole bathroom would get uncomfortably humid The shower curtain in my bathroom reminded me too much of that scene from Psycho too and Id always shower with the shower curtain pulled open and Id get water all over the floor My moms shower had a glass door that I liked much more even if there was that big window I could see clearly from the shower Once when I was  I was showering in my moms bathroom because my parents were out of town My brothers were home but were playing video games in the family room I would keep my head down when I showered in my moms bathroom Even if the windows glass was hard to see through it was still a window and the shower was the most vulnerable place I could think of being looked at Every once and a while I would glance up to quell my growing anxiety To tell myself nothing was out there Cautiously I looked up to satisfy my anxiety Nothing was out there I told myself My gaze met the window There was a dark figure pressed up against the glass Through the foggy wet shower door I couldnt see anything All I know was that it was somebody I screamed and ducked down past the tiles so that whoever was out there they couldnt see me A few moments later I heard my brothers knocking at the door both of them calling my name and asking if I was ok I pulled a towel from outside the shower and wrapped myself up before I stood up Whoever was out there was gone A few weeks later my friends and I were playing in the side yard There was a huge tree out there that we liked to climb in and pretend we were characters from XMen or Sonic My friend called my attention to something in the grass over by the window of my moms bathroom A polaroid picture of the distorted glass of the window it lay in front of  ,Windows,13,nosleep,top_day
SpudzOCD,6,5,1rgcw5,10,Hey redditors im new at this so excuse my writing skillsAll through my life ive had things happen that i just couldnt explain ive told a couple of friends but even they dont know what to sayMy story begins when i was a kid about the age of six or seven we lived in a poor neighbourhood in southern Ireland and had a shithole of a house i lived in a room with my two brothers kyle  at the time and Dylan and had been for a couple of years so i was used to sharing a room The first incident occurred after about a year in the house our street was built on a graveyard and happenned in our room it was an ordinary day before it happenned woke up ate breakfast went to school nothing out of the ordinary however when i came home from school that day there was something odd about the house I couldnt quite tell what it was but it just felt wrong But being a kid at the time i thought nothing of it and carried on with my daily routine after dinner and a shower my mom put us to bed After my mom turned out the lights and left the room i began to drift off to sleep after about an hour and a half of hazy dreams i was suddenly awoken by a loud crashing sound kind of like if you dropped a frying pan i quiclky jumped up my pillow and sat upright in bed I looked over to Dylans bed at the other side of the room he ws still asleep I began to question if i had actually heard it at all feeling curious i checked if kyle was awake we had a bunkbed Kyle was on top as i was climbing the four step ladder i felt a burst of cold air rush from kyles bed and immediately dropped to the ground waking up Kylewhat are you doing he saidi heard a noise so i wanted to see ifsshh he stopped me mid sentance and focused his gaze to the back of the room The look on his face will be forever imprinted into my mind I turned around gingerly and what i saw was scary enough to make me cringe even today I saw a scrawny black figure hunched over Dylan who was still asleep But this figure was definately not human It was at least  feet tall its head was overpoweringly large compared to its beyond anorexic body Its fingers were  inches long minimum From what i saw it wore nothing but it very well could have as it was late at night and i was still half asleep Then the image that will haunt me forever It whatever it was turned towards me and Kyle It just stood there staring at us for what felt like forever it then jumped towards us and simply vanished into thin air right before it hit me I was left lying on the floor and Kyle was wondering if what we had just seen was actually real I looked at him and back to Dylans bed whatever it as when it jumped it jumped with enough force to push the blanket off the end of Dylans bed I looked back towards Kyle who was already asleep again and decided to go back to sleep myself not knowing if what wed seen that night was just a figment of our imagination or notWhen i woke up the following morning i hesitantly asked my mom and sister if theyd seen or heard anything last nightthey didnt So i questioned kyle about it and he said that he had no idea what i was on about he had no memory of seeing or hearing anything he didnt even remember me falling off the bunk ladderTo this day i still cant quite figure out what happened that nightMy second experience was only four or five years ago a couple of months after moving to Australia We were living in a pretty old house at the time so it was a bit creaky and what not it was a pretty average day when it happennedI was  and I was once again in bed at the time I was sharing a room with Dylan  at the time Kyle  was in a room across the hallway Jenny  was the next door down and my parents room was at the end of the hallway It was about  at night and we were all just about asleep My mom and stepfather at the time were out exploring the wild clubs of Surfers Paradise so it ws just us kids I was almost asleep when i heard slight footsteps coming from the kithcen area I wondered who it was considering we were all in bed so i opened the door to check I headed towards the kitchen once i reached the living room about halfway to kitchen from my room i could see into the kitchen i slowly emerged from the wall no one thereweird i thought so i headed back to my room but as soon as i turned around Kyle was standing right in front of me with a knife I jumped quicker than id ever jumped before Kyle then laughed his head off and went back to bed I did the same without the laughing I was back in my room now lying in bed realising im too awake to go back to sleep i just lay there for about five minutes staring at the ceiling untill i heard more footsteps in the kitchen I called outKyle go to bed idioti am you fuckwit he said as he emerged from his room half asleepwell then whos upstairs i askedIts probably just a possum in the attic or something dont worryI regretfully closed the door and went back to bed But as soon as i did loud heavy footsteps started making their way down the hallway along with heavy thumping on the walls they were getting closer and a hell of a lot louder It sounded like someone was trying to stomp and bash rats out of the walls and floor It kept coming closer and increasing in volume until it was at the point where it was like gunshots right outside my room It then stomped right outside my door and my door swung open with extreme noise and force and standing at the door was i shit you not the same tall black scrawny fucked up figure that i saw years ago I practically shat myself It stood there for a couple of seconds but if felts like hours then started stomping and sprinted towards my moms room I dont know why but i instantly got up and ran towards the door and looked towards my moms room nothing there it vanished again I dropped to the ground in shock just as Kyle open his door and screamed WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT Its back i saidWhats backthe thing i saw hunched over DylanI stayed up all night that night not wanting to sleep knowing that thing followed us to AustraliaMy most recent encounter with our old friend was last year Wed moved into an old complex of houses that had a bit of a history in the crime side of things Wed been living there for about  months and my friend from primary school Jordan was now living in the complex too It was around PM and it was just Jordan Kyle and I in the house I was playing my ipod at the time Kyle was in the kitchen and Jordan was behind me Kyle decided to pick up a coin and throw it at an unsuspecting Jordan who surprisingly caught it and returned fire but then Jordan moved a little backwards and Kyle threw it further and harder The coin flew through the air right past my head and stopped rigth in front of Jordans face IT LITERALLY STOPPED IN MID AIR it stood still in front of his face for less than a second and then was propelled back towards Kyle with nearly twice the force We all just stood there speechless not knowing if that had really just happened Later that day we were showing a friend what had happened  and were back in the Kitchen messing around with coins to see if it would happen again When suddenly a ball flew through the air at Kyle like it had been thrown with force from the stairs leading upstairs For the second time that day we were utterly speechless and had no idea what to doThat night after Jordan had left and Kyle went to bed i was making a late night snack Dylan was in the living room watching TV and there was nobody else in the house I finished making the snack and was about to head into the living room when in the corner of my eye I saw the figure that i had seen twice before glide upstairs same height same scrawniness same long fingers only this time it was a little misty like a shadow and it looked right into my eyes as it vanished upstairsI am still wondering what the actual fuck that figure is all i know is that my mother has become a clairevoyantI know for a fact that there is definately going to be a lot more of this thing which i have nicknamed the figureFor the time being i will keep an eye out for my little follower and if i see himher again i will not hesitate to report the time date and details of the situation and of course reddit the fuck out of itfor now redditors i bid you farewell,An old friend of mine,15,nosleep,top_day
thedarkhalf,5,1,1rhyj5,7,You know that feeling when youre all alone and hear your name whispered Maybe youve walked into a room only to suddenly feel a sudden temperature drop Had things go missing only to reappear in odd places Maybe youre like me and you lie in bed at night only to feel like someone stroking your hair but when you become fully conscious and turn around nothing Think you walk through a cobweb or hair falls on your arms or neck and brushes against your skin delicately tickling you You check and nothing was there Im sure your parents tell you its nothing from a young age perhaps because they themselves are deluded enough to believe that it is their imagination They probably deep down fear its a ghost or apparition Even they couldnt know how much worse it really is  Stop deluding yourself Its not a cobweb Its not the wind Its not nothing Its something far more sinister an insidious force which slowly grows stronger the more you feed it your fear and attention Some of you Im sure will be fortunate enough only to feel cold spots and occasionally hear creaks and footsteps in your house Its such a common occurrence that people barely notice it and if they do its the spookiest part of a generic horror movie because those suits in Hollywood havent seen what these creatures are really capable of If you believe in the paranormal you may experience the whispers of what I can only loosely refer to as their voices Im sure not many of you have had the misfortune to awaken to them standing over your bed taking the forms of whatever creatures or person your subconscious fears most because its real form is so terrifying youd probably die instantly or become paralysed with fear a zombieesque state youll never awaken fromand that would ruin their fun too early If you dont die instantly seeing their faces will make your eyes bleed hearing their voices unrestrained will shatter your ear drums and Ive heard of cases where insides have been liquefied skin melting and bleeding seeping out of every poreThe first time I awoke to one in my room with me it was after Id given the footsteps and banging on the walls attention I had thought it was cool I even bought a stupid Ouija board and told them it was okay for them to try and talk to me I had been lying in bed after a night of drinking so I passed off the initial taunts and laughs as nothing more than my intoxicated imagination until my door slowly opened and in came one large hairy leg followed by more spindly legs followed by many eyes and two huge fucking fangs Yep a giant spider bigger than a horse came into my room I tried to scream but that just resulted with me hyperventilating then vomiting all over the floor It strode in all beady eyes on me and as it slinked atop my bed I tried to pathetically crawl away but it held me down with its two front legs piercing into the flesh of my shoulders as I whimpered like a small animal about to be devouredwhich I was  I felt the sharp pain of its fangs tear through my skin and inject me with poison that made my blood burn I lay in bed delirious desperate muttering for help My ears were greeted with a cacophony of voices screaming horrible things that were so foul that before that night had been unimaginable to me I passed out shortly after from fear blood loss or the venom and awoke a few days later believing to have all been a dream I clung to that hope until I stepped outside my bedroom door and found dozens of small animals birds mostly wrapped up in what appeared to be spiders webs discoloured drained of their blood and insides All dead I ran to the bathroom to throw up and caught sight of myself dried blood caked on my body and face puncture wounds all over me and strands of silky web still wrapped around my breasts my stomach my legs and in my hair The second night I encountered one of them they took the form of my uncle I lived with my uncle for nearly  years while my father was travelling almost every week for business I know my father loved me and desperately needed the money that he had to work from dawn until way after the sun set and had to leave me for long periods He didnt know what his brother did to me That night as I became increasingly aware of the noises in my apartment and the feelings of someone touching me and whispering in my ear I rolled over to see my uncle grinning at me He crawled onto the bed and tied me down I struggled but when I did he beat me with his belt like he had started doing when I was eight years old I fought as hard as I could tears burning my eyes and sobbing uncontrollably but he kept cutting away at my clothes with a pocket knife and telling me to be a good girl The torture that night lasted for many hours possibly days I try not to remember it I thought I had moved on from those childhood years and buried them a few years ago when my uncle died This was not the last time the monsters took on forms like this to break me Theyve only grown stronger with every drop of blood with every scream and with every hopeless sob Ive given themTheir true form will only appear to you in dreams at first because they get to torment you in ways that wont instantaneously butcher you or drive you insane yet they like to take their time with their toys The dreams for me started after those incidents I have seen what those beings really look like andjust thinking about it is enough for me to start violently shaking unable to stop retching The other day I wasnt careful and thought about one of them and a stranger had to hold me back as I unconsciously started walking in front of a train In my dreams it is pure hell as they have my undivided attention for hours and can do whatever they want to me without my body breaking and bending the way it would in the waking world but it all feels real Part of me stares at length of rope on my coffee table and considers leaving this tormentbut what if when I die I get sent to their realm to be their plaything forever Its not just the occasional brush against my skin the odd floor creak and the rare moment of is someone calling my name Now I feel them on me at all times their rough sharp skin cutting mine scratching me violating every single part of my body Their voices scream and howl at me maniacally taunting and laughing at my neverending misery Even when I shut my eyes I still see them their hideous beings beyond any words the human language has to describe them to you Most of you think of those household noises and strange occurrences as the work of ghosts of spirits Yes it is so comforting for humans to believe these presences are the souls of dead people who are just sad and wandering isnt it You want to be able to talk to someone no longer alive you open your mind and let them in Dont Whats out there isnt human it isnt some person with unfinished business whats out there wants you to think that to get comfortable with inviting it in and letting yourself become aware of it Did you just hear that faint noise outside your window like a soft breeze carrying a faint whisper That creak outside your room That faint sensation on your flesh I hope not because now you know whats really there and theyve always known about you,Dont give them attention,8,nosleep,top_day

JUVIEMAKER,2,1,1rhq9j,8,I have a nose for things No seriously all my life Ive had a very strong sense of smell and I dont mean for the average person I have an abnormally freakishly ridiculously absurd sense of smell Its been that way since I was a kid Heres a prime example when I was about four or five I used to visit my grandmother god rest her soul every month in Daytona Beach for the summer My grandmother was notorious for making the best homemade cakes in the neighborhood I would always leave my Grans house at least ten pounds heavier each summer after gorging myself on her delicious treats One Saturday after a day of playing outside when kids used to play outside I instantly smelled the aroma of cake wafting through the air but something wasoff There was another smell lingering behind the cake scent It was kinda tangy bitter sorta nutty just all around unpleasant Being so young I couldnt quite put my finger on what the smell was but I knew I didnt like it Then out comes my Gran from the kitchen with a big slice of her freshly made cake on a china plate She passes the dining room table and spots me standing there with my nose crinkled up in disgustGran  Whats the matter baby Come sit at the table and have a slice of cakeFive year old me I aint eating that cake it smells funnyLet me just interject for a second  Now if your family is old school like mine you know that a child is to NEVER disrespect an elders cooking Especially if that elder is a family member you just dont do it That is unless you want a black eye ribs broken missing teeth you get the pictureGran Girl get your hind parts over here and eat this cake before I slap the hell out of youOh geeztheres that tone You know it you know it well That angry deep tone that resonates from parents when their truly pissed off You know that voice that scares the living shit out of you and gives youre delicate childlike mind nightmares for a month or your whole life Yeah thats what I was hearing right about then But still I was adamant I would not eat that damn cake That smell It was just too potent Now you might be thinking whats the big deal Surely youve smelled worse things than that cake before which is very true At that point in my life Id smelled worse things before WAY WORSE but Id never been subjected to eat those things either Also the stench of that pastryit was just so very not right I was only a child but I was still old enough to know right from wrong and that cake was definitely wrong Even at that very moment I could taste its bitterness in the back of my mouth With every inhale it burned and tingled down my throatGran Come over here and take this plate nowOkay at this point I knew I was in REAL trouble Even if my grandmother didnt kill me I was pretty sure I was in for the ass whooping of my life I slowly started to back away from Gran as she moved closer to me with that dreaded cake Even as she inched towards me that smell seem too magnify With every step she took it grew more and more intense Girl you better take this cake she yelled holding the plate out in front of her I turned to run but she quickly snatched up my arm before I could get away No I shouted feverishly trying to pull away from her grip I dont want the cake granny but my pleas of desperation came to no avail My grandmother started to tug me towards the kitchen table her fingers angrily wrapped around my tiny forearm Suddenly she yanked me forward making my body jump about two feet in her direction tilting my face towards hers She looked down at me with an awful glare Dark hollow eyes glowered down from Grans wrinkled sockets Her once loving face was now rigid and stiff with a sadistic expression that I had by no means seen before You will eat this cake She shouted through gritted teeth Even if I have to shove it down your throat piece by piece I had never seen this side to my Gran before My once sweet devoted granny had turned into this vicious monster plucked straight out of my worst nightmares My small frame quaked in fear and tears began to seep from my eyes I had never known terror like this My insides loosened and squirmed like jelly making the contents of my bladder empty and leak down my legs To say I was afraid would be the understatement of the freakin decade But you know what There was something else I was more fearful of Even as I pissed myself in sheer horror from the presence of my devillike grandmother there was still something more bloodcurdling more utterly terrifying than herthat fucking cake NO echoed from my lips in a banshee scream and with all the strength I possessed I juggernauted into my grandmother My body throttled into her torso head first making a loud solid grunt bellow from the old woman Her arms flew in the air letting me go in the same instance and her vast body collapsed backwards before suddenlyCRACKThe sound of my grandmothers head crashing along the rim of her kitchen table splintered throughout the house Gran thudded to the ground like a sack of potatoes and the plate with the cake she so firmly held onto shattered on the floor I stared at her lifeless body as blood began to seep through her head and flow on the linoleum I was still too little to know the true meaning of life and death but I did know for sure that red liquid was not suppose to be running out of her head like that I bent down and looked into Grans half opened eyes They werent black any more Theyd gone back to their normal brown again Not really knowing what to do I just stared down at the gruesomeness of it all watching the chunks of yellow cake absorb the blood until each piece was just as red To make a long story short the police were eventually called My Grans weekly bridge game was on that day and a couple of her elder counterparts found her body and me sitting in a pool of piss and blood staring at it Needless to say there were lots of screams Oh and youre probably wondering what that smell was right I actually didnt find out until I was well into my teens what exactly it was I was pouring it into my foster parents coffee one morning when it finally hit meCyanide From the smell of it Gran probably couldnt have used too much either Maybe half a teaspoon give or take totally undetectable to the average persons nosebut not to mine So thats what that was go figure  I remember thinking that to myself as I stirred the cyanide into two mugs My foster parents passed away later on that day I wish I could say I feel sadness over it but I really dont  I was more consumed with thoughts on why my grandmother was trying to kill me Was it because of what Id done to Oscar her cute little Maltese I mean if Id known the oven wasnt a suitable place to put a dog I might have done things differently I was only two at the time Or perhaps it had something to do with what happened with Mommythat really was unfortunate I didnt want to hurt her but she was an obstacle that just had to be removed But anyways thats neither here nor there Im an adult now and those days are long behind me Im actually on my way to my boyfriendsexcuse meexboyfriends apartment right now Im visiting him and that slut he cheated on me with And guess what They just had a baby isnt that the sweetest thing  ,A nose for things,9,nosleep,top_day
FUCK,7,3,1rhjmk,7,So my uncle has always been into the paranormal and he got me into paranormal investigation Or ghost hunting to simplify it a few years back Well I go with him on a lot of them and we do it for free for people who think something paranormal is going on in their houses I always saw it as a nice little hobby to do on the weekends to blow of some time and I always liked being scared I mean thats how I even know about this subreddit because I like reading it And thats one of the only reasons I knew about what had happened on my last investigation We got a call from a family out in the middle of the country saying they had begun hearing weird voices when they were each alone but the  year old son was the one who had it happen the most I went through every scenario I could think on the way there Something was legitimately going on that was paranormal one of the kids was lying and was fucking with the rest of the family and other such things Well when we got there we talked with the family and everyone seemed happy except the two children The son was as I said earlier  and the girl was  they seemed uneasy looking off into corners and such I took a note about it but didnt dwell on it that much We went around the house marking places we would put cameras and getting the lay out of the house Once we finished that we went back to our van and started getting ready After we set up all of our equipment we each got our POV Point of view cameras strapped on and started our investigation My Uncle took the upstairs our colleague took the first floor And I went into the basement to do a little investigating of my own I made my way downstairs and grabbed my Walkytalky and radioed my uncle asking if everyone was ready for me to hit the main light breaker He gave me the go ahead and I flipped the little switch plunging the whole house into darkness I held up the other camera I had with me so I could have a camera move around freely  plus it had a night vision setting so I could see where I was going Well I turned it on and walked slowly to the chair I had placed in the room so I could sit comfortably waiting for something to happen And after an hour or so of me questioning the darkness It answered backMy instincts kicked in and I put a call in on the radio for everyone to tell me where they were And everyone was exactly where they said they were supposed to be My heart froze in my throat from fear but excitement so I stood and asked who I was talking to and I heard a small wispy chuckle before it said softly You know who I am I swallowed hard before continuing to walk around the room and asking questions It stayed silent for a few questions before I asked why it was here It chuckled again before I heard a small sound Like a door knob jiggling and I turned towards it My camera landed on a door knob sticking out from a sheet that I guess had covered it before I walked towards it slowly pulling the sheet off to reveal a shabby door about waist height with peeling paint and scratch marks  I put in a call on the radio telling my uncle and the others I had found something and for them to meet me in the basement I got no answer back but I assumed they had gotten the message My uncle did that a lot he tended to get over excited with these things so I figured he was just trying to get here as fast as possible  But the paranormal curiosity ran in the family so I reached down and grabbed the knob it was warm as if someone had been holding it for a longtime I steadied myself before twisting it and pushing it open I looked through my camera screen as I walked into the door The atmosphere around me seemed to change instantly even though all the lights in the house was off it just seemed to be darker and colder in here the basement itself  I looked around in the room through the screen until I saw a lone chair in the center of the room I walked forward until I was right next to it and then began looking around more I jumped a bit at the bright light on my screen until I noticed it was a mirror It was bolted onto a beam  next to the chair and when I looked to the left I noticed the same thing I thought it was really strange so I walked around the front of the chair and accidentally kicked something over  It was loud and then I heard a sound of rushing water My heart leapt into my throat as I looked down and around looking for the source until my camera came upon a metal bucket slightly rolling with water coming out I also saw a candle and a small match book and thats when it hit me My whole body filled with fear as the realization flooded my head This was a three kings set up I turned towards the door pointing the camera as I looked through it I saw the door slam and I stopped My whole body froze from pure terror and it took me a few seconds before I let out a scream for help After I stopped I heard the soft chuckle come from behind me in the darkness and I just stood there with my eyes closed shaking as I felt a soft breath on the back of my neck I heard a voice My voice whisper right into my ear  Do you know who I am now I stood there for a second before screaming again and then I heard the door bust open and I saw flash lights on me and my uncle asking what was wrong I just ran from the room to the breaker box and flipped on all the lights I then sank to the floor looking at him as he sat next to me and asked all that happened I just held out my camera to him and he took it Before he watched it he asked me why I didnt call for back up and I looked at him before telling him that I did He looked at our colleague before watching the recording After that he asked me if we all went in together would I go back in I nodded as long as we kept the lights on and we went in and it was as I thought It was a set up for  The three kings I shuddered as I turned to my uncle asking if he knew what it was He didnt so I explained it to him and I pointed to the bucket  and it has been used recently The bucket was full of water  My uncle nodded to me and put a wrap on the investigation We went back home and I have decided to type this up Tomorrow we will be going and talking to the family about what happened and who had done the three kings in the house  I think the three kings set up has something to do with what has been happening at the house I will update you all on what happens after we talk to them ,What have these people done,10,nosleep,top_day
OsamaBinHiding,3,2,1rhxdo,5,Last night was like every other night for me Have dinner on my own in my small yet cost flat and watch a little bit of TV Around  or  oclock I start to crack on with some work as I had a university deadline in a couple days time The minutes started going faster and before I knew it it was  oclock Where did the time go I thought It had only felt like a few minutes However this was a normal occurrence for me The world kind of disappears when I get lost in a train of thought and for the life of me I cant break out of itI had just remembered that I had a seminar early in the morning and suddenly thought Fuck I better try and get some sleep See I live in an old building that has been converted into flats in the suburbs of a major city So it isnt uncommon to hear floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and all the walls are very thin so noises in the middle of the night just tend to go over my head I wouldnt consider myself someone who doesnt get scared easily but when youre familiar with floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and branches tapping your window  you tend to grow some thick skinLast night wasnt like any other night in my flat though As I mentioned earlier I was alone My flatmate  lets call him Evan for the sake of the story was away celebrating thanksgiving with his family but hes away a lot so Im used to spending a long period of time on my own My usual night routine of showering brushing my teeth and cleaning the kitchen was over and I went into my room to finally rest my head for the night and that was when I first noticed something My drawers were all pulled open To most people this is probably nothing  but for me it wasnt normal I suffer from borderline OCD and everything especially in my room needs to be in order and I remember waking up and everything was in order I hadnt left my flat today either Im too tired for this shit I thought and went to bed Its weird though isnt it That something like a mattress and a duvet can make you feel so safe like nothing can hurt you I remember being a child and I made sure none of my limbs were outside of my bed incase something grabbed me in the middle of the night Such a feeble piece of furniture can make you feel so safeWell not anymore for me Last night I heard the usual creaking of the floorboards  no biggy right However as I drew closer to conscientious I realised that these creaking sounds werent coming from the surrounding walls and neighbouring flats but they were coming from under my bedAnd thats when I felt the unmistakable sensation of a cold coarse finger stroking mine over the side of my bed ,Last night,7,nosleep,top_day
TaylorBonaseraSr,0,3,1rhb2e,4,I can explain why Im so afraid of mirrors or anything that could reflect light even a glass door Its so difficult for me to talk about it sometimes but other times I feel her pressing me on to tell as many people about her as possible She broke my mirror the first time just crashed right through the glass and shattered the glass into a literal hundred pieces It was such a pain to have to clean all that up I got at least five cuts But she didnt care At the very least she didnt laugh at me or yell at me to clean faster At least she was nice enough to check herself for that Anyway I got my mirror replaced She didnt break the bathroom mirror again but she broke the great mirror in the hallway while she was running through it I dont understand how she did it its pressed up right against the wall Shed have to ram her body sideways She didnt even have any visible cuts She told me she was sorry and that she would try not to do it again I believed her and she was true to her word But soon enough I hear the crashing again But this time its my door The majority of my glass door has been smashed through but the weird thing is that the hole is shaped like Quasimodo No one lives here that has a body shaped like that The other times I checked her she didnt have any cuts on her but this time she was bleeding so much from every part of her body that she had to go to the hospital I had to sit there and watch her but she couldnt explain what had happened When the doctor asked neither could I because I hadnt been there Its strange how selective she is she wont smash into anything except mirrors or glasslooking things Anywhere there isnt this kind of stuff nothing bad happens She tells me that she feels so cold whenever she walks by something like that and she gets an uncontrollable urge to destroy it She talks to me about it so often I feel like Im beginning to share the feelingIts starting to unnerve me and I dont want to live with her anymore But I cant break the joint liability contract She told me to cover all the things in the house that could possibly create a reflection so I did But I find her desperately tearing off the covers when she thinks Im not lookingOne day Id had enough so I decided to take off one of the covers in my room It couldnt hurt just for a little while when she couldnt see She wouldnt notice But after a minute of reveling in my refreshed reflection I saw her standing there So close She was so ugly She copied my expression and mocked my horrified face She followed me here to my own room I couldnt turn around There was no point I felt a pressure from her on my shoulders so great I couldnt keep a straight posture She was laughing at meBut Id heard that laugh somewhere before And Id seen that face before too It looked so much like my own She must have heard my thoughts because she said she told me to never look at her by means of a reflection I couldnt stand the sight of her face anymore it was so scary Itd been such a long time since Id spent so many minutes just staring at her I had to take control So I bashed the bedroom mirror in balling my bare hands into fists and repeatedly thrashing until I could feel the glass cutting into my skinItd been so long since Id last done that Now every time I look I can see her feel her I see her staring at herourreflection through my eyes,My Blank Mirror,7,nosleep,top_day

Foundations,0,0,1rhbzy,3,Read Part  here httpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsyngvconnectedIt has been a little over a year since I last wrote  just over a year since the last nightmare  I was foolish to think I was somehow cured that as Dr Lough suggested getting it out of my head and into a journal would helpI read back over my last and only journal entry as I tried to describe the nightmare  It is so chaotic and scattered yet Im unable to find any other way to convey the details  That is the terror of the dream at its core  utterly chaotic  Jerking from one sensation to the next the hesitant probing of my fingers as they cover the smooth flesh where my eyes should be to the damp defeat in realizing those fingers have torn away the protective lids in confusion  All of this in layers of sleep  waking to the comfort of my mothers figure only to then know it is just another stage of the dream playing out with her eerie voice echoing through my bodyYoure connected nowEven now in understanding that my last entry seemed to bleed out through the pages Im struggling to form coherent thoughts onto this paper  Each detail seems to tie into the next only to fall apart when I try to see the whole  I wonder what type of clinical association Dr Lough could make  Is this what schizophrenia feels like  I have no way to explain it  It is as though there is a novelists grand plot line swirling around my body in paper shreds and each time I reach out I can snatch only a sliver of a scene unable to ever piece the parts into an understanding  Im fairly certain this entry and perhaps any subsequent entries will be just as erratic  I just cannot force these thoughts togetherSo much has changed in the last year it is so hard to recall my state of mind the last time the nightmare came to me  I have a son now nearly  months old  We must have just found out Rachel was pregnant around the time I last wrote  Could that have been a factor in the nightmare returning after years of peace  Was my mind so overwhelmed with the thought of being a father the changes to my life the responsibility it somehow dredged that old horror back from my subconscious  I cant help but think it must have played a role  It has been a blur so many other things seem to have fallen into place  Though they are exciting it seems predetermined somehow rushedOver the last decade I have had a slight obsession with the home I grew up in  I knew I would live there once again  returning it to ownership in my family  though I never anticipated it would happen so quickly  Rachels grandmother died leaving her an inheritance that allowed us to leap forward several years in our plans together  It was Christmas Day the day she died  I guess her last gift to us  Three months after my son was born we were moving back into the mountains back to the walls I had called home as a boy  One thing I feel for certain this home is the source  The nightmare started here always took place here was always fueled here  Im beginning to remember things or have recurrent thoughts I have not had for nearly two decades  It is as though these things are unlocked from muscle memory as I walk this houseAs a child I would reach the top of the second floor staircase which opened onto a hallway always with my head down staring at my feet  Left at the end of a long hallway was a guest room  Large floor to ceiling windows would reflect back a warped view of the person looking down to them  Right across a short landing was my bedroom  I had trained myself to never look left at night  as the small nightlight by my bedroom door would throw twisted shadows onto my reflection in the long guest room windows  If I would look up I would become stuck in fear with the reflection  The windows seemed to pulse with my heartbeat flexing my body larger then smaller in the glass  My feet became rooted in place the black of the windows and the emptiness behind them tunneling out for me  The nightlight would flicker in then out each time causing my shape to jump forward as though I were being pulled down the hallway towards the darkness  I never remembered breaking loose turning and walking back to my bedroom and going to sleep  I would wake up in my bed hours later staring at my hands inspecting for blood and knowing I just had the nightmare I learned I kept my head down and did not look to the leftOur first night in the home that muscle memory followed suit  After turning off the main floor lights I climbed the staircase  My son was sleeping against my chest his arms wrapped around my neck and shoulder  My head was down as I crested the top step turning to the right towards my room which was now his  As I neared the bedroom door his forehead left my shoulder  His back straightened and his arm peeled away from my neck  I felt his arm extend straight back behind my head  I didnt need to look at his eyes I knew  Those eyes followed his arm to his hand reaching down the hallway to the windows  The nightlight flickered as he let out a giggle  I took the last step into his bedroom and shut the door,Connected Again,3,nosleep,top_day

ephique,0,0,1rikrx,4,I grew up in a small town in Ohio with my mom dad and big sister We were a normal family neither happy nor sad somewhere in between I was always interested in music as a kid so I spent most of my time playing piano practicing guitar or trying my best to write my own songs It was also some sort of medicine for me it helped me drift away into my own world when my sister and my mom had disputes You see my sister was one of those rebellious teenagers at the time that had to have their own way or the rest of the world had to suffer their unfair ranting I hated it I hated hearing her yell at my poor motherDuring a lonesome walk home from school one day I got a call from my dad making sure that I didnt have any plans and telling me that I had to come home as fast as possible My dad never called my cell phone unless he really wanted something so I knew right away something was up I remember jogging most of the route home since my dad sounded so serious It gave me the creeps to say the leastI jumped over the fence surrounding our villa and paced myself into our house The kitchen was the first room youd see upon entering and it was empty so I assumed they were in the living room upstairs As I was making my way up the stairs I could hear my sister sobbing uncontrollably something had definitely happened My dad was standing up as my sister was sitting on the couch he told me to sit down as wellI was scared and curious at the same time Dad and my sister never really spoke or had any arguments since my father didnt bother caring too much about any of my sisters business so I could figure out that this wasnt about my sister I remember sitting there in dead silence with the exception of my sister shedding tears and trying to keep her crying as quiet as possible My dad was looking like he had no idea what to do or say as if he didnt know how to explain something to meFinally after a long pause my dad made an introduction to whatever I thought this was about at the time He said Your mother and then he needed to grasp some air and he continued Your mother has passed awayI was eight years old and I couldnt grasp that concept I didnt understand death or that my mom was eternally gone I just sat there as I was developing an irrational anger towards godknowswhat I remember thinking how unfair this was I do however forgive my dad for telling me so bluntly he didnt know what to do and he was in shock at the timeMy sister continued crying she asked dad how mom died although it was obvious she didnt actually care to know at that precise moment She was just being desperate and no one could blame her I thought it was my sisters fault when I was there I thought that was why she was crying so much I didnt shed a single tear I kept it all inside Of course that didnt mean this incident didnt haunt me for years I never stopped thinking about my mother The aftermath of my mothers death is what has been shaping my life the recent years My sister was very weak emotionally and it basically drove her insane My dad had to take her to an actual mental hospital Something I didnt even think existed when I was eight This resulted in that I didnt get to meet my sister very often my dad kept telling me she was in a special school for students that wanted a challenge but I overheard enough conversations to know where she really was I guess my dad was trying to keep me out of it and I didnt blame him I was guessing that my sister wasnt doing very well at the hospital since we got to see her less and less as years went by something that troubled me I hated living in this big villa of ours with just my dad It felt so dead and my dad had been more kept to himself after mom died We didnt do anything I literally spent all time at home in my room making or playing music Me and my dad didnt even greet sometimes when I came home from school it was depressing My theory for his change in behavior has always been that he blamed himself for my mothers death something that Im about to get intoYou are probably wondering how she died by now and its a legit question to be asking The best answer I could give you is that I dont know My dad has always told me she died of liverfailure but for some reason that has always sounded like a lie to me It didnt add up my mom never had any problems with her liver before and she didnt drink I think it was something he made up when I was younger because he assumed I wasnt mature enough to hear the truth In addition to this whenever I asked my dad about this matter hed get heavily upset Nowadays I never ask about my moms death nor do I even bring up mom as a topicYears went by and I ended up being fourteen It kept going like I just described I spent most times in my room playing music as my dad did whatever he was doing on his own in the house My dad did work he had the nighttime shift at a local bottle factory Im not joking he actually made glass bottles for a living He had higher ambitions but most of them got crushed when he and my mother got my sister they had to move and dad basically had no other financial option than to quit the university he was attending at the time and get a quick and close job You guessed it the bottle factoryI was riding my bike home late at night after spending the evening in the school library at one point when I was fourteen My school was the type that had an afterschool library that didnt close till  pm I didnt need any of the books or supplies that the library offered I just studied there sometimes since it felt less depressing than my father and our lonely villa Either way I hadnt seen my sister for two years that night and I was starting to get the idea that I wouldnt see her again for another two When I arrived at the house the front door was open This is odd I thought Upon closer examination I realized that someone had taken the spare key from its hidden spot underneath one of my mothers old jars Its never smart to have a spare key hidden right next to the door number one mistake people do when it comes to spare keys It did look like whoever had taken it did suffer a struggle before finding it The rug outside the door was all muffled up and there were scratches on the door around the lock I suspected we had been robbed so I pulled out my cell phone ready to call the police This is when I heard something coming from inside the house I was dead scared to say the least this could have been armed robbers or maybe something worse I didnt know It sounded like someone was grinding furniture against the floor trying to move it It was so dark as well I remember not seeing more than pitch black looking into the open door technically if someone was in there they would have seen me because of the street lights I started to slowly pace into the house walking towards the noise This is where I had to make a decision was I going to suddenly turn on the lights in order to reveal whatever was in there or was I going to approach it in the dark I picked the former I was just going to switch the lights on when I could see someone strafe into the light coming in through the kitchen window It was my sister naked My entire mindset had to change into a totally different way of dealing with the situation it took me a good couple of seconds to assume she escaped the hospital I switched on the lights in an instant She had redecorated the entire kitchen in the dark Of course it all looked hideous and random she didnt know what the hell she was doing I remember being in a slight discomfort I had never seen my sister naked in my entire life I also hadnt seen her for a good couple of years at all She didnt look very comfortable either she looked like she didnt know who I was and was wondering what I was doing thereI uttered Linda out loud that was her name She didnt respond she just continued standing there looking at me Dont you remember me Im your brother I still couldnt get any feedback out of her it was as if the wheel wasnt spinning at all I wasnt sure what the protocol here was not knowing the number to the mental institution or anything I figured Id try to call dad before I got to press the call button on my cell phone she uttered Dont call dad This is when I realized she couldnt be completely empty inside after allYou dont want to call dad She continued  I had no idea what to do I assumed this was part of the reason she was in the mental hospital in the first place Luckily my dad got home at that point not coming from a finished shift at work He had a good five hours at least left I assumed the hospital had phoned him and told him about the situation My father ran into the house as fast as he couldThis is when something I didnt expect happened he told me to leave He pointed at the door as if I had no idea how to find my way out of my own house I asked him where I was supposed to go he told me to wait in his car Judging from how serious my dad seemed I didnt think twice about it I ran out to the car As I was sitting in the car I could see my sister walk past the kitchen window a couple of times I remember how she made no effort to cover her breasts I had no clue what the two of them were discussing although I never saw my sister move her lips so Im guessing my dad did most of the talking After a couple of minutes my dad started to walk to the car he joined me inside I remember asking why he didnt bring Linda with him Dont call her that name he shouted in response I was so confused at this point Dad started the car and drove me to my only friends house I didnt see him very often though I was a lone wolf growing up and I still was at this point I didnt really create any friendships I remember sitting in the car as he ran up the steps to ring my friends doorbell his mother opened in her night dress and looked confused I assumed my dad made up some emergency story to cover what was going on in order to get me a place to stay overnight I didnt even know what was going on to be fairWhatever he told them worked I got to spend the night at my friends place Tims place to be exact It was pretty awkward I remember I only saw Tim a couple of times a week and that was when we shared classes in Spanish We got to be deskmates because the teacher made up whom to sit next to each semester so we werent very close It was a Friday so there was no school the morning after I guessed that made it easier for my dad leaving him the freedom to pick me up whenever he wanted to He did but not before giving me enough time to fully experience the awkward breakfast conversations with Tims parents both trying to justify me as Tims best friend I dont know Tim didnt have many friends I guessOn the way home I asked my dad what was going on the night before and he basically stopped the car and stared at me as if I was mocking him I remember how desperate he looked as if he had no fire left in his heart He uttered the words Do you think I wanted any of this as he grabbed his hair in regret All I wanted was a normal family with no circumstances and Im not blaming you when Im saying this because frankly you are the only sane member left in this livelihood of ours Is what came out of his mouth next I tried to comfort him telling him that he had done a good job raising me and what not I really didnt have a lot of cards in my deck at this point I mean my dad was basically losing itWhen we got home he told me that he was sorry and that I should go up to my room I did go up to my room but I got to tell you I was starting to get very anxious about my dad I really wanted to know what the hell was going on I spent that night recording some guitar sessions for a song and reading books while listening to some ambient records I had found online I couldnt sleep so pulling an allnighter was my only real option I was reading A Brief History of Time for a science project in school I was somewhere in the middle section of the book and started to get dry eyes I figured Id go downstairs into the kitchen to get myself something to drink when I got shocked upon opening the door to the hallway I saw my mother standing just outside looking right at me for a fraction of a second Had all this hassle from the last couple of days driven me insane It freaked me out so much that I ended up never getting a drink The image of my mother outside my door haunted me that entire night I kept thinking about it as I couldnt sleep She looked deranged scared and raw The shortage of light sources in the hallway made her look like she was from a black and white s movie I kept begging for the sun to rise up I even did that thing when you close your eyes and try not to open them because you never know what youll see I might have been fourteen but I can openly admit that I was dead scaredIt finally came to be morning and I ran downstairs still not fully opening my eyes while passing the hallway I remember greeting my dad who was sitting in the kitchen drinking orange juice I was just about to pour myself a glass when he said I think I need help While holding the glass of juice as if he wasnt sure he was going to drink the rest of it I asked him what he meant and he said that he wasnt sure that he had felt very uncomfortable and unstable lately He also mentioned that he was thinking of joining some people from his work in playing golf he thought that could give him some relief I told him that sounded like a pretty good idea jokingly adding that its better than hanging around the house doing nothing He looked offended when I said that something I didnt really understand since he obviously worked all night so that would justify him sleeping through the daysI understand that some of you reading this are wondering how the hell I could have been fourteen and still not know how my mother died Well its hard to explain how uncomfortable of a character my dad was at times and it felt a bit like I was offending him whenever I had to ask because part of me did actually believe she died of liverfailure I mean it was possible Imagine if it was true and I kept asking my dad as if he lied to me Thats the type of thoughts I had in my head about the whole thingHaving that explanation out of the way I did summon the courage to confront my dad one last time It was a couple of days after the conversation about my dad picking up golf I just walked into his room unexpected A part of me had wanted to do this for a long time because I really never knew what he did in his room it looked similar to an office which is nothing hed ever need since he was a labor worker in a bottle factory He was actually sitting at his desk Not only that but the desk was flooded with paperwork of some sort maybe he had picked up an accounting job for the factory during the day something he could manage from home I didnt ask I had a big enough question for him as it wereI dragged out a small chair he had behind the door and figured Id sit on it It was somewhat squeaky and not very comfortable better than standing up anyway Then I leaned forward and I was just about to ask when he interrupted my train of thought by saying You want to know about your sister and what happened the other night Dont you This is where I started to play along because he was already looking emotionally hurt bringing up mom here would have been a carcrash I told him that I was indeed there to ask about my sister He took a good pause before he bluntly exclaimed it to me Your sister is not right in the head shes in a mental hospital I couldnt believe he hadnt figured out that I would have known this by then Not wanting to make a scene I just pretended like I didnt know He explained the context telling me that she couldnt take our mothers death A tear started climbing down his cheeks and then he asked me if there was anything else I wanted to talk about There was no way I could bring up something as sensitive as my mother at this point so I told him that everything was fine and then I left the roomI realized on my way up to my room that my dad was fragile and very close to losing his mind in this problematic family business I had no idea how Id ever get the truth about my mother out of him When I finally had landed on my bed in my room again the image of my mom started crawling back to me The grey scaled portrait of her in the hallway was my mind playing tricks on me I also had a slight feeling that I remembered it from somewhere I mean it was my mom but that exact stare and look she had not only did it frighten me but I swore I had seen it before Night landed again I hadnt spoken to my father again that day I was facing the same obstacle that I had the other night I was too afraid to go downstairs because I thought Id see my mother again We all know you can imagine things in the dark kids do it all the time Its as if your mind fills in the gaps but that incident the other night was different I got more scared the more I thought of it and figured that Id open the door to the darn hallway and turn on the lights in order to feel slightly safer Im not going to lie I did open that door very slowly but as it turned out there was no sign of my mother I turned on the lights and went back into my roomStill not wanting to go to bed not only because it was spring break at this point but also because I was a bit scared I figured Id listen through some of my older songs I had loads of them most of which werent very good however I was still learning how to create music and I never really thought of myself as particularly good especially not at writing my own songs I guess I was decent at playing other peoples songs I basically went through my songs in chronological order it was interesting because was able to hear how much I had improved over the years It took me a good three hours to get past most of my songs and I was reaching the more recent creations of mine I heard something in one of the songs that I never had paid any attention to before it was a slight breeze of white noise in the middle of one of my guitar riffs Knowing that this wasnt an overworked track yet it was made just days ago and I hadnt gotten around to mastering it yet I figured I wasnt going to give it more of a thought That was until the neurons fired that track was made the day I couldnt sleep the day I saw my mother in the hallway Being a bit gullible I figured that Id give it a go using my acoustic headphones I tried everything I played the song backwards I cut out bass middle frequencies high frequencies and even listened to individual recordings of the instruments and samples I couldnt hear anything suspicious just that white noise I was a bit disappointed at the same time relieved Although that white noise shouldnt have been there nothing in my room could have made a noise like that I didnt want to overthink the situation so I ended up hitting the bed Later that night as I still had problems sleeping I was laying in bed listening to the same ambient soundtracks that I was using nights before slowly dozing off to sleep I hadnt been asleep for much more than ten minutes when I started to ascend into that state of sleep when youre in a dream at the same time as real life is somewhat happening to you I could hear a thumping sound coming from somewhere Before I knew it I got woken up by a loud bass noise it sounded like some kind of a technical disorder I continued lying in bed trying to figure out if I just dreamt about the noise or if it actually occurred this is when I heard a much dampened sound coming from the other side of my room It sounded a lot like someone was trying to get some kind of sound device to work It got quieter and quieter and when I thought it was about to disappear I could hear a voice very distorted and unstable speaking in what I believe was Russian It took me a couple of minutes but I finally realized what I thought the sound was coming from I had left my old amplifier on from when I was playing guitar I bounced out of bed in order to turn on the lights I was overlooking the entire room as I hit the switch for the blink of an eye just next to the amplifier I saw my mom again just as the light went on The same stare same face still that black and white filtered look from before I got so shocked I fell down on the floor the noise coming from the amplifier stopped in the same instant I wasnt sure what to make of this and I definitely didnt want to tell my father about what I had seen knowing he has already thrown one of his kin to a mental hospital I had a lot of sleep to catch up on but unfortunately this wouldnt let me sleep I just couldnt sleep at all I never believed in ghosts or anything growing up these two small incidents with my mom being my only experience in what could be categorized into the matter I thought and assumed I was becoming what my sister had become Whatever this all meant and needless to say I didnt get any sleep that night eitherI met my father in the kitchen the next day he was looking a lot better than the last time I had seen him He kept going on and on about how much he was looking forward to playing golf with his workcrew later that afternoon I was happy for him he deserved some time out of the stress After the conversation about an afternoon of longing for a spot in the shade and waiting for your turn on a grass field he added Have you been thinking of your mother lately As if he could read my mind I told him that I was always missing my mother and that I had indeed thought of her a lot lately He stated that he thought I had I had no clue why  Short after that he left for playing golfI kept thinking of why my amplifier was acting up that night I started recalling a clear memory of turning it off after I was done playing In fact I knew I did since the amplifier was connected to an electricity hub that I used to turn off a small lamp I had next to my bed how could it have been on I had no idea Since my dad was out of the building I figured I could use this afternoon without his presence to get some answers I stepped into his room to investigate what he had been doing sitting at that desk of his all those hours I grabbed a bunch of paperwork and sat myself on the double bed next to his desk it got me a slight reminder on how he hadnt gotten rid of the bed he shared with my mother yet The first paper I started examining looked like a letter of some sort as if it was a letter inside a legal template of some company I dont know how Id describe it better than that After further examination I found out it was a letter from my sister sent to our address I remember wondering why dad wouldnt show me something like this Daddy why didnt you visit me last weekend I thought you were coming back I was waiting for you Im sorry if I made a scene I thought something had happened to you I ran to you because I wanted answers no one has answers here Ive been getting visits lately why cant you come to me at the same timeI fixed some grammar and a whole lot of spelling errors for the sake of explaining this to you my sister had the linguistic abilities of a five yearold in this state On afterthought I guessed my dad didnt tell me about letters from my sister since they would inevitably prove that she wasnt in a special school for people who were after tougher challenges Although thinking about it that doesnt sound ridiculously different than a mental hospitalThe rest of the papers seemed to be a real mixture of workrelated things and records of local policeinvestigations Why would my father be looking into cases of murder pedophilia rape and almost anything you can think of It wasnt really my business what he did with his spare time but this was just outright messed up I knew he had a friend in the police force that was either the reason he had these or just the tool he used to get them I didnt even want to know at the time I had enough stuff on my mind already and I hadnt slept in far too longI apologize to whoever reading this if it seems that Im dragging it out with details a bit too much here and there Im only taking precautions to make sure that Im telling it right If Im finally going to tell my story I want it to sound right My father never came home after golfing so I assumed he went directly to work which made complete sense It was starting to get late into the evening and I had absolutely nothing better to do than to once again sit in my room I was trying to figure out ideas for new songs on my guitar This time I wasnt using the amplifier since I was legitimately scared of the noises occurring again My amplifier has been known to pick up foreign radio broadcasts before something that explains the distorted Russian speech last time I wasnt worrying about that I was thinking about my mother showing herself again Not that I was sure that it had anything to do with the amplifier itselfNot too long into that night I started feeling sick of being indoors for so long and I felt like I could use some kind of fresh air as a vacation from all this unexplained mystery I had been experiencing I remember being on the sane side of the fence thinking critically and trying to find solutions not marking everything as if it was a conspiracy from hell I figured Id take my bike down to a local gas station not more than ten minutes from my house I wanted some chips candy and maybe a couple cans of soda I scrambled together some change I found in my room and took off I got there faster than I thought I would It wasnt cold outside either it was a pretty smooth night After grabbing some generic brand of chips Skittles and a couple cans of coke I paid for it and left I didnt spend much time in the store but apparently enough time to get my bike stolen With no bike feeling like a stupid idiot for not locking it I had to walk home Something out of the ordinary happened after this and I wasnt even sure if I was seeing things at first I was walking on this huge open road I guess you could say it was somewhat of a country road It was tied together with the forest behind our house It was the type of road that didnt have any traffic other than truck drivers passing once every couple of hours at night I didnt want to believe my eyes at this point but I saw my sister standing alone wearing what youd imagine someone coming from a mental hospital would wear I assumed she was looking for me she was definitely staring at me I continued walking not necessarily fearing my sister It somehow still felt as if I had a bond with her that she would never have done anything to hurt me As I approached her she didnt give me any response what so ever she was just staring at me in a lightblue scrubcoat looking lifeless I had reached talkingdistance I couldnt believe this was happening It felt surreal like one of those scenarios you cant be prepared for in real life She had started to shake a bit I couldnt tell if she was freezing or if she was nervous I asked her if she was looking for me out there and if she had escaped the hospital She didnt respond I got the notion that she was slightly scared of me as if I was a threat to her After a short gap of silence I noticed that she was holding something behind her back I got a bit worried that she had some kind of a weapon or a blunt object to swing at me so I stepped back when I spotted it She started to slowly bring it forth it was a plastic bag From the way she was holding it I could tell it wasnt heavy or dangerous for that matter I withdrew the step back I took earlier and tried to peer down into the bag then she started to stretch it out to me I took this from your house the other day Im sorry I think this belongs to you Jonathan I do realize that I never told you my name it is indeed Jonathan I was slightly astonished that she had remembered my name even she seemed to be so out of it I remember grabbing the plastic bag she wouldnt let go of it too lightly either it was as if she still wanted it After I had gotten whatever was in the bag we shared another brief moment of silence she wouldnt stop staring into my eyes during these Then she told me to never mention any of this to our dad Shortly after she started walking towards the forest as if she knew where she was heading I saw the headlights of a car coming straight at me and my sister whoever was in this car was driving way ahead of the speed limit I noticed when it started to get closer to us that it was my dads car acting on impulse I threw myself into a nearby ditch as I got to witness my dad chasing after my sister I didnt even know if I wanted him to catch her or not she was purposely running away from him He dragged her into his car and they both drove away heading the direction he was originally going This was the second time she had successfully escaped this mental hospital and how the hell did my sister make it so far both times Something wasnt right I knew from when I was younger that the hospital wasnt anywhere close to where we lived since my dad sometimes was gone for ten hours upon visiting her Of course at the time it was supposedly a special school but that doesnt change the logic of it He never brought me with him whenever he visited my sister since he kept me in the dark about the whole hospital thingI ran the rest of the way home trying not to drop anything I still had all the items I bought at the gas station I wanted to make sure that I could get home before my dad did I had no clue whenever he would get back and not wanting him to find out whatever was in the bag my sister gave me I couldnt spot my dads car in the driveway so I felt relieved as I stepped into the house I didnt bother putting my drinks in the fridge or anything I made my way back to my room as fast as I could I dont really know why but I locked the door after me as if there was something to fear I sat myself on the bed with all the lights in the entire room switched on I made sure to put all the bags with snacks in them aside as I was getting ready to dig into whatever my sister ran into the night to give me I never really thought of something until now and that is how my sister could have found me It must have been a coincidence or she had been following me for a while knowing she couldnt approach me in the store I dont knowI looked into the bag it seemed to be random belongings from the drawers in our living room and maybe some stuff from one of the cupboards we had in the kitchen After sorting out stuff that had no relevance what so ever for example there was a roll of tape in there I planned to spend more time on the more interesting items The first thing I picked up was a small collection of family photos most being after mom died The next thing I could grab was a couple of rocks they werent even dry I guessed she must have gotten those just before she passed me the bag There was only one thing left in the bag an usbstick I took the stick out and threw away the bag Then I started looking at the photos as I was trying to reason why she would have taken any of these from our house The only thing that somewhat made sense is that a couple of them were from when she wasnt sent to the hospital yet but it was pretty much pending already In fact most of these photos took place a couple of weeks after our mother passed away On one of them its my sister showing off her prom dress she was planning on wearing she actually wasnt acting too badly the first couple of weeks I guess she didnt process our mothers death until later or something Another photo is of dads old car he had to sell it in order to compensate for our familys financial depression from when we lost the main income our family had my mothers candle business He loved that damn car with his entire heart we even used to joke about how mom was jealous of the car There were more photos but I stopped going through them when I realized a couple of them had a handwritten marking of the letter x behind them It noticed this when I was flipping them as I was trying to get them all to be facing me I sorted the photos with no marking away and started to focus more on the ones with the marking I figured my sister must have had done this for what reason I was about to find out I kept staring at the first picture it was the one I told you about earlier the one of my fathers old car It was a Pontiac from the early s and it must have cost him a fortune I never had any particular memories of the car I remember it spending most of its time in our garageI kept looking at the photograph and the more I stared at it the more I started to wonder why my dad hadnt use the car more he obviously loved it The photo was taken for an ad in the newspaper for selling it of course I was just about to put the sad photo away when I caught a glimpse of my mother sitting in the backseat It wasnt very clear and she seemed somewhat transparent She had the same drainedout appearance and blank stare that she had from when I saw her in the hallway outside my room and this was taken after her death I couldnt believe what I was looking at I remember dropping the photo out of shock so many thoughts started circling inside of my head I have my whole story theres a k letter limit on reddit NoSleep Ill post it as soon as I can ,I want to tell about my mother,4,nosleep,top_day

InsanityInABottle,0,1,1rgw03,2,Extra Extra The Piggy killer is at it again Yelled the paperboy holding a darkened paper above his head screaming the same phrase over again as if it was no big deal I walked towards him and asked him How muchOnly ten cents sirHa Must be a pretty good story then I said as I fumbled for a large dime I handed it into the boys hand its gleam bouncing the light of the sun veiled through the mist of rain into my eyes I blinked quickly and grabbed the paper quickly turning from the boy hearing How about a tip sirHow about you wipe your ass with the metal Ive already given you I said back to the boy who furrowed his brow and continued screaming for new customers As I walked along Heros Avenue I kept the paper open reading it over again In large font shouted Piggy killers new victim with a picture of a woman apparently known by the name of Jessica Turrow She wore a large smile on her face as she raised a glass of champagne above her head for a toast I presumedThe article read The psychopath depicted as a man with a pigs head on worn over his own face has struck again Witnesses described him as large while wearing a reddened trench coat then finally a bib which read the term KISS THE COOK slathered neatly against his chest in gore He had organs and even a human spinal cord attached to his coat and as usual was found was mist was floating through the air and at dawn We had identified the victim through a ring found on the hand of the woman who had been chopped to pieces and nailed against the side of the church If you are to spot anyone fitting under the description contact the police immediately or you may be his next victimI laughed as I watched terror shrouding the faces of everybody who grasped a paper in their hands all walking along the street as automobiles drove recklessly between one another threading the needle on the two way street not large enough for two cars to fit onI walked towards the police station which was cleverly located across the street from a coffee shop a brothel and a printing office A police car drove by its loud horn sounding flashing red and white reflecting the light from the rain directly into my eyes I walked into the station the smell of fresh cigars flooding into my nose A man screamed from across a large waiting room looking down at the paper then looked up and said Oh Its the wonderful Flynn Of course my dear come come I walked past him glaring at his smug face and then opening the door into my officeA man sitting on a chair for those waiting to enter my office abruptly greeted me He smiled and said Well hello sir I am Dean Osterrietch and believe I have a lead on the notorious killerThe pig oneY wait there are moreI believe there are just they might not like attention as much as our friend hereWell thanks for informing me of that rather morbid concept but I have gotten hundreds of pictures of the killer coming out of his lairThe man pulled out a large portfolio of pictures and dumped them onto my desk arranging them appropriately So if you look at these pictures it was for when he first got into the business holding small weapons all identifiable all related to the cutting of meat Then as you look to the left these are the later pictures which are of him coming out holding bodies on his shoulders sitting in the back of his eatery and chopping them up putting them into boxes and looking pleased with himself all the while in his pig mask But he seems to be getting careless He cam outside barely slipping on his mask in time for my camera to flash a photo his face seemed veiled in something Something sticky something gruesome But if you look closer you can quite easily see the silhouette of his face Large hooked nose eyes clouded in blue teeth sharpened to perfection and a dripping mouthHa So youre basically implying that youve seen a notorious killer walk in and out of a location multiple times and not even dared to act on it I beginning to suspect youre the killerBut that would be silly Why would a crazy give himself awayI dont know why dont you tell meI believe this conversation is getting a bit heated I saw the ad in the paper that I should contact the police and thought Id tell you where Ive seen such events Have you ever seen the abandoned butchery on  Bellcove Street Well theres your place Sir said the man as he gathered his pictures and threw them into his bag which smelled of defecation and nickels I watched as he slammed the door then sighed and sat down on my desk rapidly pressing the keys of my typewriter updating the information Ive received from the manMysterious man visits police station says he has a lead on the piggy killer As you all know the notorious killer has crossed the line now Enough to even be called a serial killer What a sick bastard he is I continued being as pessimistic as possible updating the paper then grabbing my camera as I finished the article Typing in my name finishing with my name saying Written by Flynn CovetailDarkness was beginning to shroud the air perfect night for the killer to strike in his typical environment Light rain was spattering against my window racing down to the bottom of the screening only to fall against an umbrella below As I left my office throwing on my coat I screamed to the man in the front desk Going out tooh lets see Bellcove Street If I dont come back Phone someone I said with a laugh while walking outsideInstantly my boots splashed against the small walkway paved on Western Lagoon highway as the frivolously worthless people would say I walked down towards the street which was naught but four blocks from here I passed by Dontells Donuts Redgars Rotisserie and Salams Spices all involved in the fattening of desperate cops as only fattening diners were located near the station so I developed a theory that every restaurant owner is against usI reached the butchers place which had been looted to hell by the anarchists who were just a group of thugs that didnt do shit to overthrow the government The door had been pried off its hinges yet now it was replaced by a veil of chains hanging off of rusted hooks attached to the doorframe Within the butchery the first thing I noticed was a bed a homeless man sleeping on itI simply ignored the bum and walked around searching for anything considered suspicious I walked through the door smelling the bums shit in the corner and closing my nostrils as well as I could I looked through the shop behind the counter I found several rusted knifes which were corroded to the counter which was a wooden rotten thing with three cutting boards lining it all of which nobody needed The front of the shop seemed completely normal but I listened to the bum waking instantly screaming Whos there I will kill you if youre trespassing on my property I laughed and screamed to him I suggest you run out of here or I may just have to turn you in as a key suspect for the crimes I heard the scuffing of his shoes against the floor running towards meI quickly turned backing up against the wall my sidearm pointed at the bum and screamed GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE I shot to the side of the man who quickly bolted for the door a rat following closely behind him I sat for a minute catching my breath while my vocal chords seemed to scratch against one another in a uncomfortable clunky fashion As I stood I felt the hard callused flesh of an arm pressing against the front of my throat and the sudden feeling of something hard hitting the back of my headHa Damn fool didnt even know what he had coming Shouldnt have fucked with my grandpa shouldnt have yelled My ears hurt Are they ringing Why the FUCK am I here I thought a conversation to myself as I raised the man into the air the familiar heaviness of my mask pressing against my face the pigs blood leaking down my neck warming me keeping the cold away I looked at my setup which was simply the back room of a butchers shop a heavy steel door muffling sounds on both sides of the fifty wood wide hallway of a roomBlood dripped into wooden bowls Id gotten from the shop the bodies of fresh meat hanging from the ceiling Pigs cows chickens even a few deer but the most stubborn of prey the pigs The sticky cunts hung from the ceiling their wrists cut their feet missing their hands stuffed into their fucking loud mouths The damned pigs that walked the streets reading their stories about who About me The beautiful man who is dealing righteousness to the crazies to the rich Though they think that theyre so safe in their leather homes they should be the ones making chairs their dried hides need to be a part of furnitureOh what an inventor I will be But the best part is nobody looks twice at the photographer Nobody looks at whos behind the camera they only care about the picture And I am finally the one in the picture Flynn the little anus that believed he owned the whole world because the police were backing him up NO NO NO YOU ARE MY FUCKING BITCHI whistled a tune of sorrow and greed that humans so openly express I raise him in the air catch a hook to his leg and strip him down to his bare neck This selfconceited asshole needs one thing A hook curving through the cheek wrenched from his cheek He thought I was the killer NO THAT IS NOT THE FUCKING WORDOh My friend is waking up Finally a new toy to play with Oh what a joy he will be Oh no What will I say to him I guess Ill just wing it I guess Ill just talk to him  Where will I display this beauty Ooh The police station Mmm how delectable would that be To show the pigs that even their weapons cant defend them from me THEY ARE GOING TO LOVE ME I am a hero I love being a hero and dont try to talk me out of my heroism I AM AMAINGMy eyes slowly opened to find a man in a pig mask the rotting dreaded animal seemed to have a grin on its face I was hanging upside down and fuck my leg hurts Why does my leg hurt Where the hell am I Oh youve awakened spouted the pig its squeaky voice ringing through my ears I screamed Help me Help HES GOING TO KILL ME Now thats not how you treat a guest is itFuck youOh language language my dear friend If you even try saying something like that I will cut off your cock and feed it to my friend MrSqueaks over hereI looked to where he was pointing which was a large column in the room a decomposing rat nailed to the pole Somebody is going to catch you They know where I amOh I believe they do if only your little desk friend was there to hear what you had to say said the phsyco with a smile He pointed at the ceiling which had two hooks on it chains hanging from them and a headless man blood dripping in a steady stream of thickness into a wooden bowl Why are you doing this to these peopleOkay okay story time Oh yay stories FUCK OFF GREG THIS IS MY TIME TO SHINEI looked at the pig with doubt pain shooting up my leg throbbing slowly into my brain SO let me tell you why I love my job okay Okay So when I was twelve I thought Im going to take pictures of weddings Im going to take pictures of people in love because everyone elses happiness is mine He said this while pinning his right hand against his heart which contained an extra few layers of flesh sewed against his own along with a tattoo stolen from his victimOkay so anyways What do ya know Im doing that now I am a photographer I love people being happy SO I one day was at this one glorious wedding full of lovely people I had started talking to a woman and a little oh what is it called Fetish of mine was developed As we were in bed I took out my camera and took shots of my experience and little did I know I have a few other kinks I wrung my hands around her delicate throat stuck my finger down her throat and felt the vomit shoot from her mouth I felt the rush as eventually she started to fuckin bleed WHAT A WHORE She began to cough up blood she began to wheeze and it is as these coughs echoed from her throat landing inside of my mouth as our lips touched did I realize how wonderful blood tastes Rich creamy delicious blood coursing from the fountains of our decapitated stumps I invented ways of sucking people dry licking them dry Well at first I was only an amateur but as I got better Oh BOY did I start to love my job Every wedding became a slaughter every wedding gave me a new friend because after all nobody cares about whos behind the camera NOBODY GIVES TWO FUCKING SHITSSo pretty boy I believe its time you started looking into my eyes whenever I snap a photo of your beautiful body He said this as his hand slid down from my chest slowly down to my cock grinning spittle flying out of his mouth as he coughed slid a blade against it as chopped it off I screamed out loud blood spurting from me and all the smile he smiled then I fell asleep never to wake again ,Insanity,3,nosleep,top_day
ReiKoroshiya,0,0,1rgsca,2,Here I am and im going to write about some of the things that go on in my life Sorry for bombarding you with some trivial things and please just hear me outhow about I start at the beginning that seems easier Well back in elementary I was that kid the kid that really no one liked I had a friend here and there but thats about it I was basically a social outcast I never really got my work done I still dont Note that I was a very very angry child and no I was not spoiled if thats what your thinking im the oldest of  kids who had been and are growing up in poverty but my father is very good at managing money which means he is very cheapI had shared a room with my younger brother and for some reason I never grew out of the stage where you sleep with your blankets over your head I had always liked horror even though none of it really scared me even in elementary in the rd grade I found an author by thename of RLStine and I had read tons of his books which remotely captured my interestsA few of the simple things had scared me and I most likely have experiences that I have blocked out of my mind I dont remember much about my childhood at allI dont know why I cant but thats just how it is I do remember bits and pieces though not anything like birthdays mind you Here Ile give some examples I rememberwhen I thought my stuffed animal had red eyes I freaked out a little bit called my parents and my father calmed me down and took it away Years later I went back and found it and of course it wasnt scary anymore Another examplewould be when I saw a witch in my closet but again my father came in and turned the light on to show me that there was nothing there I had clearly saw something but it was gone as soon as the light turned back onOnce he had left and turned the light back of the figure was back again I remember when my body shot up in bed and I let out a blood curtling scream and my parents rushed into the roomand they had tried to comfort me and to calm me down I was bawling my eyes out while hugging my father he had asked me what had happened and I was just mumbling incoherently about it I cant remember what it was that had freaked me out so badly Something else that just pokes out at me was when I was lying in bed and I hear talking so I sit up strait in bed and I see my parents right there talking to each other I couldnt understand what they were saying because they were mumbling and I said hey and they say love you simultaneously and I said aww I love you too you guys I reached out to hug them and they both just vanished and I almost fell out of bedI got top bunk Then their are the things that I have learned from my family throughout the years not much reallythey dont seem to want to talk much about when I was younger I got that I was a horrible child when they brought me to church and that I would bite and snarl when anyone got within an arms reach of mekeep in mind I dont remember that about going to church as a matter of fact I dont remember going to church at all hmmm well skip forward to middle school where I hadactually made friends I did got in so much trouble in middle school its not even funny I could barely even go a week without at least one detention Saturday school and suspensions I had gotten a ton too nowdrugs are prevalent where I live and when I say that drugs were prevalent I truly mean that but honestly the thought of drugs never really appealed to me well I meancertain ones that is the only mind altering substance that I would actually want to do smoke drink etc would be alcohol cause it seems fun and really any hallucinogenic drug and thereis no way I could get ahold of hallucinogenic drugs without paying a ton of money and with my broke ass I cant afford it and because of that im drug free Not to muchhappened in middle school only a few things I started to get hellish demonic dreams oh and speaking of dreams I have always been able to feel pain in my dreams so ifsay I was to get ran through with a spear or had my flesh pealed off in a dream I would wake up and still feel it I also talk in my sleep which sucks ass The vast majority of my dreams became violent and with me being an avid gamer there was usually a sword nearby in my dreams and usually I could and would fight back and be homefree I enjoyed those violent dreams where I won even though I would battle hellish creatures and people I wouldnt consider it a nightmare I got my own room in the basement which was nice and well my brother he was how do you put it Gassy so yeah hot air rises and all that Electronic malfunctions had started occurring like waking up to my radio playing static my alarm clock started to malfunction etc I remember waking up minutes before my alarm clock went off I awoke with a shot of electricity to my left ear Skip forward to highschool in the th grade I found out what creepypasta and scp were it was amazing to find real horror for a changeI read the hell out of creepypastas and found some really cool narrators for them listening to those was very enjoyable I didnt read scps often and I found a very long series called the holdersNear the end of the year I started to feel a presence in my room which was interesting because it didnt have a bad feeling to it the only word that comes to mind to describe it would be light if that makes any senseJump forward one more year I had flunked my freshman year because I dont do my work On those professional tests that they make you take SATs or some shit I did insanely good on those like I should be an A student overall Now i reside in alternative ed Im  right now I declared to my parents that im agnostic instead ofBaptist a few months ago Anyway that presence in my room i hardly feel it anymore and now there is something more sinister and not just in my room anymoreThat thing I actually saw it I fucking saw it it was short like about a foot and a half tall I went to bed last night and you know how earlier I had said I sleepwith my blankets over my head Well I was moving around under the covers and I glanced out underneath the covers and there it was just staring at me a few inches away from my face I had to resist not to punch it because half of me was saying its just my imagination and the other half says that if its real  then im going to freak the fuck out and well I never did hit it and its creepy as fuck that its been watching me I tried to calm my breathing as to not alert it to the fact that I have seen it Ithink it knows I saw it because I have been getting glances of it all day It might have seen me and it might be watching me type thisIt is very short and I can never manage to see any features on its face it just looks dark like a shadow its really really dark everything distorts when I look at it like my depth perception gets thrown off and space distorts around itIf anyone knows what this might beplease tell me,My Life,2,nosleep,top_day
highchairchildren,3,1,1rgqmu,2,Im looking for any input If anyone has had experiences like this is there a way to stop itSo this started about two years ago In the beginning it was just a perpetual bad feeling like something bad was going to happen all the time  I was anxious always alert and never at rest I hardly slept primarily keeping myself awake in order to feel safer Then I started seeing thingsWhen I say seeings things I dont mean like hallucinations well not really Im not crazy There were never any voices and there never have been It was more like a blackout moment in which the worst possible scenario for my environment would play out seemingly right before my eyes Mostly accidents  It happened once while I was sledding  The hill was a steep drop and then inclined back up about  ft or so where it met a busy road Usually people lost momentum and slid back down the hill and came to a rest in the valley but sometimes people would make it all the way up and hit the metal road block that was put up along the hill A watched as a kid went down the hill and then it happened I continued to watch as he went all the way back up the hill and under the metal road block right into the speeding car that was passing by There was blood everywhere I snapped back to reality and looked around Everything was fine There was no blood nobody was hurt just kids sledding around having fun I continued to have random visions for the entire year They varied in severity The worst one left me shaken for a few days afterwards  I was home babysitting my younger sisters and boiling pot of spaghetti for dinner  I moved to the sink to strain the pasta and then went back to turn off the electric stove  My little sister approached me to ask a question and then I had my flash  As I was seeing it I grabbed her by her hair and pressed her face into the stove In that moments I watched as her eyes rolled around in her head and she screamed begging me to stop  I snapped back and couldnt speak I teared up and thought I was going to puke  I ran to the bathroom washed my face sat down on the ground and cried I had never felt such a mixture of fear and remorse in my life I got up and reentered the kitchen finished dinner and continued the night as if nothing happened  She asked me what was wrong and I played it off as a bout of sickness  I sat awake for hours that night and I still couldnt come up with a reason for why this kept happening to me  I asked my mom to see a psychiatrist but unfortunately it was a luxury we simply couldnt afford Then it stopped As quickly as it came in it left and I had no more of an idea about what it was than Id had before  It stayed away for a while I mean really a long time  I was vision free for an entire yearI was prompted to write this because I had another one the other  The first in over a year but I am scared I dont want it to start again  The most recent one was more subtle  I was shaving in the shower went as I brought the razor up my leg somehow or another I cut myself and there was blood everywhere  The tub was washed red with it and there was nothing I could do but stand and watch as it oozed out of my leg and swirled around in the water before going down the drain  Then I flashed back and it wasnt there I hadnt even cut myselfI know this must sound crazy like some Final Destination bullshit  I swear to you I wouldnt have posted it if I didnt have hopes that someone could help  Any input is welcomed,Can anyone help,3,nosleep,top_day

bassslapper,0,2,1rh8lh,0,You think me cruel No Ive only learned to act on what Ive been given Ive learned to deal with my problems in my own way No one understands this but me it seems This is for ME I dont do it for them But they cant understand my need He cant either I must make me Make him understand How did he get here I wish I came back I want him back WHY WONT I COME BACK WHY IS HE HERE ARE YOU SORRY ARE YOU SORRY ARE YOU SORPast this the note is unreadable spewed with a fluid I can only assume is meant to go on the inside of people Not that Id really want to read much more anyways I already know what happens Well not really know but I can feel it Who wrote it I can only assume it was my dear Uncle Drewson if hes even my uncle What is this No clue A note obviously but beyond that speculation reigns Where did I find this My new house in a drawer Nothing is inherently terrifying about that  Oh except that it was under the clothing I had already packed there I just missed it before I keep telling myself I half believe it A few pills later and Im not worrying about it anymoreBefore this I didnt even know I had an Uncle Drewson let alone that I was to inherit his estate in the event of his untimely but now enacted demise With a heavily estranged family growing up in between various friends or close relatives passed around by uncaring parents looking to shirk responsibility one loses track of aunts and uncles It was in a familiar neighborhood a spacious three bedroom so I was in no way eager to turn it down As a poor regularly unemployed person Id been accustomed to sleeping on generous friends floors in the all too often occurrence I couldnt afford anywhere else I thought itll all be worth it one day the day I make it in the world I can pay all these people back tenfold The day I make it yeah right A consistent  and more pressingly free  living space was a welcome antonym to my recent fortunes So I was moved in within a couple weeks Absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened Till that note seemed to start some kind of vicious domino effect on my life I was contentYou know when you think back to something embarrassing stupid or otherwise shameful act you may have done in your younger brasher days Once you recall it it starts eating away regret seeping in to every corner of your thoughts till you would give the world to go back and change it or at least erase the memory Imagine that only you cant remember what it was youve done Its simply gone from you The more you try the less you realize The less you realize the more you regret The more you regret the more you try Thats whats happening to me ever since I moved here But it even goes past that Its the sudden feeling youre being watched from barely out of sight And at the same time a crushing loneliness in that feeling I pop a few more pills Of course Im not being watched Theres no one else here If you think youre being rather clever figuring this out ohnosomeonesbeeninthehousewithyouallalong I was most certainly the only one here Anyway this was about the time I found the note If it was this Drewson what is he talking about Who does he want back What is his need Do I even want to know the answer to any of these Insatiable curiosity will ensure I do personal preference notwithstanding Putting it all to the back of my mind I chop up steak for dinner I like to think of myself as a fairly accomplished chef particularly where matters of slicing andor dicing are concerned I once worked a sushi bar as a side job to pay the bills and was quite proud of my ability to launch various morsels into the air and sever them in two with one fell swipe like you see in commercials Until the day my knife slipped and nearly skewered a customers eyeball Maybe Im not quite as proficient as I thought I grab the bottle of pills and take a few I dont really like thinking about that time in my lifeIm digging through my drawer later that same drawer when I stumble upon another discovery Instead of a clue it only deepens my mystery A USB stick is secured to the very back of the board I carefully remove it and spend a few minutes simply gawking at my find my inner curiosity again sparring with my better senses I think this will perhaps answer some questions about the note and hopefully clear up my imaginations conjuring brought on by its conclusions implications As per your previous assumptions I couldnt be farther from the truth I secure the stick in its dock View files Two folders Reminders and Media Reminders is empty media contains one subfolder Vids I open the folder Two more memories and triggers Memories is empty I open triggers Im confronted with one video file shotinthedarkwmv Its  long I press playBefore I continue if youll permit me one aside to validate the severity of this Im a massive horror movie fan and I like them brutal The more blood and guts the better I like truly graphic heart wrenching stuff and I very rarely squirm at it Three seconds into shotinthedarkwmv and I rushed over the trash can to puke what felt like my very soul out The scene Im immediately confronted with was a man on a chair wearing nothing but an undershirt and briefs There is a single light source on the chair but I can faintly make out a figure in the background Then without a word the mans brains are ejected out his face accompanied with a thunderous bang Bone and cartilage spew forth in the foreground Nearly black red sludge runs down his white undershirt accompanied with brain matter that had just been crackling with life likely flooded by fear but life I dont have too much time to process anymore Im preoccupied with regurgitating my expertly made steak into the wastebasket I think it must be fake but I know its not Ive got to tell someone about this I think the police someone Yeah Ill talk to the cops Then over my subsiding retching I hear a familiar voice utter Are you sorry now in the tone of a disappointed parent talking to their disobedient toddler Something in that voice is chilling Something I return my gaze to the computer screen where the barely visible figure now stands in full view smilingI recognize the smile tooIts me smiling back at myself gripping a smoking sawed offThe computer screen goes black My head spins I lie down,Are you sorry Part ,2,nosleep,top_day

was initially relieved I asked would she like to come for a walk with Zeus and I and she happily agreed We set off for our normal walk and she was extremely energetic bounding off in front of Zeus and I Zeus is a Labrador and although he is a big boy hes still a pup We usually just meander along on these walks while he sniffs at everything along the way But she set a cracking pace and Zeus and I struggled to keep up We got up to this park where we usually let him off his lead for a while as were trying to train him to not run off on us and to be sociable Its always been a real task getting him back on the leash though he never ever comes when hes called Anyway we let him off and hes running around and smelling everything and peeing on anything that stands still long enough My wife shes picking flowers and sniffing them and singing She gets on the swings at the park and I push her for a bit as she sings under her breath I was feeling quite content at this point Figured she must have just been over tiredShes swinging vigourously when all of a sudden she comes to a dead halt She yells in an almost unfamiliar masculine voice Zeus Here and points in front of her feetI stood in disbelief as I watched Zeus the most disobedient rascal of a dog I know solemnly trot over to where shes pointing sit in front of her and stare up into her face They both sat there for a split second very still looking at each other I picked my jaw up off the floor and asked her Umwhat the hell How did you manage that and that seemed to break both their concentration and Zeus shot off like a bat out of hell again and she started swinging again  Oh she said I used my mind to call out to himits something new I learnedShe seemed kind of sheepish about it to be honest I pressed her for more details but the more questions I asked the more defensive she got She knows I dont believe that for a second Im just happy that Zeus is finally starting to be trained Thats really the only explanation I asked her to do it again but she refused so I think we both know it was a flukeThe rest of the afternoon wasnice Kind of odd Its like theres something thats amiss Like when you walk into your messy bedroom and you can tell that something is not how it should be but you cant pin point whatWe talked a bit about the seminar She said that it was very intense The days were very long She said that the premise of the seminar is to get to the root of any emotional upset to explore the root causes for whats going on in your life I asked if any hypnosis was used as suggested by you guys and she said no They talked a lot and were assigned to small groups and encouraged to open up and explore their inner beings She said she felt a lot better since attendingStill something was not quite right For instance we were talking about my sister who lives in another state and how she had recently got a new job A few minutes later my phone rang and it was her I picked it up and said Emma Speak of the devil and my wife smashed me up the side of the head causing me to drop the phone and shouted Emma is NOT the devil How could you say that Emma is NOT THE DEVIL I told Emma I would call her back and tried to get my wife to calm down She was very upset at what I had said She sort of went silent again and was very still She seemed rather annoyed at me but by this point I was nearing exhaustion myself so I let her beShe fell asleep early about pm on the couch I covered her with a blanket and noticed that her eyes are kind of half opened I used to have a friend who slept like that at school and Ive never noticed it before I think that in my state of hyper vigilance I am being overly perceptive of small details I read more of my original post and all your comments and decided to step outside and call our therapist just to find out more about the seminar as I knew she was there assistingI walked out onto our back porch and lit a cigarette and rang her She answered on my first ring What she said has really weirded me out Only because although she gave me a lot of information she has raised many more questions as well as answered them She said these seminars are more like interactive workshops run by a man named Brian and his wife Linda who are both selfappointed psychotherapists She said that there are psychologists such as herself on stand by to assist because sometimes when people are in such a vulnerable state they may need assistance She said she has referred a lot of her clients to attend these workshops and has found them to be helpful in most cases Basically the course is about discovering your inner self and using different methods to connect to your inner voice to find out what the cause of your worries are She said that it is incredibly demanding and intense Each session goes for  hours with only an hour break During these sessions many different activities and topics are explored including regression Apparently Brian does this  hour session on the second last day where he gets everyone to meditate and be still and he regresses them back to childhood or even in some extreme cases past lives Our therapist said it was so intense that she had to fight from being regressed herself She did make comment that she had been concerned initially about how my wife would handle that but that she seemed brighter had a clarity about her after this experience They discussed what my wife had gone back to in her mind and the therapist was happy that it hadnt caused her any great distress but reminded me she couldnt discuss the specifics She said when she wakes tomorrow I could gently try and open the lines of communication with her and she may explain her experience I told her about my wifes strange behaviour She said it is normal to be a little out of sorts after one of these sessions but nothing major I dont know if its just me but I could sense a tiny bit of alarm in her voice I dont know maybe I imagined it She said to call her if theres any further problems I hung up and as I was putting out my cigarette I turned to go inside and my wifes standing there staring at me I jump and say Jesus Christ honey you scared me and she replied Not as fucking much as Im going to scare you Ummm ok I had to physically turn her and direct her into the house In the moonlight she almost looked like a stranger to me Her long blonde hair was hanging in her face and her face was fixed in this awful scowl I figured she must still be pissed at me from before I put her to bed and she goes back to sleep And well thats where she is now she was supposed to be off work today too but I was meant to go back to my job But when my alarm went off I just had this weird feeling that I should stick around and make sure she was ok I rang in sick for work and Im just doing some household jobs waiting to see if shes better when she wakes up and googling what regression means and what these intense emotional exercises can do to someone Still nothing that convincing though I dont know Maybe Im too skeptical I just dont believe this crapThe whole thing sounds a bit stupid to me if Im honest But I have to say it has caused some kind of change in my wife She is very extreme in her emotions at the moment and Im worried because we both have to go back to work tomorrow and her work environment is very proper She is always a perfect employee and very dedicated to her work I cant help but feel concerned that she might wake up tomorrow and still be in thismood Do you guys know anything about this regressionis it the same as hypnosis She was adamant she wasnt hypnotised but it sounds like it to meEDIT Ok now Im getting really freaked out I went to check on her and she was talking and singing her sleep I cant quit work out what song shes singing Ive never heard it before But shes saying something about being someone called Azara or something Its really fucking unnerving it doesnt even sound like her Ill try and get a recording and see if you guys can shed some light EDIT TWO Ok I managed to record a bit of itshes singing but I dont know what has anyone heard this before Ignore the TV in the background I was watching it in the lounge room to drown her out and it was really unnerving when I turned it off and all I could hear was her Im kind freaked out now Ill admit it Here it ishttpsoundcloudcomuseraynmqytetesjECMW,UPDATE Need some advice My wife seems to be in some weird tranceZombie like state Not sure what to do or if Im over reacting,159,nosleep,top_day

childrenofsamhain,9,5,1rhdoj,36,My friend Jaime purchased a new home about six years ago when his wife was pregnant with their first child Until recently he lived there with his wife Claire and their two daughters Sarah and Emily Sarah is now five years old and Emily is three Within the first two years living in the house Jaime said that he never experienced anything out of the ordinary It wasnt until his daughter Sarah was around two years old that he started to notice she talked to herself Jamie thought nothing of it she was just learning to talk and he figured she was just entertaining herself One afternoon when Claire was out at the grocery store Jaime overheard his daughter in the upstairs hallway whispering and giggling Curious he asked Sweetie who are you talking to Sarah replied The woman standing in the hallwayIs she your imaginary friendI guess Amused he went upstairs to find her staring blankly at a wall whispering quietly Whats your friends name he asked her Her name is Helen Mary she said And what are you two whispering about Sarah looked at him and paused before she piped Im not supposed to tell you Suddenly the front door opened downstairs and they heard Claire come through the door Sarah rushed down the stairs to greet her Jaime didnt think about that again for a few weeks Over time the two noticed that Sarahs interactions with Helen Mary became more frequent but they attributed this to the fact that they had just given her the news that she was going to be a big sister About two weeks before Claire gave birth to Emily Jaime was at home alone with Sarah He heard her playing upstairs chatting away with her imaginary friend when suddenly he heard glass breaking He ran upstairs as quickly as possible to find his daughter standing in the hallway holding a hammer She was staring up at the wall of family pictures that were now smashed to pieces There was glass everywhere Jaime picked his daughter up and carried her down the stairs He told her to stay put as he returned to the upstairs hallway to clean up the shattered fragments of their family portraits When he returned to the living room he asked her directly Sweetie why would you smash all of our family pictures She looked at him Helen Mary told me to do itWhen Claire returned home that evening from her girls night with friends Jaime told her about the incident The crept up the stairs so as not to wake their daughter so Claire could view the damage with her own eyes She gasped silently at the sight When they returned downstairs to the kitchen they started to discuss possible explanations for her behavior Suddenly the color ran out of Claires face and she looked at Jaime Theres no way she could have done that aloneWhatThere is no way she could have smashed all of those pictures by herselfJaime was confused I told you I caught her with the hammer She told me that she did itBut it wasnt until his wife said it aloud that it dawned on him But some of those pictures are almost five feet off the ground How could she have reached thoseHis mind was racing She must have moved a chair or somethingShe was adamant There are no chairs upstairs that she is strong enough to move without you hearing it and you would have seen her carry one upstairs rightJaime was silent He didnt have an answer They went to bed that night without any answers The following morning their daughter had little recollection of smashing the pictures and Jamie wrote it off as sleepwalking Though he didnt have much time to think about it as two weeks later his second little girl was bornEmily was two years old in the summer of  and one afternoon when Claire was at home alone with the girls she heard Emily alone upstairs whispering She called up to her Who you talking to kiddoThe woman standing in the hallwayClaire thought that her Sarah must have told her about her imaginary friend and that she was simply trying to emulate her big sister Then she spoke againShe doesnt like you MommyWhy doesnt she like me Claire responded surprised I dont know Suddenly her daughter came bounding down the stairs as if nothing had happened Even though both Jaime and Claire both found this slightly creepy nothing about the situation ever felt threatening or malevolent Until one night last monthJaime had put the kids to sleep around eight oclock in the evening and he and Claire had got into bed soon after Exhausted Jaime and his wife fell asleep extremely quickly Jaime was awoken by the sound of screaming He was disoriented and had no idea what time it was but he could tell that it was his wife screaming right next to him He turned to see what was wrong and saw it His  year old daughter Emily standing beside the bed with a hammer in her hand Blood poured from Claires forehead Jamie jumped out of bed and grabbed the hammer out of his daughters hand He turned to his wife She had stopped screaming now and Jaime grabbed a towel from the bathroom and wiped the blood away from her face She was going to be alright but she did have a deep cut to her forehead Jaime picked up his daughter and carried her out of the room He went and checked on Sarah who had awoken to the screaming but was clearly unharmed He told her that everything was alright and closed her door He was standing alone with his daughter in the upstairs hallway and he finally asked her Emily why would you hurt MommyShe told me to DaddyWho told you to The woman standing right behind you She told me to hurt Mommy And then Jaime felt a chill run up his spine when his daughter leaned into his ear and whispered And she told me to hurt you too DaddyThey moved last week ,The Woman Standing in the Hallway,41,nosleep,top_day

lamenteddreams,4,9,1rgqu8,13,I love the dark I really doI dont mean going gothic and pagan and all that but I do like the dark I like to sit in my room for hours on end into the night watching videos researching diseases and the supernatural and writing storiesAnyways Ive recently come across a quote from a game called Knock Knock And let me say its utterly terrifying for not just the player but the watcher too Theres nothing but this overwhelming sense of dread throughout all of the gameYou thought about it and now it is inside Knock KnockThat quote has seemed to have seeped into my brain Multiple broken theories have been written down in my notebooks and journals and Ive seemed to have come to a conclusionThe mind isnt wrong Reality is And with that imagination often holds more truth than what we acceptThink about it When you were a small child things like fairytales and horror stories were much more real to your innocent mind In fact there is a theory that children have a sixth sense that they gradually lose as they progress into adulthood Also when you were a child you thought of monsters and what they would do to you as well as how terrifying they lookedAnd when you thought about these things you didnt want to turn around Why Because what if for the slightest moment you were right All those lone yellow eyes in the darkness the sinking feeling of being watched out of all those times what if this was the moment you were right Or moreover what if you were always right and they just didnt want you to know until nowBecause honestly we used to think the Earth was flat Then that it had the sun revolving around us So what makes us so absolutely sure that we are the only ones out there nowThis is my theoryI shared with one of my colleagues about two weeks ago and five days later she called me screaming about how there was something in her house The police showed up and they took her to the hospital She had three slash marks down her back resembling that of almost a wolf She also had multiple bruises on her neck They said there was no signs of break in and the wrecking of the house was most likely the result of her having a psychotic episodeThis could be true but I dont like how unsettlingly close it is to when I told her about my theoryYou thought about it and now it is insideThis is the phrase that keeps me from imagining creatures When I went to the hospital to visit her she was curled up in the bed shaking with her knees up as close to her chest as possible When I asked her what happened she wouldnt tell me who only that it got inside She just had this empty look in her eyes something very uncommon since she was always so hyper and nice When I asked how she just said I thought about it and it came inKeep in mind I never told her about the quote at all Those were her own words So this is more than unsettling for me It may be possible that this theory spooked her enough for all of this to happen but I dont like the coincidencesWhat do you think,The Theory,22,nosleep,top_day
angelcot,3,2,1rh91p,11,Hi rnosleep This is kind of embarrassing to post but heres a few stories of things that happened to me as a kid I was a pretty anxious kid and a lot of weird stuff happened to me Nothing paranormal though Theres more than just these stories but I thought Id at least start with thisEver since I was a kid Ive been afraid of windows Thats not saying much though I was afraid of just about everything else too But growing up my house was full of big windows Floortoceiling windows in the family room two sliding glass doors in the dining room a huge window that looked out from our kitchen into the front yard My mom never bought curtains or blinds for any of the windows other than the ones in our bedrooms because shed get depressed if it were too dark in our house I had light blue curtains in my bedroom that my grandmother sewed for me since my windows were an irregular size Every night I would pull them closed then pin them down to the walls with a pushpin so that I wasnt able to see even a sliver of the outside out of the corner of my eye My bedroom window looked out on the backyard I remember being so irritated whenever someone would accidentally leave the back porch light on The light would shine through my light blue curtains and play shadows on my wall Id cover my head with my pillow so that I could fall asleep without worrying if I would be able to make out the silhouette of someone trying to peer through my curtains still pinned to the wall From a young age I had problems with insomnia My mom struggled with it too I remember my dad telling me stories of when my parents were still married when my mom would wake him up just to talk because she still wasnt asleep at    in the morning I remembered feeling envious that I didnt have someone to do that to I listened to books on tape at bedtime to fill the silence Sometimes I would sneak into my brothers room and lay on their floor hoping for sleep to come Being uncomfortably aware of how their curtains werent drawn completely closed When I was  I moved from my room which overlooked the backyard to my brothers room and my brothers separated and took over my room and the office My new room was at the front of the house If my curtains were open someone could easily look in as they walked up the path to our front door During the day I didnt mind it I could watch for my friends or packages from the postman At night it made me so anxious I began to develop a habit of vomiting nightly My mom was sympathetic but didnt know what to do about it A year later I was moved back into my old room and my older brother moved back into his I stopped vomiting every night I feel like I had a reason for being so afraid of windows One night I must have been about  or  I was up late as usual listening to Ralph S Mouse on tape for the billionth time I had emptied the glass of water that my mom had gotten for me so I got up to refill it I was already wary of windows so I kept my head down on my way to the kitchen Id often see things out of the corner of my eye something moving or something that could have been the shadow of a human but would later try to convince myself it was nothingEven with my head down something outside caught my attention A car parked in front of my house I lived at the very bottom of a culdesac so we didnt have a lot of people drive down our street at night and stop to reorient themselves The car had its headlights on and I could tell there was someone sitting in the car Looking at my house I dont know if they were looking at me but my paranoia told me they were I stood there for a long time forgetting about my glass of water I didnt look away Paralyzed until my mom came in the kitchen Shed seen my door was open and wondered what I was doing up When she noticed the car in front of our house she quieted and gently pushed me out of the kitchen and back to my bedroom I noticed the car started to drive away as I was ushered away from the window This staring contest with the person in the car in front of my house happened twice more although over the course of a few months Once they switched their headlights off and stayed for what might have been  minutes Although my memory might be exaggerating I still dont understand why I was so afraid of seeing someone in my bedroom window but how I could fearlessly stare out of the kitchen window at the person in the parked car Maybe I felt less vulnerable in the kitchen Maybe I was comforted by the fact that they were so far away Even though the walk from where they parked was just a few seconds from my front door and the window I was looking out The third and final time I saw the car the person got out of their car They were tall and I could see them standing on the other side of their car but I still wasnt able to make out their face When they started to walk around their car and I assume towards my front door I scurried back to my bed I never liked sleepovers as a kid Staying over at a friends house meant laying awake on their floor for hours with nothing to listen to but the sound of their calm breathing Nothing to look at except for the sliver of their window I could see from behind their curtains Having friends at my house was just as stressful Usually wed sleep in the family room because it had a TV in it It also had the floortoceiling windows Usually I would sneak off to my own room after my friends had fallen asleep so that I could sleep peacefully away from those big windows When I was about  years old I was having a sleepover with a few of my friends It was after  so my friends were starting to fall asleep I knew I still had at least two or three more hours of being wide awake I was laying on the couch swaddled in my blanket The TV was still on but Id turned the volume down for my sleeping friends to something barely audible Usually I tried to keep my eyes away from the windows But that night my cat caught my attention meowing and hissing at something outside I cautiously looked out the window worried about what my cat might have seen out there Just another cat skittering in front of the window Relieved I looked out at my dark backyard Was that it There was a man in my backyard walking around Even with the distance I distinctly remember he was frowning He had his hands in his pockets I did not know this man I woke up one of my friends whispering in her ear and telling her there was somebody in the backyard She stirred quickly obviously alarmed and looked outside She saw him too Im not sure if he felt our little eyes on him or what but he turned to face us Neither of us made a move not to lay back down and pretend we were asleep not even to look at each other or look away There were a pair of french doors that lead to the back patio in my family room right in the middle of the wall of windows The man walked up to the doors and tapped on one of the small window panes The handle of what looked to be a heavy flashlight hung out of the pocket of his sweatshirt He smiled at us Not a deranged smile not a smile that looked too wide for his face Just a calm warm smile He mouthed something and pointed at the doorknob I was never very good at reading lips I stared straight ahead unblinking not responding I could hear my friends breath heavy and shaking He spoke the sound of his voice muffled through the glass Open the door A pause he knit his eyebrows together like he was concerned Im visiting your parent Let me in My heart was beating out of my chest I was a paranoid enough little kid to not fall for this line I mustered up every ounce of courage I had in my little anxious yearold body and got up off the couch For a moment they man at the door looked relieved I ran out of the room screaming for my mom I could hear my friend call out at me that he was leaving and the rest of my friends starting to stir I told my mom what had happened She turned on all the outside lights and called the police while my stepdad looked out every window for any signs of the man All of the girls at my sleepover had their moms come over and pick them up I cried and stayed the night in my parents bed although Im pretty sure I didnt sleepIn my moms bathroom there was a big window that looked out at the sideyard The glass was distorted though so my mom never bothered putting a curtain over it You couldnt see into the bathroom if you were just passing by the window If you stopped to press your face against the glass you could see in or out but everyone in the house knew not to do that when they were in the sideyard I remember my mom shrieking one night running out of the bathroom saying shed seen something through the glass A rat climbing up the windowsill and staring into the bathroomI always liked my moms shower more than the one in my bathroom My bathroom didnt have a fan in it so the whole bathroom would get uncomfortably humid The shower curtain in my bathroom reminded me too much of that scene from Psycho too and Id always shower with the shower curtain pulled open and Id get water all over the floor My moms shower had a glass door that I liked much more even if there was that big window I could see clearly from the shower Once when I was  I was showering in my moms bathroom because my parents were out of town My brothers were home but were playing video games in the family room I would keep my head down when I showered in my moms bathroom Even if the windows glass was hard to see through it was still a window and the shower was the most vulnerable place I could think of being looked at Every once and a while I would glance up to quell my growing anxiety To tell myself nothing was out there Cautiously I looked up to satisfy my anxiety Nothing was out there I told myself My gaze met the window There was a dark figure pressed up against the glass Through the foggy wet shower door I couldnt see anything All I know was that it was somebody I screamed and ducked down past the tiles so that whoever was out there they couldnt see me A few moments later I heard my brothers knocking at the door both of them calling my name and asking if I was ok I pulled a towel from outside the shower and wrapped myself up before I stood up Whoever was out there was gone A few weeks later my friends and I were playing in the side yard There was a huge tree out there that we liked to climb in and pretend we were characters from XMen or Sonic My friend called my attention to something in the grass over by the window of my moms bathroom A polaroid picture of the distorted glass of the window it lay in front of  ,Windows,13,nosleep,top_day
SpudzOCD,6,6,1rgcw5,9,Hey redditors im new at this so excuse my writing skillsAll through my life ive had things happen that i just couldnt explain ive told a couple of friends but even they dont know what to sayMy story begins when i was a kid about the age of six or seven we lived in a poor neighbourhood in southern Ireland and had a shithole of a house i lived in a room with my two brothers kyle  at the time and Dylan and had been for a couple of years so i was used to sharing a room The first incident occurred after about a year in the house our street was built on a graveyard and happenned in our room it was an ordinary day before it happenned woke up ate breakfast went to school nothing out of the ordinary however when i came home from school that day there was something odd about the house I couldnt quite tell what it was but it just felt wrong But being a kid at the time i thought nothing of it and carried on with my daily routine after dinner and a shower my mom put us to bed After my mom turned out the lights and left the room i began to drift off to sleep after about an hour and a half of hazy dreams i was suddenly awoken by a loud crashing sound kind of like if you dropped a frying pan i quiclky jumped up my pillow and sat upright in bed I looked over to Dylans bed at the other side of the room he ws still asleep I began to question if i had actually heard it at all feeling curious i checked if kyle was awake we had a bunkbed Kyle was on top as i was climbing the four step ladder i felt a burst of cold air rush from kyles bed and immediately dropped to the ground waking up Kylewhat are you doing he saidi heard a noise so i wanted to see ifsshh he stopped me mid sentance and focused his gaze to the back of the room The look on his face will be forever imprinted into my mind I turned around gingerly and what i saw was scary enough to make me cringe even today I saw a scrawny black figure hunched over Dylan who was still asleep But this figure was definately not human It was at least  feet tall its head was overpoweringly large compared to its beyond anorexic body Its fingers were  inches long minimum From what i saw it wore nothing but it very well could have as it was late at night and i was still half asleep Then the image that will haunt me forever It whatever it was turned towards me and Kyle It just stood there staring at us for what felt like forever it then jumped towards us and simply vanished into thin air right before it hit me I was left lying on the floor and Kyle was wondering if what we had just seen was actually real I looked at him and back to Dylans bed whatever it as when it jumped it jumped with enough force to push the blanket off the end of Dylans bed I looked back towards Kyle who was already asleep again and decided to go back to sleep myself not knowing if what wed seen that night was just a figment of our imagination or notWhen i woke up the following morning i hesitantly asked my mom and sister if theyd seen or heard anything last nightthey didnt So i questioned kyle about it and he said that he had no idea what i was on about he had no memory of seeing or hearing anything he didnt even remember me falling off the bunk ladderTo this day i still cant quite figure out what happened that nightMy second experience was only four or five years ago a couple of months after moving to Australia We were living in a pretty old house at the time so it was a bit creaky and what not it was a pretty average day when it happennedI was  and I was once again in bed at the time I was sharing a room with Dylan  at the time Kyle  was in a room across the hallway Jenny  was the next door down and my parents room was at the end of the hallway It was about  at night and we were all just about asleep My mom and stepfather at the time were out exploring the wild clubs of Surfers Paradise so it ws just us kids I was almost asleep when i heard slight footsteps coming from the kithcen area I wondered who it was considering we were all in bed so i opened the door to check I headed towards the kitchen once i reached the living room about halfway to kitchen from my room i could see into the kitchen i slowly emerged from the wall no one thereweird i thought so i headed back to my room but as soon as i turned around Kyle was standing right in front of me with a knife I jumped quicker than id ever jumped before Kyle then laughed his head off and went back to bed I did the same without the laughing I was back in my room now lying in bed realising im too awake to go back to sleep i just lay there for about five minutes staring at the ceiling untill i heard more footsteps in the kitchen I called outKyle go to bed idioti am you fuckwit he said as he emerged from his room half asleepwell then whos upstairs i askedIts probably just a possum in the attic or something dont worryI regretfully closed the door and went back to bed But as soon as i did loud heavy footsteps started making their way down the hallway along with heavy thumping on the walls they were getting closer and a hell of a lot louder It sounded like someone was trying to stomp and bash rats out of the walls and floor It kept coming closer and increasing in volume until it was at the point where it was like gunshots right outside my room It then stomped right outside my door and my door swung open with extreme noise and force and standing at the door was i shit you not the same tall black scrawny fucked up figure that i saw years ago I practically shat myself It stood there for a couple of seconds but if felts like hours then started stomping and sprinted towards my moms room I dont know why but i instantly got up and ran towards the door and looked towards my moms room nothing there it vanished again I dropped to the ground in shock just as Kyle open his door and screamed WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT Its back i saidWhats backthe thing i saw hunched over DylanI stayed up all night that night not wanting to sleep knowing that thing followed us to AustraliaMy most recent encounter with our old friend was last year Wed moved into an old complex of houses that had a bit of a history in the crime side of things Wed been living there for about  months and my friend from primary school Jordan was now living in the complex too It was around PM and it was just Jordan Kyle and I in the house I was playing my ipod at the time Kyle was in the kitchen and Jordan was behind me Kyle decided to pick up a coin and throw it at an unsuspecting Jordan who surprisingly caught it and returned fire but then Jordan moved a little backwards and Kyle threw it further and harder The coin flew through the air right past my head and stopped rigth in front of Jordans face IT LITERALLY STOPPED IN MID AIR it stood still in front of his face for less than a second and then was propelled back towards Kyle with nearly twice the force We all just stood there speechless not knowing if that had really just happened Later that day we were showing a friend what had happened  and were back in the Kitchen messing around with coins to see if it would happen again When suddenly a ball flew through the air at Kyle like it had been thrown with force from the stairs leading upstairs For the second time that day we were utterly speechless and had no idea what to doThat night after Jordan had left and Kyle went to bed i was making a late night snack Dylan was in the living room watching TV and there was nobody else in the house I finished making the snack and was about to head into the living

FUCK,7,4,1rhjmk,6,So my uncle has always been into the paranormal and he got me into paranormal investigation Or ghost hunting to simplify it a few years back Well I go with him on a lot of them and we do it for free for people who think something paranormal is going on in their houses I always saw it as a nice little hobby to do on the weekends to blow of some time and I always liked being scared I mean thats how I even know about this subreddit because I like reading it And thats one of the only reasons I knew about what had happened on my last investigation We got a call from a family out in the middle of the country saying they had begun hearing weird voices when they were each alone but the  year old son was the one who had it happen the most I went through every scenario I could think on the way there Something was legitimately going on that was paranormal one of the kids was lying and was fucking with the rest of the family and other such things Well when we got there we talked with the family and everyone seemed happy except the two children The son was as I said earlier  and the girl was  they seemed uneasy looking off into corners and such I took a note about it but didnt dwell on it that much We went around the house marking places we would put cameras and getting the lay out of the house Once we finished that we went back to our van and started getting ready After we set up all of our equipment we each got our POV Point of view cameras strapped on and started our investigation My Uncle took the upstairs our colleague took the first floor And I went into the basement to do a little investigating of my own I made my way downstairs and grabbed my Walkytalky and radioed my uncle asking if everyone was ready for me to hit the main light breaker He gave me the go ahead and I flipped the little switch plunging the whole house into darkness I held up the other camera I had with me so I could have a camera move around freely  plus it had a night vision setting so I could see where I was going Well I turned it on and walked slowly to the chair I had placed in the room so I could sit comfortably waiting for something to happen And after an hour or so of me questioning the darkness It answered backMy instincts kicked in and I put a call in on the radio for everyone to tell me where they were And everyone was exactly where they said they were supposed to be My heart froze in my throat from fear but excitement so I stood and asked who I was talking to and I heard a small wispy chuckle before it said softly You know who I am I swallowed hard before continuing to walk around the room and asking questions It stayed silent for a few questions before I asked why it was here It chuckled again before I heard a small sound Like a door knob jiggling and I turned towards it My camera landed on a door knob sticking out from a sheet that I guess had covered it before I walked towards it slowly pulling the sheet off to reveal a shabby door about waist height with peeling paint and scratch marks  I put in a call on the radio telling my uncle and the others I had found something and for them to meet me in the basement I got no answer back but I assumed they had gotten the message My uncle did that a lot he tended to get over excited with these things so I figured he was just trying to get here as fast as possible  But the paranormal curiosity ran in the family so I reached down and grabbed the knob it was warm as if someone had been holding it for a longtime I steadied myself before twisting it and pushing it open I looked through my camera screen as I walked into the door The atmosphere around me seemed to change instantly even though all the lights in the house was off it just seemed to be darker and colder in here the basement itself  I looked around in the room through the screen until I saw a lone chair in the center of the room I walked forward until I was right next to it and then began looking around more I jumped a bit at the bright light on my screen until I noticed it was a mirror It was bolted onto a beam  next to the chair and when I looked to the left I noticed the same thing I thought it was really strange so I walked around the front of the chair and accidentally kicked something over  It was loud and then I heard a sound of rushing water My heart leapt into my throat as I looked down and around looking for the source until my camera came upon a metal bucket slightly rolling with water coming out I also saw a candle and a small match book and thats when it hit me My whole body filled with fear as the realization flooded my head This was a three kings set up I turned towards the door pointing the camera as I looked through it I saw the door slam and I stopped My whole body froze from pure terror and it took me a few seconds before I let out a scream for help After I stopped I heard the soft chuckle come from behind me in the darkness and I just stood there with my eyes closed shaking as I felt a soft breath on the back of my neck I heard a voice My voice whisper right into my ear  Do you know who I am now I stood there for a second before screaming again and then I heard the door bust open and I saw flash lights on me and my uncle asking what was wrong I just ran from the room to the breaker box and flipped on all the lights I then sank to the floor looking at him as he sat next to me and asked all that happened I just held out my camera to him and he took it Before he watched it he asked me why I didnt call for back up and I looked at him before telling him that I did He looked at our colleague before watching the recording After that he asked me if we all went in together would I go back in I nodded as long as we kept the lights on and we went in and it was as I thought It was a set up for  The three kings I shuddered as I turned to my uncle asking if he knew what it was He didnt so I explained it to him and I pointed to the bucket  and it has been used recently The bucket was full of water  My uncle nodded to me and put a wrap on the investigation We went back home and I have decided to type this up Tomorrow we will be going and talking to the family about what happened and who had done the three kings in the house  I think the three kings set up has something to do with what has been happening at the house I will update you all on what happens after we talk to them ,What have these people done,10,nosleep,top_day
OsamaBinHiding,3,1,1rhxdo,6,Last night was like every other night for me Have dinner on my own in my small yet cost flat and watch a little bit of TV Around  or  oclock I start to crack on with some work as I had a university deadline in a couple days time The minutes started going faster and before I knew it it was  oclock Where did the time go I thought It had only felt like a few minutes However this was a normal occurrence for me The world kind of disappears when I get lost in a train of thought and for the life of me I cant break out of itI had just remembered that I had a seminar early in the morning and suddenly thought Fuck I better try and get some sleep See I live in an old building that has been converted into flats in the suburbs of a major city So it isnt uncommon to hear floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and all the walls are very thin so noises in the middle of the night just tend to go over my head I wouldnt consider myself someone who doesnt get scared easily but when youre familiar with floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and branches tapping your window  you tend to grow some thick skinLast night wasnt like any other night in my flat though As I mentioned earlier I was alone My flatmate  lets call him Evan for the sake of the story was away celebrating thanksgiving with his family but hes away a lot so Im used to spending a long period of time on my own My usual night routine of showering brushing my teeth and cleaning the kitchen was over and I went into my room to finally rest my head for the night and that was when I first noticed something My drawers were all pulled open To most people this is probably nothing  but for me it wasnt normal I suffer from borderline OCD and everything especially in my room needs to be in order and I remember waking up and everything was in order I hadnt left my flat today either Im too tired for this shit I thought and went to bed Its weird though isnt it That something like a mattress and a duvet can make you feel so safe like nothing can hurt you I remember being a child and I made sure none of my limbs were outside of my bed incase something grabbed me in the middle of the night Such a feeble piece of furniture can make you feel so safeWell not anymore for me Last night I heard the usual creaking of the floorboards  no biggy right However as I drew closer to conscientious I realised that these creaking sounds werent coming from the surrounding walls and neighbouring flats but they were coming from under my bedAnd thats when I felt the unmistakable sensation of a cold coarse finger stroking mine over the side of my bed ,Last night,7,nosleep,top_day
TaylorBonaseraSr,0,2,1rhb2e,5,I can explain why Im so afraid of mirrors or anything that could reflect light even a glass door Its so difficult for me to talk about it sometimes but other times I feel her pressing me on to tell as many people about her as possible She broke my mirror the first time just crashed right through the glass and shattered the glass into a literal hundred pieces It was such a pain to have to clean all that up I got at least five cuts But she didnt care At the very least she didnt laugh at me or yell at me to clean faster At least she was nice enough to check herself for that Anyway I got my mirror replaced She didnt break the bathroom mirror again but she broke the great mirror in the hallway while she was running through it I dont understand how she did it its pressed up right against the wall Shed have to ram her body sideways She didnt even have any visible cuts She told me she was sorry and that she would try not to do it again I believed her and she was true to her word But soon enough I hear the crashing again But this time its my door The majority of my glass door has been smashed through but the weird thing is that the hole is shaped like Quasimodo No one lives here that has a body shaped like that The other times I checked her she didnt have any cuts on her but this time she was bleeding so much from every part of her body that she had to go to the hospital I had to sit there and watch her but she couldnt explain what had happened When the doctor asked neither could I because I hadnt been there Its strange how selective she is she wont smash into anything except mirrors or glasslooking things Anywhere there isnt this kind of stuff nothing bad happens She tells me that she feels so cold whenever she walks by something like that and she gets an uncontrollable urge to destroy it She talks to me about it so often I feel like Im beginning to share the feelingIts starting to unnerve me and I dont want to live with her anymore But I cant break the joint liability contract She told me to cover all the things in the house that could possibly create a reflection so I did But I find her desperately tearing off the covers when she thinks Im not lookingOne day Id had enough so I decided to take off one of the covers in my room It couldnt hurt just for a little while when she couldnt see She wouldnt notice But after a minute of reveling in my refreshed reflection I saw her standing there So close She was so ugly She copied my expression and mocked my horrified face She followed me here to my own room I couldnt turn around There was no point I felt a pressure from her on my shoulders so great I couldnt keep a straight posture She was laughing at meBut Id heard that laugh somewhere before And Id seen that face before too It looked so much like my own She must have heard my thoughts because she said she told me to never look at her by means of a reflection I couldnt stand the sight of her face anymore it was so scary Itd been such a long time since Id spent so many minutes just staring at her I had to take control So I bashed the bedroom mirror in balling my bare hands into fists and repeatedly thrashing until I could feel the glass cutting into my skinItd been so long since Id last done that Now every time I look I can see her feel her I see her staring at herourreflection through my eyes,My Blank Mirror,7,nosleep,top_day
