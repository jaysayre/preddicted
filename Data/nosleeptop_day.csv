kimmiekissies,13,,32,1rgt5c,,118,"I never even met him, I didn't know his name or face. I was, blissfully unaware, of his very existence.

 I will never know why, or when it started. I'm glad for that I guess. I moved into my very small apartment in February last year. My landlord, Olivia, was a sweet older woman who would cook to much and bring me much appreciated leftovers. She was great to me, even after telling her my problem. I'm antisocial, but she didn't mind renting to a reclusive young girl who reminded her of her daughter.

 Every few weeks she would knock on my door then leave, letting me know she was leaving something for me. I loved that. Not even my family would cook so well. The next morning I wash and leave her empty containers outside my door and by an hour or so she would take them back again. My other neighbors seemed fine, but I never talked or visited with them.

 I work from home so anytime I ever was forced to go out I rushed out and into my apartment avoiding an, uncomfortable situation. I loved living alone, it was everything I hoped for. I could just, breathe. By April though, I started noticing things were not right. They were moving, or plain disappearing. I was convinced it was just anxiety caused by my new medication and the move, another side affect was it would make me so drowsy. Since I hated seeing the doctor I just dealt.

 I took naps during the day now and eventually stopped caring. Until one incident doubled my paranoia, Olivia brought me some sort of greek tossed salad and dressing for lunch one day and I enjoyed it with my friend netflix. I fell asleep in the middle of Portlandia, and woke up that evening at 5pm. Per usual, what was not usual was my bedding on the opposite side of me was disturbed. I only sleep on the right side. Always. Even more it felt.. *warm.* My first thought was I must have rolled around a lot, but I knew it was to odd to dismiss. 

I got up and searched my apartment gripping my phone with 911 typed in. Nothing else was disturbed, everything was exactly like it should be. I let it go, for the next few weeks everything was normal pardon the occasional misplaced shoe or drawn back shower curtain. I thought about telling someone, my parents, maybe Olivia, but if it's not life or death I am not reaching out to anyone. 

I wasn't scared, I was nervous, maybe a little stubborn.. But I stayed. I am not letting some stupid anxiety ruin my lovely lonely world.
 May came and It was getting worse. My panties, toothbrush, hell even my food was being misplaced. Every time I woke up there was this strange odor in the air. I finally realized this won't go away by ignoring it. I called my mom and begged to come stay a few days, when I got home I told them everything. Saying it out loud solidified any creepy suspicions. 

That weekend my dad went to my apartment and what was found was true horror. Written all over that walls: ""COME BACK"" ""BABY PLEASE"" He ran out and called the police. There was no one living in my apartment but someone definitely had access besides me. 
The investigation revealed a man, Henry, the son of my landlord Olivia, was in a projected relationship with me.

 They showed me his confession on tape. He admitted coming into my apartment every night and everyday with his mother's extra key. He claims we were in love and he had my permission. He drugged his mother's food she left out for me causing my drowsiness and falling asleep so he could come in and watch me sleep, touch my hair, kiss my shoulder. The leftovers I had in the fridge were tested and confirmed.
 I was absolutely, horrified and disgusted. A man, I never knew existed, collected my drain hair, clothes, and trash and practically lived in my apartment for *four months.*

Thanks to everyone for your responses, I have taken a lot of your advice.
I'll just give you all a quick update on what happened after I posted yesterday. She ended up having a nap after sitting in front of the TV for a few hours. I was going to walk our dog, Zeus, but I decided to wait until she woke up just in case she woke up and was confused.


She woke up after a couple of hours and was.....well. Happy. Really, really happy. Almost manic. She woke up full of beans, and smiling like a maniac. I was initially relieved. I asked would she like to come for a walk with Zeus and I and she happily agreed. We set off for our normal walk, and she was extremely energetic, bounding off in front of Zeus and I. Zeus is a Labrador, and although he is a big boy, he's still a pup. We usually just meander along on these walks while he sniffs at everything along the way. But she set a cracking pace and Zeus and I struggled to keep up. 


We got up to this park where we usually let him off his lead for a while as we're trying to train him to not run off on us and to be sociable. It's always been a real task getting him back on the leash though, he never ever comes when he's called. Anyway, we let him off, and he's running around and smelling everything and peeing on anything that stands still long enough. My wife, she's picking flowers and sniffing them, and singing. She gets on the swings at the park and I push her for a bit, as she sings under her breath. I was feeling quite content at this point. Figured she must have just been over tired.


She's swinging vigourously when all of a sudden she comes to a dead halt. She yells, in an almost unfamiliar, masculine voice, ""Zeus! Here!"" and points in front of her feet.


I stood in disbelief as I watched Zeus, the most disobedient rascal of a dog I know, solemnly trot over to where she's pointing, sit in front of her, and stare up into her face. They both sat there for a split second, very still, looking at each other. I picked my jaw up off the floor and asked her ""Um..what the hell! How did you manage that!"" and that seemed to break both their concentration and Zeus shot off like a bat out of hell again, and she started swinging again - ""Oh"" she said, ""I used my mind to call out to him...it's something new I learned..""
She seemed kind of sheepish about it to be honest. I pressed her for more details, but the more questions I asked the more defensive she got. She knows I don't believe that for a second. I'm just happy that Zeus is finally starting to be trained. That's really the only explanation. I asked her to do it again but she refused, so I think we both know it was a fluke.


The rest of the afternoon was....nice. Kind of odd. It's like there's something that's amiss. Like when you walk into your messy bedroom and you can tell that *something* is not how it should be but you can't pin point what.


We talked a bit about the seminar. She said that it was very intense. The days were very long. She said that the premise of the seminar is to get to the root of any emotional upset, to explore the root causes for what's going on in your life. I asked if any hypnosis was used, as suggested by you guys, and she said no. They talked a lot, and were assigned to small groups, and encouraged to open up and explore their ""inner beings"". She said she felt a lot better since attending.
Still, something was not quite right. For instance, we were talking about my sister who lives in another state, and how she had recently got a new job. A few minutes later, my phone rang and it was her. I picked it up and said ""Emma! Speak of the devil..."" and my wife smashed me up the side of the head, causing me to drop the phone and shouted ""Emma is NOT the devil!! How could you say that!!! Emma is NOT THE DEVIL!!"" I told Emma I would call her back and tried to get my wife to calm down. She was very upset at what I had said. She sort of went silent again, and was very still. She seemed rather annoyed at me, but by this point, I was nearing exhaustion myself, so I let her be.

She fell asleep early, about 8pm, on the couch. I covered her with a blanket, and noticed that her eyes are kind of half opened..... I used to have a friend who slept like that at school and I've never noticed it before, I think that in my state of hyper vigilance, I am being overly perceptive of small details.
 
I read more of my original post, and all your comments, and decided to step outside and call our therapist, just to find out more about the seminar, as I knew she was there assisting.

I walked out onto our back porch and lit a cigarette and rang her. She answered on my first ring. What she said has really weirded me out. Only because although she gave me a lot of information, she has raised many more questions, as well as answered them.
 
She said these seminars are more like interactive workshops run by a man named Brian and his wife Linda, who are both self-appointed ""psychotherapists"". She said that there are psychologists such as herself on stand by to assist because sometimes when people are in such a vulnerable state, they may need assistance. She said she has referred a lot of her client's to attend these workshops and has found them to be helpful in most cases.
 
Basically, the course is about discovering your inner self, and using different methods to connect to your inner voice, to find out what the cause of your worries are. She said that it is incredibly demanding and intense. Each session goes for 14 hours with only an hour break. During these sessions, many different activities and topics are explored, including, regression. Apparently Brian does this 3 hour session on the second last day, where he gets everyone to meditate, and be still, and he regresses them back to childhood, or even, in some extreme cases, past lives. Our therapist said, it was so intense that she had to fight from being regressed herself. She did make comment that she had been concerned initially about how my wife would handle that, but that she seemed ""brighter, had a clarity about her"" after this experience. They discussed what my wife had gone back to, in her mind, and the therapist was happy that it hadn't caused her any great distress, but reminded me she couldn't discuss the specifics. She said when she wakes tomorrow I could gently try and open the lines of communication with her and she may explain her ""experience"".
 
I told her about my wife's strange behaviour. She said it is normal to be a little out of sorts after one of these sessions, but nothing major. I don't know if it's just me, but I could sense a tiny bit of alarm in her voice.... I don't know, maybe I imagined it. She said to call her if there's any further problems.
 
I hung up, and as I was putting out my cigarette, I turned to go inside and my wife's standing there staring at me. I jump and say ""Jesus Christ honey you scared me!"" and she replied ""Not as fucking much as I'm going to scare you.""
 
Ummm ok. I had to physically turn her and direct her into the house. In the moonlight she almost looked like a stranger to me. Her long blonde hair was hanging in her face, and her face was fixed in this awful scowl. I figured she must still be pissed at me from before. I put her to bed and she goes back to sleep.
 
And, well, that's where she is now.... she was supposed to be off work today too, but I was meant to go back to my job. But when my alarm went off, I just had this weird feeling that I should stick around and make sure she was ok. I rang in sick for work, and I'm just doing some household jobs, waiting to see if she's better when she wakes up, and googling what regression means, and what these intense emotional exercises can do to someone. Still nothing that convincing though. I dont know. Maybe I'm *too* skeptical. I just don't believe this crap.

The whole thing sounds a bit stupid to me, if I'm honest. But I have to say, it has caused some kind of change in my wife. She is very extreme in her emotions at the moment, and I'm worried, because we both have to go back to work tomorrow, and her work environment is very proper. She is always a perfect employee, and very dedicated to her work. I can't help but feel concerned that she might wake up tomorrow and still be in this....mood. Do you guys know anything about this ""regression""....is it the same as hypnosis? She was adamant she wasn't hypnotised, but it sounds like it to me!!



EDIT: Ok now I'm getting really freaked out. I went to check on her and she was talking and singing her sleep. I can't quit work out what song she's singing I've never heard it before. But she's saying something about being someone called Azara or something??? It's really fucking unnerving it doesn't even sound like her. Ill try and get a recording and see if you guys can shed some light. 


EDIT TWO: Ok I managed to record a bit of it...she's singing but I don't know what, has anyone heard this before????????? Ignore the TV in the background I was watching it in the lounge room to drown her out, and it was really unnerving when I turned it off and all I could hear was her. I'm kind freaked out now, I'll admit it. [Here it is](http://soundcloud.com/user165636719/a0ynmqy5tete/s-jECMW)",UPDATE!!! Need some advice.

floydnimrod,21,,25,1rhxtb,,113,"I'd just come from church for some reason. I'm not sure why I'd gone into the church, but it was the weirdest service I'd ever been too. Everybody was there. It was a packed house. Rich people, poor people, criminals, middle class folk. It was all people who didn't normally go to church. I looked into the coat room as I walked in, and some guy was snorting cocaine on this little counter top. Right in a church. I was like, what the hell? I've never see that.

I sat in a pew, and looked up. There was no minister. They were just playing a movie of an old church service on the screen. Some little old lady was playing a hymn on an organ, and the minister was applauding her. She seemed happy. But the audience was restless, not really paying attention, not sitting down, just kind of wandering around, talking to everybody. 

And then I saw a woman I used to know, someone I worked with years ago. I went to sit down next to her, and she sort of jumped on my lap and hugged me, saying she was so glad to see me. I wasn't sure if she was sad, or drunk, or terrified, or just lonely, but she whispered in my ear, offering me sex, saying she's always wanted me, ever since she'd known me. I sort of pushed her off my lap, thinking this was hardly the place for that kind of cheap pick-up. And then I got up and walked out. There wasn't really a church service going on anyway, I don't even think it was Sunday.

And then for some reason, I was in a car with this old lady. I don't even know who it was, or why I was with her. She was old like my grandma Freddie, but it wasn't her. We were driving down the street. She was driving too slow because she was kind of lost. I don't think I was in Winnipeg I was on a large street, almost the size of Portage with several lanes. But they all seemed to be deserted, like very early on a Sunday morning. I'm not sure if it was early in the morning or near sunset, but the sun was low in the sky. I think it was late in the day. The streets were mostly clear though.

The lady pulled over and for some reason she got out of the car. I think she was going to ask somebody for directions. I looked at the GPS thing she had on her dashboard, and suddenly the direction went all fuzzy and scrambled, like the satellite was confused, or just no longer there. And then the whole sky got this weird greenish tint to it for about ten seconds. It basically turned green instead of blue, but only for a moment, and then it was back to normal. Everybody stopped and looked up.

I was still in the car, but I leaned forward and looked out the window. The sun was over in the west, low in the sky. And I saw what looked like a second moon fly over the sky in a direction that was diagonal to the sun's normal path. It was huge. And my stomach got queasy for a moment. It made your stomach sick because it was so big, it actually pulled on you with its own gravity, like the moon pulls on the tides, but much bigger, and everything inside you just got tugged around.

But it went straight across the sky, without hitting. When I realized how close it was, though, I knew it was gonna hit somewhere, probably on the other side of the world. The gravity of the earth pulled it in, and it sling-shotted around to the other side somewhere. I jumped out of the car and grabbed the old lady's arm.

""Come on! We have to find shelter! It's gonna hit!"" 

We just abandoned the car in the street, and I dragged her toward a nearby fire station, or hydro office, or whatever it was. I'm not sure which it was, but there were large utility trucks, with lifts on them. It was also deserted for some reason, except for two guys loading one of the trucks. We banged on the doors, but it was locked up. We ran from door to door trying to get in, but everything was locked. 

And then I felt a great rumble under my feet. It nearly knocked me down. I've never been in an earthquake, so I don't know what it's like, but it felt like the entire planet shivered. Car alarms started going off in every direction and I heard a weird sound like gravel tumbling down a hillside, except there were no hills. I think it was pieces falling off houses in all directions. We were able to stay on our feet though. 

A few moments later, the sky in the north went dark. If I assume the sun was setting in the west, and the meteor or asteroid or whatever flew over the sky in a north-west to south-east direction, then it was north the black came from. And I mean the entire sky. Like a wall of blackness, smoke and ash suddenly filling the view from the ground to the upper atmosphere, from west to east as far as you could see, in one huge wall of black cloud. And it was coming toward us. Well, sort of going towards everyone, everywhere, I guess. It came over the horizon like an charging army, fast and steady, advancing.

""It hit on the other side of the world somewhere! Come on! we have to get indoors! We won't be able to breathe!""

The air started turning yellow. Ash started raining down, and bits of rock and debris from the blast, where ever it hit. I took a deep breath and held it as I was running. I could already smell a weird burning rock smell, like sulphur, like burnt matches, but more metallic. 

Me and the lady finally got into some doors, but it was just a little foyer. We ran in and shut the doors behind us. The inside doors were locked. But it was somewhere to hide. There was a fire alarm. I pulled it, not really knowing why I was bothering. But I was sort of in a panic and not thinking straight. The sign said, In Case of Emergency, so I pulled it. The alarm went off, and we looked out the window. The yellow air turned brown, and then dark red. Then everything went black. The black cloud fell over the whole sky with a clattering rumble that sounded like it was raining gravel instead of water. And all light went out of the world.

The world as we knew it was over. Even if we survived, life as we know it would never be the same. We'd be set back 10,000 years, reduced to hunter gatherers again, living out of caves. If we survived the impact that is. I honestly don't think anybody would have survived the shockwave. Something with that much gravity hitting the earth would pretty much end the story for everybody.

Of course, that's when I woke up.",I just dreamed of the apocalypse. I probably won't sleep for a few days now.,138,nosleep
Charlies_friend,20,,9,1rhapg,,79,"A friend of mine posted a story here not too long ago, and he was pretty well received by your wonderful community, so I decided to create an account to share mine.


When I was a little girl, about nine years old, my family purchased a small ranch in western Kansas. My father had just gotten out of the Army, and I suppose after seven years of trotting around the world, and spending two of those years in active combat zones, my dad just wanted to go somewhere the world would leave him alone. He couldn't have found a better location for this purpose; anyone who's ever followed Interstate 70 westward through that area knows, there isn't much between Topeka and Denver.

I still remember the day we (my mom, dad, older sister and I) moved into that old ranch house. It had been built in the early 1900's, and being something of a history buff, I was pretty excited to live in a house that had stood through prohibition, the depression, both world wars, and everything since. The house itself sat at the bottom of a small incline from the main road, backed literally into a hill. This setup meant the back half of the home sat underground, buried in the hillside. Outside the house was a little grassy yard area, and across this yard was an old barn. We didn't have any horses, but my dad held a particular love for classic cars, and he turned that barn into an amateur autoshop where he worked refurbishing old cars from the junk yard in his spare time.

My sister and I were given seperate but adjoining rooms upstairs, while my parents took the master bedroom (oddly) on the first floor. My sister and I's rooms opened onto a sort of landing that looked out over the living room and kitchen, and the stairs led down from there.

It was only our second or third night in the house, that I began to notice some strange things occurring. I was unable to sleep one night, and I laid awake in bed long after I heard my parents and sister go to bed. The house was incredibly quiet, both from being in the middle of a very isolated area, and by virtue of being half buried. Just as I was reaching the half-sleep state...........SLAM! I heard a door downstairs slam shut. At first I tried convincing myself I had just dreamed it, but I couldn't make myself believe that. And the next thing I heard chilled me to my core. I heard footsteps coming up the stairway. I could tell from the sound that the individual must be wearing shoes, so it probably wasn't my parents coming up to check on me. I heard the steps reach the top of the stairs, and then begin down the landing. I was frozen with fear when I heard them arrive outside my door, pause for a moment, and then continue on. When the stranger was apparently in front of my sisters room, he paused again, and again he continued. He reached the far end of the landing, and then turned around and came back the way he came. He continued for what seemed like an eternity, pacing around outside my sister and I's rooms. I finally worked up some nine-year-old courage and crawled to the door. I could still hear footsteps coming from just outside. I waited until he was moving away from me, and I was between him and the stairs, planning on making a mad dash for my parents room when his back was turned. I barely cracked open the door and looked out, and saw....nothing. The footsteps had stopped, and the whole house was empty, and still. I was confused, and afraid, but even then I knew if I ran to my parents they would think I was nuts. So I slid a chair in front of my door and crept into bed. A minute later the footsteps started again, back and forth, all along the landing. Eventually, they lulled me to sleep. 

I didn't mention the noises that night to anyone, fearful of my parents thinking I was a whacko, and of being made fun of by my sister. But, over the next few weeks, everyone in my family began to notice strange happenings on our ranch. Objects moved on their own. Small things would disappear for days, only to be returned exactly where they'd gone missing from. It was what I guess you'd call typical poltergeist activity; nothing harmful or malevolent, just noises here and there and odds and ends moving around. And practically every night I heard those footsteps outside my room. 

My family eventually began referring to this entity as ""Charlie"". He seemed to be a harmless ghost, and sometimes downright helpful. Occasionally my parents would wake early in the morning for work, only to find a freshly brewed pot of coffee waiting in the kitchen. The coffee maker had no automatic timer. Sometimes when one of us had misplaced something, like car keys or the like, we'd search the house frantically only to turn around and find what we'd been searching for laying on the ground behind us. And sometimes Charlie would slam a door, or walk around loudly, or turn a sink on, seemingly just to let us know he was there. And always, those footsteps at night.

Charlie always seemed particularly active in my dad's auto shop. My dad would occasionally find car parts he'd been working on had been tinkered with, despite the fact that he was the only one who ever went in there. Sometimes tools would go missing, only to be returned a short time later. Once my dad came in from his shop one evening as white as a sheet. When we asked what was wrong he just said ""Charlie was walking around out there........Jesus, I thought you all were just hearing things!"". I wasn't sure why Charlie loved that shop so much, but incidentally, that was where I caught my first sight of him. It was a Saturday, and my Dad was hard at work putting together an old Chevy Fleetline. My mom mad him a sandwich as a working lunch, and asked me to take it to him. I eased open the barn door, and saw my dad seated at his work bench, his back to me. And I saw another man, next to the car, also out of my dad's field of vision. He was about 5'8"", with dark hair and eyes. He was dressed in what looked like typical 1930's clothing; black slacks, a pinstripe vest over a grey work shirt, and topped off by a brown ""paper boy"" hat, cocked to one side. He looked right at me for a second, a big, mischievous grin on his face, and then he simply disappeared. I didn't even realized I was still holding my dad's sandwich and continued to stare at the spot Charlie had stood until my dad snapped me back to reality.

So passed the next few months. My family was happy on our little haunted ranch, Charlie seemed happy enough to share the space with us, and life was good. And his nightly vigil outside my room began to seem almost comforting. One night in late November, however, I learned just how utterly terrifying Charlie could be.

My dad had some kind of dinner event for work in Topeka, almost two hours away, and since my Sister was almost 16 by then, and there was virtually no crime in our rural area, my parents figured we would do fine by ourselves until they returned the next morning. Of course, to my sister and I, it meant we could stay up as late as we wanted, watch scary movies, all the kid stuff you can't do with your parents around. At around midnight, I was in my Sister's room with her watching some movie on her TV, when we heard a loud CRASH from the living room. My first thought was that it was Charlie, playing another prank, by this felt different somehow. Charlie's noises were simply little bumps to remind you he was home. But this noise sounded violent, and angry. Before I could really react, we heard another loud crash, and another. My sister cautiously peeked out of her door, and down into the living room. I swear I saw her go white. She began trembling, and her hand covered her mouth. I peeked around her to see what she saw, and felt y blood run cold. We could just barely see two men, outside our from door. One of them was kicking it in. As we watched, a final smash from this man caused the door jam to give out, and they both entered our home, shining long flashlights all over. My sister and I crawled under her bed, and held each other tight. This was easily the most terrified I have ever felt. 

But as the two men began to go through the living room, another loud crash came from the kitchen. One of the cabinets had opened and slammed shut; a favorite trick of Charlie's. The man who seemed to be leading the show shined his flashlight into the kitchen and shouted ""Is there anyone in here?!?? If you are, you better come out now!! We will find you, and we will FUCK you up!!!!"". My sister and I had to cover our mouths to keep from screaming out loud. At the man's words though, Charlie apparently got angry. We heard another loud crash and a skittering of metal on the floor, as one of our silverware drawers apparently threw itself across the room. I heard one of the men say ""What.......the FUCK?!?!"". And then Charlie decided he was do e fucking around. All at once, every door, window, and cabinet in our home began opening and closing violently, and loudly. Small objects all over the house began to fling themselves into walls, across the floor, even at the intruders. At this point, the one in charge just yelled ""FUCK this"" and turned and ran out, his buddy close behind.

As soon as the men were out of the door, everything stopped, and the house was again silent. It was a long, long time before either my sister or myself finally worked up the courage to move. She had left her cell phone downstairs, and and she needed it to call the police and our parents. She began slowly creeping downstairs to get it, and since there was no way in hell I was being left alone, I followed. As we got to the bottom, I looked into the kitchen, and for just a moment, Charlie was standing there, exactly as I saw him before, with the same grin on his face. A moment later, he was gone.

The police arrived shortly, and my parents not far behind. The cops determined that the disorder in the home was caused by the robbers ransacking the place for valuables, and they must have been scared off by a passing car. Lucky for us. My sister and I didn't even try to tell them what really happened, and within thirty minutes, both men were caught, still fleeing. 

After that night, hearing Charlie's walk around my floor gave me a serene sense of security every night. When he played his little pranks, I would always look for him. And every now and then I would catch just a glimpse of him and smile.

Several years later, when I was a junior in high school, I was working on a school report at the local library. The topic was the history of our town, and I wanted to see if the library had any old news clippings that mentioned my family's ranch. I typed our address on the search bar, and the first result stopped me dead in my tracks. The date of the old article was July 17, 1936, and at the top was a picture of a man, about 5'8"", with dark hair and eyes. It was, unmistakably, Charlie. The title of the article read ""Local Man Murdered While Defending Daughter"". It seems the man we called Charlie was actually named Brian Davis. He had lived alone in the ranch with his only child, a daughter, after losing his wife to a bad case of the Flu. On the night of July 15, the article said, Mr. Davis was returning home from his job as an auto mechanic in town. When he pulled up to the house, he found the door had been forced open. He ran inside, and found a man on top of his daughter. The girl was sobbing, her dress had been ripped open, and the attacker held a knife to her throat. In a moment of sheer instinct, Mr. Davis threw himself at the intruder, tackling him of his daughter, and as he held the attacker, Mr. Davis yelled for the girl to run to the neighbors and call the police. The girl made it the mile and a half to the closest neighbor, who promptly called the sheriff. When deputies arrived, they were able to apprehend the attacker, who had been beaten half to death. Unfortunately, he had stabbed Mr. Davis three times in the chest. Brian Davis died right on our kitchen floor.",Charlie,88,nosleep

It wasn't until his daughter Sarah was around two years old, that he started to notice she talked to herself. Jamie thought nothing of it, she was just learning to talk and he figured she was just entertaining herself. 

One afternoon when Claire was out at the grocery store, Jaime overheard his daughter in the upstairs hallway, whispering and giggling. Curious, he asked, ""Sweetie, who are you talking to?"" Sarah replied, 

""The woman standing in the hallway"".

""And what are you two whispering about?"" 

Sarah looked at him and paused before she piped ""I'm not supposed to tell you."" 

Suddenly the front door opened downstairs, and they heard Claire come through the door. Sarah rushed down the stairs to greet her. Jaime didn't think about that again for a few weeks. 

Over time, the two noticed that Sarah's interactions with ""Helen Mary"" became more frequent, but they attributed this to the fact that they had just given her the news that she was going to be a big sister. 

About two weeks before Claire gave birth to Emily, Jaime was at home alone with Sarah. He heard her playing upstairs, chatting away with her imaginary friend, when suddenly he heard glass breaking. He ran upstairs as quickly as possible to find his daughter standing in the hallway, holding a hammer. She was staring up at the wall of family pictures that were now smashed to pieces. There was glass everywhere. Jaime picked his daughter up and carried her down the stairs. He told her to stay put as he returned to the upstairs hallway to clean up the shattered fragments of their family portraits. When he returned to the living room, he asked her directly, ""Sweetie, why would you smash all of our family pictures?"" 

She looked at him, ""Helen Mary told me to do it.""

When Claire returned home that evening from her girls night with friends, Jaime told her about the incident. The crept up the stairs so as not to wake their daughter, so Claire could view the damage with her own eyes. She gasped silently at the sight. 

When they returned downstairs to the kitchen, they started to discuss possible explanations for her behavior. Suddenly, the color ran out of Claire's face and she looked at Jaime. ""There's no way she could have done that alone.""

""What?""

""There is no way she could have smashed all of those pictures by herself.""

Jaime was confused, ""I told you, I caught her with the hammer. She told me that she did it.""

But it wasn't until his wife said it aloud that it dawned on him, ""But… some of those pictures are almost five feet off the ground. How could she have reached those?""

His mind was racing, ""She must have moved a chair or something.""

She was adamant, ""There are no chairs upstairs that she is strong enough to move without you hearing it, and you would have seen her carry one upstairs, right?""

Jaime was silent. He didn't have an answer. 

They went to bed that night without any answers. The following morning their daughter had little recollection of smashing the pictures and Jamie wrote it off as sleepwalking. Though he didn't have much time to think about it, as two weeks later his second little girl was born.

Emily was two years old in the summer of 2012, and one afternoon, when Claire was at home alone with the girls, she heard Emily alone upstairs, whispering. She called up to her, ""Who you talking to, kiddo?""

""The woman standing in the hallway.""

Claire thought that her Sarah must have told her about her imaginary friend, and that she was simply trying to emulate her big sister. Then she spoke again.

""She doesn't like you, Mommy""

""Why doesn't she like me?"" Claire responded, surprised. 

""I don't know."" 

Suddenly her daughter came bounding down the stairs as if nothing had happened. Even though both Jaime and Claire both found this slightly creepy, nothing about the situation ever felt threatening or malevolent. Until one night last month.

Jaime had put the kids to sleep around eight o'clock in the evening and he and Claire had got into bed soon after. Exhausted, Jaime and his wife fell asleep extremely quickly. Jaime was awoken by the sound of screaming. He was disoriented and had no idea what time it was, but he could tell that it was his wife screaming right next to him. He turned to see what was wrong and saw it. His 3 year old daughter Emily, standing beside the bed, with a hammer in her hand. Blood poured from Claire's forehead. Jamie jumped out of bed and grabbed the hammer out of his daughters hand. He turned to his wife. She had stopped screaming now, and Jaime grabbed a towel from the bathroom and wiped the blood away from her face. She was going to be alright, but she did have a deep cut to her forehead. 

Jaime picked up his daughter and carried her out of the room. He went and checked on Sarah, who had awoken to the screaming but was clearly unharmed. He told her that everything was alright and closed her door. He was standing alone with his daughter in the upstairs hallway, and he finally asked her, ""Emily, why would you hurt Mommy?""

""She told me to, Daddy.""

""Who told you to?"" 

""The woman standing right behind you. She told me to hurt Mommy"" And then Jaime felt a chill run up his spine when his daughter leaned into his ear and whispered, ""And she told me to hurt you too, Daddy.""

darkened-thoughts,1,,7,1rg1d9,,19,"I want to turn around. It's three in the morning, the lights are off, and I'm bathed in the luminescent glow of this old monitor. I just kept clicking through - that was my greatest vice. I could have let it rest. But with every story, my blood pumped faster, my breath came quicker.

There's nothing like a good scare. Every rush of adrenaline left me wanting more. That next fix got harder to find, took longer. I grew discerning, opinionated, a veteran of the genre. Soon I was writing for myself; days spent clacking the keys and nights spent in marathon research sessions. I was a crow picking through the maggots and gore for that next juicy nibble. I was a man consumed, and like a junkie messiah I wanted to share my high with others.

Everything has a basis in reality. Think about it. Why do the holy men think your soul needs saving? Why do children fear the dark? What's there in the unknown deep, what is it that averts our gaze?

That's why I'm here now. That's why I'm writing to you. I come bringing the ultimate high. All you have to do is believe. Believe in me, in the hellish nightmares that chase after you in your sleep, in the stories you read and the movies you watch. When you believe, the hunt is on.

My stomach is in knots, every heartbeat a hammer blow against my sternum. My hands are shaking. My breath comes in stecatto bursts. I can't hold on much longer. The anticipation is mounting, building to orgasmic frenzy. I found it, the ultimate high. Or rather, it found me. All I had to do was believe. All I have to do is turn around.

My faith is sure, and I know it with every fiber in my being:

It's here. And it hates me.",I couldn't stop.,26,nosleep
lamented_dreams,4,,8,1rgqu8,,14,"I love the dark. I really do.

I don't mean going gothic and pagan and all that, but I do like the dark. I like to sit in my room for hours on end into the night watching videos, researching diseases and the supernatural, and writing stories.

Anyways, I've recently come across a quote from a game called 'Knock Knock'. And let me say, it's utterly terrifying for not just the player, but the watcher too. There's nothing but this overwhelming sense of dread throughout all of the game.

""You thought about it, and now, it is inside."" —Knock Knock

That quote has seemed to have seeped into my brain. Multiple broken theories have been written down in my notebooks and journals and I've seemed to have come to a conclusion.

The mind isn't wrong. Reality is. And, with that, imagination often holds more truth than what we accept.

Think about it. When you were a small child, things like fairytales and horror stories were much more real to your innocent mind. In fact, there is a theory that children have a sixth sense that they gradually lose as they progress into adulthood. Also when you were a child, you thought of monsters and what they would do to you as well as how terrifying they looked.

And when you thought about these things, you didn't want to turn around. Why? Because what if for the slightest moment, you were right? All those lone yellow eyes in the darkness, the sinking feeling of being watched, out of all those times, what if this was the moment you were right? Or moreover what if you were always right and they just didn't want you to know... until now.

Because honestly, we used to think the Earth was flat. Then that it had the sun revolving around us. So what makes us so absolutely sure that we are the only ones out there now?

This is my theory.

I shared with one of my colleagues about two weeks ago and five days later she called me screaming about how there was something in her house. The police showed up and they took her to the hospital. She had three slash marks down her back, resembling that of almost a wolf. She also had multiple bruises on her neck. They said there was no signs of break in and the wrecking of the house was most likely the result of her having a psychotic episode.

This could be true, but I don't like how unsettlingly close it is to when I told her about my theory.

""You thought about it, and now, it is inside.""

This is the phrase that keeps me from imagining creatures. When I went to the hospital to visit her she was curled up in the bed, shaking with her knees up as close to her chest as possible. When I asked her what happened she wouldn't tell me who, only that 'it' got inside. She just had this empty look in her eyes, something very uncommon since she was always so hyper and nice. When I asked how she just said, ""I thought about it, and it came in.""

Keep in mind I never told her about the quote at all. Those were her own words. So this is more than unsettling for me. It may be possible that this 'theory' spooked her enough for all of this to happen, but I don't like the coincidences.

What do you think?",The Theory,22,nosleep
angelcot,3,,1,1rh91p,,12,"Hi /r/nosleep. This is kind of embarrassing to post, but here's a few stories of things that happened to me as a kid. I was a pretty anxious kid, and a lot of weird stuff happened to me. Nothing paranormal, though There's more than just these stories, but I thought I'd at least start with this.

Ever since I was a kid, I've been afraid of windows. That's not saying much, though. I was afraid of just about everything else, too. But growing up, my house was full of big windows. Floor-to-ceiling windows in the family room, two sliding glass doors in the dining room, a huge window that looked out from our kitchen into the front yard. My mom never bought curtains or blinds for any of the windows other than the ones in our bedrooms because she'd get depressed if it were too dark in our house. 

I had light blue curtains in my bedroom that my grandmother sewed for me since my windows were an irregular size. Every night I would pull them closed, then pin them down to the walls with a pushpin so that I wasn't able to see even a sliver of the outside out of the corner of my eye. My bedroom window looked out on the backyard. I remember being so irritated whenever someone would accidentally leave the back porch light on. The light would shine through my light blue curtains and play shadows on my wall. I'd cover my head with my pillow so that I could fall asleep without worrying if I would be able to make out the silhouette of someone trying to peer through my curtains, still pinned to the wall. 

From a young age, I had problems with insomnia. My mom struggled with it, too. I remember my dad telling me stories of when my parents were still married, when my mom would wake him up just to talk because she still wasn't asleep at 4, 5, 6 in the morning. I remembered feeling envious that I didn't have someone to do that to. I listened to books on tape at bedtime to fill the silence. Sometimes I would sneak into my brothers' room and lay on their floor, hoping for sleep to come. Being uncomfortably aware of how their curtains weren't drawn completely closed. 

When I was 10, I moved from my room- which overlooked the backyard- to my brothers' room, and my brothers separated and took over my room, and the office. My new room was at the front of the house. If my curtains were open, someone could easily look in as they walked up the path to our front door. During the day, I didn't mind it. I could watch for my friends or packages from the postman. At night, it made me so anxious I began to develop a habit of vomiting nightly. My mom was sympathetic, but didn't know what to do about it. A year later, I was moved back into my old room, and my older brother moved back into his. I stopped vomiting every night. 

I feel like I had a reason for being so afraid of windows. One night- I must have been about 6 or 7- I was up late, as usual, listening to *Ralph S. Mouse* on tape for the billionth time. I had emptied the glass of water that my mom had gotten for me, so I got up to refill it. I was already wary of windows, so I kept my head down on my way to the kitchen. I'd often see things out of the corner of my eye; something moving, or something that *could* have been the shadow of a human, but would later try to convince myself it was nothing.

Even with my head down, something outside caught my attention. A car, parked in front of my house. I lived at the very bottom of a cul-de-sac, so we didn't have a lot of people drive down our street at night and stop to reorient themselves. The car had its headlights on, and I could tell there was someone sitting in the car. Looking at my house. I don't know if they were looking at me, but my paranoia told me they were. I stood there for a long time, forgetting about my glass of water. I didn't look away. Paralyzed, until my mom came in the kitchen. She'd seen my door was open and wondered what I was doing up. When she noticed the car in front of our house, she quieted and gently pushed me out of the kitchen and back to my bedroom. I noticed the car started to drive away as I was ushered away from the window. 

This staring contest with the person in the car in front of my house happened twice more, although over the course of a few months. Once, they switched their headlights off, and stayed for what might have been 45 minutes. Although my memory might be exaggerating. I still don't understand why I was so afraid of seeing someone in my bedroom window, but how I could fearlessly stare out of the kitchen window at the person in the parked car. Maybe I felt less vulnerable in the kitchen. Maybe I was comforted by the fact that they were so far away. Even though the walk from where they parked was just a few seconds from my front door and the window I was looking out. 

The third and final time I saw the car, the person got out of their car. They were tall, and I could see them standing on the other side of their car but I still wasn't able to make out their face. When they started to walk around their car and- I assume- towards my front door, I scurried back to my bed. 

I never liked sleepovers as a kid. Staying over at a friends house meant laying awake on their floor for hours with nothing to listen to but the sound of their calm breathing. Nothing to look at except for the sliver of their window I could see from behind their curtains. Having friends at my house was just as stressful. Usually we'd sleep in the family room, because it had a TV in it. It also had the floor-to-ceiling windows. Usually I would sneak off to my own room after my friends had fallen asleep, so that I could sleep peacefully away from those big windows. 

When I was about 8 years old, I was having a sleepover with a few of my friends. It was after 10, so my friends were starting to fall asleep. I knew I still had *at least* two or three more hours of being wide awake. I was laying on the couch, swaddled in my blanket. The TV was still on, but I'd turned the volume down for my sleeping friends to something barely audible. Usually, I tried to keep my eyes away from the windows. But that night my cat caught my attention, meowing and hissing at something outside. I cautiously looked out the window, worried about what my cat might have seen out there. Just another cat, skittering in front of the window. Relieved, I looked out at my dark backyard. Was that it? 

There was a man in my backyard, walking around. Even with the distance, I distinctly remember he was frowning. He had his hands in his pockets. I did not know this man. 

I woke up one of my friends, whispering in her ear and telling her there was somebody in the backyard. She stirred quickly, obviously alarmed, and looked outside. She saw him too. I'm not sure if he felt our little eyes on him or what, but he turned to face us. Neither of us made a move; not to lay back down and pretend we were asleep, not even to look at each other, or look away. 

There were a pair of french doors that lead to the back patio in my family room, right in the middle of the wall of windows. The man walked up to the doors and tapped on one of the small window panes. The handle of what looked to be a heavy flashlight hung out of the pocket of his sweatshirt. He smiled at us. Not a deranged smile, not a smile that looked too wide for his face. Just a calm, warm smile. He mouthed something and pointed at the doorknob. I was never very good at reading lips. I stared straight ahead, unblinking, not responding. I could hear my friends' breath, heavy and shaking. 

He spoke, the sound of his voice muffled through the glass, ""Open the door."" A pause, he knit his eyebrows together like he was concerned. ""I'm visiting your parent. Let me in."" 

My heart was beating out of my chest. I was a paranoid enough little kid to not fall for this line. I mustered up every ounce of courage I had in my little, anxious, 8-year-old body, and got up off the couch. For a moment, they man at the door looked relieved. I ran out of the room, screaming for my mom. I could hear my friend call out at me that he was leaving, and the rest of my friends starting to stir. I told my mom what had happened. She turned on all the outside lights and called the police while my step-dad looked out every window for any signs of the man. All of the girls at my sleepover had their moms come over and pick them up. I cried, and stayed the night in my parents bed, although I'm pretty sure I didn't sleep.

In my mom's bathroom, there was a big window that looked out at the sideyard. The glass was distorted, though, so my mom never bothered putting a curtain over it. You couldn't see into the bathroom if you were just passing by the window. If you stopped to press your face against the glass, you could see in or out, but everyone in the house knew not to do that when they were in the sideyard. I remember my mom shrieking one night, running out of the bathroom, saying she'd seen something through the glass. A rat, climbing up the windowsill and staring into the bathroom.

I always liked my mom's shower more than the one in my bathroom. My bathroom didn't have a fan in it, so the whole bathroom would get uncomfortably humid. The shower curtain in my bathroom reminded me too much of that scene from *Psycho*, too, and I'd always shower with the shower curtain pulled open, and I'd get water all over the floor. My mom's shower had a glass door that I liked much more, even if there was that big window I could see clearly from the shower. 

Once when I was 12, I was showering in my mom's bathroom because my parents were out of town. My brothers were home, but were playing video games in the family room. I would keep my head down when I showered in my mom's bathroom. Even if the window's glass was hard to see through, it was still a window, and the shower was the most vulnerable place I could think of being looked at. Every once and a while, I would glance up to quell my growing anxiety. To tell myself *nothing was out there*. 

Cautiously, I looked up to satisfy my anxiety. *Nothing was out there*, I told myself. My gaze met the window. There was a dark figure pressed up against the glass. Through the foggy, wet shower door, I couldn't see anything. All I know was that it was *somebody*. I screamed, and ducked down past the tiles so that whoever was out there, they couldn't see me. A few moments later, I heard my brothers knocking at the door, both of them calling my name and asking if I was ok. I pulled a towel from outside the shower and wrapped myself up before I stood up. Whoever was out there was gone. 

A few weeks later, my friends and I were playing in the side yard. There was a huge tree out there that we liked to climb in, and pretend we were characters from X-Men or Sonic. My friend called my attention to something in the grass, over by the window of my mom's bathroom. A polaroid picture of the distorted glass of the window it lay in front of.  ",Windows.,13,nosleep
Spudz_OCD,6,,5,1rgcw5,,10,"Hey redditors, im new at this so excuse my writing skills

All through my life ive had things happen that i just couldn't explain, i've told a couple of friends but even they don't know what to say.

My story begins when i was a kid about the age of six or seven, we lived in a poor neighbourhood in southern Ireland and had a shithole of a house, i lived in a room with my two brothers (kyle[8-9  at the time], and Dylan[3-4]) and had been for a couple of years so i was used to sharing a room. The first incident occurred after about a year in the house (our street was built on a graveyard) and happenned in our room. it was an ordinary day before it happenned, woke up, ate breakfast, went to school, nothing out of the ordinary. however when i came home from school that day, there was something odd about the house, I couldn't quite tell what it was but it just felt wrong. But being a kid at the time, i thought nothing of it and carried on with my daily routine. after dinner and a shower my mom put us to bed. After my mom turned out the lights and left the room, i began to drift off to sleep. after about an hour and a half of hazy dreams, i was suddenly awoken by a loud crashing sound, kind of like if you dropped a frying pan, i quiclky jumped up my pillow and sat upright in bed. I looked over to Dylan's bed at the other side of the room, he ws still asleep. I began to question if i had actually heard it at all. feeling curious i checked if kyle was awake (we had a bunk-bed, Kyle was on top) as i was climbing the four step ladder, i felt a burst of cold air rush from kyles bed and immediately dropped to the ground, waking up Kyle.
""what are you doing"", he said.
""i heard a noise so i wanted to see if--""
""--sshh"", he stopped me mid sentance, and focused his gaze to the back of the room; The look on his face will be forever imprinted into my mind. I turned around gingerly and what i saw was scary enough to make me cringe even today. I saw a scrawny black figure hunched over Dylan, who was still asleep. But this figure was definately not human; It was at least 7 feet tall, it's head was overpoweringly large compared to it's beyond anorexic body. It's fingers were 6-7 inches long minimum. From what i saw it wore nothing, but it very well could have, as it was late at night and i was still half asleep. Then the image that will haunt me forever; It, whatever it was, turned towards me and Kyle. It just stood there, staring at us for what felt like forever, it then jumped towards us and simply vanished into thin air right before it hit me. I was left lying on the floor and Kyle was wondering if what we had just seen was actually real. I looked at him and back to Dylan's bed, whatever it as, when it jumped it jumped with enough force to push the blanket off the end of Dylan's bed. I looked back towards Kyle, who was already asleep again, and decided to go back to sleep myself, not knowing if what we'd seen that night was just a figment of our imagination or not.
When i woke up the following morning i hesitantly asked my mom and sister if they'd seen or heard anything last night..they didn't. So i questioned kyle about it and he said that he had no idea what i was on about, he had no memory of seeing or hearing anything, he didnt even remember me falling off the bunk ladder.
To this day i still cant quite figure out what happened that night.

My second experience was only four or five years ago, a couple of months after moving to Australia. We were living in a pretty old house at the time so it was a bit creaky and what not. it was a pretty average day when it happenned;I was 14 and I was once again in bed at the time. I was sharing a room with Dylan (10) at the time. Kyle (16) was in a room across the hallway, Jenny (12) was the next door down and my parent's room was at the end of the hallway. It was about 11-12 at night, and we were all just about asleep. My mom and step-father at the time were out exploring the wild clubs of Surfers Paradise, so it ws just us kids. I was almost asleep when i heard slight footsteps coming from the kithcen area. I wondered who it was considering we were all in bed, so i opened the door to check. I headed towards the kitchen, once i reached the living room (about half-way to kitchen from my room) i could see into the kitchen, i slowly emerged from the wall; no one there..weird, i thought, so i headed back to my room, but as soon as i turned around Kyle was standing right in front of me with a knife. I jumped quicker than i'd ever jumped before. Kyle then laughed his head off and went back to bed. I did the same without the laughing.. I was back in my room, now lying in bed realising im too awake to go back to sleep. i just lay there for about five minutes staring at the ceiling untill i heard more footsteps in the kitchen. I called out
""Kyle, go to bed, idiot""
""i am you fuckwit"", he said as he emerged from his room half asleep
""well then who's upstairs?"" i asked
""It's probably just a possum in the attic or something don't worry""
I regretfully closed the door and went back to bed. But as soon as i did, loud heavy footsteps started making their way down the hallway, along with heavy thumping on the walls, they were getting closer and a hell of a lot louder, It sounded like someone was trying to stomp and bash rats out of the walls and floor. It kept coming closer and increasing in volume until it was at the point where it was like gunshots right outside my room. It then stomped right outside my door and my door swung open with extreme noise and force and standing at the door was, i shit you not, the same tall, black scrawny fucked up figure that i saw years ago. I practically shat myself. It stood there for a couple of seconds, but if felts like hours, then started stomping and sprinted towards my moms room. I don't know why but i instantly got up and ran towards the door and looked towards my moms room; nothing there, it vanished again. I dropped to the ground in shock, just as Kyle open his door and screamed ""WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT"" 
""It's back"" ,i said
""What's back?""
""the thing i saw hunched over Dylan""
I stayed up all night that night not wanting to sleep knowing that thing followed us to Australia

My most recent encounter with our old friend was last year. We'd moved into an old complex of houses that had a bit of a history in the crime side of things. We'd been living there for about 6 months and my friend from primary school, Jordan, was now living in the complex too. It was around 5PM and it was just Jordan Kyle and I in the house. I was playing my i-pod at the time, Kyle was in the kitchen and Jordan was behind me. Kyle decided to pick up a coin and throw it at an unsuspecting Jordan, who surprisingly, caught it, and returned fire. but then Jordan moved a little backwards and Kyle threw it further and harder. The coin flew through the air right past my head and stopped rigth in front of Jordans face, IT LITERALLY STOPPED IN MID AIR, it stood still in front of his face for less than a second and then was propelled back towards Kyle with nearly twice the force. We all just stood there speechless, not knowing if that had really just happened. Later that day we were showing a friend what had happened  and were back in the Kitchen messing around with coins to see if it would happen again. When suddenly a ball flew through the air at Kyle, like it had been thrown with force from the stairs leading upstairs. For the second time that day we were utterly speechless and had no idea what to do.
That night after Jordan had left and Kyle went to bed, i was making a late night snack. Dylan was in the living room watching TV and there was nobody else in the house. I finished making the snack and was about to head into the living room when in the corner of my eye, I saw the figure that i had seen twice before glide upstairs; same height, same scrawniness, same long fingers only this time it was a little misty, like a shadow, and it looked right into my eyes as it vanished upstairs.
I am still wondering what the actual fuck that figure is, all i know is that my mother has become a claire-voyant.I know for a fact that there is definately going to be a lot more of this thing which i have nicknamed ""the figure"".

For the time being i will keep an eye out for my little follower and if i see him/her again i will not hesitate to report the time, date, and details of the situation and of course reddit the fuck out of it.
for now redditors, i bid you farewell

the_dark_half,5,,1,1rhyj5,,7,"You know that feeling when you’re all alone and hear your name whispered? Maybe you’ve walked into a room only to suddenly feel a sudden temperature drop? Had things go missing only to re-appear in odd places? Maybe you’re like me and you lie in bed at night, only to feel like someone stroking your hair but when you become fully conscious and turn around, nothing. 
Think you walk through a cobweb or hair falls on your arms or neck and brushes against your skin delicately, tickling you? You check and nothing was there? I’m sure your parents tell you it’s nothing from a young age; perhaps because they themselves are deluded enough to believe that it is their imagination. They probably deep down fear it’s a ghost or apparition. Even they couldn’t know how much worse it really is.  Stop deluding yourself. It’s not a cobweb. It’s not the wind. It’s not nothing. It’s something far more sinister, an insidious force which slowly grows stronger the more you feed it your fear and attention. 

Some of you, I’m sure, will be fortunate enough only to feel cold spots and occasionally hear creaks and footsteps in your house. It’s such a common occurrence that people barely notice it and if they do, it’s the spookiest part of a generic horror movie, because those suits in Hollywood haven’t seen what these creatures are really capable of. If you believe in the paranormal you may experience the whispers of what I can only loosely refer to as their ‘voices’. I’m sure not many of you have had the misfortune to awaken to them standing over your bed, taking the forms of whatever creatures or person your subconscious fears most because it’s real form is so terrifying you’d probably die instantly or become paralysed with fear, a zombie-esque state you’ll never awaken from-and that would ruin their fun too early. If you don’t die instantly, seeing their faces will make your eyes bleed; hearing their voices unrestrained will shatter your ear drums and I’ve heard of cases where insides have been liquefied, skin melting and bleeding seeping out of every pore.

The first time I awoke to one in my room with me, it was after I’d given the footsteps and banging on the walls attention. I had thought it was cool, I even bought a stupid Ouija board and told them it was okay for them to try and talk to me. I had been lying in bed after a night of drinking so I passed off the initial taunts and laughs as nothing more than my intoxicated imagination, until my door slowly opened and in came one large hairy leg, followed by more spindly legs, followed by many eyes and two huge fucking fangs. Yep, a giant spider, bigger than a horse came into my room. I tried to scream, but that just resulted with me hyperventilating, then vomiting all over the floor. It strode in, all beady eyes on me and as it slinked atop my bed I tried to pathetically crawl away, but it held me down with its two front legs, piercing into the flesh of my shoulders as I whimpered like a small animal about to be devoured-which I was.  I felt the sharp pain of its fangs tear through my skin and inject me with poison that made my blood burn. I lay in bed, delirious, desperate, muttering for help. My ears were greeted with a cacophony of voices, screaming horrible things that were so foul that before that night had been unimaginable to me. I passed out shortly after, from fear, blood loss or the venom and awoke a few days later, believing to have all been a dream. I clung to that hope until I stepped outside my bedroom door and found dozens of small animals, birds mostly, wrapped up in what appeared to be spider’s webs, discoloured, drained of their blood and insides. All dead. I ran to the bathroom to throw up and caught sight of myself, dried blood caked on my body and face, puncture wounds all over me and strands of silky web still wrapped around my breasts, my stomach, my legs and in my hair. 

The second night I encountered one of them, they took the form of my uncle. I lived with my uncle for nearly 5 years while my father was travelling almost every week for business. I know my father loved me and desperately needed the money that he had to work from dawn until way after the sun set and had to leave me for long periods. He didn’t know what his brother did to me. That night as I became increasingly aware of the noises in my apartment and the feelings of someone touching me and whispering in my ear, I rolled over to see my uncle grinning at me. He crawled onto the bed and tied me down. I struggled, but when I did he beat me with his belt, like he had started doing when I was eight years old. I fought as hard as I could, tears burning my eyes and sobbing uncontrollably, but he kept cutting away at my clothes with a pocket knife and telling me to be a good girl. The torture that night lasted for many hours, possibly days. I try not to remember it. I thought I had moved on from those childhood years and buried them a few years ago, when my uncle died. This was not the last time the monsters took on forms like this to break me. They’ve only grown stronger with every drop of blood, with every scream and with every hopeless sob I’ve given them.

Their true form will only appear to you in dreams at first because they get to torment you in ways that won’t instantaneously butcher you or drive you insane, yet; they like to take their time with their toys. The dreams for me started after those incidents. I have seen what those beings really look like and…just thinking about it is enough for me to start violently shaking, unable to stop retching. The other day I wasn’t careful and thought about one of them and a stranger had to hold me back as I unconsciously started walking in front of a train. In my dreams, it is pure hell as they have my undivided attention for hours and can do whatever they want to me without my body breaking and bending the way it would in the waking world, but it all feels real. 
Part of me stares at length of rope on my coffee table and considers leaving this torment…but what if when I die, I get sent to their realm, to be their plaything forever? 

It’s not just the occasional brush against my skin, the odd floor creak and the rare moment of ‘is someone calling my name?’ Now I feel them on me at all times, their rough, sharp skin cutting mine, scratching me, violating every single part of my body. Their voices scream and howl at me, maniacally taunting and laughing at my never-ending misery. Even when I shut my eyes, I still see them, their hideous beings beyond any words the human language has to describe them to you. 

Most of you think of those household noises and strange occurrences as the work of ghosts, of spirits. Yes, it is so comforting for humans to believe these presences are the souls of dead people who are just sad and wandering, isn’t it? You want to be able to talk to someone no longer alive; you open your mind and let them in. Don’t. What’s out there isn’t human, it isn’t some person with unfinished business, what’s out there wants you to think that, to get comfortable with inviting it in and letting yourself become aware of it. 

Did you just hear that faint noise outside your window, like a soft breeze carrying a faint whisper? That creak outside your room? That faint sensation on your flesh? I hope not, because now you know what’s really there and they’ve always known about you.",Don't give them attention.,8,nosleep
Rhapsodeyus,1,,1,1rgtyq,,7,"Some may recall a story I posted a few months back, about shadow-like figures who visited me on a mission for knowledge, and afterwards, disappeared like ghosts. For those who do not recall, the story is [Curious Visitors](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l4dv2/curious_visitors/).

If you have not read that, well, you probably haven't missed much, but it will help with the backstory for this one if you do read it.

Done reading? Good, let's continue.

This happened last night, Sunday, November 24th, 2013. I woke up at precisely 4:27 AM, and I know this because I watched my small digital alarm clock on my bedside table flip to 4:27 AM as my eyes opened. I also noticed that my lamp was off (I sleep with the light on for safety reasons, since living with cats can be hazardous). However, I could see my plain, black clock in a pale blueish light.

My brain clicked. ""My laptop is on. I must have left it on and the power went out, so it's running on battery."" Then I remembered, quite clearly, turning it off and closing it before going to bed. That's when I felt a weight at the end of my bed, sitting in front of my laptop.

I sat up, looked, and spotted a shadowy figure sitting in front of my laptop. The NoSleep submission form was up. I coughed, and said quietly, ""You could have asked."" Instead of, say, a sudden spin and a glare from Brarger, as I expected, my visitor vanished instantly.

I didn't expect that, and it startled me thoroughly. My previous visitors would never have been so rude, and certainly would have asked my permission to access my personal computer. I shifted, tossed the covers aside, and moved to the end of the bed, to read what it had written.

I now wish I hadn't.

The message ends there. I suppose I interrupted the agent and he fled.

Whether this is genuine or not, I cannot know. If it is a fake by a rogue agent, then its purpose is unclear, but it is certainly unsettling. If this is a prank, then it's impressively elaborate, yet in poor taste.

JUVIE_MAKER,2,,1,1rhq9j,,8,"I have a nose for things. No seriously, all my life I’ve had a very strong sense of smell and I don’t mean for the average person. I have an abnormally, freakishly, ridiculously, absurd sense of smell. It’s been that way since I was a kid. Here’s a prime example, when I was about four or five I used to visit my grandmother (god rest her soul) every month in Daytona Beach for the summer. My grandmother was notorious for making the best homemade cakes in the neighborhood. I would always leave my Gran’s house at least ten pounds heavier each summer after gorging myself on her delicious treats. One Saturday, after a day of playing outside (when kids used to play outside!) I instantly smelled the aroma of cake wafting through the air, but something was…..off. There was another smell lingering behind the cake scent. It was kinda tangy, bitter, sorta nutty …just all around unpleasant. Being so young, I couldn’t quite put my finger on what the smell was but I knew I didn’t like it. Then out comes my Gran from the kitchen with a big slice of her freshly made cake on a china plate. She passes the dining room table and spots me standing there with my nose crinkled up in disgust.

Gran:  What’s the matter baby? Come sit at the table and have a slice of cake.

Five year old me: I aint eating that cake, it smells funny!

(Let me just interject for a second.  Now if your family is old school like mine, you know that a child is to NEVER disrespect an elder’s cooking! Especially if that elder is a family member, you just don’t do it! That is unless you want a black eye, ribs broken, missing teeth… you get the picture.)

Gran: Girl, get your hind parts over here and eat this cake before I slap the hell out of you!!

Oh geez…there’s that tone. You know it, you know it well. That angry deep tone that resonates from parents when their truly pissed off. You know… that voice that scares the living shit out of you and gives you’re delicate child-like mind nightmares for a month (or your whole life). Yeah that’s what I was hearing right about then. But still I was adamant. I would not eat that damn cake. That smell! It was just too potent. Now, you might be thinking, what’s the big deal? Surely you’ve smelled worse things than that cake before, which is very true. At that point in my life I’d smelled worse things before (WAY WORSE) but I’d never been subjected to eat those things either. Also, the stench of that pastry….it was just… so very not right. I was only a child but I was still old enough to know right from wrong, and that cake was definitely wrong! Even at that very moment I could taste its bitterness in the back of my mouth. With every inhale it burned and tingled down my throat.

Gran: Come over here and take this plate now!

Okay at this point I knew I was in REAL trouble. Even if my grandmother didn’t kill me, I was pretty sure I was in for the ass whooping of my life! I slowly started to back away from Gran as she moved closer to me with that dreaded cake. Even as she inched towards me that smell seem too magnify. With every step she took it grew more and more intense! “Girl, you better take this cake!” she yelled holding the plate out in front of her. I turned to run but she quickly snatched up my arm before I could get away. “No!” I shouted feverishly trying to pull away from her grip, “I don’t want the cake, granny!!” but my pleas of desperation came to no avail. My grandmother started to tug me towards the kitchen table, her fingers angrily wrapped around my tiny forearm. Suddenly, she yanked me forward making my body jump about two feet in her direction, tilting my face towards hers. She looked down at me with an awful glare. Dark hollow eyes glowered down from Gran’s wrinkled sockets. Her once loving face was now rigid and stiff with a sadistic expression that I had by no means seen before. “You will eat this cake!” She shouted through gritted teeth. “Even if I have to shove it down your throat piece by piece!” 

I had never seen this side to my Gran before. My once sweet, devoted granny had turned into this vicious monster plucked straight out of my worst nightmares. My small frame quaked in fear and tears began to seep from my eyes. I had never known terror like this. My insides loosened and squirmed like jelly making the contents of my bladder empty and leak down my legs. To say I was afraid would be the understatement of the freakin decade! But you know what? There was something else I was more fearful of. Even as I pissed myself in sheer horror from the presence of my devil-like grandmother, there was still something more bloodcurdling, more utterly terrifying than her…that fucking cake! 

“NO!!!!!!!” echoed from my lips in a banshee scream and with all the strength I possessed I juggernauted into my grandmother. My body throttled into her torso head first making a loud solid grunt bellow from the old woman. Her arms flew in the air (letting me go in the same instance) and her vast body collapsed backwards before suddenly….CRACK!
The sound of my grandmother’s head crashing along the rim of her kitchen table splintered throughout the house. Gran thudded to the ground like a sack of potatoes and the plate with the cake she so firmly held onto shattered on the floor. I stared at her lifeless body as blood began to seep through her head and flow on the linoleum. I was still too little to know the true meaning of life and death but I did know for sure that red liquid was not suppose to be running out of her head like that. I bent down and looked into Gran’s half opened eyes. They weren’t black any more. They’d gone back to their normal brown again. Not really knowing what to do I just stared down at the gruesomeness of it all, watching the chunks of yellow cake absorb the blood until each piece was just as red. 

To make a long story short the police were eventually called. My Gran’s weekly bridge game was on that day and a couple of her elder counterparts found her body, and me sitting in a pool of piss and blood staring at it. Needless to say there were lots of screams. Oh, and you’re probably wondering what that smell was, right? I actually didn’t find out until I was well into my teens what exactly it was. I was pouring it into my foster parent’s coffee one morning when it finally hit me…Cyanide. From the smell of it, Gran probably couldn’t have used too much either. Maybe half a teaspoon, give or take; totally undetectable to the average person’s nose…but not to mine. “So that’s what that was, go figure”.  I remember thinking that to myself as I stirred the cyanide into two mugs. My foster parents passed away later on that day, I wish I could say I feel sadness over it but I really don’t.  I was more consumed with thoughts on why my grandmother was trying to kill me? Was it because of what I’d done to Oscar, her cute little Maltese? I mean, if I’d known the oven wasn’t a suitable place to put a dog I might have done things differently. I was only two at the time. Or perhaps it had something to do with what happened with Mommy…that really was unfortunate. I didn’t want to hurt her, but she was an obstacle that just had to be removed. 

But anyways, that’s neither here nor there. I’m an adult now and those days are long behind me. I’m actually on my way to my boyfriend’s…excuse me….ex-boyfriend’s apartment right now. I’m visiting him and that slut he cheated on me with. And guess what? They just had a baby, isn’t that the sweetest thing.  ",A nose for things...,9,nosleep
1234FUCK,7,,3,1rhjmk,,7,"So my uncle has always been into the paranormal and he got me into paranormal investigation, Or ghost hunting to simplify it a few years back. Well I go with him on a lot of them and we do it for free for people who think something paranormal is going on in their houses. I always saw it as a nice little hobby to do on the weekends to blow of some time and I always liked being scared. I mean that’s how I even know about this sub-reddit because I like reading it. And that’s one of the only reasons I knew about what had happened on my last investigation. 


	We got a call from a family out in the middle of the country saying they had begun hearing weird voices when they were each alone but the 16 year old son was the one who had it happen the most. I went through every scenario I could think on the way there, Something was legitimately going on that was paranormal, one of the kids was lying and was fucking with the rest of the family and other such things. Well when we got there we talked with the family and everyone seemed happy except the two children. The son was as I said earlier 16 and the girl was 14, they seemed uneasy looking off into corners and such. I took a note about it but didn’t dwell on it that much. We went around the house marking places we would put cameras and getting the lay out of the house. Once we finished that we went back to our van and started getting ready. After we set up all of our equipment we each got our POV (Point of view) cameras strapped on and started our investigation. My Uncle took the upstairs, our colleague took the first floor, And I went into the basement to do a little investigating of my own. 


I made my way downstairs and grabbed my Walky-talky and radioed my uncle asking if everyone was ready for me to hit the main light breaker. He gave me the go ahead and I flipped the little switch plunging the whole house into darkness I held up the other camera I had with me so I could have a camera move around freely ( plus it had a night vision setting so I could see where I was going.) Well I turned it on and walked slowly to the chair I had placed in the room so I could sit comfortably waiting for something to happen. And after an hour or so of me questioning the darkness.. It answered back.
My instincts kicked in and I put a call in on the radio for everyone to tell me where they were. And everyone was exactly where they said they were supposed to be. My heart froze in my throat from fear but excitement so I stood and asked who I was talking to and I heard a small wispy chuckle before it said softly “You know who I am.” I swallowed hard before continuing to walk around the room and asking questions. It stayed silent for a few questions before I asked why it was here. It chuckled again before I heard a small sound. Like a door knob jiggling and I turned towards it. My camera landed on a door knob sticking out from a sheet that I guess had covered it before. I walked towards it slowly pulling the sheet off to reveal a shabby door about waist height with peeling paint and scratch marks.  I put in a call on the radio telling my uncle and the others I had found something and for them to meet me in the basement. I got no answer back but I assumed they had gotten the message. My uncle did that a lot; he tended to get over excited with these things so I figured he was just trying to get here as fast as possible.  But the paranormal curiosity ran in the family so I reached down and grabbed the knob, it was warm as if someone had been holding it for a longtime. I steadied myself before twisting it and pushing it open. 


I looked through my camera screen as I walked into the door. The atmosphere around me seemed to change instantly, even though all the lights in the house was off it just seemed to be darker and colder in here the basement itself.  I looked around in the room through the screen until I saw a lone chair in the center of the room. I walked forward until I was right next to it and then began looking around more. I jumped a bit at the bright light on my screen until I noticed it was a mirror. It was bolted onto a beam  next to the chair and when I looked to the left I noticed the same thing. I thought it was really strange so I walked around the front of the chair and accidentally kicked something over.  It was loud and then I heard a sound of rushing water. My heart leapt into my throat as I looked down and around looking for the source until my camera came upon a metal bucket slightly rolling with water coming out. I also saw a candle and a small match book and that’s when it hit me. My whole body filled with fear as the realization flooded my head…. This was a “three kings” set up.


 I turned towards the door pointing the camera as I looked through it I saw the door slam and I stopped. My whole body froze from pure terror and it took me a few seconds before I let out a scream for help. After I stopped I heard the soft chuckle come from behind me in the darkness and I just stood there with my eyes closed shaking as I felt a soft breath on the back of my neck I heard a voice.. My voice whisper right into my ear. “ Do you know who I am now?” I stood there for a second before screaming again and then I heard the door bust open and I saw flash lights on me and my uncle asking what was wrong. I just ran from the room to the breaker box and flipped on all the lights. I then sank to the floor looking at him as he sat next to me and asked all that happened. I just held out my camera to him and he took it. Before he watched it he asked me why I didn’t call for back up and I looked at him before telling him that I did. He looked at our colleague before watching the recording.


 After that he asked me if we all went in together would I go back in. I nodded as long as we kept the lights on and we went in. and it was as I thought. It was a set up for “ The three kings.” I shuddered as I turned to my uncle asking if he knew what it was. He didn’t so I explained it to him and I pointed to the bucket “ and it has been used recently. The bucket was full of water. “ My uncle nodded to me and put a wrap on the investigation. We went back home and I have decided to type this up. Tomorrow we will be going and talking to the family about what happened and who had done the three kings in the house.  


I think the three kings set up has something to do with what has been happening at the house. I will update you all on what happens after we talk to them.

OsamaBinHiding,3,,2,1rhxdo,,5,"Last night was like every other night for me. Have dinner on my own in my small, yet cost flat and watch a little bit of TV. Around 9 or 10 o'clock, I start to crack on with some work as I had a university deadline in a couple days time. The minutes started going faster and before I knew it it was 12 o""clock. 

""Where did the time go?"" I thought. It had only felt like a few minutes. However, this was a normal occurrence for me. The world kind of, disappears when I get lost in a train of thought and for the life of me, I can't break out of it.

I had just remembered that I had a seminar early in the morning and suddenly thought ""Fuck, I better try and get some sleep"" 

See, I live in an old building that has been converted into flats in the suburbs of a major city. So it isn't uncommon to hear floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and all the walls are very thin so noises in the middle of the night just tend to go over my head. I wouldn't consider myself someone who doesn't get scared easily but when you're familiar with floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and branches tapping your window - you tend to grow some thick skin.

Last night wasn't like any other night in my flat though. 

As I mentioned earlier, I was alone. My flatmate - let's call him, Evan for the sake of the story, was away celebrating thanksgiving with his family but he's away a lot so I'm used to spending a long period of time on my own. My usual night routine of showering, brushing my teeth and cleaning the kitchen was over and I went into my room to finally rest my head for the night and that was when I first noticed something. My drawers were all pulled open. 

To most people, this is probably nothing - but for me it wasn't normal. I suffer from borderline OCD and everything, especially in my room needs to be in order and I remember waking up and everything was in order. I hadn't left my flat today either. 

""I'm too tired for this shit"" I thought and went to bed. 

It's weird though isn't it? That something like a mattress and a duvet can make you feel so safe, like nothing can hurt you. I remember being a child and I made sure none of my limbs were outside of my bed incase something grabbed me in the middle of the night. Such a feeble piece of furniture can make you feel so safe.

Well, not anymore for me. Last night I heard the usual creaking of the floorboards - no biggy, right? However, as I drew closer to conscientious, I realised that these creaking sounds weren't coming from the surrounding walls and neighbouring flats but they were coming from under my bed.

And that's when I felt the unmistakable sensation of a cold, coarse finger stroking mine over the side of my bed.

TaylorBonaseraSr,0,,3,1rhb2e,,4,"I can explain why I'm so afraid of mirrors, or anything that could reflect light, even a glass door. It's so difficult for me to talk about it sometimes, but other times I feel her pressing me on to tell as many people about her as possible. She broke my mirror the first time, just crashed right through the glass and shattered the glass into a literal hundred pieces. It was such a pain to have to clean all that up. I got at least five cuts. But she didn't care. At the very least she didn't laugh at me or yell at me to clean faster. At least she was nice enough to check herself for that. Anyway, I got my mirror replaced. She didn't break the bathroom mirror again, but she broke the great mirror in the hallway while she was running through it. I don't understand how she did it, it's pressed up right against the wall. She'd have to ram her body sideways. She didn't even have any visible cuts. She told me she was sorry, and that she would try not to do it again. I believed her, and she was true to her word. But soon enough, I hear the crashing again. But this time it's my door. The majority of my glass door has been smashed through, but the weird thing is that the hole is shaped like Quasimodo. No one lives here that has a body shaped like that. The other times I checked her she didn't have any cuts on her, but this time she was bleeding so much from every part of her body that she had to go to the hospital. I had to sit there and watch her, but she couldn't explain what had happened. When the doctor asked, neither could I, because I hadn't been there. It's strange how selective she is; she won't smash into anything except mirrors or glass-looking things. Anywhere there isn't this kind of stuff, nothing bad happens. She tells me that she feels so cold whenever she walks by something like that, and she gets an uncontrollable urge to destroy it. She talks to me about it so often I feel like I'm beginning to share the feeling.

It's starting to unnerve me, and I don't want to live with her anymore. But I can't break the joint liability contract. She told me to cover all the things in the house that could possibly create a reflection, so I did. But I find her desperately tearing off the covers when she thinks I'm not looking.

One day I'd had enough so I decided to take off one of the covers in my room. It couldn't hurt, just for a little while when she couldn't see. She wouldn't notice. But after a minute of reveling in my refreshed reflection, I saw her standing there. So close. She was so ugly. She copied my expression and mocked my horrified face. She followed me here, to my own room. I couldn't turn around. There was no point. I felt a pressure from her on my shoulders so great I couldn't keep a straight posture. She was laughing at me.

But I'd heard that laugh somewhere before. And I'd seen that face before too. It looked so much like my own. She must have heard my thoughts, because she said she told me to never look at her by means of a reflection. I couldn't stand the sight of her face anymore, it was so scary. It'd been such a long time since I'd spent so many minutes just staring at her. I had to take control. So I bashed the bedroom mirror in, balling my bare hands into fists and repeatedly thrashing until I could feel the glass cutting into my skin.

It'd been so long since I'd last done that. Now every time I look, I can see her, feel her, I see her staring at her...our...reflection, through my eyes.",My Blank Mirror,7,nosleep
SeaDweller7,2,,2,1rhilw,,4,"I go to a regular school, its kindergarten to year twelve, so its pretty big. But, my school is an old public school, and the principle is ancient. Me? I am in year twelve, and I’m graduating next year, and my friends said I should share this story with you guys. 

Ok, where to start? Well, at my school we have a pretty serious problem with bullies, and when I say serious I mean it. One year our school was even on the news, but it was pretty traumatic. When I was in year nine, there was this little girl in fifth grade, called Melody. Her and me sort of talked sometimes, as she was a new girl and I was her school buddy (to show her around and stuff) She was a sort of short, curly brown haired, blue eyed and geeky girl. Glasses and all of that stuff, so your stereotypical nerd. Which pretty much was what she was.

After I moved up in to Tenth grade it was pretty clear that she was being bullied. Instead of gossiping or playing with the other girls, she just sort of walked around the school... bouncing a tennis ball and wandering around the grounds of the school. 

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

Then, half way through the year, school was stopped. During lunch they lined us up and called our parents. Sent us home. They just said there was an accident. My mother and father lived in Melbourne and I lived with my uncle and aunty, and they’re pretty laid back and all ‘come home when you feel’ so I stayed at school.

I saw five year six girls with that sort of ‘we know nothing it wasn’t us we didn’t do anything’ look on their face before I saw an ambulance and a white body bag. Out of the end of the body bag stuck out locks of curly brown hair, and the always-screeching birds seemed to sing a sweet tune. A melody.

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

Last week we had a substitute teacher who started screaming at a girl who was outside bouncing her ball after the end of lunch bell had rung. She didn’t realise Melody wouldn’t listen. 

No one knew why the back stairs from German were out of bounds for two months, and why the German teacher quit. No one asked why those five girls we’re stared at my Melody’s sort of... ghost.

I pieced it together. A simple push, a simple tumble. A simple death.

No one cares, all the kids just skip past her, all the laughter swallows up her silence.

It has been a little over a year since I last wrote - just over a year since the last nightmare.  I was foolish to think I was somehow cured, that, as Dr. Lough suggested, getting it out of my head and into a journal would help.

I read back over my last and only journal entry, as I tried to describe the nightmare.  It is so chaotic and scattered, yet I'm unable to find any other way to convey the details.  That is the terror of the dream at its core - utterly chaotic.  Jerking from one sensation to the next, the hesitant probing of my fingers as they cover the smooth flesh where my eyes should be, to the damp defeat in realizing those fingers have torn away the protective lids in confusion.  All of this, in layers of sleep - waking to the comfort of my mother's figure, only to then know it is just another stage of the dream playing out, with her eerie voice echoing through my body:

""You're connected now.""

Even now, in understanding that my last entry seemed to bleed out through the pages, I'm struggling to form coherent thoughts onto this paper.  Each detail seems to tie into the next, only to fall apart when I try to see the whole.  I wonder what type of clinical association Dr. Lough could make?  Is this what schizophrenia feels like?  I have no way to explain it.  It is as though there is a novelist's grand plot line swirling around my body in paper shreds and each time I reach out I can snatch only a sliver of a scene, unable to ever piece the parts into an understanding.  I'm fairly certain this entry, and perhaps any subsequent entries, will be just as erratic.  I just cannot force these thoughts together.

So much has changed in the last year, it is so hard to recall my state of mind the last time the nightmare came to me.  I have a son now, nearly 6 months old.  We must have just found out Rachel was pregnant around the time I last wrote.  Could that have been a factor in the nightmare returning after years of peace?  Was my mind so overwhelmed with the thought of being a father, the changes to my life, the responsibility, it somehow dredged that old horror back from my subconscious?  I can't help but think it must have played a role.  It has been a blur, so many other things seem to have fallen into place.  Though they are exciting, it seems predetermined, somehow rushed.

Over the last decade I have had a slight obsession with the home I grew up in.  I knew I would live there once again - returning it to ownership in my family - though I never anticipated it would happen so quickly.  Rachel's grandmother died, leaving her an inheritance that allowed us to leap forward several years in our plans together.  It was Christmas Day, the day she died - I guess her last gift to us.  Three months after my son was born, we were moving back into the mountains, back to the walls I had called home as a boy.  

One thing I feel for certain, this home is the source.  The nightmare started here, always took place here, was always fueled here.  I'm beginning to remember things, or have recurrent thoughts I have not had for nearly two decades.  It is as though these things are unlocked from muscle memory as I walk this house.

As a child I would reach the top of the second floor staircase, which opened onto a hallway, always with my head down staring at my feet.  Left, at the end of a long hallway was a guest room.  Large floor to ceiling windows would reflect back a warped view of the person looking down to them.  Right, across a short landing was my bedroom.  I had trained myself to never look left at night - as the small nightlight by my bedroom door would throw twisted shadows onto my reflection in the long guest room windows.  If I would look up, I would become stuck in fear with the reflection.  The windows seemed to pulse with my heartbeat, flexing my body larger then smaller in the glass.  My feet became rooted in place, the black of the windows and the emptiness behind them tunneling out for me.  The nightlight would flicker in then out, each time causing my shape to jump forward, as though I were being pulled down the hallway towards the darkness.  I never remembered breaking loose, turning and walking back to my bedroom and going to sleep.  I would wake up in my bed hours later, staring at my hands, inspecting for blood and knowing I just had the nightmare. 

I learned, I kept my head down and did not look to the left.

Our first night in the home, that muscle memory followed suit.  After turning off the main floor lights, I climbed the staircase.  My son was sleeping against my chest, his arms wrapped around my neck and shoulder.  My head was down as I crested the top step, turning to the right, towards my room which was now his.  As I neared the bedroom door, his forehead left my shoulder.  His back straightened and his arm peeled away from my neck.  I felt his arm extend straight back behind my head.  I didn't need to look at his eyes, I knew.  Those eyes followed his arm to his hand, reaching down the hallway to the windows.  The nightlight flickered as he let out a giggle.  I took the last step into his bedroom and shut the door.

Sunny day in Nevada. Families having lunch outside, fathers teaching their sons how to grill steak, playgrounds
filled with kids. Every year I plan a trip with my son. Nevada has really nice caves in it. When I was little,
my father always took me there and so did his father. I didn't want to break this chain. I told Jake, my son, about that
cave that I used to visit but I did not have enough time to take him there until now. He was still sleeping when
I stepped in his room.
""Honey wake up!"" Jake opened his little eyes and whispered:
""What?""

""We are going to see the cave I told you about!"" he instantly jumped out of his bed and become so excited that
I can't even tell about it. He got dressed and ran to have something to eat. About five minutes later he was screaming
from the garage door.
""Hurry up mom!""

One hour car ride. Not the longest one he ever had. He kept asking me about the place. I just smiled and told him to
be patient. As soon as I parked the car, he blasted out the door and ran to the back of the car to grab two flashlights. 
""You ready?"" I asked him. He obviously was so we started walking towards our destination.
It was dark in there. Darker than anywhere else. Flashlights on.  He just kept pushing forward. Sometimes I couldn't 
even catch up with that little kid. After a sharp left turn I saw him standing there. He found it. The biggest hall 
in the cave. Every wall was shining when the light of our flashlights reached them.
""Beautiful isn't it?""

""It is indeed!"" he answered. He turned his head towards me but it was only q light at a corner 
that he could see. He totally crapped himself. ""Mommy wait for me!"" He started running towards the light 
that he could see. It is a maze down there. - MOM! - he screamed.
""I'm here honey!"" He caught up with me. He just gasped there and started to be a bit relieved as he realized 
that he was not alone in that dark cave again.
""Hey calm down little boy! I'm not leaving you here!"" went closer to him and whispered:  ""Or am I ?

jonssijonssi,0,,0,1rilff,,2,"Hey guys, I just wanted to tell you about my dream which kind of freaked me out. I've been having a lot of bad dreams for the past 3 weeks, but i think this one tops all of them. Anyhow, I dreamt that I lived with my boyfriend in a big house, it was night and we both were sleeping. Suddely i wake up, and I sit up in our bed. I'm fully aware that I'm sleepwalking but I can't stop myself, lay down again or do anything about my actions. I start walking out in a big hallway (this is where the main door is located), then I enter a smaller, much more narrow and dark hallway, and in the end is a small wardrobe-like room which is truly pitch black. This scared me a bit since I am afraid of the dark but I just keep walking, I don't even consider NOT to walk in to the wardrobe. So I find myself inside this pitch black tiny room and I close the door and I lock it. Once I have locked the door i just panic, I'm not afraid but I simply can't stop screaming, I remember the scream so well, it was a true scream of despair, I screamed at the top of my lungs but I still was not scared. I started to bang the door, the walls, everything while screaming and crying as hard as I could. Finally my boyfriend comes to the rescue and the door was open now, he just grabs me and tells me I was sleepwalking and I just said ""I know"" in the sternest voice. He's scared out of his life and crying and I just looks at him like he's crazy and then i just go back to bed like nothing happened. 
",The sleepwalking dream,2,nosleep
ephique,0,,0,1rikrx,,4,"I grew up in a small town in Ohio with my mom, dad and big sister. We were a normal family, neither happy nor sad, somewhere in between. I was always interested in music as a kid so I spent most of my time playing piano, practicing guitar or trying my best to write my own songs. It was also some sort of medicine for me; it helped me drift away into my own world when my sister and my mom had disputes. You see, my sister was one of those rebellious teenagers at the time that had to have their own way or the rest of the world had to suffer their unfair ranting. I hated it; I hated hearing her yell at my poor mother.

During a lonesome walk home from school one day I got a call from my dad, making sure that I didn’t have any plans and telling me that I had to come home as fast as possible. My dad never called my cell phone unless he really wanted something so I knew right away something was up. I remember jogging most of the route home, since my dad sounded so serious. It gave me the creeps to say the least.

I jumped over the fence surrounding our villa and paced myself into our house. The kitchen was the first room you’d see upon entering and it was empty so I assumed they were in the living room upstairs. As I was making my way up the stairs I could hear my sister sobbing uncontrollably, something had definitely happened. My dad was standing up as my sister was sitting on the couch, he told me to sit down as well.

I was scared and curious at the same time. Dad and my sister never really spoke or had any arguments since my father didn’t bother caring too much about any of my sisters business, so I could figure out that this wasn’t about my sister. I remember sitting there in dead silence with the exception of my sister shedding tears and trying to keep her crying as quiet as possible. My dad was looking like he had no idea what to do or say, as if he didn’t know how to explain something to me.

Finally, after a long pause my dad made an introduction to whatever I thought this was about at the time. He said: “Your mother…” and then he needed to grasp some air, and he continued: “Your mother has passed away.”

I was eight years old and I couldn’t grasp that concept. I didn’t understand death, or that my mom was eternally gone. I just sat there as I was developing an irrational anger towards god-knows-what, I remember thinking how unfair this was. I do however forgive my dad for telling me so bluntly, he didn’t know what to do and he was in shock at the time.

My sister continued crying, she asked dad how mom died although it was obvious she didn’t actually care to know at that precise moment. She was just being desperate and no one could blame her. I thought it was my sisters fault when I was there, I thought that was why she was crying so much. I didn’t shed a single tear; I kept it all inside. Of course that didn’t mean this incident didn’t haunt me for years, I never stopped thinking about my mother. 

The aftermath of my mother’s death is what has been shaping my life the recent years. My sister was very weak emotionally and it basically drove her insane. My dad had to take her to an actual mental hospital. Something I didn’t even think existed when I was eight. This resulted in that I didn’t get to meet my sister very often, my dad kept telling me she was in a special school for students that wanted a challenge; but I overheard enough conversations to know where she really was. I guess my dad was trying to keep me out of it, and I didn’t blame him. 

I was guessing that my sister wasn’t doing very well at the hospital since we got to see her less and less as years went by, something that troubled me; I hated living in this big villa of ours with just my dad. It felt so dead, and my dad had been more kept to himself after mom died. We didn’t do anything, I literally spent all time at home in my room, making or playing music. Me and my dad didn’t even greet sometimes when I came home from school, it was depressing. My theory for his change in behavior has always been that he blamed himself for my mother’s death, something that I’m about to get into.

You are probably wondering how she died by now, and it’s a legit question to be asking. The best answer I could give you is that I don’t know. My dad has always told me she died of liver-failure but for some reason that has always sounded like a lie to me. It didn’t add up, my mom never had any problems with her liver before and she didn’t drink. I think it was something he made up when I was younger because he assumed I wasn’t mature enough to hear the truth. In addition to this, whenever I asked my dad about this matter he’d get heavily upset. Nowadays I never ask about my mom’s death, nor do I even bring up mom as a topic.

Years went by and I ended up being fourteen. It kept going like I just described, I spent most times in my room playing music as my dad did whatever he was doing on his own in the house. My dad did work, he had the night-time shift at a local bottle factory, I’m not joking, he actually made glass bottles for a living. He had higher ambitions but most of them got crushed when he and my mother got my sister, they had to move and dad basically had no other financial option than to quit the university he was attending at the time and get a quick and close job. You guessed it, the bottle factory.

I was riding my bike home late at night after spending the evening in the school library at one point when I was fourteen. My school was the type that had an after-school library that didn’t close till 11 pm. I didn’t need any of the books or supplies that the library offered; I just studied there sometimes since it felt less depressing than my father and our lonely villa. Either way, I hadn’t seen my sister for two years that night and I was starting to get the idea that I wouldn’t see her again for another two. 

When I arrived at the house the front door was open, “This is odd?” I thought. Upon closer examination I realized that someone had taken the spare key from its hidden spot underneath one of my mother’s old jars. It’s never smart to have a spare key hidden right next to the door, number one mistake people do when it comes to spare keys. It did look like whoever had taken it did suffer a struggle before finding it. The rug outside the door was all muffled up and there were scratches on the door, around the lock. I suspected we had been robbed so I pulled out my cell phone, ready to call the police. 

This is when I heard something coming from inside the house. I was dead scared to say the least, this could have been armed robbers or maybe something worse, I didn’t know. It sounded like someone was grinding furniture against the floor, trying to move it. It was so dark as well, I remember not seeing more than pitch black looking into the open door, technically if someone was in there they would have seen me because of the street lights. I started to slowly pace into the house, walking towards the noise. This is where I had to make a decision, was I going to suddenly turn on the lights in order to reveal whatever was in there or was I going to approach it in the dark? I picked the former. I was just going to switch the lights on when I could see someone strafe into the light coming in through the kitchen window. It was my sister, naked. My entire mindset had to change into a totally different way of dealing with the situation; it took me a good couple of seconds to assume she escaped the hospital. 

I switched on the lights in an instant. She had redecorated the entire kitchen, in the dark. Of course it all looked hideous and random; she didn’t know what the hell she was doing. I remember being in a slight discomfort, I had never seen my sister naked in my entire life. I also hadn’t seen her for a good couple of years at all. She didn’t look very comfortable either, she looked like she didn’t know who I was and was wondering what I was doing there.

I uttered “Linda?” out loud, that was her name. She didn’t respond, she just continued standing there looking at me. “Don’t you remember me, I’m your brother.” I still couldn’t get any feedback out of her; it was as if the wheel wasn’t spinning at all. I wasn’t sure what the protocol here was, not knowing the number to the mental institution or anything I figured I’d try to call dad, before I got to press the call button on my cell phone she uttered: “Don’t call dad.” This is when I realized she couldn’t be completely empty inside after all.

“You don’t want to call dad.” She continued.  I had no idea what to do, I assumed this was part of the reason she was in the mental hospital in the first place. Luckily my dad got home at that point, not coming from a finished shift at work. He had a good five hours at least left, I assumed the hospital had phoned him and told him about the situation. My father ran into the house as fast as he could.

This is when something I didn’t expect happened, he told me to leave. He pointed at the door as if I had no idea how to find my way out of my own house. I asked him where I was supposed to go, he told me to wait in his car. Judging from how serious my dad seemed I didn’t think twice about it, I ran out to the car. As I was sitting in the car I could see my sister walk past the kitchen window a couple of times, I remember how she made no effort to cover her breasts. I had no clue what the two of them were discussing, although I never saw my sister move her lips so I’m guessing my dad did most of the talking. 

After a couple of minutes my dad started to walk to the car, he joined me inside. I remember asking why he didn’t bring Linda with him, “Don’t call her that name!” he shouted in response. I was so confused at this point. Dad started the car and drove me to my only friend’s house; I didn’t see him very often though. I was a lone wolf growing up and I still was at this point, I didn’t really create any friendships. I remember sitting in the car as he ran up the steps to ring my friend’s doorbell, his mother opened in her night dress and looked confused. I assumed my dad made up some emergency story to cover what was going on in order to get me a place to stay overnight. I didn’t even know what was going on to be fair.

Whatever he told them worked, I got to spend the night at my friend’s place. Tim’s place, to be exact. It was pretty awkward I remember, I only saw Tim a couple of times a week and that was when we shared classes in Spanish. We got to be desk-mates because the teacher made up whom to sit next to each semester, so we weren’t very close. 

It was a Friday so there was no school the morning after; I guessed that made it easier for my dad, leaving him the freedom to pick me up whenever he wanted to. He did, but not before giving me enough time to fully experience the awkward breakfast conversations with Tim’s parents, both trying to justify me as Tim’s best friend. I don’t know. Tim didn’t have many friends I guess.

On the way home I asked my dad what was going on the night before and he basically stopped the car and stared at me, as if I was mocking him. I remember how desperate he looked, as if he had no fire left in his heart. He uttered the words: “Do you think I wanted any of this?” as he grabbed his hair in regret. “All I wanted was a normal family with no circumstances, and I’m not blaming you when I’m saying this because frankly you are the only sane member left in this livelihood of ours.” Is what came out of his mouth next. I tried to comfort him, telling him that he had done a good job raising me and what not; I really didn’t have a lot of cards in my deck at this point. I mean my dad was basically losing it.

When we got home he told me that he was sorry, and that I should go up to my room. I did go up to my room but I got to tell you; I was starting to get very anxious about my dad. I really wanted to know what the hell was going on. I spent that night recording some guitar sessions for a song and reading books while listening to some ambient records I had found online, I couldn’t sleep so pulling an all-nighter was my only real option. I was reading “A Brief History of Time” for a science project in school, I was somewhere in the middle section of the book and started to get dry eyes. I figured I’d go downstairs into the kitchen to get myself something to drink when I got shocked upon opening the door to the hallway. I saw my mother standing just outside, looking right at me for a fraction of a second. Had all this hassle from the last couple of days driven me insane? It freaked me out so much that I ended up never getting a drink. 

The image of my mother outside my door haunted me that entire night, I kept thinking about it as I couldn’t sleep. She looked deranged, scared and raw. The shortage of light sources in the hallway made her look like she was from a black and white 50’s movie. I kept begging for the sun to rise up, I even did that thing when you close your eyes and try not to open them because you never know what you’ll see. I might have been fourteen, but I can openly admit that I was dead scared.

It finally came to be morning and I ran downstairs, still not fully opening my eyes while passing the hallway. I remember greeting my dad who was sitting in the kitchen drinking orange juice. I was just about to pour myself a glass when he said: “I think I need help.” While holding the glass of juice as if he wasn’t sure he was going to drink the rest of it. I asked him what he meant and he said that he wasn’t sure, that he had felt very uncomfortable and unstable lately. He also mentioned that he was thinking of joining some people from his work in playing golf, he thought that could give him some relief. I told him that sounded like a pretty good idea, jokingly adding that it’s better than hanging around the house doing nothing. He looked offended when I said that, something I didn’t really understand since he obviously worked all night, so that would justify him sleeping through the days.

I understand that some of you reading this are wondering how the hell I could have been fourteen and still not know how my mother died. Well, it’s hard to explain how uncomfortable of a character my dad was at times, and it felt a bit like I was offending him whenever I had to ask because part of me did actually believe she died of liver-failure. I mean it was possible. Imagine if it was true, and I kept asking my dad as if he lied to me. That’s the type of thoughts I had in my head about the whole thing.

Having that explanation out of the way, I did summon the courage to confront my dad one last time. It was a couple of days after the conversation about my dad picking up golf; I just walked into his room unexpected. A part of me had wanted to do this for a long time because I really never knew what he did in his room; it looked similar to an office which is nothing he’d ever need since he was a labor worker in a bottle factory. He was actually sitting at his desk. Not only that, but the desk was flooded with paper-work of some sort, maybe he had picked up an accounting job for the factory during the day, something he could manage from home. I didn’t ask; I had a big enough question for him as it were.

I dragged out a small chair he had behind the door and figured I’d sit on it. It was somewhat squeaky and not very comfortable, better than standing up anyway. Then I leaned forward and I was just about to ask when he interrupted my train of thought by saying: “You want to know about your sister, and what happened the other night. Don’t you?” This is where I started to play along because he was already looking emotionally hurt, bringing up mom here would have been a car-crash. I told him that I was indeed there to ask about my sister. He took a good pause before he bluntly exclaimed it to me: “Your sister is not right in the head; she’s in a mental hospital.” I couldn’t believe he hadn’t figured out that I would have known this by then. Not wanting to make a scene I just pretended like I didn’t know. He explained the context, telling me that she couldn’t take our mother’s death. A tear started climbing down his cheeks, and then he asked me if there was anything else I wanted to talk about. There was no way I could bring up something as sensitive as my mother at this point so I told him that everything was fine, and then I left the room.

I realized on my way up to my room that my dad was fragile and very close to losing his mind in this problematic family business. I had no idea how I’d ever get the truth about my mother out of him. When I finally had landed on my bed in my room again, the image of my mom started crawling back to me. The grey scaled portrait of her in the hallway, was my mind playing tricks on me? I also had a slight feeling that I remembered it from somewhere. I mean it was my mom but that exact stare and look she had, not only did it frighten me but I swore I had seen it before. 

Night landed again, I hadn’t spoken to my father again that day. I was facing the same obstacle that I had the other night, I was too afraid to go downstairs because I thought I’d see my mother again. We all know you can imagine things in the dark, kids do it all the time. It’s as if your mind fills in the gaps, but that incident the other night was different. I got more scared the more I thought of it and figured that I’d open the door to the darn hallway, and turn on the lights in order to feel slightly safer. I’m not going to lie, I did open that door very slowly but as it turned out; there was no sign of my mother. I turned on the lights and went back into my room.

Still not wanting to go to bed, not only because it was spring break at this point but also because I was a bit scared I figured I’d listen through some of my older songs. I had loads of them; most of which weren’t very good however. I was still learning how to create music and I never really thought of myself as particularly good, especially not at writing my own songs. I guess I was decent at playing other people’s songs. I basically went through my songs in chronological order, it was interesting because was able to hear how much I had improved over the years. 
It took me a good three hours to get past most of my songs, and I was reaching the more recent creations of mine. I heard something in one of the songs that I never had paid any attention to before; it was a slight breeze of white noise in the middle of one of my guitar riffs. Knowing that this wasn’t an overworked track yet, it was made just days ago and I hadn’t gotten around to mastering it yet, I figured I wasn’t going to give it more of a thought. That was until the neurons fired, that track was made the day I couldn’t sleep, the day I saw my mother in the hallway. Being a bit gullible I figured that I’d give it a go using my acoustic headphones. I tried everything. I played the song backwards; I cut out bass, middle frequencies, high frequencies and even listened to individual recordings of the instruments and samples. I couldn’t hear anything suspicious, just that white noise. 

I was a bit disappointed, at the same time relieved. Although that white noise shouldn’t have been there, nothing in my room could have made a noise like that. I didn’t want to over-think the situation, so I ended up hitting the bed. Later that night, as I still had problems sleeping I was laying in bed listening to the same ambient soundtracks that I was using nights before, slowly dozing off to sleep. I hadn’t been asleep for much more than ten minutes when I started to ascend into that state of sleep when you’re in a dream at the same time as real life is somewhat happening to you. I could hear a thumping sound coming from somewhere. Before I knew it I got woken up by a loud bass noise, it sounded like some kind of a technical disorder. I continued lying in bed, trying to figure out if I just dreamt about the noise or if it actually occurred, this is when I heard a much dampened sound coming from the other side of my room. It sounded a lot like someone was trying to get some kind of sound device to work. It got quieter and quieter and when I thought it was about to disappear I could hear a voice; very distorted and unstable speaking in what I believe was Russian. 

It took me a couple of minutes but I finally realized what I thought the sound was coming from, I had left my old amplifier on from when I was playing guitar. I bounced out of bed in order to turn on the lights. I was overlooking the entire room as I hit the switch, for the blink of an eye, just next to the amplifier I saw my mom again; just as the light went on. The same stare, same face, still that black and white filtered look from before. I got so shocked I fell down on the floor, the noise coming from the amplifier stopped in the same instant. I wasn’t sure what to make of this, and I definitely didn’t want to tell my father about what I had seen, knowing he has already thrown one of his kin to a mental hospital. 

I had a lot of sleep to catch up on but unfortunately this wouldn’t let me sleep, I just couldn’t sleep at all. I never believed in ghosts or anything growing up, these two small incidents with my mom being my only experience in what could be categorized into the matter. I thought and assumed I was becoming what my sister had become. Whatever this all meant, and needless to say; I didn’t get any sleep that night either.

I met my father in the kitchen the next day, he was looking a lot better than the last time I had seen him. He kept going on and on about how much he was looking forward to playing golf with his work-crew later that afternoon. I was happy for him; he deserved some time out of the stress. After the conversation about an afternoon of longing for a spot in the shade and waiting for your turn on a grass field he added: “Have you been thinking of your mother lately?” As if he could read my mind. I told him that I was always missing my mother, and that I had indeed thought of her a lot lately. He stated that he thought I had. I had no clue why.  Short after that he left for playing golf.

I kept thinking of why my amplifier was acting up that night, I started recalling a clear memory of turning it off after I was done playing. In fact, I knew I did since the amplifier was connected to an electricity hub that I used to turn off a small lamp I had next to my bed, how could it have been on? I had no idea. 

Since my dad was out of the building I figured I could use this afternoon without his presence to get some answers. I stepped into his room to investigate what he had been doing sitting at that desk of his all those hours. I grabbed a bunch of paperwork and sat myself on the double bed next to his desk, it got me a slight reminder on how he hadn’t gotten rid of the bed he shared with my mother yet. The first paper I started examining looked like a letter of some sort, as if it was a letter inside a legal template of some company. I don’t know how I’d describe it better than that. After further examination I found out it was a letter from my sister sent to our address, I remember wondering why dad wouldn’t show me something like this: 

“Daddy, why didn’t you visit me last weekend. I thought you were coming back, I was waiting for you. I’m sorry if I made a scene, I thought something had happened to you! I ran to you because I wanted answers, no one has answers here. I’ve been getting visits lately, why can’t you come to me at the same time?”

I fixed some grammar and a whole lot of spelling errors for the sake of explaining this to you, my sister had the linguistic abilities of a five year-old in this state. On after-thought I guessed my dad didn’t tell me about letters from my sister since they would inevitably prove that she wasn’t in a special school for people who were after tougher challenges. Although thinking about it, that doesn’t sound ridiculously different than a mental hospital.

The rest of the papers seemed to be a real mixture of work-related things and records of local police-investigations. Why would my father be looking into cases of murder, pedophilia, rape and almost anything you can think of? It wasn’t really my business what he did with his spare time but this was just outright messed up. I knew he had a friend in the police force, that was either the reason he had these or just the tool he used to get them. I didn’t even want to know at the time, I had enough stuff on my mind already and I hadn’t slept in far too long.
I apologize to whoever reading this if it seems that I’m dragging it out with details a bit too much here and there, I’m only taking precautions to make sure that I’m telling it right. If I’m finally going to tell my story I want it to sound right. 

My father never came home after golfing so I assumed he went directly to work, which made complete sense. It was starting to get late into the evening and I had absolutely nothing better to do than to once again sit in my room, I was trying to figure out ideas for new songs on my guitar. This time I wasn’t using the amplifier since I was legitimately scared of the noises occurring again. My amplifier has been known to pick up foreign radio broadcasts before, something that explains the distorted Russian speech last time, I wasn’t worrying about that. I was thinking about my mother showing herself again. Not that I was sure that it had anything to do with the amplifier itself.

Not too long into that night I started feeling sick of being in-doors for so long, and I felt like I could use some kind of fresh air as a vacation from all this unexplained mystery I had been experiencing. I remember being on the sane side of the fence, thinking critically and trying to find solutions, not marking everything as if it was a conspiracy from hell. I figured I’d take my bike down to a local gas station, not more than ten minutes from my house; I wanted some chips, candy and maybe a couple cans of soda. 

I scrambled together some change I found in my room and took off; I got there faster than I thought I would. It wasn’t cold outside either; it was a pretty smooth night. After grabbing some generic brand of chips, Skittles and a couple cans of coke I paid for it and left. I didn’t spend much time in the store, but apparently enough time to get my bike stolen. With no bike, feeling like a stupid idiot for not locking it I had to walk home. 

Something out of the ordinary happened after this, and I wasn’t even sure if I was seeing things at first. I was walking on this huge open road; I guess you could say it was somewhat of a country road. It was tied together with the forest behind our house. It was the type of road that didn’t have any traffic other than truck drivers, passing once every couple of hours at night. I didn’t want to believe my eyes at this point but I saw my sister standing alone wearing what you’d imagine someone coming from a mental hospital would wear. I assumed she was looking for me; she was definitely staring at me. 

I continued walking, not necessarily fearing my sister. It somehow still felt as if I had a bond with her, that she would never have done anything to hurt me. As I approached her she didn’t give me any response what so ever, she was just staring at me in a light-blue scrub-coat, looking lifeless. I had reached talking-distance; I couldn’t believe this was happening. It felt surreal, like one of those scenarios you can’t be prepared for in real life. She had started to shake a bit, I couldn’t tell if she was freezing or if she was nervous. I asked her if she was looking for me out there, and if she had escaped the hospital. She didn’t respond. I got the notion that she was slightly scared of me, as if I was a threat to her. 

After a short gap of silence I noticed that she was holding something behind her back. I got a bit worried that she had some kind of a weapon, or a blunt object to swing at me so I stepped back when I spotted it. She started to slowly bring it forth, it was a plastic bag. From the way she was holding it I could tell it wasn’t heavy, or dangerous for that matter. I withdrew the step back I took earlier and tried to peer down into the bag, then she started to stretch it out to me: “I took this from your house the other day, I’m sorry. I think this belongs to you. Jonathan.” 

I do realize that I never told you my name, it is indeed Jonathan. I was slightly astonished that she had remembered my name even; she seemed to be so out of it. I remember grabbing the plastic bag, she wouldn’t let go of it too lightly either, it was as if she still wanted it. After I had gotten whatever was in the bag we shared another brief moment of silence, she wouldn’t stop staring into my eyes during these. Then she told me to never mention any of this to our dad. Shortly after she started walking towards the forest; as if she knew where she was heading. 

I saw the headlights of a car coming straight at me and my sister, whoever was in this car was driving way ahead of the speed limit. I noticed when it started to get closer to us that it was my dad’s car, acting on impulse I threw myself into a nearby ditch, as I got to witness my dad chasing after my sister. I didn’t even know if I wanted him to catch her or not, she was purposely running away from him. He dragged her into his car and they both drove away, heading the direction he was originally going. This was the second time she had successfully escaped this mental hospital, and how the hell did my sister make it so far both times? Something wasn’t right, I knew from when I was younger that the hospital wasn’t anywhere close to where we lived since my dad sometimes was gone for ten hours upon visiting her. Of course at the time it was supposedly a special school, but that doesn’t change the logic of it. He never brought me with him whenever he visited my sister, since he kept me in the dark about the whole hospital thing.

I ran the rest of the way home, trying not to drop anything; I still had all the items I bought at the gas station. I wanted to make sure that I could get home before my dad did; I had no clue whenever he would get back, and not wanting him to find out whatever was in the bag my sister gave me. I couldn’t spot my dad’s car in the driveway so I felt relieved as I stepped into the house. I didn’t bother putting my drinks in the fridge or anything, I made my way back to my room as fast as I could. I don’t really know why but I locked the door after me, as if there was something to fear. I sat myself on the bed with all the lights in the entire room switched on. I made sure to put all the bags with snacks in them aside; as I was getting ready to dig into whatever my sister ran into the night to give me. 

I never really thought of something until now, and that is how my sister could have found me. It must have been a coincidence, or she had been following me for a while; knowing she couldn’t approach me in the store. I don’t know.

I looked into the bag, it seemed to be random belongings from the drawers in our living room, and maybe some stuff from one of the cupboards we had in the kitchen. After sorting out stuff that had no relevance what so ever, for example there was a roll of tape in there. I planned to spend more time on the more interesting items. The first thing I picked up was a small collection of family photos, most being after mom died. The next thing I could grab was a couple of rocks; they weren’t even dry, I guessed she must have gotten those just before she passed me the bag. There was only one thing left in the bag, an usb-stick. 

I took the stick out and threw away the bag. Then I started looking at the photos as I was trying to reason why she would have taken any of these from our house. The only thing that somewhat made sense is that a couple of them were from when she wasn’t sent to the hospital yet, but it was pretty much pending already. In fact, most of these photos took place a couple of weeks after our mother passed away. On one of them it’s my sister showing off her prom dress she was planning on wearing, she actually wasn’t acting too badly the first couple of weeks. I guess she didn’t process our mother’s death until later or something. Another photo is of dad’s old car, he had to sell it in order to compensate for our family’s financial depression from when we lost the main income our family had, my mother’s candle business. He loved that damn car with his entire heart; we even used to joke about how mom was jealous of the car. 

There were more photos but I stopped going through them when I realized a couple of them had a handwritten marking of the letter “x” behind them. It noticed this when I was flipping them as I was trying to get them all to be facing me. I sorted the photos with no marking away and started to focus more on the ones with the marking. I figured my sister must have had done this, for what reason I was about to find out. I kept staring at the first picture; it was the one I told you about earlier, the one of my father’s old car. It was a Pontiac from the early 80’s and it must have cost him a fortune. I never had any particular memories of the car; I remember it spending most of its time in our garage.

I kept looking at the photograph and the more I stared at it the more I started to wonder why my dad hadn’t use the car more, he obviously loved it. The photo was taken for an ad in the newspaper, for selling it of course. I was just about to put the sad photo away when I caught a glimpse of my mother sitting in the backseat. It wasn’t very clear and she seemed somewhat transparent. She had the same drained-out appearance and blank stare that she had from when I saw her in the hallway outside my room, and this was taken after her death. I couldn’t believe what I was looking at. I remember dropping the photo out of shock; so many thoughts started circling inside of my head.

dinofinger,0,,1,1rie11,,1,"    17^th May 2007.
I followed my dad went to Grandma's house. My cousin who lives with grandma, had a suspicion that something had happen to Aunt L &gt; *Her initial would be appropriate here* &lt; Aunt L was never in her sound mind but she prefer to live alone which is the best option avoiding the troubles she would cause to others. Grandma has a problem of [nagging](https://www.google.com/search?q=nagging&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a) disease which makes more Aunt L better suit live far from her lectures. 

Back again to my cousin, who received a call from Aunt L's neighbour. Her respond was *there was a sudden silent for the past four days*. Aunt L was never a social person who goes anywhere she wants and always out. She prefered to live in her tiny apartment secluded only her herself and herself she enjoys being with. But her neighbour help us to watch for her just in case for anything. So we respond to go and visit her house. My father, my cousin and I, the three of us went together with nothing held us back. 

As we arrive by the door, we knock and knock. From the window we can see noise screen from her small tv at the corner. But there was no sign of her. Somehow her grill lock and the door were changed, the key my cousin brought didn't fit at all. Maybe she doesn't want us to barge in anytime we want. My dad took the liberty to call the locksmith while giving positive thoughts to my cousin that everything was fine. 

30 minutes pass. The locksmith do his magic and opened the door. Such stench came out in full loaded right to our faces. Right in front of the door we can see Aunt L laid still in the toilet facing the floor. A 15 year old me shocked and I just watched her body in strip condition only a towel covered her other half and her faeces was right below her and all over behind her. Yet she is still alive, blinking and gasping.

My dad pull me back allowing my cousin to go in. I can still feel my father clenches my arms so tightly when he saw his sister. He said ""*[I better call the ambulance](http://www.wikihow.com/Call-an-Ambulance)*"", so he did and left. My cousin call me out to help pick her up. But she was too heavy, we can't even push her to the side. So my cousin rinse her with water to clean her off. I was told to took a towel and wipe her face. I could say her face was in a total blankness. 

25 minutes later the ambulance arrive. They took her with a stretcher. Both of us went down to send her off. I can remember certain vision of some neighbours pry on their window looking out what was happening. My dad went together with Aunt L, so left me and my cousin. Soon my mom and sister arrive bringing cleaning equipment. We spent whole 3 hours cleaning her house. Based on what I heard my cousin said ""*The man who always deliver her food got no respond from her for three days. That's when he ask the neighbour if she had gone somewhere. I bet if we were too late, she might have gone by any minute unconscious on the floor*""


    18^th May, 2013
We had her funeral in the day after the day we thought she would died 6 years ago. Funny the coincidence of the date just *one day after* we laughed. My cousin gave a speech said she was a fighter. Indeed she was. I think her life is better after that 17^th May living in the retirement home. She was more happier than before she was a shut-in.

As I was doing this, the big rocking chair next to his litter box was swaying, and I gave him a quick glance. I felt him sniff at my ear. He then jumped off the chair and walked into the kitchen. I thought nothing of it for a few seconds, then froze. ""Oliver!"", I called. I then walked to the door and looked outside, he was napping on the steps.

echoes007,4,,2,1rhee9,,2,"I’ve always been a non-religious person. I was brought up by parents who told me to question everything. To not believe the crap that is forced down our throats daily. But I’ve always felt a whole in my life when it came to that stuff. I went as far as trying LSD and DMT to achieve this “religious experience” we all want, but I never got it. So, after a while, I just gave up and moved on and accepted there is no God, or spiritual experience, or anything that’s real, that will make me see life in a whole new perspective. Naturally, this got me down and depressed a bit. It was then when I started seeing 11:11 everywhere. It started one night when I was doing some heavy drinking and decided to do some coke lines. I remember vividly, my heart stopped, and I remember a sound, like a blender going off in my head. When I forced myself to snap out of what had happened to me, I remember the first thing I looked at was the clock on the cable box. It read 11:11. This stuck with me for a long long time. I felt like some force or spirit was forcing me to look at the clock when it was 11:11 in the morning and 11:11 at night. As if reminding me that it saved my life. This was going on for a while, when I went as far as Googling what it was. Unfortunately, the 11:11 thing was associated to some spiritual stuff, things I thought were bullshit to begin with. But still, 11:11 was always there. Slowly I stopped thinking about it, and my 11:11 experiences were less and less. It wasn’t until last week when I was driving home (I was butt sober) from an event when it started raining. My tires and brakes were messed up and I didn’t get a chance to change them, and besides, it hardly ever rains in this town, so this came as a surprise to me. As I was driving up a hill, I lost control of my car completely on the wet road, and was literally fighting my steering wheel and slamming on my brakes to stop the car, but I couldn’t. This went on for about five seconds until I finally stopped the car in the middle of the road. Again, when I snapped out of my panic mode, the first thing I looked at was the time, and it said 11:11. I’m not one who believes in coincidences, but this has me thinking I have some angel or spiritual entity looking after me. Even though I don’t believe this stuff, there is NO way that could happen. Has anyone else experienced 11:11, or has randomly been “forced” to look at a clock when it’s 11:11? Or is it my brain playing tricks on me because of the LSD/DMT I took? ",11:11,4,nosleep
Jerbsybear,0,,0,1rh5g6,,2,"There are tales of a man committed to Central State

Who killed his wife and children while he asphyxiates

His doctors with the bloody spinal cord

Of his fat nurse, who cares if she was old

When the guards rushed in, it was no problem at all

bashing their brutish faces straight into the wall

Bursting through the heavy front doors

He killed everyone on the first floor

No one would stop him, no, not this time

5 years of waiting, no stopping on a dime

He had to get out on this night

To meet his lover, one at first sight

Taking his science class, year after year

Convinced that she loved him, held him dear

Called her ""favorite student"" and all

Had her parents give him a call

To invite him to dinner, on a cold winter's night

Slaughtered her family, their faces were a sight

In the judge's court, he mercilessly pleaded insanity

When, in reality, it was egotistical vanity

If he couldn't have her, no one can

To kill her new parents was the plan

Standing outside of the house that was soon to be theirs,

Looking to seek justice, to seek what's fair

So as he broke in and brandished the knife

She knew he was back to take a life

So quickly she fled into the night

Leaving behind more victims, as she took flight

She ran two miles straight to the highway

Waving for anyone to stop, to go her way

As hand grabbed her from behind the bushes

His knife drives deeper and deeper as it pushes

Past her vitals and deep into her heart

All flashbacks of her life seemed to fall apart

As he whispers ""This...feels so right""

Her mind tries to escape into the night

The fires of his greed are not yet doused

As he tries to get back to the house

He plans to take another life

While sharpening his serrated knife

""Am I next, is he coming,"" you cry with fear

InsanityInABottle,0,,1,1rgw03,,2,"“Extra, Extra! The Piggy killer is at it again!” Yelled the paperboy, holding a darkened paper above his head, screaming the same phrase over again, as if it was no big deal. I walked towards him and asked him “How much?”
“Only ten cents sir.”
“Ha. Must be a pretty good story then.” I said, as I fumbled for a large dime. I handed it into the boy’s hand, it’s gleam bouncing the light of the sun, veiled through the mist of rain into my eyes. I blinked quickly and grabbed the paper, quickly turning from the boy, hearing “How about a tip sir?”
“How about you wipe your ass with the metal I’ve already given you.” I said back to the boy, who furrowed his brow and continued screaming for new customers. As I walked along Hero’s Avenue, I kept the paper open, reading it over again. In large font, shouted “Piggy killer’s new victim!” with a picture of a woman, apparently known by the name of “Jessica Turrow.” She wore a large smile on her face, as she raised a glass of champagne above her head for a toast, I presumed.
	The article read “The psychopath, depicted as a man with a pig’s head on worn over his own face, has struck again. Witnesses described him as large, while wearing a reddened trench coat, then finally, a bib, which read the term KISS THE COOK, slathered neatly against his chest in gore. He had organs and even a human spinal cord attached to his coat and as usual, was found was mist was floating through the air and at dawn. We had identified the victim, through a ring found on the hand of the woman, who had been chopped to pieces and nailed against the side of the church. If you are to spot anyone fitting under the description, contact the police immediately, or you may be his next victim.”
	I laughed as I watched terror shrouding the faces of everybody who grasped a paper in their hands, all walking along the street as automobiles drove recklessly between one another, threading the needle on the two way street, not large enough for two cars to fit on.
	I walked towards the police station, which was cleverly located across the street from a coffee shop, a brothel and a printing office. A police car drove by; it’s loud horn sounding, flashing red and white, reflecting the light from the rain directly into my eyes. I walked into the station, the smell of fresh cigars flooding into my nose. A man screamed from across a large waiting room, looking down at the paper, then looked up and said “Oh. It’s the wonderful Flynn. Of course my dear, come, come.” I walked past him, glaring at his smug face, and then opening the door into my office.
	A man sitting on a chair for those waiting to enter my office abruptly greeted me. He smiled and said, “Well hello sir, I am Dean Osterrietch and believe I have a lead on the notorious killer”
“The pig one?”
“Y- wait, there are more?”
“I believe there are, just they might not like attention as much as our friend here.”
“Well… thanks for informing me of that rather morbid concept, but I have gotten hundreds of pictures of the killer, coming out of his lair.”
	The man pulled out a large portfolio of pictures and dumped them onto my desk, arranging them appropriately. “So, if you look at these pictures, it was for when he first got into the business, holding small weapons, all identifiable, all related to the cutting of meat. Then as you look to the left, these are the later pictures, which are of him coming out, holding bodies on his shoulders, sitting in the back of his eatery and chopping them up, putting them into boxes and looking pleased with himself, all the while in his pig mask. But, he seems to be getting careless. He cam outside, barely slipping on his mask in time for my camera to flash a photo, his face seemed veiled in… something. Something sticky, something gruesome. But if you look closer, you can quite easily see the silhouette of his face. Large, hooked nose, eyes, clouded in blue, teeth, sharpened to perfection and a dripping mouth.”
“Ha. So you’re basically implying that you’ve seen a notorious killer walk in and out of a location multiple times and not even dared to act on it? I beginning to suspect you’re the killer!”
“But that would be silly. Why would a crazy give himself away?”
“I don’t know, why don’t you tell me?”
“I believe this conversation is getting a bit heated. I saw the ad in the paper that I should contact the police and thought I’d tell you where I’ve seen such events. Have you ever seen the abandoned butchery on 1800 Bellcove Street? Well there’s your place. Sir!” said the man as he gathered his pictures and threw them into his bag, which smelled of defecation and nickels. I watched as he slammed the door, then sighed and sat down on my desk, rapidly pressing the keys of my typewriter, updating the information I’ve received from the man.
“Mysterious man visits police station, says he has a lead on the piggy killer. As you all know, the notorious killer has crossed the line now. Enough to even be called a serial killer! What a sick bastard he is.” I continued being as pessimistic as possible, updating the paper, then grabbing my camera as I finished the article. Typing in my name, finishing with my name, saying “Written by: Flynn Covetail.”
	Darkness was beginning to shroud the air, perfect night for the killer to strike in his typical environment. Light rain was spattering against my window, racing down to the bottom of the screening, only to fall against an umbrella below. As I left my office, throwing on my coat, I screamed to the man in the front desk, “Going out to…oh, let’s see...1800 Bellcove Street? If I don’t come back, Phone someone.” I said with a laugh, while walking outside.
	Instantly my boots splashed against the small walkway paved on “Western Lagoon highway” as the frivolously worthless people would say. I walked down towards the street, which was naught but four blocks from here. I passed by Dontell’s Donuts, Redgar’s Rotisserie and Salam’s Spices, all involved in the fattening of desperate cops, as only fattening diners were located near the station, so I developed a theory that every restaurant owner is against us.
	I reached the butcher’s place, which had been looted to hell by the anarchists, who were just a group of thugs that didn’t do shit to overthrow the government. The door had been pried off it’s hinges, yet now it was replaced by a veil of chains, hanging off of rusted hooks attached to the doorframe. Within the butchery, the first thing I noticed was a bed, a homeless man sleeping on it.
	I simply ignored the bum and walked around, searching for anything considered suspicious. I walked through the door, smelling the bum’s shit in the corner and closing my nostrils as well as I could. I looked through the shop, behind the counter I found several rusted knifes, which were corroded to the counter, which was a wooden rotten thing, with three cutting boards lining it, all of which nobody needed. The front of the shop seemed completely normal, but I listened to the bum waking, instantly screaming, “Who’s there! I will kill you if you’re trespassing on my property!” I laughed and screamed to him “I suggest you run out of here, or I may just have to turn you in as a key suspect for the crimes.” I heard the scuffing of his shoes against the floor, running towards me.
	I quickly turned, backing up against the wall, my sidearm pointed at the bum and screamed “GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!” I shot to the side of the man, who quickly bolted for the door, a rat following closely behind him. I sat for a minute, catching my breath, while my vocal chords seemed to scratch against one another in a uncomfortable clunky fashion. As I stood, I felt the hard callused flesh of an arm pressing against the front of my throat and the sudden feeling of something hard hitting the back of my head.








	Ha. Damn fool didn’t even know what he had coming. Shouldn’t have fucked with my grandpa… shouldn’t have yelled. My ears hurt. Are they ringing? Why the FUCK am I here? I thought a conversation to myself as I raised the man into the air, the familiar heaviness of my mask pressing against my face, the pig’s blood leaking down my neck, warming me, keeping the cold away. I looked at my setup, which was simply the back room of a butcher’s shop, a heavy steel door muffling sounds on both sides of the fifty wood wide hallway of a room.
	Blood dripped into wooden bowls I’d gotten from the shop, the bodies of fresh meat hanging from the ceiling. Pigs, cows, chickens, even a few deer, but the most stubborn of prey, the pigs. The sticky cunts hung from the ceiling, their wrists cut, their feet missing, their hands stuffed into their fucking loud mouths. The damned pigs that walked the streets, reading their stories about who? About me! The beautiful man, who is dealing righteousness to the crazies, to the rich. Though they think that they’re so safe in their leather homes, they should be the ones making chairs; their dried hides need to be a part of furniture!
	Oh, what an inventor I will be! But the best part is, nobody looks twice at the photographer. Nobody looks at who’s behind the camera; they only care about the picture! And I am finally the one in the picture! Flynn, the little anus that believed he owned the whole world, because the police were backing him up. NO, NO, NO! YOU ARE MY FUCKING BITCH!
	I whistled a tune of sorrow and greed that humans so openly express. I raise him in the air, catch a hook to his leg and strip him down to his bare neck. This self-conceited asshole needs one thing. A hook curving through the cheek, wrenched from his cheek. He thought I was the killer? NO! THAT IS NOT THE FUCKING WORD!
	Oh! My friend is waking up! Finally a new toy to play with. Oh, what a joy he will be! Oh no! What will I say to him? I guess I’ll just wing it. I guess I’ll just talk to him.  Where will I display this beauty? Ooh! The police station! Mmm, how delectable would that be? To show the pigs that even their weapons can’t defend them from me. THEY ARE GOING TO LOVE ME! I am a hero. I love being a hero and don’t try to talk me out of my heroism! I AM AMAING!








	My eyes slowly opened, to find a man in a pig mask, the rotting dreaded animal seemed to have a grin on it’s face. I was hanging upside down and fuck my leg hurts! Why does my leg hurt? Where the hell am I? “Oh… you’ve awakened!” spouted the pig; it’s squeaky voice ringing through my ears. I screamed, “Help me! Help! HE’S GOING TO KILL ME!” 
“Now that’s not how you treat a guest, is it?”
“Fuck you.”
“Oh… language, language my dear friend. If you even try saying something like that, I will cut off your cock and feed it to my friend Mr.Squeaks over here!”
	I looked to where he was pointing, which was a large column in the room, a decomposing rat nailed to the pole. “Somebody is going to catch you. They know where I am!”
“Oh, I believe they do, if only your little desk friend was there to hear what you had to say!” said the phsyco with a smile. He pointed at the ceiling, which had two hooks on it, chains hanging from them and a headless man, blood dripping in a steady stream of thickness, into a wooden bowl. “Why are you doing this to these people?”
“Okay, okay, story time. Oh yay, stories! FUCK OFF GREG, THIS IS MY TIME TO SHINE!”
	I looked at the pig with doubt, pain shooting up my leg, throbbing slowly into my brain. “SO, let me tell you why I love my job, okay? Okay. So, when I was twelve, I thought, I’m going to take pictures of weddings! I’m going to take pictures of people in love, because everyone else’s happiness, is mine.” He said this, while pinning his right hand against his heart, which contained an extra few layers of flesh, sewed against his own, along with a tattoo, stolen from his victim.
	“Okay, so anyways! What do ya know! I’m doing that now! I am a photographer! I love people being happy. SO, I one day, was at this one glorious wedding, full of lovely people. I had started talking to a woman and a little, oh what is it called? Fetish of mine was developed. As we were in bed, I took out my camera and took shots of my experience and little did I know, I have a few other… kinks. I wrung my hands around her delicate throat, stuck my finger down her throat and felt the vomit shoot from her mouth! I felt the rush as eventually, she started to fuckin’ bleed! WHAT A WHORE! She began to cough up blood, she began to wheeze and it is as these coughs echoed from her throat, landing inside of my mouth as our lips touched, did I realize how wonderful blood tastes. Rich, creamy, delicious, blood, coursing from the fountains of our decapitated stumps. I invented ways of sucking people dry, licking them dry! Well, at first I was only an amateur, but, as I got better! Oh BOY did I start to love my job! Every wedding became a slaughter, every wedding gave me a new friend, because after all, nobody cares about who’s behind the camera! NOBODY GIVES TWO FUCKING SHITS!
	So, pretty boy, I believe it’s time; you… started looking into my eyes, whenever I snap a photo of your beautiful body.” He said this as his hand slid down from my chest, slowly down to my cock, grinning, spittle flying out of his mouth as he coughed, slid a blade against it as chopped it off. I screamed out loud, blood spurting from me and all the smile he smiled, then I fell asleep, never to wake again.

ReiKoroshiya,0,,0,1rgsca,,2,"Here I am and im going to write about some of the things that go on in my life. Sorry for bombarding you with some trivial things and please just hear me out.
how about I start at the beginning that seems easier. Well back in elementary, I was that kid the kid that really no one liked. I had a friend here and there but that's about it. I was basically a social outcast, 
I never really got my work done, I still don't. Note that I was a very, very angry child and no I was not spoiled if that's what your thinking, im the oldest of 3 kids who had been and are growing up in poverty, but my father is very good at managing money which means he is very cheap.
I had shared a room with my younger brother and for some reason I never grew out of the stage where you sleep with your blankets over your head. I had always liked horror even though none of it really scared me even in elementary in the 3rd grade I found an author by the
name of R.L.Stine and I had read tons of his books which remotely captured my interests.
A few of the simple things had scared me, and I most likely have experiences that I have blocked out of my mind, I don't remember much about my childhood at all.
I don't know why I can't but that's just how it is. I do remember bits and pieces though, not anything like birthdays, mind you. Here Ile give some examples, I remember
when I thought my stuffed animal had red eyes, I freaked out a little bit called my parents and my father calmed me down and took it away. Years later I went back and found it, and of course it wasn't scary anymore. Another example
would be when I saw a ""witch"" in my closet, but again my father came in and turned the light on to show me that there was nothing there, I had clearly saw something but it was gone as soon as the light turned back on.
Once he had left and turned the light back of the figure was back again. I remember when my body shot up in bed and I let out a blood curtling scream and my parents rushed into the room
and they had tried to comfort me and to calm me down I was bawling my eyes out while hugging my father he had asked me what had happened and I was just mumbling incoherently 
about it. I can't remember what it was that had freaked me out so badly. Something else that just pokes out at me was when I was lying in bed and I hear talking so I sit up strait in bed and I see my parents right there talking to each other I couldn't understand what they were saying because they were mumbling and I said hey and they say love you simultaneously and I said aww I love you too you guys, I reached out to hug them and they both just vanished and I almost fell out of bed(I got top bunk). Then their are the things that I have learned from my family throughout the years, not much really
they don't seem to want to talk much about when I was younger. I got that I was a horrible child when they brought me to church, and that I would bite and snarl when anyone got within an arms reach of me.
keep in mind I don't remember that about going to church, as a matter of fact I don't remember going to church at all. hmmm.... well skip forward to middle school where I had
actually made friends. I did got in so much trouble in middle school its not even funny. I could barely even go a week without at least one detention. Saturday school and suspensions I had gotten a ton too, now
drugs are prevalent where I live and when I say that drugs were prevalent I truly mean that, but honestly the thought of drugs never really appealed to me well I mean
certain ones that is, the only mind altering substance that I would actually want to do, smoke, drink, etc would be alcohol cause it seems fun and really any hallucinogenic drug and there
is no way I could get ahold of hallucinogenic drugs without paying a ton of money and with my broke ass I can't afford it and because of that im drug free. Not to much
happened in middle school, only a few things I started to get hellish demonic dreams (oh and speaking of dreams I have always been able to feel pain in my dreams so if
say I was to get ran through with a spear or had my flesh pealed off in a dream I would wake up and still feel it, I also talk in my sleep) which sucks ass, The vast 
majority of my dreams became violent and with me being an avid gamer there was usually a sword nearby in my dreams and usually I could and would fight back and be home
free. I enjoyed those violent dreams where I won, even though I would battle hellish creatures and people I wouldn't consider it a nightmare. I got my own room in the basement which was nice, and well my brother he was, how do you put it? 
Gassy so yeah hot air rises and all that. Electronic malfunctions had started occurring, like waking up to my radio playing static, my alarm clock started to malfunction, etc. I remember waking up minutes before my alarm clock 
went off I awoke with a shot of electricity to my left ear. Skip forward to highschool in the 9th grade I found out what creepypasta and scp were it was amazing to find real horror for a change.
I read the hell out of creepypasta's and found some really cool narrators for them, listening to those was very enjoyable I didn't read scps often and I found a very long series called the holders.
Near the end of the year I started to feel a presence in my room which was interesting because it didn't have a bad feeling to it, the only word that comes to mind to describe it would be light if that makes any sense.
Jump forward one more year, I had flunked my freshman year because I don't do my work. On those professional tests that they make you take S.A.T's or some shit I did 
insanely good on those like I should be an A- student overall. Now i reside in alternative ed. Im 15 right now. I declared to my parents that im agnostic instead of
Baptist a few months ago. Anyway that presence in my room i hardly feel it anymore and now there is something more sinister and not just in my room anymore.
That thing I actually saw it, I fucking saw it, it was short like about a foot and a half tall. I went to bed last night and you know how earlier I had said I sleep
with my blankets over my head. Well I was moving around under the covers and I glanced out underneath the covers and there it was just staring at me a few inches away 
from my face I had to resist not to punch it because half of me was saying its just my imagination and the other half says that if its real  then im going to freak the fuck out and well I never did hit it and its creepy as fuck that its been watching me. I tried to calm my breathing as to not alert it to the fact that I have seen it I
think it knows I saw it because I have been getting glances of it all day. It might have seen me and it might be watching me type this.
It is very short and I can never manage to see any features on its face it just looks dark like a shadow its really, really dark, everything distorts when I look at it like my depth perception gets thrown off and space distorts around it.

highchairchildren,3,,1,1rgqmu,,2,"I'm looking for any input. If anyone has had experiences like this, is there a way to stop it?

So this started about two years ago. In the beginning it was just a perpetual bad feeling, like something bad was going to happen all the time.  I was anxious, always alert and never at rest. I hardly slept, primarily keeping myself awake in order to feel safer. 

Then, I started seeing things.

When I say seeings things I don't mean like hallucinations, well not really. I'm not crazy. There were never any voices and there never have been. It was more like a blackout moment in which the worst possible scenario for my environment would play out seemingly right before my eyes. 

Mostly accidents.  It happened once while I was sledding.  The hill was a steep drop and then inclined back up about 20 ft. or so where it met a busy road. Usually people lost momentum and slid back down the hill and came to a rest in the valley but sometimes, people would make it all the way up and hit the metal road block that was put up along the hill. A watched as a kid went down the hill and then it happened. I continued to watch as he went all the way back up the hill and under the metal road block right into the speeding car that was passing by. There was blood everywhere. I snapped back to reality and looked around. Everything was fine. There was no blood, nobody was hurt, just kids sledding around having fun. 

I continued to have random ""visions"" for the entire year. They varied in severity. The worst one left me shaken for a few days afterwards.  I was home babysitting my younger sisters and boiling pot of spaghetti for dinner.  I moved to the sink to strain the pasta and then went back to turn off the electric stove.  My little sister approached me to ask a question and then I had my flash.  As I was seeing it, I grabbed her by her hair and pressed her face into the stove. In that moments I watched as her eyes rolled around in her head and she screamed, begging me to stop.  I snapped back and couldn't speak. I teared up and thought I was going to puke.  I ran to the bathroom, washed my face, sat down on the ground and cried. I had never felt such a mixture of fear and remorse in my life. I got up and reentered the kitchen, finished dinner and continued the night as if nothing happened.  She asked me what was wrong and I played it off as a bout of sickness.  I sat awake for hours that night and I still couldn't come up with a reason for why this kept happening to me.  I asked my mom to see a psychiatrist but unfortunately it was a luxury we simply couldn't afford. 

Then it stopped. As quickly as it came in it left and I had no more of an idea about what it was than I'd had before.  It stayed away for a while. I mean really a long time.  I was vision free for an entire year.

I was prompted to write this because I had another one the other.  The first in over a year but I am scared. I don't want it to start again.  The most recent one was more subtle.  I was shaving in the shower went as I brought the razor up my leg, somehow or another I cut myself and there was blood everywhere.  The tub was washed red with it and there was nothing I could do but stand and watch as it oozed out of my leg and swirled around in the water before going down the drain.  Then I flashed back and it wasn't there. I hadn't even cut myself.

I know this must sound crazy, like some Final Destination bullshit.  I swear to you I wouldn't have posted it if I didn't have hopes that someone could help.  Any input is welcomed.",Can anyone help?,3,nosleep

You might remember my journal entries from last month. Last month, I can't believe it's been that long. Days and weeks run now in an endless loop. Where I am now time doesn't matter. It's a nuisance, it's a hinderance. 

A lot has happened. I just wanted to let those who cared, who reached out to me, know that I am alive. Very much so. And I have met some friends. Real human beings. There is so much I want to tell you. So much I want to explain. But I can't. Not now. 

Just know that the monster under your bed is real. That shadow in the closet exists. And those voices, the voices you hear in the dead of the night are not your imagination. All your life you have been told horror stories. And now you seek them out, on this subreddit. To be entertained, to be thrilled. But these stories exist for a reason. Every story has a truth. A small bit of reality wrapped around trigger words and exaggeration. 

That truth is what lurks in the shadows of your house, just at the corner of your eye. The truth is what is waiting for you when you close your eyes to sleep, hoping for a peaceful night's rest. But nothing is peaceful in the dark. Where the light is eclipsed by the slithering, rotting presence that knows you oh so well. One day you'll know. You will wake up and know. All those stories. All those scary tales. All those fears.

Are real.

bass_slapper,0,,2,1rh8lh,,0,"*You think me cruel. No. I’ve only learned to act on what I’ve been given. I’ve learned to deal with my problems in my own way. No one understands this but me it seems. This is for ME, I don’t do it for them. But they can’t understand my need. He can’t either. I must make me. Make him understand. How did he get here? I wish I came back. I want him back. WHY WON’T I COME BACK WHY IS HE HERE ARE YOU SORRY ARE YOU SORRY ARE YOU SOR-*

Past this the note is unreadable, spewed with a fluid I can only assume is meant to go on the inside of people. Not that I’d really want to read much more anyways. I already know what happens. Well, not really “know”, but I can feel it. Who wrote it? I can only assume it was my dear Uncle Drewson, if he’s even my uncle. What is this? No clue. A note, obviously, but beyond that speculation reigns. Where did I find this? My new house, in a drawer. Nothing is inherently terrifying about that – Oh, except that it was under the clothing I had already packed there. I just missed it before, I keep telling myself. I half believe it. A few pills later and I’m not worrying about it anymore.

Before this, I didn’t even know I had an Uncle Drewson, let alone that I was to inherit his estate in the event of his untimely, but now enacted, demise. With a heavily estranged family, growing up in between various friends or close relatives passed around by uncaring parents looking to shirk responsibility, one loses track of aunts and uncles. It was in a familiar neighborhood, a spacious three bedroom, so I was in no way eager to turn it down. As a poor, regularly unemployed person I’d been accustomed to sleeping on generous friends floors in the all too often occurrence I couldn’t afford anywhere else. I thought, it’ll all be worth it one day, the day I make it in the world. I can pay all these people back tenfold. “The day I make it”, yeah right. A consistent – and more pressingly, free – living space was a welcome antonym to my recent fortunes. So I was moved in within a couple weeks. Absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened. Till that note seemed to start some kind of vicious domino effect on my life, I was content.

You know when you think back to something embarrassing, stupid, or otherwise shameful act you may have done in your younger, brasher days? Once you recall it, it starts eating away, regret seeping in to every corner of your thoughts, till you would give the world to go back and change it, or at least erase the memory. Imagine that, only you can’t remember what it was you’ve done. It’s simply gone from you. The more you try, the less you realize. The less you realize, the more you regret. The more you regret, the more you try. That’s what’s happening to me, ever since I moved here. But it even goes past that. It’s the sudden feeling you’re being watched from barely out of sight. And at the same time, a crushing loneliness in that feeling. I pop a few more pills. Of course, I’m not being watched. There’s no one else here. If you think you’re being rather clever, figuring this out, oh-no-someone’s-been-in-the-house-with-you-all-along, I was most certainly the only one here. Anyway, this was about the time I found the note. If it was this Drewson, what is he talking about? Who does he want back? What is his need? Do I even want to know the answer to any of these? Insatiable curiosity will ensure I do, personal preference notwithstanding. Putting it all to the back of my mind, I chop up steak for dinner. I like to think of myself as a fairly accomplished chef, particularly where matters of slicing and/or dicing are concerned. I once worked a sushi bar, as a side job to pay the bills, and was quite proud of my ability to launch various morsels into the air and sever them in two with one fell swipe, like you see in commercials. Until the day my knife slipped and nearly skewered a customer’s eyeball. Maybe I’m not quite as proficient as I thought… I grab the bottle of pills and take a few. I don’t really like thinking about that time in my life.

I’m digging through my drawer later, that same drawer, when I stumble upon another discovery. Instead of a clue, it only deepens my mystery. A USB stick is secured to the very back of the board. I carefully remove it, and spend a few minutes simply gawking at my find, my inner curiosity again sparring with my better senses. I think, this will perhaps answer some questions about the note, and hopefully clear up my imaginations conjuring brought on by its conclusion’s implications. As per your previous assumptions, I couldn’t be farther from the truth. I secure the stick in its dock. View files. Two folders: “Reminders” and “Media”. Reminders is empty, media contains one subfolder: “Vids”. I open the folder. Two more: “memories” and “triggers”. Memories is empty. I open triggers. I’m confronted with one video file: shotinthedark.wmv. It’s 0:40 long. I press play.

Before I continue, if you’ll permit me one aside to validate the severity of this. I’m a massive horror movie fan, and I like them brutal. The more blood and guts, the better. I like truly graphic, heart wrenching stuff, and I very rarely squirm at it. Three seconds into shotinthedark.wmv and I rushed over the trash can to puke what felt like my very soul out. The scene I’m immediately confronted with was a man on a chair wearing nothing but an undershirt and briefs. There is a single light source on the chair, but I can faintly make out a figure in the background. Then, without a word, the man’s brains are ejected out his face, accompanied with a thunderous bang. Bone and cartilage spew forth in the foreground. Nearly black red sludge runs down his white undershirt, accompanied with brain matter that had just been crackling with life, likely flooded by fear, but life. I don’t have too much time to process anymore; I’m preoccupied with regurgitating my expertly made steak into the wastebasket. I think, it must be fake, but I know it’s not. I’ve got to tell someone about this, I think, the police, someone. Yeah, I’ll talk to the cops. Then, over my subsiding retching, I hear a familiar voice utter “Are you sorry now?” in the tone of a disappointed parent talking to their disobedient toddler. Something in that voice is chilling. Something… I return my gaze to the computer screen, where the barely visible figure now stands in full view, smiling.

I recognize the smile too.

It’s me, smiling back at myself, gripping a smoking sawed off.

The computer screen goes black. My head spins. I lie down.

youngsterjose42,1,,5,1rge20,,1,"He woke up in the morning like every other day. Yet this day was different; Jordan was going back to school after being expelled last year. He was caught with drugs and his school wanted nothing to do with it. He moved, now resides in york, Pennsylvania and now goes to William Penn High. He moved to a house which was quite old and just had some renovations a while back. The rent was quite cheap so his mother said ""why not?"". I was one of Jordan's first friends, since moving to york he told me things about that house really strange things. He soon moved away a little after I moved away so I have no idea where he is now. If any of you happen to live in york I'm talking about the old burned down house on market street across the street from the kindergarten/daycare. This story takes place about 2 years before the house burned down. 

A month since school started and about two weeks since I started talking to Jordan he invited me over to his house. Jordan said ""cmon dude come and stay the night my moms gone and im pretty sure wont give a shit"". So I thought why not I haven't spent the night at a friends house in a while ""yea sure ill spend the night man"". We went around town skated for a while, went to McDonald's with a few other friends then it came around 10 or maybe 11 everyone was ready to go home and i was ready to just go to a place and chill, play video games, and maybe eat some more. We got to his place, sat down in the living room, and lit up a blunt. Playing grand auto 3, high off our asses, we ordered some pizza. We ate and everything was fine till I felt like heading over to the bathroom. As soon as I opened the door I notice under the sink there was like a small cabinet and the doors slammed shut. I was high so I didn't really questioned it much. I used the bathroom and then as I exit I suddenly hear a giggle coming from under the sink. A child's giggle, as if there was a kid under the sink playing hide'n'seek or something. Again I did not question it because I was high and didn't really wanna bother finding out what made the noise. Jordan passed out on the couch, I went to his room and tried to sleep on his bed. I remember waking up around four in the morning hearing footsteps and a child giggling I'm pretty sure it was a little boy. I couldn't really tell his age but he was young; I would guess around six or seven. He was running around the house and he stopped at the door I did not see him, I only ever got to see his outline. He said "" I'm really happy I got more friends to play with now"". Suddenly after that he vanished faster than I could blink. I didn't sleep for the rest of the night. I had goosebumps for a good 30 to 45 minutes. Eventually I  calmed myself down by eating pizza and watching TV.",Hide 'N' seek,6,nosleep

Mindlesssavage,4,,9,1rhawv,,0,"I have a Where's Wally book. Well, had. Why? I'll tell you.
So I was just searching for Wally at night like I usually do, and I heard a noise.
It was sort of a scratching noise, scratching with a walking cane maybe.
I went to investigate. I went out of my room and...
Nothing.
Maybe it was just me. I went back to my bedroom door. I saw something written on really drippy red paint.
It said ""Find me if you can"". I thought it was just my little brother Mike painting on the walls again. ""Where was Mike anyway?"", I thought. Then I remembered he was outside playing with our pet dog Molly. ( Don't ask me why he was playing in the dark, because I have no idea).
I went inside my room. That's when I saw it. The book was lying on the ground open. I picked it up. This is what the title said:
""yllaW s'erehW"" Now THIS was weird. I also saw the same Wally picture except his eyes were gone and blood was dripping from them.
It was possessed, I thought. I ran outside to bury it, and I stepped on something. It sounded like it was glass because I heard it shatter.
I looked down.
A pair of broken, black rimmed glasses. I ignored it and ran even faster than before.
I ran to my dog Molly's kennel. I always feel safe when she's with me.
She was whining in the corner. That was typical, though. But wasn't she playing with Mike? I shouted out, ""Mike! Mike! Can you hear me?""
No replies.
I ran to the middle of the yard to bury the book.
I stepped in another thing. It was squishy, and slimy.
I looked down.
Blood. Blood and guts.
And Mike.
Lying on the ground.
Stomach open.
With a walking cane through his heart.
I wanted to cry, but then I saw a little Post-It note on the cane.
A poem.
This is what it said:
""I can run, and I can hide.
Tear you apart from the inside.
Waiting in the darkness, with my cane.
Used to be for children, now insane.
Red and white, in the grey fog.
Running around with my little pet dog.
With my girlfriend Wenda, with her camera,
And an old man with a white beard.
The prisoner who escaped from jail, murdering people with no fail.
That's my gang, with no doubt.
When you're in with me, there's no way out.""
This was way too bad to just BURY. We had to set it on FIRE. Or RIP IT APART. Just destroy it in whatever way I could.
So now in my backyard, a grave for Mike, some burnt and ripped pages, shattered glasses, and a walking cane.
And to this day, I never read another Where's Wally book again.
And every night, I still hear the sound of a scratching walking cane against my bedroom door.

kimmiekissies,13,,29,1rgt5c,,122,"I never even met him, I didn't know his name or face. I was, blissfully unaware, of his very existence.

 I will never know why, or when it started. I'm glad for that I guess. I moved into my very small apartment in February last year. My landlord, Olivia, was a sweet older woman who would cook to much and bring me much appreciated leftovers. She was great to me, even after telling her my problem. I'm antisocial, but she didn't mind renting to a reclusive young girl who reminded her of her daughter.

 Every few weeks she would knock on my door then leave, letting me know she was leaving something for me. I loved that. Not even my family would cook so well. The next morning I wash and leave her empty containers outside my door and by an hour or so she would take them back again. My other neighbors seemed fine, but I never talked or visited with them.

 I work from home so anytime I ever was forced to go out I rushed out and into my apartment avoiding an, uncomfortable situation. I loved living alone, it was everything I hoped for. I could just, breathe. By April though, I started noticing things were not right. They were moving, or plain disappearing. I was convinced it was just anxiety caused by my new medication and the move, another side affect was it would make me so drowsy. Since I hated seeing the doctor I just dealt.

 I took naps during the day now and eventually stopped caring. Until one incident doubled my paranoia, Olivia brought me some sort of greek tossed salad and dressing for lunch one day and I enjoyed it with my friend netflix. I fell asleep in the middle of Portlandia, and woke up that evening at 5pm. Per usual, what was not usual was my bedding on the opposite side of me was disturbed. I only sleep on the right side. Always. Even more it felt.. *warm.* My first thought was I must have rolled around a lot, but I knew it was to odd to dismiss. 

I got up and searched my apartment gripping my phone with 911 typed in. Nothing else was disturbed, everything was exactly like it should be. I let it go, for the next few weeks everything was normal pardon the occasional misplaced shoe or drawn back shower curtain. I thought about telling someone, my parents, maybe Olivia, but if it's not life or death I am not reaching out to anyone. 

I wasn't scared, I was nervous, maybe a little stubborn.. But I stayed. I am not letting some stupid anxiety ruin my lovely lonely world.
 May came and It was getting worse. My panties, toothbrush, hell even my food was being misplaced. Every time I woke up there was this strange odor in the air. I finally realized this won't go away by ignoring it. I called my mom and begged to come stay a few days, when I got home I told them everything. Saying it out loud solidified any creepy suspicions. 

That weekend my dad went to my apartment and what was found was true horror. Written all over that walls: ""COME BACK"" ""BABY PLEASE"" He ran out and called the police. There was no one living in my apartment but someone definitely had access besides me. 
The investigation revealed a man, Henry, the son of my landlord Olivia, was in a projected relationship with me.

 They showed me his confession on tape. He admitted coming into my apartment every night and everyday with his mother's extra key. He claims we were in love and he had my permission. He drugged his mother's food she left out for me causing my drowsiness and falling asleep so he could come in and watch me sleep, touch my hair, kiss my shoulder. The leftovers I had in the fridge were tested and confirmed.
 I was absolutely, horrified and disgusted. A man, I never knew existed, collected my drain hair, clothes, and trash and practically lived in my apartment for *four months.*

Thanks to everyone for your responses, I have taken a lot of your advice.
I'll just give you all a quick update on what happened after I posted yesterday. She ended up having a nap after sitting in front of the TV for a few hours. I was going to walk our dog, Zeus, but I decided to wait until she woke up just in case she woke up and was confused.


She woke up after a couple of hours and was.....well. Happy. Really, really happy. Almost manic. She woke up full of beans, and smiling like a maniac. I was initially relieved. I asked would she like to come for a walk with Zeus and I and she happily agreed. We set off for our normal walk, and she was extremely energetic, bounding off in front of Zeus and I. Zeus is a Labrador, and although he is a big boy, he's still a pup. We usually just meander along on these walks while he sniffs at everything along the way. But she set a cracking pace and Zeus and I struggled to keep up. 


We got up to this park where we usually let him off his lead for a while as we're trying to train him to not run off on us and to be sociable. It's always been a real task getting him back on the leash though, he never ever comes when he's called. Anyway, we let him off, and he's running around and smelling everything and peeing on anything that stands still long enough. My wife, she's picking flowers and sniffing them, and singing. She gets on the swings at the park and I push her for a bit, as she sings under her breath. I was feeling quite content at this point. Figured she must have just been over tired.


She's swinging vigourously when all of a sudden she comes to a dead halt. She yells, in an almost unfamiliar, masculine voice, ""Zeus! Here!"" and points in front of her feet.


I stood in disbelief as I watched Zeus, the most disobedient rascal of a dog I know, solemnly trot over to where she's pointing, sit in front of her, and stare up into her face. They both sat there for a split second, very still, looking at each other. I picked my jaw up off the floor and asked her ""Um..what the hell! How did you manage that!"" and that seemed to break both their concentration and Zeus shot off like a bat out of hell again, and she started swinging again - ""Oh"" she said, ""I used my mind to call out to him...it's something new I learned..""
She seemed kind of sheepish about it to be honest. I pressed her for more details, but the more questions I asked the more defensive she got. She knows I don't believe that for a second. I'm just happy that Zeus is finally starting to be trained. That's really the only explanation. I asked her to do it again but she refused, so I think we both know it was a fluke.


The rest of the afternoon was....nice. Kind of odd. It's like there's something that's amiss. Like when you walk into your messy bedroom and you can tell that *something* is not how it should be but you can't pin point what.


We talked a bit about the seminar. She said that it was very intense. The days were very long. She said that the premise of the seminar is to get to the root of any emotional upset, to explore the root causes for what's going on in your life. I asked if any hypnosis was used, as suggested by you guys, and she said no. They talked a lot, and were assigned to small groups, and encouraged to open up and explore their ""inner beings"". She said she felt a lot better since attending.
Still, something was not quite right. For instance, we were talking about my sister who lives in another state, and how she had recently got a new job. A few minutes later, my phone rang and it was her. I picked it up and said ""Emma! Speak of the devil..."" and my wife smashed me up the side of the head, causing me to drop the phone and shouted ""Emma is NOT the devil!! How could you say that!!! Emma is NOT THE DEVIL!!"" I told Emma I would call her back and tried to get my wife to calm down. She was very upset at what I had said. She sort of went silent again, and was very still. She seemed rather annoyed at me, but by this point, I was nearing exhaustion myself, so I let her be.

She fell asleep early, about 8pm, on the couch. I covered her with a blanket, and noticed that her eyes are kind of half opened..... I used to have a friend who slept like that at school and I've never noticed it before, I think that in my state of hyper vigilance, I am being overly perceptive of small details.
 
I read more of my original post, and all your comments, and decided to step outside and call our therapist, just to find out more about the seminar, as I knew she was there assisting.

I walked out onto our back porch and lit a cigarette and rang her. She answered on my first ring. What she said has really weirded me out. Only because although she gave me a lot of information, she has raised many more questions, as well as answered them.
 
She said these seminars are more like interactive workshops run by a man named Brian and his wife Linda, who are both self-appointed ""psychotherapists"". She said that there are psychologists such as herself on stand by to assist because sometimes when people are in such a vulnerable state, they may need assistance. She said she has referred a lot of her client's to attend these workshops and has found them to be helpful in most cases.
 
Basically, the course is about discovering your inner self, and using different methods to connect to your inner voice, to find out what the cause of your worries are. She said that it is incredibly demanding and intense. Each session goes for 14 hours with only an hour break. During these sessions, many different activities and topics are explored, including, regression. Apparently Brian does this 3 hour session on the second last day, where he gets everyone to meditate, and be still, and he regresses them back to childhood, or even, in some extreme cases, past lives. Our therapist said, it was so intense that she had to fight from being regressed herself. She did make comment that she had been concerned initially about how my wife would handle that, but that she seemed ""brighter, had a clarity about her"" after this experience. They discussed what my wife had gone back to, in her mind, and the therapist was happy that it hadn't caused her any great distress, but reminded me she couldn't discuss the specifics. She said when she wakes tomorrow I could gently try and open the lines of communication with her and she may explain her ""experience"".
 
I told her about my wife's strange behaviour. She said it is normal to be a little out of sorts after one of these sessions, but nothing major. I don't know if it's just me, but I could sense a tiny bit of alarm in her voice.... I don't know, maybe I imagined it. She said to call her if there's any further problems.
 
I hung up, and as I was putting out my cigarette, I turned to go inside and my wife's standing there staring at me. I jump and say ""Jesus Christ honey you scared me!"" and she replied ""Not as fucking much as I'm going to scare you.""
 
Ummm ok. I had to physically turn her and direct her into the house. In the moonlight she almost looked like a stranger to me. Her long blonde hair was hanging in her face, and her face was fixed in this awful scowl. I figured she must still be pissed at me from before. I put her to bed and she goes back to sleep.
 
And, well, that's where she is now.... she was supposed to be off work today too, but I was meant to go back to my job. But when my alarm went off, I just had this weird feeling that I should stick around and make sure she was ok. I rang in sick for work, and I'm just doing some household jobs, waiting to see if she's better when she wakes up, and googling what regression means, and what these intense emotional exercises can do to someone. Still nothing that convincing though. I dont know. Maybe I'm *too* skeptical. I just don't believe this crap.

The whole thing sounds a bit stupid to me, if I'm honest. But I have to say, it has caused some kind of change in my wife. She is very extreme in her emotions at the moment, and I'm worried, because we both have to go back to work tomorrow, and her work environment is very proper. She is always a perfect employee, and very dedicated to her work. I can't help but feel concerned that she might wake up tomorrow and still be in this....mood. Do you guys know anything about this ""regression""....is it the same as hypnosis? She was adamant she wasn't hypnotised, but it sounds like it to me!!



EDIT: Ok now I'm getting really freaked out. I went to check on her and she was talking and singing her sleep. I can't quit work out what song she's singing I've never heard it before. But she's saying something about being someone called Azara or something??? It's really fucking unnerving it doesn't even sound like her. Ill try and get a recording and see if you guys can shed some light. 


EDIT TWO: Ok I managed to record a bit of it...she's singing but I don't know what, has anyone heard this before????????? Ignore the TV in the background I was watching it in the lounge room to drown her out, and it was really unnerving when I turned it off and all I could hear was her. I'm kind freaked out now, I'll admit it. [Here it is](http://soundcloud.com/user165636719/a0ynmqy5tete/s-jECMW)",UPDATE!!! Need some advice.

floydnimrod,21,,25,1rhxtb,,113,"I'd just come from church for some reason. I'm not sure why I'd gone into the church, but it was the weirdest service I'd ever been too. Everybody was there. It was a packed house. Rich people, poor people, criminals, middle class folk. It was all people who didn't normally go to church. I looked into the coat room as I walked in, and some guy was snorting cocaine on this little counter top. Right in a church. I was like, what the hell? I've never see that.

I sat in a pew, and looked up. There was no minister. They were just playing a movie of an old church service on the screen. Some little old lady was playing a hymn on an organ, and the minister was applauding her. She seemed happy. But the audience was restless, not really paying attention, not sitting down, just kind of wandering around, talking to everybody. 

And then I saw a woman I used to know, someone I worked with years ago. I went to sit down next to her, and she sort of jumped on my lap and hugged me, saying she was so glad to see me. I wasn't sure if she was sad, or drunk, or terrified, or just lonely, but she whispered in my ear, offering me sex, saying she's always wanted me, ever since she'd known me. I sort of pushed her off my lap, thinking this was hardly the place for that kind of cheap pick-up. And then I got up and walked out. There wasn't really a church service going on anyway, I don't even think it was Sunday.

And then for some reason, I was in a car with this old lady. I don't even know who it was, or why I was with her. She was old like my grandma Freddie, but it wasn't her. We were driving down the street. She was driving too slow because she was kind of lost. I don't think I was in Winnipeg I was on a large street, almost the size of Portage with several lanes. But they all seemed to be deserted, like very early on a Sunday morning. I'm not sure if it was early in the morning or near sunset, but the sun was low in the sky. I think it was late in the day. The streets were mostly clear though.

The lady pulled over and for some reason she got out of the car. I think she was going to ask somebody for directions. I looked at the GPS thing she had on her dashboard, and suddenly the direction went all fuzzy and scrambled, like the satellite was confused, or just no longer there. And then the whole sky got this weird greenish tint to it for about ten seconds. It basically turned green instead of blue, but only for a moment, and then it was back to normal. Everybody stopped and looked up.

I was still in the car, but I leaned forward and looked out the window. The sun was over in the west, low in the sky. And I saw what looked like a second moon fly over the sky in a direction that was diagonal to the sun's normal path. It was huge. And my stomach got queasy for a moment. It made your stomach sick because it was so big, it actually pulled on you with its own gravity, like the moon pulls on the tides, but much bigger, and everything inside you just got tugged around.

But it went straight across the sky, without hitting. When I realized how close it was, though, I knew it was gonna hit somewhere, probably on the other side of the world. The gravity of the earth pulled it in, and it sling-shotted around to the other side somewhere. I jumped out of the car and grabbed the old lady's arm.

""Come on! We have to find shelter! It's gonna hit!"" 

We just abandoned the car in the street, and I dragged her toward a nearby fire station, or hydro office, or whatever it was. I'm not sure which it was, but there were large utility trucks, with lifts on them. It was also deserted for some reason, except for two guys loading one of the trucks. We banged on the doors, but it was locked up. We ran from door to door trying to get in, but everything was locked. 

And then I felt a great rumble under my feet. It nearly knocked me down. I've never been in an earthquake, so I don't know what it's like, but it felt like the entire planet shivered. Car alarms started going off in every direction and I heard a weird sound like gravel tumbling down a hillside, except there were no hills. I think it was pieces falling off houses in all directions. We were able to stay on our feet though. 

A few moments later, the sky in the north went dark. If I assume the sun was setting in the west, and the meteor or asteroid or whatever flew over the sky in a north-west to south-east direction, then it was north the black came from. And I mean the entire sky. Like a wall of blackness, smoke and ash suddenly filling the view from the ground to the upper atmosphere, from west to east as far as you could see, in one huge wall of black cloud. And it was coming toward us. Well, sort of going towards everyone, everywhere, I guess. It came over the horizon like an charging army, fast and steady, advancing.

""It hit on the other side of the world somewhere! Come on! we have to get indoors! We won't be able to breathe!""

The air started turning yellow. Ash started raining down, and bits of rock and debris from the blast, where ever it hit. I took a deep breath and held it as I was running. I could already smell a weird burning rock smell, like sulphur, like burnt matches, but more metallic. 

Me and the lady finally got into some doors, but it was just a little foyer. We ran in and shut the doors behind us. The inside doors were locked. But it was somewhere to hide. There was a fire alarm. I pulled it, not really knowing why I was bothering. But I was sort of in a panic and not thinking straight. The sign said, In Case of Emergency, so I pulled it. The alarm went off, and we looked out the window. The yellow air turned brown, and then dark red. Then everything went black. The black cloud fell over the whole sky with a clattering rumble that sounded like it was raining gravel instead of water. And all light went out of the world.

The world as we knew it was over. Even if we survived, life as we know it would never be the same. We'd be set back 10,000 years, reduced to hunter gatherers again, living out of caves. If we survived the impact that is. I honestly don't think anybody would have survived the shockwave. Something with that much gravity hitting the earth would pretty much end the story for everybody.

Charlies_friend,20,,9,1rhapg,,79,"A friend of mine posted a story here not too long ago, and he was pretty well received by your wonderful community, so I decided to create an account to share mine.


When I was a little girl, about nine years old, my family purchased a small ranch in western Kansas. My father had just gotten out of the Army, and I suppose after seven years of trotting around the world, and spending two of those years in active combat zones, my dad just wanted to go somewhere the world would leave him alone. He couldn't have found a better location for this purpose; anyone who's ever followed Interstate 70 westward through that area knows, there isn't much between Topeka and Denver.

I still remember the day we (my mom, dad, older sister and I) moved into that old ranch house. It had been built in the early 1900's, and being something of a history buff, I was pretty excited to live in a house that had stood through prohibition, the depression, both world wars, and everything since. The house itself sat at the bottom of a small incline from the main road, backed literally into a hill. This setup meant the back half of the home sat underground, buried in the hillside. Outside the house was a little grassy yard area, and across this yard was an old barn. We didn't have any horses, but my dad held a particular love for classic cars, and he turned that barn into an amateur autoshop where he worked refurbishing old cars from the junk yard in his spare time.

My sister and I were given seperate but adjoining rooms upstairs, while my parents took the master bedroom (oddly) on the first floor. My sister and I's rooms opened onto a sort of landing that looked out over the living room and kitchen, and the stairs led down from there.

It was only our second or third night in the house, that I began to notice some strange things occurring. I was unable to sleep one night, and I laid awake in bed long after I heard my parents and sister go to bed. The house was incredibly quiet, both from being in the middle of a very isolated area, and by virtue of being half buried. Just as I was reaching the half-sleep state...........SLAM! I heard a door downstairs slam shut. At first I tried convincing myself I had just dreamed it, but I couldn't make myself believe that. And the next thing I heard chilled me to my core. I heard footsteps coming up the stairway. I could tell from the sound that the individual must be wearing shoes, so it probably wasn't my parents coming up to check on me. I heard the steps reach the top of the stairs, and then begin down the landing. I was frozen with fear when I heard them arrive outside my door, pause for a moment, and then continue on. When the stranger was apparently in front of my sisters room, he paused again, and again he continued. He reached the far end of the landing, and then turned around and came back the way he came. He continued for what seemed like an eternity, pacing around outside my sister and I's rooms. I finally worked up some nine-year-old courage and crawled to the door. I could still hear footsteps coming from just outside. I waited until he was moving away from me, and I was between him and the stairs, planning on making a mad dash for my parents room when his back was turned. I barely cracked open the door and looked out, and saw....nothing. The footsteps had stopped, and the whole house was empty, and still. I was confused, and afraid, but even then I knew if I ran to my parents they would think I was nuts. So I slid a chair in front of my door and crept into bed. A minute later the footsteps started again, back and forth, all along the landing. Eventually, they lulled me to sleep. 

I didn't mention the noises that night to anyone, fearful of my parents thinking I was a whacko, and of being made fun of by my sister. But, over the next few weeks, everyone in my family began to notice strange happenings on our ranch. Objects moved on their own. Small things would disappear for days, only to be returned exactly where they'd gone missing from. It was what I guess you'd call typical poltergeist activity; nothing harmful or malevolent, just noises here and there and odds and ends moving around. And practically every night I heard those footsteps outside my room. 

My family eventually began referring to this entity as ""Charlie"". He seemed to be a harmless ghost, and sometimes downright helpful. Occasionally my parents would wake early in the morning for work, only to find a freshly brewed pot of coffee waiting in the kitchen. The coffee maker had no automatic timer. Sometimes when one of us had misplaced something, like car keys or the like, we'd search the house frantically only to turn around and find what we'd been searching for laying on the ground behind us. And sometimes Charlie would slam a door, or walk around loudly, or turn a sink on, seemingly just to let us know he was there. And always, those footsteps at night.

Charlie always seemed particularly active in my dad's auto shop. My dad would occasionally find car parts he'd been working on had been tinkered with, despite the fact that he was the only one who ever went in there. Sometimes tools would go missing, only to be returned a short time later. Once my dad came in from his shop one evening as white as a sheet. When we asked what was wrong he just said ""Charlie was walking around out there........Jesus, I thought you all were just hearing things!"". I wasn't sure why Charlie loved that shop so much, but incidentally, that was where I caught my first sight of him. It was a Saturday, and my Dad was hard at work putting together an old Chevy Fleetline. My mom mad him a sandwich as a working lunch, and asked me to take it to him. I eased open the barn door, and saw my dad seated at his work bench, his back to me. And I saw another man, next to the car, also out of my dad's field of vision. He was about 5'8"", with dark hair and eyes. He was dressed in what looked like typical 1930's clothing; black slacks, a pinstripe vest over a grey work shirt, and topped off by a brown ""paper boy"" hat, cocked to one side. He looked right at me for a second, a big, mischievous grin on his face, and then he simply disappeared. I didn't even realized I was still holding my dad's sandwich and continued to stare at the spot Charlie had stood until my dad snapped me back to reality.

So passed the next few months. My family was happy on our little haunted ranch, Charlie seemed happy enough to share the space with us, and life was good. And his nightly vigil outside my room began to seem almost comforting. One night in late November, however, I learned just how utterly terrifying Charlie could be.

My dad had some kind of dinner event for work in Topeka, almost two hours away, and since my Sister was almost 16 by then, and there was virtually no crime in our rural area, my parents figured we would do fine by ourselves until they returned the next morning. Of course, to my sister and I, it meant we could stay up as late as we wanted, watch scary movies, all the kid stuff you can't do with your parents around. At around midnight, I was in my Sister's room with her watching some movie on her TV, when we heard a loud CRASH from the living room. My first thought was that it was Charlie, playing another prank, by this felt different somehow. Charlie's noises were simply little bumps to remind you he was home. But this noise sounded violent, and angry. Before I could really react, we heard another loud crash, and another. My sister cautiously peeked out of her door, and down into the living room. I swear I saw her go white. She began trembling, and her hand covered her mouth. I peeked around her to see what she saw, and felt y blood run cold. We could just barely see two men, outside our from door. One of them was kicking it in. As we watched, a final smash from this man caused the door jam to give out, and they both entered our home, shining long flashlights all over. My sister and I crawled under her bed, and held each other tight. This was easily the most terrified I have ever felt. 

But as the two men began to go through the living room, another loud crash came from the kitchen. One of the cabinets had opened and slammed shut; a favorite trick of Charlie's. The man who seemed to be leading the show shined his flashlight into the kitchen and shouted ""Is there anyone in here?!?? If you are, you better come out now!! We will find you, and we will FUCK you up!!!!"". My sister and I had to cover our mouths to keep from screaming out loud. At the man's words though, Charlie apparently got angry. We heard another loud crash and a skittering of metal on the floor, as one of our silverware drawers apparently threw itself across the room. I heard one of the men say ""What.......the FUCK?!?!"". And then Charlie decided he was do e fucking around. All at once, every door, window, and cabinet in our home began opening and closing violently, and loudly. Small objects all over the house began to fling themselves into walls, across the floor, even at the intruders. At this point, the one in charge just yelled ""FUCK this"" and turned and ran out, his buddy close behind.

As soon as the men were out of the door, everything stopped, and the house was again silent. It was a long, long time before either my sister or myself finally worked up the courage to move. She had left her cell phone downstairs, and and she needed it to call the police and our parents. She began slowly creeping downstairs to get it, and since there was no way in hell I was being left alone, I followed. As we got to the bottom, I looked into the kitchen, and for just a moment, Charlie was standing there, exactly as I saw him before, with the same grin on his face. A moment later, he was gone.

The police arrived shortly, and my parents not far behind. The cops determined that the disorder in the home was caused by the robbers ransacking the place for valuables, and they must have been scared off by a passing car. Lucky for us. My sister and I didn't even try to tell them what really happened, and within thirty minutes, both men were caught, still fleeing. 

After that night, hearing Charlie's walk around my floor gave me a serene sense of security every night. When he played his little pranks, I would always look for him. And every now and then I would catch just a glimpse of him and smile.

Several years later, when I was a junior in high school, I was working on a school report at the local library. The topic was the history of our town, and I wanted to see if the library had any old news clippings that mentioned my family's ranch. I typed our address on the search bar, and the first result stopped me dead in my tracks. The date of the old article was July 17, 1936, and at the top was a picture of a man, about 5'8"", with dark hair and eyes. It was, unmistakably, Charlie. The title of the article read ""Local Man Murdered While Defending Daughter"". It seems the man we called Charlie was actually named Brian Davis. He had lived alone in the ranch with his only child, a daughter, after losing his wife to a bad case of the Flu. On the night of July 15, the article said, Mr. Davis was returning home from his job as an auto mechanic in town. When he pulled up to the house, he found the door had been forced open. He ran inside, and found a man on top of his daughter. The girl was sobbing, her dress had been ripped open, and the attacker held a knife to her throat. In a moment of sheer instinct, Mr. Davis threw himself at the intruder, tackling him of his daughter, and as he held the attacker, Mr. Davis yelled for the girl to run to the neighbors and call the police. The girl made it the mile and a half to the closest neighbor, who promptly called the sheriff. When deputies arrived, they were able to apprehend the attacker, who had been beaten half to death. Unfortunately, he had stabbed Mr. Davis three times in the chest. Brian Davis died right on our kitchen floor.",Charlie,88,nosleep

childrenofsamhain,9,,5,1rhdoj,,36,"My friend Jaime purchased a new home about six years ago when his wife was pregnant with their first child. Until recently, he lived there with his wife Claire and their two daughters, Sarah and Emily. Sarah is now five years old and Emily is three. Within the first two years living in the house, Jaime said that he never experienced anything out of the ordinary. It wasn't until his daughter Sarah was around two years old, that he started to notice she talked to herself. Jamie thought nothing of it, she was just learning to talk and he figured she was just entertaining herself. 

One afternoon when Claire was out at the grocery store, Jaime overheard his daughter in the upstairs hallway, whispering and giggling. Curious, he asked, ""Sweetie, who are you talking to?"" Sarah replied, 

""The woman standing in the hallway"".

""Is she your imaginary friend?""

""I guess."" 

Amused, he went upstairs to find her staring blankly at a wall, whispering quietly. ""What's your friends name?"" he asked her. 

""Her name is Helen Mary"", she said. 

""And what are you two whispering about?"" 

Sarah looked at him and paused before she piped ""I'm not supposed to tell you."" 

Suddenly the front door opened downstairs, and they heard Claire come through the door. Sarah rushed down the stairs to greet her. Jaime didn't think about that again for a few weeks. 

Over time, the two noticed that Sarah's interactions with ""Helen Mary"" became more frequent, but they attributed this to the fact that they had just given her the news that she was going to be a big sister. 

About two weeks before Claire gave birth to Emily, Jaime was at home alone with Sarah. He heard her playing upstairs, chatting away with her imaginary friend, when suddenly he heard glass breaking. He ran upstairs as quickly as possible to find his daughter standing in the hallway, holding a hammer. She was staring up at the wall of family pictures that were now smashed to pieces. There was glass everywhere. Jaime picked his daughter up and carried her down the stairs. He told her to stay put as he returned to the upstairs hallway to clean up the shattered fragments of their family portraits. When he returned to the living room, he asked her directly, ""Sweetie, why would you smash all of our family pictures?"" 

She looked at him, ""Helen Mary told me to do it.""

When Claire returned home that evening from her girls night with friends, Jaime told her about the incident. The crept up the stairs so as not to wake their daughter, so Claire could view the damage with her own eyes. She gasped silently at the sight. 

When they returned downstairs to the kitchen, they started to discuss possible explanations for her behavior. Suddenly, the color ran out of Claire's face and she looked at Jaime. ""There's no way she could have done that alone.""

""What?""

""There is no way she could have smashed all of those pictures by herself.""

Jaime was confused, ""I told you, I caught her with the hammer. She told me that she did it.""

But it wasn't until his wife said it aloud that it dawned on him, ""But… some of those pictures are almost five feet off the ground. How could she have reached those?""

His mind was racing, ""She must have moved a chair or something.""

She was adamant, ""There are no chairs upstairs that she is strong enough to move without you hearing it, and you would have seen her carry one upstairs, right?""

Jaime was silent. He didn't have an answer. 

They went to bed that night without any answers. The following morning their daughter had little recollection of smashing the pictures and Jamie wrote it off as sleepwalking. Though he didn't have much time to think about it, as two weeks later his second little girl was born.

Emily was two years old in the summer of 2012, and one afternoon, when Claire was at home alone with the girls, she heard Emily alone upstairs, whispering. She called up to her, ""Who you talking to, kiddo?""

""The woman standing in the hallway.""

Claire thought that her Sarah must have told her about her imaginary friend, and that she was simply trying to emulate her big sister. Then she spoke again.

""She doesn't like you, Mommy""

""Why doesn't she like me?"" Claire responded, surprised. 

""I don't know."" 

Suddenly her daughter came bounding down the stairs as if nothing had happened. Even though both Jaime and Claire both found this slightly creepy, nothing about the situation ever felt threatening or malevolent. Until one night last month.

Jaime had put the kids to sleep around eight o'clock in the evening and he and Claire had got into bed soon after. Exhausted, Jaime and his wife fell asleep extremely quickly. Jaime was awoken by the sound of screaming. He was disoriented and had no idea what time it was, but he could tell that it was his wife screaming right next to him. He turned to see what was wrong and saw it. His 3 year old daughter Emily, standing beside the bed, with a hammer in her hand. Blood poured from Claire's forehead. Jamie jumped out of bed and grabbed the hammer out of his daughters hand. He turned to his wife. She had stopped screaming now, and Jaime grabbed a towel from the bathroom and wiped the blood away from her face. She was going to be alright, but she did have a deep cut to her forehead. 

Jaime picked up his daughter and carried her out of the room. He went and checked on Sarah, who had awoken to the screaming but was clearly unharmed. He told her that everything was alright and closed her door. He was standing alone with his daughter in the upstairs hallway, and he finally asked her, ""Emily, why would you hurt Mommy?""

""She told me to, Daddy.""

""Who told you to?"" 

""The woman standing right behind you. She told me to hurt Mommy"" And then Jaime felt a chill run up his spine when his daughter leaned into his ear and whispered, ""And she told me to hurt you too, Daddy.""

I just kept clicking through - that was my greatest vice. I could have let it rest. But with every story, my blood pumped faster, my breath came quicker.

There's nothing like a good scare. Every rush of adrenaline left me wanting more. That next fix got harder to find, took longer. I grew discerning, opinionated, a veteran of the genre. Soon I was writing for myself; days spent clacking the keys and nights spent in marathon research sessions. I was a crow picking through the maggots and gore for that next juicy nibble. I was a man consumed, and like a junkie messiah I wanted to share my high with others.

Everything has a basis in reality. Think about it. Why do the holy men think your soul needs saving? Why do children fear the dark? What's there in the unknown deep, what is it that averts our gaze?

That's why I'm here now. That's why I'm writing to you. I come bringing the ultimate high. All you have to do is believe. Believe in me, in the hellish nightmares that chase after you in your sleep, in the stories you read and the movies you watch. When you believe, the hunt is on.

My stomach is in knots, every heartbeat a hammer blow against my sternum. My hands are shaking. My breath comes in stecatto bursts. I can't hold on much longer. The anticipation is mounting, building to orgasmic frenzy. I found it, the ultimate high. Or rather, it found me. All I had to do was believe. All I have to do is turn around.

My faith is sure, and I know it with every fiber in my being:

It's here. And it hates me.",I couldn't stop.,26,nosleep
lamented_dreams,4,,9,1rgqu8,,13,"I love the dark. I really do.

I don't mean going gothic and pagan and all that, but I do like the dark. I like to sit in my room for hours on end into the night watching videos, researching diseases and the supernatural, and writing stories.

Anyways, I've recently come across a quote from a game called 'Knock Knock'. And let me say, it's utterly terrifying for not just the player, but the watcher too. There's nothing but this overwhelming sense of dread throughout all of the game.

""You thought about it, and now, it is inside."" —Knock Knock

That quote has seemed to have seeped into my brain. Multiple broken theories have been written down in my notebooks and journals and I've seemed to have come to a conclusion.

The mind isn't wrong. Reality is. And, with that, imagination often holds more truth than what we accept.

Think about it. When you were a small child, things like fairytales and horror stories were much more real to your innocent mind. In fact, there is a theory that children have a sixth sense that they gradually lose as they progress into adulthood. Also when you were a child, you thought of monsters and what they would do to you as well as how terrifying they looked.

And when you thought about these things, you didn't want to turn around. Why? Because what if for the slightest moment, you were right? All those lone yellow eyes in the darkness, the sinking feeling of being watched, out of all those times, what if this was the moment you were right? Or moreover what if you were always right and they just didn't want you to know... until now.

Because honestly, we used to think the Earth was flat. Then that it had the sun revolving around us. So what makes us so absolutely sure that we are the only ones out there now?

This is my theory.

I shared with one of my colleagues about two weeks ago and five days later she called me screaming about how there was something in her house. The police showed up and they took her to the hospital. She had three slash marks down her back, resembling that of almost a wolf. She also had multiple bruises on her neck. They said there was no signs of break in and the wrecking of the house was most likely the result of her having a psychotic episode.

This could be true, but I don't like how unsettlingly close it is to when I told her about my theory.

""You thought about it, and now, it is inside.""

This is the phrase that keeps me from imagining creatures. When I went to the hospital to visit her she was curled up in the bed, shaking with her knees up as close to her chest as possible. When I asked her what happened she wouldn't tell me who, only that 'it' got inside. She just had this empty look in her eyes, something very uncommon since she was always so hyper and nice. When I asked how she just said, ""I thought about it, and it came in.""

Keep in mind I never told her about the quote at all. Those were her own words. So this is more than unsettling for me. It may be possible that this 'theory' spooked her enough for all of this to happen, but I don't like the coincidences.

angelcot,3,,2,1rh91p,,11,"Hi /r/nosleep. This is kind of embarrassing to post, but here's a few stories of things that happened to me as a kid. I was a pretty anxious kid, and a lot of weird stuff happened to me. Nothing paranormal, though There's more than just these stories, but I thought I'd at least start with this.

Ever since I was a kid, I've been afraid of windows. That's not saying much, though. I was afraid of just about everything else, too. But growing up, my house was full of big windows. Floor-to-ceiling windows in the family room, two sliding glass doors in the dining room, a huge window that looked out from our kitchen into the front yard. My mom never bought curtains or blinds for any of the windows other than the ones in our bedrooms because she'd get depressed if it were too dark in our house. 

I had light blue curtains in my bedroom that my grandmother sewed for me since my windows were an irregular size. Every night I would pull them closed, then pin them down to the walls with a pushpin so that I wasn't able to see even a sliver of the outside out of the corner of my eye. My bedroom window looked out on the backyard. I remember being so irritated whenever someone would accidentally leave the back porch light on. The light would shine through my light blue curtains and play shadows on my wall. I'd cover my head with my pillow so that I could fall asleep without worrying if I would be able to make out the silhouette of someone trying to peer through my curtains, still pinned to the wall. 

From a young age, I had problems with insomnia. My mom struggled with it, too. I remember my dad telling me stories of when my parents were still married, when my mom would wake him up just to talk because she still wasn't asleep at 4, 5, 6 in the morning. I remembered feeling envious that I didn't have someone to do that to. I listened to books on tape at bedtime to fill the silence. Sometimes I would sneak into my brothers' room and lay on their floor, hoping for sleep to come. Being uncomfortably aware of how their curtains weren't drawn completely closed. 

When I was 10, I moved from my room- which overlooked the backyard- to my brothers' room, and my brothers separated and took over my room, and the office. My new room was at the front of the house. If my curtains were open, someone could easily look in as they walked up the path to our front door. During the day, I didn't mind it. I could watch for my friends or packages from the postman. At night, it made me so anxious I began to develop a habit of vomiting nightly. My mom was sympathetic, but didn't know what to do about it. A year later, I was moved back into my old room, and my older brother moved back into his. I stopped vomiting every night. 

I feel like I had a reason for being so afraid of windows. One night- I must have been about 6 or 7- I was up late, as usual, listening to *Ralph S. Mouse* on tape for the billionth time. I had emptied the glass of water that my mom had gotten for me, so I got up to refill it. I was already wary of windows, so I kept my head down on my way to the kitchen. I'd often see things out of the corner of my eye; something moving, or something that *could* have been the shadow of a human, but would later try to convince myself it was nothing.

Even with my head down, something outside caught my attention. A car, parked in front of my house. I lived at the very bottom of a cul-de-sac, so we didn't have a lot of people drive down our street at night and stop to reorient themselves. The car had its headlights on, and I could tell there was someone sitting in the car. Looking at my house. I don't know if they were looking at me, but my paranoia told me they were. I stood there for a long time, forgetting about my glass of water. I didn't look away. Paralyzed, until my mom came in the kitchen. She'd seen my door was open and wondered what I was doing up. When she noticed the car in front of our house, she quieted and gently pushed me out of the kitchen and back to my bedroom. I noticed the car started to drive away as I was ushered away from the window. 

This staring contest with the person in the car in front of my house happened twice more, although over the course of a few months. Once, they switched their headlights off, and stayed for what might have been 45 minutes. Although my memory might be exaggerating. I still don't understand why I was so afraid of seeing someone in my bedroom window, but how I could fearlessly stare out of the kitchen window at the person in the parked car. Maybe I felt less vulnerable in the kitchen. Maybe I was comforted by the fact that they were so far away. Even though the walk from where they parked was just a few seconds from my front door and the window I was looking out. 

The third and final time I saw the car, the person got out of their car. They were tall, and I could see them standing on the other side of their car but I still wasn't able to make out their face. When they started to walk around their car and- I assume- towards my front door, I scurried back to my bed. 

I never liked sleepovers as a kid. Staying over at a friends house meant laying awake on their floor for hours with nothing to listen to but the sound of their calm breathing. Nothing to look at except for the sliver of their window I could see from behind their curtains. Having friends at my house was just as stressful. Usually we'd sleep in the family room, because it had a TV in it. It also had the floor-to-ceiling windows. Usually I would sneak off to my own room after my friends had fallen asleep, so that I could sleep peacefully away from those big windows. 

When I was about 8 years old, I was having a sleepover with a few of my friends. It was after 10, so my friends were starting to fall asleep. I knew I still had *at least* two or three more hours of being wide awake. I was laying on the couch, swaddled in my blanket. The TV was still on, but I'd turned the volume down for my sleeping friends to something barely audible. Usually, I tried to keep my eyes away from the windows. But that night my cat caught my attention, meowing and hissing at something outside. I cautiously looked out the window, worried about what my cat might have seen out there. Just another cat, skittering in front of the window. Relieved, I looked out at my dark backyard. Was that it? 

There was a man in my backyard, walking around. Even with the distance, I distinctly remember he was frowning. He had his hands in his pockets. I did not know this man. 

I woke up one of my friends, whispering in her ear and telling her there was somebody in the backyard. She stirred quickly, obviously alarmed, and looked outside. She saw him too. I'm not sure if he felt our little eyes on him or what, but he turned to face us. Neither of us made a move; not to lay back down and pretend we were asleep, not even to look at each other, or look away. 

There were a pair of french doors that lead to the back patio in my family room, right in the middle of the wall of windows. The man walked up to the doors and tapped on one of the small window panes. The handle of what looked to be a heavy flashlight hung out of the pocket of his sweatshirt. He smiled at us. Not a deranged smile, not a smile that looked too wide for his face. Just a calm, warm smile. He mouthed something and pointed at the doorknob. I was never very good at reading lips. I stared straight ahead, unblinking, not responding. I could hear my friends' breath, heavy and shaking. 

He spoke, the sound of his voice muffled through the glass, ""Open the door."" A pause, he knit his eyebrows together like he was concerned. ""I'm visiting your parent. Let me in."" 

My heart was beating out of my chest. I was a paranoid enough little kid to not fall for this line. I mustered up every ounce of courage I had in my little, anxious, 8-year-old body, and got up off the couch. For a moment, they man at the door looked relieved. I ran out of the room, screaming for my mom. I could hear my friend call out at me that he was leaving, and the rest of my friends starting to stir. I told my mom what had happened. She turned on all the outside lights and called the police while my step-dad looked out every window for any signs of the man. All of the girls at my sleepover had their moms come over and pick them up. I cried, and stayed the night in my parents bed, although I'm pretty sure I didn't sleep.

In my mom's bathroom, there was a big window that looked out at the sideyard. The glass was distorted, though, so my mom never bothered putting a curtain over it. You couldn't see into the bathroom if you were just passing by the window. If you stopped to press your face against the glass, you could see in or out, but everyone in the house knew not to do that when they were in the sideyard. I remember my mom shrieking one night, running out of the bathroom, saying she'd seen something through the glass. A rat, climbing up the windowsill and staring into the bathroom.

I always liked my mom's shower more than the one in my bathroom. My bathroom didn't have a fan in it, so the whole bathroom would get uncomfortably humid. The shower curtain in my bathroom reminded me too much of that scene from *Psycho*, too, and I'd always shower with the shower curtain pulled open, and I'd get water all over the floor. My mom's shower had a glass door that I liked much more, even if there was that big window I could see clearly from the shower. 

Once when I was 12, I was showering in my mom's bathroom because my parents were out of town. My brothers were home, but were playing video games in the family room. I would keep my head down when I showered in my mom's bathroom. Even if the window's glass was hard to see through, it was still a window, and the shower was the most vulnerable place I could think of being looked at. Every once and a while, I would glance up to quell my growing anxiety. To tell myself *nothing was out there*. 

Cautiously, I looked up to satisfy my anxiety. *Nothing was out there*, I told myself. My gaze met the window. There was a dark figure pressed up against the glass. Through the foggy, wet shower door, I couldn't see anything. All I know was that it was *somebody*. I screamed, and ducked down past the tiles so that whoever was out there, they couldn't see me. A few moments later, I heard my brothers knocking at the door, both of them calling my name and asking if I was ok. I pulled a towel from outside the shower and wrapped myself up before I stood up. Whoever was out there was gone. 

A few weeks later, my friends and I were playing in the side yard. There was a huge tree out there that we liked to climb in, and pretend we were characters from X-Men or Sonic. My friend called my attention to something in the grass, over by the window of my mom's bathroom. A polaroid picture of the distorted glass of the window it lay in front of.  ",Windows.,13,nosleep
Spudz_OCD,6,,6,1rgcw5,,9,"Hey redditors, im new at this so excuse my writing skills

All through my life ive had things happen that i just couldn't explain, i've told a couple of friends but even they don't know what to say.

My story begins when i was a kid about the age of six or seven, we lived in a poor neighbourhood in southern Ireland and had a shithole of a house, i lived in a room with my two brothers (kyle[8-9  at the time], and Dylan[3-4]) and had been for a couple of years so i was used to sharing a room. The first incident occurred after about a year in the house (our street was built on a graveyard) and happenned in our room. it was an ordinary day before it happenned, woke up, ate breakfast, went to school, nothing out of the ordinary. however when i came home from school that day, there was something odd about the house, I couldn't quite tell what it was but it just felt wrong. But being a kid at the time, i thought nothing of it and carried on with my daily routine. after dinner and a shower my mom put us to bed. After my mom turned out the lights and left the room, i began to drift off to sleep. after about an hour and a half of hazy dreams, i was suddenly awoken by a loud crashing sound, kind of like if you dropped a frying pan, i quiclky jumped up my pillow and sat upright in bed. I looked over to Dylan's bed at the other side of the room, he ws still asleep. I began to question if i had actually heard it at all. feeling curious i checked if kyle was awake (we had a bunk-bed, Kyle was on top) as i was climbing the four step ladder, i felt a burst of cold air rush from kyles bed and immediately dropped to the ground, waking up Kyle.
""what are you doing"", he said.
""i heard a noise so i wanted to see if--""
""--sshh"", he stopped me mid sentance, and focused his gaze to the back of the room; The look on his face will be forever imprinted into my mind. I turned around gingerly and what i saw was scary enough to make me cringe even today. I saw a scrawny black figure hunched over Dylan, who was still asleep. But this figure was definately not human; It was at least 7 feet tall, it's head was overpoweringly large compared to it's beyond anorexic body. It's fingers were 6-7 inches long minimum. From what i saw it wore nothing, but it very well could have, as it was late at night and i was still half asleep. Then the image that will haunt me forever; It, whatever it was, turned towards me and Kyle. It just stood there, staring at us for what felt like forever, it then jumped towards us and simply vanished into thin air right before it hit me. I was left lying on the floor and Kyle was wondering if what we had just seen was actually real. I looked at him and back to Dylan's bed, whatever it as, when it jumped it jumped with enough force to push the blanket off the end of Dylan's bed. I looked back towards Kyle, who was already asleep again, and decided to go back to sleep myself, not knowing if what we'd seen that night was just a figment of our imagination or not.
When i woke up the following morning i hesitantly asked my mom and sister if they'd seen or heard anything last night..they didn't. So i questioned kyle about it and he said that he had no idea what i was on about, he had no memory of seeing or hearing anything, he didnt even remember me falling off the bunk ladder.
To this day i still cant quite figure out what happened that night.

My second experience was only four or five years ago, a couple of months after moving to Australia. We were living in a pretty old house at the time so it was a bit creaky and what not. it was a pretty average day when it happenned;I was 14 and I was once again in bed at the time. I was sharing a room with Dylan (10) at the time. Kyle (16) was in a room across the hallway, Jenny (12) was the next door down and my parent's room was at the end of the hallway. It was about 11-12 at night, and we were all just about asleep. My mom and step-father at the time were out exploring the wild clubs of Surfers Paradise, so it ws just us kids. I was almost asleep when i heard slight footsteps coming from the kithcen area. I wondered who it was considering we were all in bed, so i opened the door to check. I headed towards the kitchen, once i reached the living room (about half-way to kitchen from my room) i could see into the kitchen, i slowly emerged from the wall; no one there..weird, i thought, so i headed back to my room, but as soon as i turned around Kyle was standing right in front of me with a knife. I jumped quicker than i'd ever jumped before. Kyle then laughed his head off and went back to bed. I did the same without the laughing.. I was back in my room, now lying in bed realising im too awake to go back to sleep. i just lay there for about five minutes staring at the ceiling untill i heard more footsteps in the kitchen. I called out
""Kyle, go to bed, idiot""
""i am you fuckwit"", he said as he emerged from his room half asleep
""well then who's upstairs?"" i asked
""It's probably just a possum in the attic or something don't worry""
I regretfully closed the door and went back to bed. But as soon as i did, loud heavy footsteps started making their way down the hallway, along with heavy thumping on the walls, they were getting closer and a hell of a lot louder, It sounded like someone was trying to stomp and bash rats out of the walls and floor. It kept coming closer and increasing in volume until it was at the point where it was like gunshots right outside my room. It then stomped right outside my door and my door swung open with extreme noise and force and standing at the door was, i shit you not, the same tall, black scrawny fucked up figure that i saw years ago. I practically shat myself. It stood there for a couple of seconds, but if felts like hours, then started stomping and sprinted towards my moms room. I don't know why but i instantly got up and ran towards the door and looked towards my moms room; nothing there, it vanished again. I dropped to the ground in shock, just as Kyle open his door and screamed ""WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT"" 
""It's back"" ,i said
""What's back?""
""the thing i saw hunched over Dylan""
I stayed up all night that night not wanting to sleep knowing that thing followed us to Australia

My most recent encounter with our old friend was last year. We'd moved into an old complex of houses that had a bit of a history in the crime side of things. We'd been living there for about 6 months and my friend from primary school, Jordan, was now living in the complex too. It was around 5PM and it was just Jordan Kyle and I in the house. I was playing my i-pod at the time, Kyle was in the kitchen and Jordan was behind me. Kyle decided to pick up a coin and throw it at an unsuspecting Jordan, who surprisingly, caught it, and returned fire. but then Jordan moved a little backwards and Kyle threw it further and harder. The coin flew through the air right past my head and stopped rigth in front of Jordans face, IT LITERALLY STOPPED IN MID AIR, it stood still in front of his face for less than a second and then was propelled back towards Kyle with nearly twice the force. We all just stood there speechless, not knowing if that had really just happened. Later that day we were showing a friend what had happened  and were back in the Kitchen messing around with coins to see if it would happen again. When suddenly a ball flew through the air at Kyle, like it had been thrown with force from the stairs leading upstairs. For the second time that day we were utterly speechless and had no idea what to do.
That night after Jordan had left and Kyle went to bed, i was making a late night snack. Dylan was in the living room watching TV and there was nobody else in the house. I finished making the snack and was about to head into the living room when in the corner of my eye, I saw the figure that i had seen twice before glide upstairs; same height, same scrawniness, same long fingers only this time it was a little misty, like a shadow, and it looked right into my eyes as it vanished upstairs.
I am still wondering what the actual fuck that figure is, all i know is that my mother has become a claire-voyant.I know for a fact that there is definately going to be a lot more of this thing which i have nicknamed ""the figure"".

For the time being i will keep an eye out for my little follower and if i see him/her again i will not hesitate to report the time, date, and details of the situation and of course reddit the fuck out of it.
for now redditors, i bid you farewell

the_dark_half,5,,1,1rhyj5,,7,"You know that feeling when you’re all alone and hear your name whispered? Maybe you’ve walked into a room only to suddenly feel a sudden temperature drop? Had things go missing only to re-appear in odd places? Maybe you’re like me and you lie in bed at night, only to feel like someone stroking your hair but when you become fully conscious and turn around, nothing. 
Think you walk through a cobweb or hair falls on your arms or neck and brushes against your skin delicately, tickling you? You check and nothing was there? I’m sure your parents tell you it’s nothing from a young age; perhaps because they themselves are deluded enough to believe that it is their imagination. They probably deep down fear it’s a ghost or apparition. Even they couldn’t know how much worse it really is.  Stop deluding yourself. It’s not a cobweb. It’s not the wind. It’s not nothing. It’s something far more sinister, an insidious force which slowly grows stronger the more you feed it your fear and attention. 

Some of you, I’m sure, will be fortunate enough only to feel cold spots and occasionally hear creaks and footsteps in your house. It’s such a common occurrence that people barely notice it and if they do, it’s the spookiest part of a generic horror movie, because those suits in Hollywood haven’t seen what these creatures are really capable of. If you believe in the paranormal you may experience the whispers of what I can only loosely refer to as their ‘voices’. I’m sure not many of you have had the misfortune to awaken to them standing over your bed, taking the forms of whatever creatures or person your subconscious fears most because it’s real form is so terrifying you’d probably die instantly or become paralysed with fear, a zombie-esque state you’ll never awaken from-and that would ruin their fun too early. If you don’t die instantly, seeing their faces will make your eyes bleed; hearing their voices unrestrained will shatter your ear drums and I’ve heard of cases where insides have been liquefied, skin melting and bleeding seeping out of every pore.

The first time I awoke to one in my room with me, it was after I’d given the footsteps and banging on the walls attention. I had thought it was cool, I even bought a stupid Ouija board and told them it was okay for them to try and talk to me. I had been lying in bed after a night of drinking so I passed off the initial taunts and laughs as nothing more than my intoxicated imagination, until my door slowly opened and in came one large hairy leg, followed by more spindly legs, followed by many eyes and two huge fucking fangs. Yep, a giant spider, bigger than a horse came into my room. I tried to scream, but that just resulted with me hyperventilating, then vomiting all over the floor. It strode in, all beady eyes on me and as it slinked atop my bed I tried to pathetically crawl away, but it held me down with its two front legs, piercing into the flesh of my shoulders as I whimpered like a small animal about to be devoured-which I was.  I felt the sharp pain of its fangs tear through my skin and inject me with poison that made my blood burn. I lay in bed, delirious, desperate, muttering for help. My ears were greeted with a cacophony of voices, screaming horrible things that were so foul that before that night had been unimaginable to me. I passed out shortly after, from fear, blood loss or the venom and awoke a few days later, believing to have all been a dream. I clung to that hope until I stepped outside my bedroom door and found dozens of small animals, birds mostly, wrapped up in what appeared to be spider’s webs, discoloured, drained of their blood and insides. All dead. I ran to the bathroom to throw up and caught sight of myself, dried blood caked on my body and face, puncture wounds all over me and strands of silky web still wrapped around my breasts, my stomach, my legs and in my hair. 

The second night I encountered one of them, they took the form of my uncle. I lived with my uncle for nearly 5 years while my father was travelling almost every week for business. I know my father loved me and desperately needed the money that he had to work from dawn until way after the sun set and had to leave me for long periods. He didn’t know what his brother did to me. That night as I became increasingly aware of the noises in my apartment and the feelings of someone touching me and whispering in my ear, I rolled over to see my uncle grinning at me. He crawled onto the bed and tied me down. I struggled, but when I did he beat me with his belt, like he had started doing when I was eight years old. I fought as hard as I could, tears burning my eyes and sobbing uncontrollably, but he kept cutting away at my clothes with a pocket knife and telling me to be a good girl. The torture that night lasted for many hours, possibly days. I try not to remember it. I thought I had moved on from those childhood years and buried them a few years ago, when my uncle died. This was not the last time the monsters took on forms like this to break me. They’ve only grown stronger with every drop of blood, with every scream and with every hopeless sob I’ve given them.

Their true form will only appear to you in dreams at first because they get to torment you in ways that won’t instantaneously butcher you or drive you insane, yet; they like to take their time with their toys. The dreams for me started after those incidents. I have seen what those beings really look like and…just thinking about it is enough for me to start violently shaking, unable to stop retching. The other day I wasn’t careful and thought about one of them and a stranger had to hold me back as I unconsciously started walking in front of a train. In my dreams, it is pure hell as they have my undivided attention for hours and can do whatever they want to me without my body breaking and bending the way it would in the waking world, but it all feels real. 
Part of me stares at length of rope on my coffee table and considers leaving this torment…but what if when I die, I get sent to their realm, to be their plaything forever? 

It’s not just the occasional brush against my skin, the odd floor creak and the rare moment of ‘is someone calling my name?’ Now I feel them on me at all times, their rough, sharp skin cutting mine, scratching me, violating every single part of my body. Their voices scream and howl at me, maniacally taunting and laughing at my never-ending misery. Even when I shut my eyes, I still see them, their hideous beings beyond any words the human language has to describe them to you. 

Most of you think of those household noises and strange occurrences as the work of ghosts, of spirits. Yes, it is so comforting for humans to believe these presences are the souls of dead people who are just sad and wandering, isn’t it? You want to be able to talk to someone no longer alive; you open your mind and let them in. Don’t. What’s out there isn’t human, it isn’t some person with unfinished business, what’s out there wants you to think that, to get comfortable with inviting it in and letting yourself become aware of it. 

Did you just hear that faint noise outside your window, like a soft breeze carrying a faint whisper? That creak outside your room? That faint sensation on your flesh? I hope not, because now you know what’s really there and they’ve always known about you.",Don't give them attention.,8,nosleep
Rhapsodeyus,1,,0,1rgtyq,,8,"Some may recall a story I posted a few months back, about shadow-like figures who visited me on a mission for knowledge, and afterwards, disappeared like ghosts. For those who do not recall, the story is [Curious Visitors](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l4dv2/curious_visitors/).

If you have not read that, well, you probably haven't missed much, but it will help with the backstory for this one if you do read it.

Done reading? Good, let's continue.

This happened last night, Sunday, November 24th, 2013. I woke up at precisely 4:27 AM, and I know this because I watched my small digital alarm clock on my bedside table flip to 4:27 AM as my eyes opened. I also noticed that my lamp was off (I sleep with the light on for safety reasons, since living with cats can be hazardous). However, I could see my plain, black clock in a pale blueish light.

My brain clicked. ""My laptop is on. I must have left it on and the power went out, so it's running on battery."" Then I remembered, quite clearly, turning it off and closing it before going to bed. That's when I felt a weight at the end of my bed, sitting in front of my laptop.

I sat up, looked, and spotted a shadowy figure sitting in front of my laptop. The NoSleep submission form was up. I coughed, and said quietly, ""You could have asked."" Instead of, say, a sudden spin and a glare from Brarger, as I expected, my visitor vanished instantly.

I didn't expect that, and it startled me thoroughly. My previous visitors would never have been so rude, and certainly would have asked my permission to access my personal computer. I shifted, tossed the covers aside, and moved to the end of the bed, to read what it had written.

JUVIE_MAKER,2,,1,1rhq9j,,8,"I have a nose for things. No seriously, all my life I’ve had a very strong sense of smell and I don’t mean for the average person. I have an abnormally, freakishly, ridiculously, absurd sense of smell. It’s been that way since I was a kid. Here’s a prime example, when I was about four or five I used to visit my grandmother (god rest her soul) every month in Daytona Beach for the summer. My grandmother was notorious for making the best homemade cakes in the neighborhood. I would always leave my Gran’s house at least ten pounds heavier each summer after gorging myself on her delicious treats. One Saturday, after a day of playing outside (when kids used to play outside!) I instantly smelled the aroma of cake wafting through the air, but something was…..off. There was another smell lingering behind the cake scent. It was kinda tangy, bitter, sorta nutty …just all around unpleasant. Being so young, I couldn’t quite put my finger on what the smell was but I knew I didn’t like it. Then out comes my Gran from the kitchen with a big slice of her freshly made cake on a china plate. She passes the dining room table and spots me standing there with my nose crinkled up in disgust.

Gran:  What’s the matter baby? Come sit at the table and have a slice of cake.

Five year old me: I aint eating that cake, it smells funny!

(Let me just interject for a second.  Now if your family is old school like mine, you know that a child is to NEVER disrespect an elder’s cooking! Especially if that elder is a family member, you just don’t do it! That is unless you want a black eye, ribs broken, missing teeth… you get the picture.)

Gran: Girl, get your hind parts over here and eat this cake before I slap the hell out of you!!

Oh geez…there’s that tone. You know it, you know it well. That angry deep tone that resonates from parents when their truly pissed off. You know… that voice that scares the living shit out of you and gives you’re delicate child-like mind nightmares for a month (or your whole life). Yeah that’s what I was hearing right about then. But still I was adamant. I would not eat that damn cake. That smell! It was just too potent. Now, you might be thinking, what’s the big deal? Surely you’ve smelled worse things than that cake before, which is very true. At that point in my life I’d smelled worse things before (WAY WORSE) but I’d never been subjected to eat those things either. Also, the stench of that pastry….it was just… so very not right. I was only a child but I was still old enough to know right from wrong, and that cake was definitely wrong! Even at that very moment I could taste its bitterness in the back of my mouth. With every inhale it burned and tingled down my throat.

Gran: Come over here and take this plate now!

Okay at this point I knew I was in REAL trouble. Even if my grandmother didn’t kill me, I was pretty sure I was in for the ass whooping of my life! I slowly started to back away from Gran as she moved closer to me with that dreaded cake. Even as she inched towards me that smell seem too magnify. With every step she took it grew more and more intense! “Girl, you better take this cake!” she yelled holding the plate out in front of her. I turned to run but she quickly snatched up my arm before I could get away. “No!” I shouted feverishly trying to pull away from her grip, “I don’t want the cake, granny!!” but my pleas of desperation came to no avail. My grandmother started to tug me towards the kitchen table, her fingers angrily wrapped around my tiny forearm. Suddenly, she yanked me forward making my body jump about two feet in her direction, tilting my face towards hers. She looked down at me with an awful glare. Dark hollow eyes glowered down from Gran’s wrinkled sockets. Her once loving face was now rigid and stiff with a sadistic expression that I had by no means seen before. “You will eat this cake!” She shouted through gritted teeth. “Even if I have to shove it down your throat piece by piece!” 

I had never seen this side to my Gran before. My once sweet, devoted granny had turned into this vicious monster plucked straight out of my worst nightmares. My small frame quaked in fear and tears began to seep from my eyes. I had never known terror like this. My insides loosened and squirmed like jelly making the contents of my bladder empty and leak down my legs. To say I was afraid would be the understatement of the freakin decade! But you know what? There was something else I was more fearful of. Even as I pissed myself in sheer horror from the presence of my devil-like grandmother, there was still something more bloodcurdling, more utterly terrifying than her…that fucking cake! 

“NO!!!!!!!” echoed from my lips in a banshee scream and with all the strength I possessed I juggernauted into my grandmother. My body throttled into her torso head first making a loud solid grunt bellow from the old woman. Her arms flew in the air (letting me go in the same instance) and her vast body collapsed backwards before suddenly….CRACK!
The sound of my grandmother’s head crashing along the rim of her kitchen table splintered throughout the house. Gran thudded to the ground like a sack of potatoes and the plate with the cake she so firmly held onto shattered on the floor. I stared at her lifeless body as blood began to seep through her head and flow on the linoleum. I was still too little to know the true meaning of life and death but I did know for sure that red liquid was not suppose to be running out of her head like that. I bent down and looked into Gran’s half opened eyes. They weren’t black any more. They’d gone back to their normal brown again. Not really knowing what to do I just stared down at the gruesomeness of it all, watching the chunks of yellow cake absorb the blood until each piece was just as red. 

To make a long story short the police were eventually called. My Gran’s weekly bridge game was on that day and a couple of her elder counterparts found her body, and me sitting in a pool of piss and blood staring at it. Needless to say there were lots of screams. Oh, and you’re probably wondering what that smell was, right? I actually didn’t find out until I was well into my teens what exactly it was. I was pouring it into my foster parent’s coffee one morning when it finally hit me…Cyanide. From the smell of it, Gran probably couldn’t have used too much either. Maybe half a teaspoon, give or take; totally undetectable to the average person’s nose…but not to mine. “So that’s what that was, go figure”.  I remember thinking that to myself as I stirred the cyanide into two mugs. My foster parents passed away later on that day, I wish I could say I feel sadness over it but I really don’t.  I was more consumed with thoughts on why my grandmother was trying to kill me? Was it because of what I’d done to Oscar, her cute little Maltese? I mean, if I’d known the oven wasn’t a suitable place to put a dog I might have done things differently. I was only two at the time. Or perhaps it had something to do with what happened with Mommy…that really was unfortunate. I didn’t want to hurt her, but she was an obstacle that just had to be removed. 

But anyways, that’s neither here nor there. I’m an adult now and those days are long behind me. I’m actually on my way to my boyfriend’s…excuse me….ex-boyfriend’s apartment right now. I’m visiting him and that slut he cheated on me with. And guess what? They just had a baby, isn’t that the sweetest thing.  ",A nose for things...,9,nosleep
1234FUCK,7,,4,1rhjmk,,6,"So my uncle has always been into the paranormal and he got me into paranormal investigation, Or ghost hunting to simplify it a few years back. Well I go with him on a lot of them and we do it for free for people who think something paranormal is going on in their houses. I always saw it as a nice little hobby to do on the weekends to blow of some time and I always liked being scared. I mean that’s how I even know about this sub-reddit because I like reading it. And that’s one of the only reasons I knew about what had happened on my last investigation. 


	We got a call from a family out in the middle of the country saying they had begun hearing weird voices when they were each alone but the 16 year old son was the one who had it happen the most. I went through every scenario I could think on the way there, Something was legitimately going on that was paranormal, one of the kids was lying and was fucking with the rest of the family and other such things. Well when we got there we talked with the family and everyone seemed happy except the two children. The son was as I said earlier 16 and the girl was 14, they seemed uneasy looking off into corners and such. I took a note about it but didn’t dwell on it that much. We went around the house marking places we would put cameras and getting the lay out of the house. Once we finished that we went back to our van and started getting ready. After we set up all of our equipment we each got our POV (Point of view) cameras strapped on and started our investigation. My Uncle took the upstairs, our colleague took the first floor, And I went into the basement to do a little investigating of my own. 


I made my way downstairs and grabbed my Walky-talky and radioed my uncle asking if everyone was ready for me to hit the main light breaker. He gave me the go ahead and I flipped the little switch plunging the whole house into darkness I held up the other camera I had with me so I could have a camera move around freely ( plus it had a night vision setting so I could see where I was going.) Well I turned it on and walked slowly to the chair I had placed in the room so I could sit comfortably waiting for something to happen. And after an hour or so of me questioning the darkness.. It answered back.
My instincts kicked in and I put a call in on the radio for everyone to tell me where they were. And everyone was exactly where they said they were supposed to be. My heart froze in my throat from fear but excitement so I stood and asked who I was talking to and I heard a small wispy chuckle before it said softly “You know who I am.” I swallowed hard before continuing to walk around the room and asking questions. It stayed silent for a few questions before I asked why it was here. It chuckled again before I heard a small sound. Like a door knob jiggling and I turned towards it. My camera landed on a door knob sticking out from a sheet that I guess had covered it before. I walked towards it slowly pulling the sheet off to reveal a shabby door about waist height with peeling paint and scratch marks.  I put in a call on the radio telling my uncle and the others I had found something and for them to meet me in the basement. I got no answer back but I assumed they had gotten the message. My uncle did that a lot; he tended to get over excited with these things so I figured he was just trying to get here as fast as possible.  But the paranormal curiosity ran in the family so I reached down and grabbed the knob, it was warm as if someone had been holding it for a longtime. I steadied myself before twisting it and pushing it open. 


I looked through my camera screen as I walked into the door. The atmosphere around me seemed to change instantly, even though all the lights in the house was off it just seemed to be darker and colder in here the basement itself.  I looked around in the room through the screen until I saw a lone chair in the center of the room. I walked forward until I was right next to it and then began looking around more. I jumped a bit at the bright light on my screen until I noticed it was a mirror. It was bolted onto a beam  next to the chair and when I looked to the left I noticed the same thing. I thought it was really strange so I walked around the front of the chair and accidentally kicked something over.  It was loud and then I heard a sound of rushing water. My heart leapt into my throat as I looked down and around looking for the source until my camera came upon a metal bucket slightly rolling with water coming out. I also saw a candle and a small match book and that’s when it hit me. My whole body filled with fear as the realization flooded my head…. This was a “three kings” set up.


 I turned towards the door pointing the camera as I looked through it I saw the door slam and I stopped. My whole body froze from pure terror and it took me a few seconds before I let out a scream for help. After I stopped I heard the soft chuckle come from behind me in the darkness and I just stood there with my eyes closed shaking as I felt a soft breath on the back of my neck I heard a voice.. My voice whisper right into my ear. “ Do you know who I am now?” I stood there for a second before screaming again and then I heard the door bust open and I saw flash lights on me and my uncle asking what was wrong. I just ran from the room to the breaker box and flipped on all the lights. I then sank to the floor looking at him as he sat next to me and asked all that happened. I just held out my camera to him and he took it. Before he watched it he asked me why I didn’t call for back up and I looked at him before telling him that I did. He looked at our colleague before watching the recording.


 After that he asked me if we all went in together would I go back in. I nodded as long as we kept the lights on and we went in. and it was as I thought. It was a set up for “ The three kings.” I shuddered as I turned to my uncle asking if he knew what it was. He didn’t so I explained it to him and I pointed to the bucket “ and it has been used recently. The bucket was full of water. “ My uncle nodded to me and put a wrap on the investigation. We went back home and I have decided to type this up. Tomorrow we will be going and talking to the family about what happened and who had done the three kings in the house.  


I think the three kings set up has something to do with what has been happening at the house. I will update you all on what happens after we talk to them.

OsamaBinHiding,3,,1,1rhxdo,,6,"Last night was like every other night for me. Have dinner on my own in my small, yet cost flat and watch a little bit of TV. Around 9 or 10 o'clock, I start to crack on with some work as I had a university deadline in a couple days time. The minutes started going faster and before I knew it it was 12 o""clock. 

""Where did the time go?"" I thought. It had only felt like a few minutes. However, this was a normal occurrence for me. The world kind of, disappears when I get lost in a train of thought and for the life of me, I can't break out of it.

I had just remembered that I had a seminar early in the morning and suddenly thought ""Fuck, I better try and get some sleep"" 

See, I live in an old building that has been converted into flats in the suburbs of a major city. So it isn't uncommon to hear floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and all the walls are very thin so noises in the middle of the night just tend to go over my head. I wouldn't consider myself someone who doesn't get scared easily but when you're familiar with floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and branches tapping your window - you tend to grow some thick skin.

Last night wasn't like any other night in my flat though. 

As I mentioned earlier, I was alone. My flatmate - let's call him, Evan for the sake of the story, was away celebrating thanksgiving with his family but he's away a lot so I'm used to spending a long period of time on my own. My usual night routine of showering, brushing my teeth and cleaning the kitchen was over and I went into my room to finally rest my head for the night and that was when I first noticed something. My drawers were all pulled open. 

To most people, this is probably nothing - but for me it wasn't normal. I suffer from borderline OCD and everything, especially in my room needs to be in order and I remember waking up and everything was in order. I hadn't left my flat today either. 

""I'm too tired for this shit"" I thought and went to bed. 

It's weird though isn't it? That something like a mattress and a duvet can make you feel so safe, like nothing can hurt you. I remember being a child and I made sure none of my limbs were outside of my bed incase something grabbed me in the middle of the night. Such a feeble piece of furniture can make you feel so safe.

Well, not anymore for me. Last night I heard the usual creaking of the floorboards - no biggy, right? However, as I drew closer to conscientious, I realised that these creaking sounds weren't coming from the surrounding walls and neighbouring flats but they were coming from under my bed.

And that's when I felt the unmistakable sensation of a cold, coarse finger stroking mine over the side of my bed.

TaylorBonaseraSr,0,,2,1rhb2e,,5,"I can explain why I'm so afraid of mirrors, or anything that could reflect light, even a glass door. It's so difficult for me to talk about it sometimes, but other times I feel her pressing me on to tell as many people about her as possible. She broke my mirror the first time, just crashed right through the glass and shattered the glass into a literal hundred pieces. It was such a pain to have to clean all that up. I got at least five cuts. But she didn't care. At the very least she didn't laugh at me or yell at me to clean faster. At least she was nice enough to check herself for that. Anyway, I got my mirror replaced. She didn't break the bathroom mirror again, but she broke the great mirror in the hallway while she was running through it. I don't understand how she did it, it's pressed up right against the wall. She'd have to ram her body sideways. She didn't even have any visible cuts. She told me she was sorry, and that she would try not to do it again. I believed her, and she was true to her word. But soon enough, I hear the crashing again. But this time it's my door. The majority of my glass door has been smashed through, but the weird thing is that the hole is shaped like Quasimodo. No one lives here that has a body shaped like that. The other times I checked her she didn't have any cuts on her, but this time she was bleeding so much from every part of her body that she had to go to the hospital. I had to sit there and watch her, but she couldn't explain what had happened. When the doctor asked, neither could I, because I hadn't been there. It's strange how selective she is; she won't smash into anything except mirrors or glass-looking things. Anywhere there isn't this kind of stuff, nothing bad happens. She tells me that she feels so cold whenever she walks by something like that, and she gets an uncontrollable urge to destroy it. She talks to me about it so often I feel like I'm beginning to share the feeling.

It's starting to unnerve me, and I don't want to live with her anymore. But I can't break the joint liability contract. She told me to cover all the things in the house that could possibly create a reflection, so I did. But I find her desperately tearing off the covers when she thinks I'm not looking.

One day I'd had enough so I decided to take off one of the covers in my room. It couldn't hurt, just for a little while when she couldn't see. She wouldn't notice. But after a minute of reveling in my refreshed reflection, I saw her standing there. So close. She was so ugly. She copied my expression and mocked my horrified face. She followed me here, to my own room. I couldn't turn around. There was no point. I felt a pressure from her on my shoulders so great I couldn't keep a straight posture. She was laughing at me.

But I'd heard that laugh somewhere before. And I'd seen that face before too. It looked so much like my own. She must have heard my thoughts, because she said she told me to never look at her by means of a reflection. I couldn't stand the sight of her face anymore, it was so scary. It'd been such a long time since I'd spent so many minutes just staring at her. I had to take control. So I bashed the bedroom mirror in, balling my bare hands into fists and repeatedly thrashing until I could feel the glass cutting into my skin.

It'd been so long since I'd last done that. Now every time I look, I can see her, feel her, I see her staring at her...our...reflection, through my eyes.",My Blank Mirror,7,nosleep
SeaDweller7,2,,2,1rhilw,,4,"I go to a regular school, its kindergarten to year twelve, so its pretty big. But, my school is an old public school, and the principle is ancient. Me? I am in year twelve, and I’m graduating next year, and my friends said I should share this story with you guys. 

Ok, where to start? Well, at my school we have a pretty serious problem with bullies, and when I say serious I mean it. One year our school was even on the news, but it was pretty traumatic. When I was in year nine, there was this little girl in fifth grade, called Melody. Her and me sort of talked sometimes, as she was a new girl and I was her school buddy (to show her around and stuff) She was a sort of short, curly brown haired, blue eyed and geeky girl. Glasses and all of that stuff, so your stereotypical nerd. Which pretty much was what she was.

After I moved up in to Tenth grade it was pretty clear that she was being bullied. Instead of gossiping or playing with the other girls, she just sort of walked around the school... bouncing a tennis ball and wandering around the grounds of the school. 

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

Then, half way through the year, school was stopped. During lunch they lined us up and called our parents. Sent us home. They just said there was an accident. My mother and father lived in Melbourne and I lived with my uncle and aunty, and they’re pretty laid back and all ‘come home when you feel’ so I stayed at school.

I saw five year six girls with that sort of ‘we know nothing it wasn’t us we didn’t do anything’ look on their face before I saw an ambulance and a white body bag. Out of the end of the body bag stuck out locks of curly brown hair, and the always-screeching birds seemed to sing a sweet tune. A melody.

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

Last week we had a substitute teacher who started screaming at a girl who was outside bouncing her ball after the end of lunch bell had rung. She didn’t realise Melody wouldn’t listen. 

No one knew why the back stairs from German were out of bounds for two months, and why the German teacher quit. No one asked why those five girls we’re stared at my Melody’s sort of... ghost.

I pieced it together. A simple push, a simple tumble. A simple death.

No one cares, all the kids just skip past her, all the laughter swallows up her silence. 

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

It has been a little over a year since I last wrote - just over a year since the last nightmare.  I was foolish to think I was somehow cured, that, as Dr. Lough suggested, getting it out of my head and into a journal would help.

I read back over my last and only journal entry, as I tried to describe the nightmare.  It is so chaotic and scattered, yet I'm unable to find any other way to convey the details.  That is the terror of the dream at its core - utterly chaotic.  Jerking from one sensation to the next, the hesitant probing of my fingers as they cover the smooth flesh where my eyes should be, to the damp defeat in realizing those fingers have torn away the protective lids in confusion.  All of this, in layers of sleep - waking to the comfort of my mother's figure, only to then know it is just another stage of the dream playing out, with her eerie voice echoing through my body:

""You're connected now.""

Even now, in understanding that my last entry seemed to bleed out through the pages, I'm struggling to form coherent thoughts onto this paper.  Each detail seems to tie into the next, only to fall apart when I try to see the whole.  I wonder what type of clinical association Dr. Lough could make?  Is this what schizophrenia feels like?  I have no way to explain it.  It is as though there is a novelist's grand plot line swirling around my body in paper shreds and each time I reach out I can snatch only a sliver of a scene, unable to ever piece the parts into an understanding.  I'm fairly certain this entry, and perhaps any subsequent entries, will be just as erratic.  I just cannot force these thoughts together.

So much has changed in the last year, it is so hard to recall my state of mind the last time the nightmare came to me.  I have a son now, nearly 6 months old.  We must have just found out Rachel was pregnant around the time I last wrote.  Could that have been a factor in the nightmare returning after years of peace?  Was my mind so overwhelmed with the thought of being a father, the changes to my life, the responsibility, it somehow dredged that old horror back from my subconscious?  I can't help but think it must have played a role.  It has been a blur, so many other things seem to have fallen into place.  Though they are exciting, it seems predetermined, somehow rushed.

Over the last decade I have had a slight obsession with the home I grew up in.  I knew I would live there once again - returning it to ownership in my family - though I never anticipated it would happen so quickly.  Rachel's grandmother died, leaving her an inheritance that allowed us to leap forward several years in our plans together.  It was Christmas Day, the day she died - I guess her last gift to us.  Three months after my son was born, we were moving back into the mountains, back to the walls I had called home as a boy.  

One thing I feel for certain, this home is the source.  The nightmare started here, always took place here, was always fueled here.  I'm beginning to remember things, or have recurrent thoughts I have not had for nearly two decades.  It is as though these things are unlocked from muscle memory as I walk this house.

As a child I would reach the top of the second floor staircase, which opened onto a hallway, always with my head down staring at my feet.  Left, at the end of a long hallway was a guest room.  Large floor to ceiling windows would reflect back a warped view of the person looking down to them.  Right, across a short landing was my bedroom.  I had trained myself to never look left at night - as the small nightlight by my bedroom door would throw twisted shadows onto my reflection in the long guest room windows.  If I would look up, I would become stuck in fear with the reflection.  The windows seemed to pulse with my heartbeat, flexing my body larger then smaller in the glass.  My feet became rooted in place, the black of the windows and the emptiness behind them tunneling out for me.  The nightlight would flicker in then out, each time causing my shape to jump forward, as though I were being pulled down the hallway towards the darkness.  I never remembered breaking loose, turning and walking back to my bedroom and going to sleep.  I would wake up in my bed hours later, staring at my hands, inspecting for blood and knowing I just had the nightmare. 

I learned, I kept my head down and did not look to the left.

Our first night in the home, that muscle memory followed suit.  After turning off the main floor lights, I climbed the staircase.  My son was sleeping against my chest, his arms wrapped around my neck and shoulder.  My head was down as I crested the top step, turning to the right, towards my room which was now his.  As I neared the bedroom door, his forehead left my shoulder.  His back straightened and his arm peeled away from my neck.  I felt his arm extend straight back behind my head.  I didn't need to look at his eyes, I knew.  Those eyes followed his arm to his hand, reaching down the hallway to the windows.  The nightlight flickered as he let out a giggle.  I took the last step into his bedroom and shut the door.

Sunny day in Nevada. Families having lunch outside, fathers teaching their sons how to grill steak, playgrounds
filled with kids. Every year I plan a trip with my son. Nevada has really nice caves in it. When I was little,
my father always took me there and so did his father. I didn't want to break this chain. I told Jake, my son, about that
cave that I used to visit but I did not have enough time to take him there until now. He was still sleeping when
I stepped in his room.
""Honey wake up!"" Jake opened his little eyes and whispered:
""What?""

""We are going to see the cave I told you about!"" he instantly jumped out of his bed and become so excited that
I can't even tell about it. He got dressed and ran to have something to eat. About five minutes later he was screaming
from the garage door.
""Hurry up mom!""

One hour car ride. Not the longest one he ever had. He kept asking me about the place. I just smiled and told him to
be patient. As soon as I parked the car, he blasted out the door and ran to the back of the car to grab two flashlights. 
""You ready?"" I asked him. He obviously was so we started walking towards our destination.
It was dark in there. Darker than anywhere else. Flashlights on.  He just kept pushing forward. Sometimes I couldn't 
even catch up with that little kid. After a sharp left turn I saw him standing there. He found it. The biggest hall 
in the cave. Every wall was shining when the light of our flashlights reached them.
""Beautiful isn't it?""

""It is indeed!"" he answered. He turned his head towards me but it was only q light at a corner 
that he could see. He totally crapped himself. ""Mommy wait for me!"" He started running towards the light 
that he could see. It is a maze down there. - MOM! - he screamed.
""I'm here honey!"" He caught up with me. He just gasped there and started to be a bit relieved as he realized 
that he was not alone in that dark cave again.
""Hey calm down little boy! I'm not leaving you here!"" went closer to him and whispered:  ""Or am I ?

Just woke up. Went to grab a coffee and brought in the newspaper from the yard. Sat down in the living room and started
 to read the front page.

jonssijonssi,0,,0,1rilff,,2,"Hey guys, I just wanted to tell you about my dream which kind of freaked me out. I've been having a lot of bad dreams for the past 3 weeks, but i think this one tops all of them. Anyhow, I dreamt that I lived with my boyfriend in a big house, it was night and we both were sleeping. Suddely i wake up, and I sit up in our bed. I'm fully aware that I'm sleepwalking but I can't stop myself, lay down again or do anything about my actions. I start walking out in a big hallway (this is where the main door is located), then I enter a smaller, much more narrow and dark hallway, and in the end is a small wardrobe-like room which is truly pitch black. This scared me a bit since I am afraid of the dark but I just keep walking, I don't even consider NOT to walk in to the wardrobe. So I find myself inside this pitch black tiny room and I close the door and I lock it. Once I have locked the door i just panic, I'm not afraid but I simply can't stop screaming, I remember the scream so well, it was a true scream of despair, I screamed at the top of my lungs but I still was not scared. I started to bang the door, the walls, everything while screaming and crying as hard as I could. Finally my boyfriend comes to the rescue and the door was open now, he just grabs me and tells me I was sleepwalking and I just said ""I know"" in the sternest voice. He's scared out of his life and crying and I just looks at him like he's crazy and then i just go back to bed like nothing happened.

ephique,0,,0,1rikrx,,4,"I grew up in a small town in Ohio with my mom, dad and big sister. We were a normal family, neither happy nor sad, somewhere in between. I was always interested in music as a kid so I spent most of my time playing piano, practicing guitar or trying my best to write my own songs. It was also some sort of medicine for me; it helped me drift away into my own world when my sister and my mom had disputes. You see, my sister was one of those rebellious teenagers at the time that had to have their own way or the rest of the world had to suffer their unfair ranting. I hated it; I hated hearing her yell at my poor mother.

During a lonesome walk home from school one day I got a call from my dad, making sure that I didn’t have any plans and telling me that I had to come home as fast as possible. My dad never called my cell phone unless he really wanted something so I knew right away something was up. I remember jogging most of the route home, since my dad sounded so serious. It gave me the creeps to say the least.

I jumped over the fence surrounding our villa and paced myself into our house. The kitchen was the first room you’d see upon entering and it was empty so I assumed they were in the living room upstairs. As I was making my way up the stairs I could hear my sister sobbing uncontrollably, something had definitely happened. My dad was standing up as my sister was sitting on the couch, he told me to sit down as well.

I was scared and curious at the same time. Dad and my sister never really spoke or had any arguments since my father didn’t bother caring too much about any of my sisters business, so I could figure out that this wasn’t about my sister. I remember sitting there in dead silence with the exception of my sister shedding tears and trying to keep her crying as quiet as possible. My dad was looking like he had no idea what to do or say, as if he didn’t know how to explain something to me.

Finally, after a long pause my dad made an introduction to whatever I thought this was about at the time. He said: “Your mother…” and then he needed to grasp some air, and he continued: “Your mother has passed away.”

I was eight years old and I couldn’t grasp that concept. I didn’t understand death, or that my mom was eternally gone. I just sat there as I was developing an irrational anger towards god-knows-what, I remember thinking how unfair this was. I do however forgive my dad for telling me so bluntly, he didn’t know what to do and he was in shock at the time.

My sister continued crying, she asked dad how mom died although it was obvious she didn’t actually care to know at that precise moment. She was just being desperate and no one could blame her. I thought it was my sisters fault when I was there, I thought that was why she was crying so much. I didn’t shed a single tear; I kept it all inside. Of course that didn’t mean this incident didn’t haunt me for years, I never stopped thinking about my mother. 

The aftermath of my mother’s death is what has been shaping my life the recent years. My sister was very weak emotionally and it basically drove her insane. My dad had to take her to an actual mental hospital. Something I didn’t even think existed when I was eight. This resulted in that I didn’t get to meet my sister very often, my dad kept telling me she was in a special school for students that wanted a challenge; but I overheard enough conversations to know where she really was. I guess my dad was trying to keep me out of it, and I didn’t blame him. 

I was guessing that my sister wasn’t doing very well at the hospital since we got to see her less and less as years went by, something that troubled me; I hated living in this big villa of ours with just my dad. It felt so dead, and my dad had been more kept to himself after mom died. We didn’t do anything, I literally spent all time at home in my room, making or playing music. Me and my dad didn’t even greet sometimes when I came home from school, it was depressing. My theory for his change in behavior has always been that he blamed himself for my mother’s death, something that I’m about to get into.

You are probably wondering how she died by now, and it’s a legit question to be asking. The best answer I could give you is that I don’t know. My dad has always told me she died of liver-failure but for some reason that has always sounded like a lie to me. It didn’t add up, my mom never had any problems with her liver before and she didn’t drink. I think it was something he made up when I was younger because he assumed I wasn’t mature enough to hear the truth. In addition to this, whenever I asked my dad about this matter he’d get heavily upset. Nowadays I never ask about my mom’s death, nor do I even bring up mom as a topic.

Years went by and I ended up being fourteen. It kept going like I just described, I spent most times in my room playing music as my dad did whatever he was doing on his own in the house. My dad did work, he had the night-time shift at a local bottle factory, I’m not joking, he actually made glass bottles for a living. He had higher ambitions but most of them got crushed when he and my mother got my sister, they had to move and dad basically had no other financial option than to quit the university he was attending at the time and get a quick and close job. You guessed it, the bottle factory.

I was riding my bike home late at night after spending the evening in the school library at one point when I was fourteen. My school was the type that had an after-school library that didn’t close till 11 pm. I didn’t need any of the books or supplies that the library offered; I just studied there sometimes since it felt less depressing than my father and our lonely villa. Either way, I hadn’t seen my sister for two years that night and I was starting to get the idea that I wouldn’t see her again for another two. 

When I arrived at the house the front door was open, “This is odd?” I thought. Upon closer examination I realized that someone had taken the spare key from its hidden spot underneath one of my mother’s old jars. It’s never smart to have a spare key hidden right next to the door, number one mistake people do when it comes to spare keys. It did look like whoever had taken it did suffer a struggle before finding it. The rug outside the door was all muffled up and there were scratches on the door, around the lock. I suspected we had been robbed so I pulled out my cell phone, ready to call the police. 

This is when I heard something coming from inside the house. I was dead scared to say the least, this could have been armed robbers or maybe something worse, I didn’t know. It sounded like someone was grinding furniture against the floor, trying to move it. It was so dark as well, I remember not seeing more than pitch black looking into the open door, technically if someone was in there they would have seen me because of the street lights. I started to slowly pace into the house, walking towards the noise. This is where I had to make a decision, was I going to suddenly turn on the lights in order to reveal whatever was in there or was I going to approach it in the dark? I picked the former. I was just going to switch the lights on when I could see someone strafe into the light coming in through the kitchen window. It was my sister, naked. My entire mindset had to change into a totally different way of dealing with the situation; it took me a good couple of seconds to assume she escaped the hospital. 

I switched on the lights in an instant. She had redecorated the entire kitchen, in the dark. Of course it all looked hideous and random; she didn’t know what the hell she was doing. I remember being in a slight discomfort, I had never seen my sister naked in my entire life. I also hadn’t seen her for a good couple of years at all. She didn’t look very comfortable either, she looked like she didn’t know who I was and was wondering what I was doing there.

I uttered “Linda?” out loud, that was her name. She didn’t respond, she just continued standing there looking at me. “Don’t you remember me, I’m your brother.” I still couldn’t get any feedback out of her; it was as if the wheel wasn’t spinning at all. I wasn’t sure what the protocol here was, not knowing the number to the mental institution or anything I figured I’d try to call dad, before I got to press the call button on my cell phone she uttered: “Don’t call dad.” This is when I realized she couldn’t be completely empty inside after all.

“You don’t want to call dad.” She continued.  I had no idea what to do, I assumed this was part of the reason she was in the mental hospital in the first place. Luckily my dad got home at that point, not coming from a finished shift at work. He had a good five hours at least left, I assumed the hospital had phoned him and told him about the situation. My father ran into the house as fast as he could.

This is when something I didn’t expect happened, he told me to leave. He pointed at the door as if I had no idea how to find my way out of my own house. I asked him where I was supposed to go, he told me to wait in his car. Judging from how serious my dad seemed I didn’t think twice about it, I ran out to the car. As I was sitting in the car I could see my sister walk past the kitchen window a couple of times, I remember how she made no effort to cover her breasts. I had no clue what the two of them were discussing, although I never saw my sister move her lips so I’m guessing my dad did most of the talking. 

After a couple of minutes my dad started to walk to the car, he joined me inside. I remember asking why he didn’t bring Linda with him, “Don’t call her that name!” he shouted in response. I was so confused at this point. Dad started the car and drove me to my only friend’s house; I didn’t see him very often though. I was a lone wolf growing up and I still was at this point, I didn’t really create any friendships. I remember sitting in the car as he ran up the steps to ring my friend’s doorbell, his mother opened in her night dress and looked confused. I assumed my dad made up some emergency story to cover what was going on in order to get me a place to stay overnight. I didn’t even know what was going on to be fair.

Whatever he told them worked, I got to spend the night at my friend’s place. Tim’s place, to be exact. It was pretty awkward I remember, I only saw Tim a couple of times a week and that was when we shared classes in Spanish. We got to be desk-mates because the teacher made up whom to sit next to each semester, so we weren’t very close. 

It was a Friday so there was no school the morning after; I guessed that made it easier for my dad, leaving him the freedom to pick me up whenever he wanted to. He did, but not before giving me enough time to fully experience the awkward breakfast conversations with Tim’s parents, both trying to justify me as Tim’s best friend. I don’t know. Tim didn’t have many friends I guess.

On the way home I asked my dad what was going on the night before and he basically stopped the car and stared at me, as if I was mocking him. I remember how desperate he looked, as if he had no fire left in his heart. He uttered the words: “Do you think I wanted any of this?” as he grabbed his hair in regret. “All I wanted was a normal family with no circumstances, and I’m not blaming you when I’m saying this because frankly you are the only sane member left in this livelihood of ours.” Is what came out of his mouth next. I tried to comfort him, telling him that he had done a good job raising me and what not; I really didn’t have a lot of cards in my deck at this point. I mean my dad was basically losing it.

When we got home he told me that he was sorry, and that I should go up to my room. I did go up to my room but I got to tell you; I was starting to get very anxious about my dad. I really wanted to know what the hell was going on. I spent that night recording some guitar sessions for a song and reading books while listening to some ambient records I had found online, I couldn’t sleep so pulling an all-nighter was my only real option. I was reading “A Brief History of Time” for a science project in school, I was somewhere in the middle section of the book and started to get dry eyes. I figured I’d go downstairs into the kitchen to get myself something to drink when I got shocked upon opening the door to the hallway. I saw my mother standing just outside, looking right at me for a fraction of a second. Had all this hassle from the last couple of days driven me insane? It freaked me out so much that I ended up never getting a drink. 

The image of my mother outside my door haunted me that entire night, I kept thinking about it as I couldn’t sleep. She looked deranged, scared and raw. The shortage of light sources in the hallway made her look like she was from a black and white 50’s movie. I kept begging for the sun to rise up, I even did that thing when you close your eyes and try not to open them because you never know what you’ll see. I might have been fourteen, but I can openly admit that I was dead scared.

It finally came to be morning and I ran downstairs, still not fully opening my eyes while passing the hallway. I remember greeting my dad who was sitting in the kitchen drinking orange juice. I was just about to pour myself a glass when he said: “I think I need help.” While holding the glass of juice as if he wasn’t sure he was going to drink the rest of it. I asked him what he meant and he said that he wasn’t sure, that he had felt very uncomfortable and unstable lately. He also mentioned that he was thinking of joining some people from his work in playing golf, he thought that could give him some relief. I told him that sounded like a pretty good idea, jokingly adding that it’s better than hanging around the house doing nothing. He looked offended when I said that, something I didn’t really understand since he obviously worked all night, so that would justify him sleeping through the days.

I understand that some of you reading this are wondering how the hell I could have been fourteen and still not know how my mother died. Well, it’s hard to explain how uncomfortable of a character my dad was at times, and it felt a bit like I was offending him whenever I had to ask because part of me did actually believe she died of liver-failure. I mean it was possible. Imagine if it was true, and I kept asking my dad as if he lied to me. That’s the type of thoughts I had in my head about the whole thing.

Having that explanation out of the way, I did summon the courage to confront my dad one last time. It was a couple of days after the conversation about my dad picking up golf; I just walked into his room unexpected. A part of me had wanted to do this for a long time because I really never knew what he did in his room; it looked similar to an office which is nothing he’d ever need since he was a labor worker in a bottle factory. He was actually sitting at his desk. Not only that, but the desk was flooded with paper-work of some sort, maybe he had picked up an accounting job for the factory during the day, something he could manage from home. I didn’t ask; I had a big enough question for him as it were.

I dragged out a small chair he had behind the door and figured I’d sit on it. It was somewhat squeaky and not very comfortable, better than standing up anyway. Then I leaned forward and I was just about to ask when he interrupted my train of thought by saying: “You want to know about your sister, and what happened the other night. Don’t you?” This is where I started to play along because he was already looking emotionally hurt, bringing up mom here would have been a car-crash. I told him that I was indeed there to ask about my sister. He took a good pause before he bluntly exclaimed it to me: “Your sister is not right in the head; she’s in a mental hospital.” I couldn’t believe he hadn’t figured out that I would have known this by then. Not wanting to make a scene I just pretended like I didn’t know. He explained the context, telling me that she couldn’t take our mother’s death. A tear started climbing down his cheeks, and then he asked me if there was anything else I wanted to talk about. There was no way I could bring up something as sensitive as my mother at this point so I told him that everything was fine, and then I left the room.

I realized on my way up to my room that my dad was fragile and very close to losing his mind in this problematic family business. I had no idea how I’d ever get the truth about my mother out of him. When I finally had landed on my bed in my room again, the image of my mom started crawling back to me. The grey scaled portrait of her in the hallway, was my mind playing tricks on me? I also had a slight feeling that I remembered it from somewhere. I mean it was my mom but that exact stare and look she had, not only did it frighten me but I swore I had seen it before. 

Night landed again, I hadn’t spoken to my father again that day. I was facing the same obstacle that I had the other night, I was too afraid to go downstairs because I thought I’d see my mother again. We all know you can imagine things in the dark, kids do it all the time. It’s as if your mind fills in the gaps, but that incident the other night was different. I got more scared the more I thought of it and figured that I’d open the door to the darn hallway, and turn on the lights in order to feel slightly safer. I’m not going to lie, I did open that door very slowly but as it turned out; there was no sign of my mother. I turned on the lights and went back into my room.

Still not wanting to go to bed, not only because it was spring break at this point but also because I was a bit scared I figured I’d listen through some of my older songs. I had loads of them; most of which weren’t very good however. I was still learning how to create music and I never really thought of myself as particularly good, especially not at writing my own songs. I guess I was decent at playing other people’s songs. I basically went through my songs in chronological order, it was interesting because was able to hear how much I had improved over the years. 
It took me a good three hours to get past most of my songs, and I was reaching the more recent creations of mine. I heard something in one of the songs that I never had paid any attention to before; it was a slight breeze of white noise in the middle of one of my guitar riffs. Knowing that this wasn’t an overworked track yet, it was made just days ago and I hadn’t gotten around to mastering it yet, I figured I wasn’t going to give it more of a thought. That was until the neurons fired, that track was made the day I couldn’t sleep, the day I saw my mother in the hallway. Being a bit gullible I figured that I’d give it a go using my acoustic headphones. I tried everything. I played the song backwards; I cut out bass, middle frequencies, high frequencies and even listened to individual recordings of the instruments and samples. I couldn’t hear anything suspicious, just that white noise. 

I was a bit disappointed, at the same time relieved. Although that white noise shouldn’t have been there, nothing in my room could have made a noise like that. I didn’t want to over-think the situation, so I ended up hitting the bed. Later that night, as I still had problems sleeping I was laying in bed listening to the same ambient soundtracks that I was using nights before, slowly dozing off to sleep. I hadn’t been asleep for much more than ten minutes when I started to ascend into that state of sleep when you’re in a dream at the same time as real life is somewhat happening to you. I could hear a thumping sound coming from somewhere. Before I knew it I got woken up by a loud bass noise, it sounded like some kind of a technical disorder. I continued lying in bed, trying to figure out if I just dreamt about the noise or if it actually occurred, this is when I heard a much dampened sound coming from the other side of my room. It sounded a lot like someone was trying to get some kind of sound device to work. It got quieter and quieter and when I thought it was about to disappear I could hear a voice; very distorted and unstable speaking in what I believe was Russian. 

It took me a couple of minutes but I finally realized what I thought the sound was coming from, I had left my old amplifier on from when I was playing guitar. I bounced out of bed in order to turn on the lights. I was overlooking the entire room as I hit the switch, for the blink of an eye, just next to the amplifier I saw my mom again; just as the light went on. The same stare, same face, still that black and white filtered look from before. I got so shocked I fell down on the floor, the noise coming from the amplifier stopped in the same instant. I wasn’t sure what to make of this, and I definitely didn’t want to tell my father about what I had seen, knowing he has already thrown one of his kin to a mental hospital. 

I had a lot of sleep to catch up on but unfortunately this wouldn’t let me sleep, I just couldn’t sleep at all. I never believed in ghosts or anything growing up, these two small incidents with my mom being my only experience in what could be categorized into the matter. I thought and assumed I was becoming what my sister had become. Whatever this all meant, and needless to say; I didn’t get any sleep that night either.

I met my father in the kitchen the next day, he was looking a lot better than the last time I had seen him. He kept going on and on about how much he was looking forward to playing golf with his work-crew later that afternoon. I was happy for him; he deserved some time out of the stress. After the conversation about an afternoon of longing for a spot in the shade and waiting for your turn on a grass field he added: “Have you been thinking of your mother lately?” As if he could read my mind. I told him that I was always missing my mother, and that I had indeed thought of her a lot lately. He stated that he thought I had. I had no clue why.  Short after that he left for playing golf.

I kept thinking of why my amplifier was acting up that night, I started recalling a clear memory of turning it off after I was done playing. In fact, I knew I did since the amplifier was connected to an electricity hub that I used to turn off a small lamp I had next to my bed, how could it have been on? I had no idea. 

Since my dad was out of the building I figured I could use this afternoon without his presence to get some answers. I stepped into his room to investigate what he had been doing sitting at that desk of his all those hours. I grabbed a bunch of paperwork and sat myself on the double bed next to his desk, it got me a slight reminder on how he hadn’t gotten rid of the bed he shared with my mother yet. The first paper I started examining looked like a letter of some sort, as if it was a letter inside a legal template of some company. I don’t know how I’d describe it better than that. After further examination I found out it was a letter from my sister sent to our address, I remember wondering why dad wouldn’t show me something like this: 

“Daddy, why didn’t you visit me last weekend. I thought you were coming back, I was waiting for you. I’m sorry if I made a scene, I thought something had happened to you! I ran to you because I wanted answers, no one has answers here. I’ve been getting visits lately, why can’t you come to me at the same time?”

I fixed some grammar and a whole lot of spelling errors for the sake of explaining this to you, my sister had the linguistic abilities of a five year-old in this state. On after-thought I guessed my dad didn’t tell me about letters from my sister since they would inevitably prove that she wasn’t in a special school for people who were after tougher challenges. Although thinking about it, that doesn’t sound ridiculously different than a mental hospital.

The rest of the papers seemed to be a real mixture of work-related things and records of local police-investigations. Why would my father be looking into cases of murder, pedophilia, rape and almost anything you can think of? It wasn’t really my business what he did with his spare time but this was just outright messed up. I knew he had a friend in the police force, that was either the reason he had these or just the tool he used to get them. I didn’t even want to know at the time, I had enough stuff on my mind already and I hadn’t slept in far too long.
I apologize to whoever reading this if it seems that I’m dragging it out with details a bit too much here and there, I’m only taking precautions to make sure that I’m telling it right. If I’m finally going to tell my story I want it to sound right. 

My father never came home after golfing so I assumed he went directly to work, which made complete sense. It was starting to get late into the evening and I had absolutely nothing better to do than to once again sit in my room, I was trying to figure out ideas for new songs on my guitar. This time I wasn’t using the amplifier since I was legitimately scared of the noises occurring again. My amplifier has been known to pick up foreign radio broadcasts before, something that explains the distorted Russian speech last time, I wasn’t worrying about that. I was thinking about my mother showing herself again. Not that I was sure that it had anything to do with the amplifier itself.

Not too long into that night I started feeling sick of being in-doors for so long, and I felt like I could use some kind of fresh air as a vacation from all this unexplained mystery I had been experiencing. I remember being on the sane side of the fence, thinking critically and trying to find solutions, not marking everything as if it was a conspiracy from hell. I figured I’d take my bike down to a local gas station, not more than ten minutes from my house; I wanted some chips, candy and maybe a couple cans of soda. 

I scrambled together some change I found in my room and took off; I got there faster than I thought I would. It wasn’t cold outside either; it was a pretty smooth night. After grabbing some generic brand of chips, Skittles and a couple cans of coke I paid for it and left. I didn’t spend much time in the store, but apparently enough time to get my bike stolen. With no bike, feeling like a stupid idiot for not locking it I had to walk home. 

Something out of the ordinary happened after this, and I wasn’t even sure if I was seeing things at first. I was walking on this huge open road; I guess you could say it was somewhat of a country road. It was tied together with the forest behind our house. It was the type of road that didn’t have any traffic other than truck drivers, passing once every couple of hours at night. I didn’t want to believe my eyes at this point but I saw my sister standing alone wearing what you’d imagine someone coming from a mental hospital would wear. I assumed she was looking for me; she was definitely staring at me. 

I continued walking, not necessarily fearing my sister. It somehow still felt as if I had a bond with her, that she would never have done anything to hurt me. As I approached her she didn’t give me any response what so ever, she was just staring at me in a light-blue scrub-coat, looking lifeless. I had reached talking-distance; I couldn’t believe this was happening. It felt surreal, like one of those scenarios you can’t be prepared for in real life. She had started to shake a bit, I couldn’t tell if she was freezing or if she was nervous. I asked her if she was looking for me out there, and if she had escaped the hospital. She didn’t respond. I got the notion that she was slightly scared of me, as if I was a threat to her. 

After a short gap of silence I noticed that she was holding something behind her back. I got a bit worried that she had some kind of a weapon, or a blunt object to swing at me so I stepped back when I spotted it. She started to slowly bring it forth, it was a plastic bag. From the way she was holding it I could tell it wasn’t heavy, or dangerous for that matter. I withdrew the step back I took earlier and tried to peer down into the bag, then she started to stretch it out to me: “I took this from your house the other day, I’m sorry. I think this belongs to you. Jonathan.” 

I do realize that I never told you my name, it is indeed Jonathan. I was slightly astonished that she had remembered my name even; she seemed to be so out of it. I remember grabbing the plastic bag, she wouldn’t let go of it too lightly either, it was as if she still wanted it. After I had gotten whatever was in the bag we shared another brief moment of silence, she wouldn’t stop staring into my eyes during these. Then she told me to never mention any of this to our dad. Shortly after she started walking towards the forest; as if she knew where she was heading. 

I saw the headlights of a car coming straight at me and my sister, whoever was in this car was driving way ahead of the speed limit. I noticed when it started to get closer to us that it was my dad’s car, acting on impulse I threw myself into a nearby ditch, as I got to witness my dad chasing after my sister. I didn’t even know if I wanted him to catch her or not, she was purposely running away from him. He dragged her into his car and they both drove away, heading the direction he was originally going. This was the second time she had successfully escaped this mental hospital, and how the hell did my sister make it so far both times? Something wasn’t right, I knew from when I was younger that the hospital wasn’t anywhere close to where we lived since my dad sometimes was gone for ten hours upon visiting her. Of course at the time it was supposedly a special school, but that doesn’t change the logic of it. He never brought me with him whenever he visited my sister, since he kept me in the dark about the whole hospital thing.

I ran the rest of the way home, trying not to drop anything; I still had all the items I bought at the gas station. I wanted to make sure that I could get home before my dad did; I had no clue whenever he would get back, and not wanting him to find out whatever was in the bag my sister gave me. I couldn’t spot my dad’s car in the driveway so I felt relieved as I stepped into the house. I didn’t bother putting my drinks in the fridge or anything, I made my way back to my room as fast as I could. I don’t really know why but I locked the door after me, as if there was something to fear. I sat myself on the bed with all the lights in the entire room switched on. I made sure to put all the bags with snacks in them aside; as I was getting ready to dig into whatever my sister ran into the night to give me. 

I never really thought of something until now, and that is how my sister could have found me. It must have been a coincidence, or she had been following me for a while; knowing she couldn’t approach me in the store. I don’t know.

I looked into the bag, it seemed to be random belongings from the drawers in our living room, and maybe some stuff from one of the cupboards we had in the kitchen. After sorting out stuff that had no relevance what so ever, for example there was a roll of tape in there. I planned to spend more time on the more interesting items. The first thing I picked up was a small collection of family photos, most being after mom died. The next thing I could grab was a couple of rocks; they weren’t even dry, I guessed she must have gotten those just before she passed me the bag. There was only one thing left in the bag, an usb-stick. 

I took the stick out and threw away the bag. Then I started looking at the photos as I was trying to reason why she would have taken any of these from our house. The only thing that somewhat made sense is that a couple of them were from when she wasn’t sent to the hospital yet, but it was pretty much pending already. In fact, most of these photos took place a couple of weeks after our mother passed away. On one of them it’s my sister showing off her prom dress she was planning on wearing, she actually wasn’t acting too badly the first couple of weeks. I guess she didn’t process our mother’s death until later or something. Another photo is of dad’s old car, he had to sell it in order to compensate for our family’s financial depression from when we lost the main income our family had, my mother’s candle business. He loved that damn car with his entire heart; we even used to joke about how mom was jealous of the car. 

There were more photos but I stopped going through them when I realized a couple of them had a handwritten marking of the letter “x” behind them. It noticed this when I was flipping them as I was trying to get them all to be facing me. I sorted the photos with no marking away and started to focus more on the ones with the marking. I figured my sister must have had done this, for what reason I was about to find out. I kept staring at the first picture; it was the one I told you about earlier, the one of my father’s old car. It was a Pontiac from the early 80’s and it must have cost him a fortune. I never had any particular memories of the car; I remember it spending most of its time in our garage.

I kept looking at the photograph and the more I stared at it the more I started to wonder why my dad hadn’t use the car more, he obviously loved it. The photo was taken for an ad in the newspaper, for selling it of course. I was just about to put the sad photo away when I caught a glimpse of my mother sitting in the backseat. It wasn’t very clear and she seemed somewhat transparent. She had the same drained-out appearance and blank stare that she had from when I saw her in the hallway outside my room, and this was taken after her death. I couldn’t believe what I was looking at. I remember dropping the photo out of shock; so many thoughts started circling inside of my head.

dinofinger,0,,1,1rie11,,1,"    17^th May 2007.
I followed my dad went to Grandma's house. My cousin who lives with grandma, had a suspicion that something had happen to Aunt L &gt; *Her initial would be appropriate here* &lt; Aunt L was never in her sound mind but she prefer to live alone which is the best option avoiding the troubles she would cause to others. Grandma has a problem of [nagging](https://www.google.com/search?q=nagging&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a) disease which makes more Aunt L better suit live far from her lectures. 

Back again to my cousin, who received a call from Aunt L's neighbour. Her respond was *there was a sudden silent for the past four days*. Aunt L was never a social person who goes anywhere she wants and always out. She prefered to live in her tiny apartment secluded only her herself and herself she enjoys being with. But her neighbour help us to watch for her just in case for anything. So we respond to go and visit her house. My father, my cousin and I, the three of us went together with nothing held us back. 

As we arrive by the door, we knock and knock. From the window we can see noise screen from her small tv at the corner. But there was no sign of her. Somehow her grill lock and the door were changed, the key my cousin brought didn't fit at all. Maybe she doesn't want us to barge in anytime we want. My dad took the liberty to call the locksmith while giving positive thoughts to my cousin that everything was fine. 

30 minutes pass. The locksmith do his magic and opened the door. Such stench came out in full loaded right to our faces. Right in front of the door we can see Aunt L laid still in the toilet facing the floor. A 15 year old me shocked and I just watched her body in strip condition only a towel covered her other half and her faeces was right below her and all over behind her. Yet she is still alive, blinking and gasping.

My dad pull me back allowing my cousin to go in. I can still feel my father clenches my arms so tightly when he saw his sister. He said ""*[I better call the ambulance](http://www.wikihow.com/Call-an-Ambulance)*"", so he did and left. My cousin call me out to help pick her up. But she was too heavy, we can't even push her to the side. So my cousin rinse her with water to clean her off. I was told to took a towel and wipe her face. I could say her face was in a total blankness. 

25 minutes later the ambulance arrive. They took her with a stretcher. Both of us went down to send her off. I can remember certain vision of some neighbours pry on their window looking out what was happening. My dad went together with Aunt L, so left me and my cousin. Soon my mom and sister arrive bringing cleaning equipment. We spent whole 3 hours cleaning her house. Based on what I heard my cousin said ""*The man who always deliver her food got no respond from her for three days. That's when he ask the neighbour if she had gone somewhere. I bet if we were too late, she might have gone by any minute unconscious on the floor*""


    18^th May, 2013
We had her funeral in the day after the day we thought she would died 6 years ago. Funny the coincidence of the date just *one day after* we laughed. My cousin gave a speech said she was a fighter. Indeed she was. I think her life is better after that 17^th May living in the retirement home. She was more happier than before she was a shut-in. R.I.P Aunt L, our auntie we always concern hereafter. ",Brief moments,2,nosleep

As I was doing this, the big rocking chair next to his litter box was swaying, and I gave him a quick glance. I felt him sniff at my ear. He then jumped off the chair and walked into the kitchen. I thought nothing of it for a few seconds, then froze. ""Oliver!"", I called. I then walked to the door and looked outside, he was napping on the steps.

echoes007,4,,2,1rhee9,,2,"I’ve always been a non-religious person. I was brought up by parents who told me to question everything. To not believe the crap that is forced down our throats daily. But I’ve always felt a whole in my life when it came to that stuff. I went as far as trying LSD and DMT to achieve this “religious experience” we all want, but I never got it. So, after a while, I just gave up and moved on and accepted there is no God, or spiritual experience, or anything that’s real, that will make me see life in a whole new perspective. Naturally, this got me down and depressed a bit. It was then when I started seeing 11:11 everywhere. It started one night when I was doing some heavy drinking and decided to do some coke lines. I remember vividly, my heart stopped, and I remember a sound, like a blender going off in my head. When I forced myself to snap out of what had happened to me, I remember the first thing I looked at was the clock on the cable box. It read 11:11. This stuck with me for a long long time. I felt like some force or spirit was forcing me to look at the clock when it was 11:11 in the morning and 11:11 at night. As if reminding me that it saved my life. This was going on for a while, when I went as far as Googling what it was. Unfortunately, the 11:11 thing was associated to some spiritual stuff, things I thought were bullshit to begin with. But still, 11:11 was always there. Slowly I stopped thinking about it, and my 11:11 experiences were less and less. It wasn’t until last week when I was driving home (I was butt sober) from an event when it started raining. My tires and brakes were messed up and I didn’t get a chance to change them, and besides, it hardly ever rains in this town, so this came as a surprise to me. As I was driving up a hill, I lost control of my car completely on the wet road, and was literally fighting my steering wheel and slamming on my brakes to stop the car, but I couldn’t. This went on for about five seconds until I finally stopped the car in the middle of the road. Again, when I snapped out of my panic mode, the first thing I looked at was the time, and it said 11:11. I’m not one who believes in coincidences, but this has me thinking I have some angel or spiritual entity looking after me. Even though I don’t believe this stuff, there is NO way that could happen. Has anyone else experienced 11:11, or has randomly been “forced” to look at a clock when it’s 11:11? Or is it my brain playing tricks on me because of the LSD/DMT I took? ",11:11,4,nosleep
Jerbsybear,0,,0,1rh5g6,,2,"There are tales of a man committed to Central State

Who killed his wife and children while he asphyxiates

His doctors with the bloody spinal cord

Of his fat nurse, who cares if she was old

When the guards rushed in, it was no problem at all

bashing their brutish faces straight into the wall

Bursting through the heavy front doors

He killed everyone on the first floor

No one would stop him, no, not this time

5 years of waiting, no stopping on a dime

He had to get out on this night

To meet his lover, one at first sight

Taking his science class, year after year

Convinced that she loved him, held him dear

Called her ""favorite student"" and all

Had her parents give him a call

To invite him to dinner, on a cold winter's night

Slaughtered her family, their faces were a sight

In the judge's court, he mercilessly pleaded insanity

When, in reality, it was egotistical vanity

If he couldn't have her, no one can

To kill her new parents was the plan

Standing outside of the house that was soon to be theirs,

Looking to seek justice, to seek what's fair

So as he broke in and brandished the knife

She knew he was back to take a life

So quickly she fled into the night

Leaving behind more victims, as she took flight

She ran two miles straight to the highway

Waving for anyone to stop, to go her way

As hand grabbed her from behind the bushes

His knife drives deeper and deeper as it pushes

Past her vitals and deep into her heart

All flashbacks of her life seemed to fall apart

As he whispers ""This...feels so right""

Her mind tries to escape into the night

The fires of his greed are not yet doused

As he tries to get back to the house

He plans to take another life

While sharpening his serrated knife

""Am I next, is he coming,"" you cry with fear

InsanityInABottle,0,,1,1rgw03,,2,"“Extra, Extra! The Piggy killer is at it again!” Yelled the paperboy, holding a darkened paper above his head, screaming the same phrase over again, as if it was no big deal. I walked towards him and asked him “How much?”
“Only ten cents sir.”
“Ha. Must be a pretty good story then.” I said, as I fumbled for a large dime. I handed it into the boy’s hand, it’s gleam bouncing the light of the sun, veiled through the mist of rain into my eyes. I blinked quickly and grabbed the paper, quickly turning from the boy, hearing “How about a tip sir?”
“How about you wipe your ass with the metal I’ve already given you.” I said back to the boy, who furrowed his brow and continued screaming for new customers. As I walked along Hero’s Avenue, I kept the paper open, reading it over again. In large font, shouted “Piggy killer’s new victim!” with a picture of a woman, apparently known by the name of “Jessica Turrow.” She wore a large smile on her face, as she raised a glass of champagne above her head for a toast, I presumed.
	The article read “The psychopath, depicted as a man with a pig’s head on worn over his own face, has struck again. Witnesses described him as large, while wearing a reddened trench coat, then finally, a bib, which read the term KISS THE COOK, slathered neatly against his chest in gore. He had organs and even a human spinal cord attached to his coat and as usual, was found was mist was floating through the air and at dawn. We had identified the victim, through a ring found on the hand of the woman, who had been chopped to pieces and nailed against the side of the church. If you are to spot anyone fitting under the description, contact the police immediately, or you may be his next victim.”
	I laughed as I watched terror shrouding the faces of everybody who grasped a paper in their hands, all walking along the street as automobiles drove recklessly between one another, threading the needle on the two way street, not large enough for two cars to fit on.
	I walked towards the police station, which was cleverly located across the street from a coffee shop, a brothel and a printing office. A police car drove by; it’s loud horn sounding, flashing red and white, reflecting the light from the rain directly into my eyes. I walked into the station, the smell of fresh cigars flooding into my nose. A man screamed from across a large waiting room, looking down at the paper, then looked up and said “Oh. It’s the wonderful Flynn. Of course my dear, come, come.” I walked past him, glaring at his smug face, and then opening the door into my office.
	A man sitting on a chair for those waiting to enter my office abruptly greeted me. He smiled and said, “Well hello sir, I am Dean Osterrietch and believe I have a lead on the notorious killer”
“The pig one?”
“Y- wait, there are more?”
“I believe there are, just they might not like attention as much as our friend here.”
“Well… thanks for informing me of that rather morbid concept, but I have gotten hundreds of pictures of the killer, coming out of his lair.”
	The man pulled out a large portfolio of pictures and dumped them onto my desk, arranging them appropriately. “So, if you look at these pictures, it was for when he first got into the business, holding small weapons, all identifiable, all related to the cutting of meat. Then as you look to the left, these are the later pictures, which are of him coming out, holding bodies on his shoulders, sitting in the back of his eatery and chopping them up, putting them into boxes and looking pleased with himself, all the while in his pig mask. But, he seems to be getting careless. He cam outside, barely slipping on his mask in time for my camera to flash a photo, his face seemed veiled in… something. Something sticky, something gruesome. But if you look closer, you can quite easily see the silhouette of his face. Large, hooked nose, eyes, clouded in blue, teeth, sharpened to perfection and a dripping mouth.”
“Ha. So you’re basically implying that you’ve seen a notorious killer walk in and out of a location multiple times and not even dared to act on it? I beginning to suspect you’re the killer!”
“But that would be silly. Why would a crazy give himself away?”
“I don’t know, why don’t you tell me?”
“I believe this conversation is getting a bit heated. I saw the ad in the paper that I should contact the police and thought I’d tell you where I’ve seen such events. Have you ever seen the abandoned butchery on 1800 Bellcove Street? Well there’s your place. Sir!” said the man as he gathered his pictures and threw them into his bag, which smelled of defecation and nickels. I watched as he slammed the door, then sighed and sat down on my desk, rapidly pressing the keys of my typewriter, updating the information I’ve received from the man.
“Mysterious man visits police station, says he has a lead on the piggy killer. As you all know, the notorious killer has crossed the line now. Enough to even be called a serial killer! What a sick bastard he is.” I continued being as pessimistic as possible, updating the paper, then grabbing my camera as I finished the article. Typing in my name, finishing with my name, saying “Written by: Flynn Covetail.”
	Darkness was beginning to shroud the air, perfect night for the killer to strike in his typical environment. Light rain was spattering against my window, racing down to the bottom of the screening, only to fall against an umbrella below. As I left my office, throwing on my coat, I screamed to the man in the front desk, “Going out to…oh, let’s see...1800 Bellcove Street? If I don’t come back, Phone someone.” I said with a laugh, while walking outside.
	Instantly my boots splashed against the small walkway paved on “Western Lagoon highway” as the frivolously worthless people would say. I walked down towards the street, which was naught but four blocks from here. I passed by Dontell’s Donuts, Redgar’s Rotisserie and Salam’s Spices, all involved in the fattening of desperate cops, as only fattening diners were located near the station, so I developed a theory that every restaurant owner is against us.
	I reached the butcher’s place, which had been looted to hell by the anarchists, who were just a group of thugs that didn’t do shit to overthrow the government. The door had been pried off it’s hinges, yet now it was replaced by a veil of chains, hanging off of rusted hooks attached to the doorframe. Within the butchery, the first thing I noticed was a bed, a homeless man sleeping on it.
	I simply ignored the bum and walked around, searching for anything considered suspicious. I walked through the door, smelling the bum’s shit in the corner and closing my nostrils as well as I could. I looked through the shop, behind the counter I found several rusted knifes, which were corroded to the counter, which was a wooden rotten thing, with three cutting boards lining it, all of which nobody needed. The front of the shop seemed completely normal, but I listened to the bum waking, instantly screaming, “Who’s there! I will kill you if you’re trespassing on my property!” I laughed and screamed to him “I suggest you run out of here, or I may just have to turn you in as a key suspect for the crimes.” I heard the scuffing of his shoes against the floor, running towards me.
	I quickly turned, backing up against the wall, my sidearm pointed at the bum and screamed “GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!” I shot to the side of the man, who quickly bolted for the door, a rat following closely behind him. I sat for a minute, catching my breath, while my vocal chords seemed to scratch against one another in a uncomfortable clunky fashion. As I stood, I felt the hard callused flesh of an arm pressing against the front of my throat and the sudden feeling of something hard hitting the back of my head.








	Ha. Damn fool didn’t even know what he had coming. Shouldn’t have fucked with my grandpa… shouldn’t have yelled. My ears hurt. Are they ringing? Why the FUCK am I here? I thought a conversation to myself as I raised the man into the air, the familiar heaviness of my mask pressing against my face, the pig’s blood leaking down my neck, warming me, keeping the cold away. I looked at my setup, which was simply the back room of a butcher’s shop, a heavy steel door muffling sounds on both sides of the fifty wood wide hallway of a room.
	Blood dripped into wooden bowls I’d gotten from the shop, the bodies of fresh meat hanging from the ceiling. Pigs, cows, chickens, even a few deer, but the most stubborn of prey, the pigs. The sticky cunts hung from the ceiling, their wrists cut, their feet missing, their hands stuffed into their fucking loud mouths. The damned pigs that walked the streets, reading their stories about who? About me! The beautiful man, who is dealing righteousness to the crazies, to the rich. Though they think that they’re so safe in their leather homes, they should be the ones making chairs; their dried hides need to be a part of furniture!
	Oh, what an inventor I will be! But the best part is, nobody looks twice at the photographer. Nobody looks at who’s behind the camera; they only care about the picture! And I am finally the one in the picture! Flynn, the little anus that believed he owned the whole world, because the police were backing him up. NO, NO, NO! YOU ARE MY FUCKING BITCH!
	I whistled a tune of sorrow and greed that humans so openly express. I raise him in the air, catch a hook to his leg and strip him down to his bare neck. This self-conceited asshole needs one thing. A hook curving through the cheek, wrenched from his cheek. He thought I was the killer? NO! THAT IS NOT THE FUCKING WORD!
	Oh! My friend is waking up! Finally a new toy to play with. Oh, what a joy he will be! Oh no! What will I say to him? I guess I’ll just wing it. I guess I’ll just talk to him.  Where will I display this beauty? Ooh! The police station! Mmm, how delectable would that be? To show the pigs that even their weapons can’t defend them from me. THEY ARE GOING TO LOVE ME! I am a hero. I love being a hero and don’t try to talk me out of my heroism! I AM AMAING!








	My eyes slowly opened, to find a man in a pig mask, the rotting dreaded animal seemed to have a grin on it’s face. I was hanging upside down and fuck my leg hurts! Why does my leg hurt? Where the hell am I? “Oh… you’ve awakened!” spouted the pig; it’s squeaky voice ringing through my ears. I screamed, “Help me! Help! HE’S GOING TO KILL ME!” 
“Now that’s not how you treat a guest, is it?”
“Fuck you.”
“Oh… language, language my dear friend. If you even try saying something like that, I will cut off your cock and feed it to my friend Mr.Squeaks over here!”
	I looked to where he was pointing, which was a large column in the room, a decomposing rat nailed to the pole. “Somebody is going to catch you. They know where I am!”
“Oh, I believe they do, if only your little desk friend was there to hear what you had to say!” said the phsyco with a smile. He pointed at the ceiling, which had two hooks on it, chains hanging from them and a headless man, blood dripping in a steady stream of thickness, into a wooden bowl. “Why are you doing this to these people?”
“Okay, okay, story time. Oh yay, stories! FUCK OFF GREG, THIS IS MY TIME TO SHINE!”
	I looked at the pig with doubt, pain shooting up my leg, throbbing slowly into my brain. “SO, let me tell you why I love my job, okay? Okay. So, when I was twelve, I thought, I’m going to take pictures of weddings! I’m going to take pictures of people in love, because everyone else’s happiness, is mine.” He said this, while pinning his right hand against his heart, which contained an extra few layers of flesh, sewed against his own, along with a tattoo, stolen from his victim.
	“Okay, so anyways! What do ya know! I’m doing that now! I am a photographer! I love people being happy. SO, I one day, was at this one glorious wedding, full of lovely people. I had started talking to a woman and a little, oh what is it called? Fetish of mine was developed. As we were in bed, I took out my camera and took shots of my experience and little did I know, I have a few other… kinks. I wrung my hands around her delicate throat, stuck my finger down her throat and felt the vomit shoot from her mouth! I felt the rush as eventually, she started to fuckin’ bleed! WHAT A WHORE! She began to cough up blood, she began to wheeze and it is as these coughs echoed from her throat, landing inside of my mouth as our lips touched, did I realize how wonderful blood tastes. Rich, creamy, delicious, blood, coursing from the fountains of our decapitated stumps. I invented ways of sucking people dry, licking them dry! Well, at first I was only an amateur, but, as I got better! Oh BOY did I start to love my job! Every wedding became a slaughter, every wedding gave me a new friend, because after all, nobody cares about who’s behind the camera! NOBODY GIVES TWO FUCKING SHITS!
	So, pretty boy, I believe it’s time; you… started looking into my eyes, whenever I snap a photo of your beautiful body.” He said this as his hand slid down from my chest, slowly down to my cock, grinning, spittle flying out of his mouth as he coughed, slid a blade against it as chopped it off. I screamed out loud, blood spurting from me and all the smile he smiled, then I fell asleep, never to wake again.

ReiKoroshiya,0,,0,1rgsca,,2,"Here I am and im going to write about some of the things that go on in my life. Sorry for bombarding you with some trivial things and please just hear me out.
how about I start at the beginning that seems easier. Well back in elementary, I was that kid the kid that really no one liked. I had a friend here and there but that's about it. I was basically a social outcast, 
I never really got my work done, I still don't. Note that I was a very, very angry child and no I was not spoiled if that's what your thinking, im the oldest of 3 kids who had been and are growing up in poverty, but my father is very good at managing money which means he is very cheap.
I had shared a room with my younger brother and for some reason I never grew out of the stage where you sleep with your blankets over your head. I had always liked horror even though none of it really scared me even in elementary in the 3rd grade I found an author by the
name of R.L.Stine and I had read tons of his books which remotely captured my interests.
A few of the simple things had scared me, and I most likely have experiences that I have blocked out of my mind, I don't remember much about my childhood at all.
I don't know why I can't but that's just how it is. I do remember bits and pieces though, not anything like birthdays, mind you. Here Ile give some examples, I remember
when I thought my stuffed animal had red eyes, I freaked out a little bit called my parents and my father calmed me down and took it away. Years later I went back and found it, and of course it wasn't scary anymore. Another example
would be when I saw a ""witch"" in my closet, but again my father came in and turned the light on to show me that there was nothing there, I had clearly saw something but it was gone as soon as the light turned back on.
Once he had left and turned the light back of the figure was back again. I remember when my body shot up in bed and I let out a blood curtling scream and my parents rushed into the room
and they had tried to comfort me and to calm me down I was bawling my eyes out while hugging my father he had asked me what had happened and I was just mumbling incoherently 
about it. I can't remember what it was that had freaked me out so badly. Something else that just pokes out at me was when I was lying in bed and I hear talking so I sit up strait in bed and I see my parents right there talking to each other I couldn't understand what they were saying because they were mumbling and I said hey and they say love you simultaneously and I said aww I love you too you guys, I reached out to hug them and they both just vanished and I almost fell out of bed(I got top bunk). Then their are the things that I have learned from my family throughout the years, not much really
they don't seem to want to talk much about when I was younger. I got that I was a horrible child when they brought me to church, and that I would bite and snarl when anyone got within an arms reach of me.
keep in mind I don't remember that about going to church, as a matter of fact I don't remember going to church at all. hmmm.... well skip forward to middle school where I had
actually made friends. I did got in so much trouble in middle school its not even funny. I could barely even go a week without at least one detention. Saturday school and suspensions I had gotten a ton too, now
drugs are prevalent where I live and when I say that drugs were prevalent I truly mean that, but honestly the thought of drugs never really appealed to me well I mean
certain ones that is, the only mind altering substance that I would actually want to do, smoke, drink, etc would be alcohol cause it seems fun and really any hallucinogenic drug and there
is no way I could get ahold of hallucinogenic drugs without paying a ton of money and with my broke ass I can't afford it and because of that im drug free. Not to much
happened in middle school, only a few things I started to get hellish demonic dreams (oh and speaking of dreams I have always been able to feel pain in my dreams so if
say I was to get ran through with a spear or had my flesh pealed off in a dream I would wake up and still feel it, I also talk in my sleep) which sucks ass, The vast 
majority of my dreams became violent and with me being an avid gamer there was usually a sword nearby in my dreams and usually I could and would fight back and be home
free. I enjoyed those violent dreams where I won, even though I would battle hellish creatures and people I wouldn't consider it a nightmare. I got my own room in the basement which was nice, and well my brother he was, how do you put it? 
Gassy so yeah hot air rises and all that. Electronic malfunctions had started occurring, like waking up to my radio playing static, my alarm clock started to malfunction, etc. I remember waking up minutes before my alarm clock 
went off I awoke with a shot of electricity to my left ear. Skip forward to highschool in the 9th grade I found out what creepypasta and scp were it was amazing to find real horror for a change.
I read the hell out of creepypasta's and found some really cool narrators for them, listening to those was very enjoyable I didn't read scps often and I found a very long series called the holders.
Near the end of the year I started to feel a presence in my room which was interesting because it didn't have a bad feeling to it, the only word that comes to mind to describe it would be light if that makes any sense.
Jump forward one more year, I had flunked my freshman year because I don't do my work. On those professional tests that they make you take S.A.T's or some shit I did 
insanely good on those like I should be an A- student overall. Now i reside in alternative ed. Im 15 right now. I declared to my parents that im agnostic instead of
Baptist a few months ago. Anyway that presence in my room i hardly feel it anymore and now there is something more sinister and not just in my room anymore.
That thing I actually saw it, I fucking saw it, it was short like about a foot and a half tall. I went to bed last night and you know how earlier I had said I sleep
with my blankets over my head. Well I was moving around under the covers and I glanced out underneath the covers and there it was just staring at me a few inches away 
from my face I had to resist not to punch it because half of me was saying its just my imagination and the other half says that if its real  then im going to freak the fuck out and well I never did hit it and its creepy as fuck that its been watching me. I tried to calm my breathing as to not alert it to the fact that I have seen it I
think it knows I saw it because I have been getting glances of it all day. It might have seen me and it might be watching me type this.
It is very short and I can never manage to see any features on its face it just looks dark like a shadow its really, really dark, everything distorts when I look at it like my depth perception gets thrown off and space distorts around it.
If anyone knows what this might be
please tell me.",My Life.,2,nosleep
highchairchildren,3,,1,1rgqmu,,2,"I'm looking for any input. If anyone has had experiences like this, is there a way to stop it?

So this started about two years ago. In the beginning it was just a perpetual bad feeling, like something bad was going to happen all the time.  I was anxious, always alert and never at rest. I hardly slept, primarily keeping myself awake in order to feel safer. 

Then, I started seeing things.

When I say seeings things I don't mean like hallucinations, well not really. I'm not crazy. There were never any voices and there never have been. It was more like a blackout moment in which the worst possible scenario for my environment would play out seemingly right before my eyes. 

Mostly accidents.  It happened once while I was sledding.  The hill was a steep drop and then inclined back up about 20 ft. or so where it met a busy road. Usually people lost momentum and slid back down the hill and came to a rest in the valley but sometimes, people would make it all the way up and hit the metal road block that was put up along the hill. A watched as a kid went down the hill and then it happened. I continued to watch as he went all the way back up the hill and under the metal road block right into the speeding car that was passing by. There was blood everywhere. I snapped back to reality and looked around. Everything was fine. There was no blood, nobody was hurt, just kids sledding around having fun. 

I continued to have random ""visions"" for the entire year. They varied in severity. The worst one left me shaken for a few days afterwards.  I was home babysitting my younger sisters and boiling pot of spaghetti for dinner.  I moved to the sink to strain the pasta and then went back to turn off the electric stove.  My little sister approached me to ask a question and then I had my flash.  As I was seeing it, I grabbed her by her hair and pressed her face into the stove. In that moments I watched as her eyes rolled around in her head and she screamed, begging me to stop.  I snapped back and couldn't speak. I teared up and thought I was going to puke.  I ran to the bathroom, washed my face, sat down on the ground and cried. I had never felt such a mixture of fear and remorse in my life. I got up and reentered the kitchen, finished dinner and continued the night as if nothing happened.  She asked me what was wrong and I played it off as a bout of sickness.  I sat awake for hours that night and I still couldn't come up with a reason for why this kept happening to me.  I asked my mom to see a psychiatrist but unfortunately it was a luxury we simply couldn't afford. 

Then it stopped. As quickly as it came in it left and I had no more of an idea about what it was than I'd had before.  It stayed away for a while. I mean really a long time.  I was vision free for an entire year.

I was prompted to write this because I had another one the other.  The first in over a year but I am scared. I don't want it to start again.  The most recent one was more subtle.  I was shaving in the shower went as I brought the razor up my leg, somehow or another I cut myself and there was blood everywhere.  The tub was washed red with it and there was nothing I could do but stand and watch as it oozed out of my leg and swirled around in the water before going down the drain.  Then I flashed back and it wasn't there. I hadn't even cut myself.

I know this must sound crazy, like some Final Destination bullshit.  I swear to you I wouldn't have posted it if I didn't have hopes that someone could help.  Any input is welcomed.",Can anyone help?,3,nosleep

You might remember my journal entries from last month. Last month, I can't believe it's been that long. Days and weeks run now in an endless loop. Where I am now time doesn't matter. It's a nuisance, it's a hinderance. 

A lot has happened. I just wanted to let those who cared, who reached out to me, know that I am alive. Very much so. And I have met some friends. Real human beings. There is so much I want to tell you. So much I want to explain. But I can't. Not now. 

Just know that the monster under your bed is real. That shadow in the closet exists. And those voices, the voices you hear in the dead of the night are not your imagination. All your life you have been told horror stories. And now you seek them out, on this subreddit. To be entertained, to be thrilled. But these stories exist for a reason. Every story has a truth. A small bit of reality wrapped around trigger words and exaggeration. 

That truth is what lurks in the shadows of your house, just at the corner of your eye. The truth is what is waiting for you when you close your eyes to sleep, hoping for a peaceful night's rest. But nothing is peaceful in the dark. Where the light is eclipsed by the slithering, rotting presence that knows you oh so well. One day you'll know. You will wake up and know. All those stories. All those scary tales. All those fears.

Are real. 

It doesn't take much to become a monster. All you need is the dark to find it's way in. ",I am the monster,6,nosleep
bass_slapper,0,,2,1rh8lh,,0,"*You think me cruel. No. I’ve only learned to act on what I’ve been given. I’ve learned to deal with my problems in my own way. No one understands this but me it seems. This is for ME, I don’t do it for them. But they can’t understand my need. He can’t either. I must make me. Make him understand. How did he get here? I wish I came back. I want him back. WHY WON’T I COME BACK WHY IS HE HERE ARE YOU SORRY ARE YOU SORRY ARE YOU SOR-*

Past this the note is unreadable, spewed with a fluid I can only assume is meant to go on the inside of people. Not that I’d really want to read much more anyways. I already know what happens. Well, not really “know”, but I can feel it. Who wrote it? I can only assume it was my dear Uncle Drewson, if he’s even my uncle. What is this? No clue. A note, obviously, but beyond that speculation reigns. Where did I find this? My new house, in a drawer. Nothing is inherently terrifying about that – Oh, except that it was under the clothing I had already packed there. I just missed it before, I keep telling myself. I half believe it. A few pills later and I’m not worrying about it anymore.

Before this, I didn’t even know I had an Uncle Drewson, let alone that I was to inherit his estate in the event of his untimely, but now enacted, demise. With a heavily estranged family, growing up in between various friends or close relatives passed around by uncaring parents looking to shirk responsibility, one loses track of aunts and uncles. It was in a familiar neighborhood, a spacious three bedroom, so I was in no way eager to turn it down. As a poor, regularly unemployed person I’d been accustomed to sleeping on generous friends floors in the all too often occurrence I couldn’t afford anywhere else. I thought, it’ll all be worth it one day, the day I make it in the world. I can pay all these people back tenfold. “The day I make it”, yeah right. A consistent – and more pressingly, free – living space was a welcome antonym to my recent fortunes. So I was moved in within a couple weeks. Absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened. Till that note seemed to start some kind of vicious domino effect on my life, I was content.

You know when you think back to something embarrassing, stupid, or otherwise shameful act you may have done in your younger, brasher days? Once you recall it, it starts eating away, regret seeping in to every corner of your thoughts, till you would give the world to go back and change it, or at least erase the memory. Imagine that, only you can’t remember what it was you’ve done. It’s simply gone from you. The more you try, the less you realize. The less you realize, the more you regret. The more you regret, the more you try. That’s what’s happening to me, ever since I moved here. But it even goes past that. It’s the sudden feeling you’re being watched from barely out of sight. And at the same time, a crushing loneliness in that feeling. I pop a few more pills. Of course, I’m not being watched. There’s no one else here. If you think you’re being rather clever, figuring this out, oh-no-someone’s-been-in-the-house-with-you-all-along, I was most certainly the only one here. Anyway, this was about the time I found the note. If it was this Drewson, what is he talking about? Who does he want back? What is his need? Do I even want to know the answer to any of these? Insatiable curiosity will ensure I do, personal preference notwithstanding. Putting it all to the back of my mind, I chop up steak for dinner. I like to think of myself as a fairly accomplished chef, particularly where matters of slicing and/or dicing are concerned. I once worked a sushi bar, as a side job to pay the bills, and was quite proud of my ability to launch various morsels into the air and sever them in two with one fell swipe, like you see in commercials. Until the day my knife slipped and nearly skewered a customer’s eyeball. Maybe I’m not quite as proficient as I thought… I grab the bottle of pills and take a few. I don’t really like thinking about that time in my life.

I’m digging through my drawer later, that same drawer, when I stumble upon another discovery. Instead of a clue, it only deepens my mystery. A USB stick is secured to the very back of the board. I carefully remove it, and spend a few minutes simply gawking at my find, my inner curiosity again sparring with my better senses. I think, this will perhaps answer some questions about the note, and hopefully clear up my imaginations conjuring brought on by its conclusion’s implications. As per your previous assumptions, I couldn’t be farther from the truth. I secure the stick in its dock. View files. Two folders: “Reminders” and “Media”. Reminders is empty, media contains one subfolder: “Vids”. I open the folder. Two more: “memories” and “triggers”. Memories is empty. I open triggers. I’m confronted with one video file: shotinthedark.wmv. It’s 0:40 long. I press play.

Before I continue, if you’ll permit me one aside to validate the severity of this. I’m a massive horror movie fan, and I like them brutal. The more blood and guts, the better. I like truly graphic, heart wrenching stuff, and I very rarely squirm at it. Three seconds into shotinthedark.wmv and I rushed over the trash can to puke what felt like my very soul out. The scene I’m immediately confronted with was a man on a chair wearing nothing but an undershirt and briefs. There is a single light source on the chair, but I can faintly make out a figure in the background. Then, without a word, the man’s brains are ejected out his face, accompanied with a thunderous bang. Bone and cartilage spew forth in the foreground. Nearly black red sludge runs down his white undershirt, accompanied with brain matter that had just been crackling with life, likely flooded by fear, but life. I don’t have too much time to process anymore; I’m preoccupied with regurgitating my expertly made steak into the wastebasket. I think, it must be fake, but I know it’s not. I’ve got to tell someone about this, I think, the police, someone. Yeah, I’ll talk to the cops. Then, over my subsiding retching, I hear a familiar voice utter “Are you sorry now?” in the tone of a disappointed parent talking to their disobedient toddler. Something in that voice is chilling. Something… I return my gaze to the computer screen, where the barely visible figure now stands in full view, smiling.

I recognize the smile too.

It’s me, smiling back at myself, gripping a smoking sawed off.

The computer screen goes black. My head spins. I lie down.

youngsterjose42,1,,5,1rge20,,1,"He woke up in the morning like every other day. Yet this day was different; Jordan was going back to school after being expelled last year. He was caught with drugs and his school wanted nothing to do with it. He moved, now resides in york, Pennsylvania and now goes to William Penn High. He moved to a house which was quite old and just had some renovations a while back. The rent was quite cheap so his mother said ""why not?"". I was one of Jordan's first friends, since moving to york he told me things about that house really strange things. He soon moved away a little after I moved away so I have no idea where he is now. If any of you happen to live in york I'm talking about the old burned down house on market street across the street from the kindergarten/daycare. This story takes place about 2 years before the house burned down. 

A month since school started and about two weeks since I started talking to Jordan he invited me over to his house. Jordan said ""cmon dude come and stay the night my moms gone and im pretty sure wont give a shit"". So I thought why not I haven't spent the night at a friends house in a while ""yea sure ill spend the night man"". We went around town skated for a while, went to McDonald's with a few other friends then it came around 10 or maybe 11 everyone was ready to go home and i was ready to just go to a place and chill, play video games, and maybe eat some more. We got to his place, sat down in the living room, and lit up a blunt. Playing grand auto 3, high off our asses, we ordered some pizza. We ate and everything was fine till I felt like heading over to the bathroom. As soon as I opened the door I notice under the sink there was like a small cabinet and the doors slammed shut. I was high so I didn't really questioned it much. I used the bathroom and then as I exit I suddenly hear a giggle coming from under the sink. A child's giggle, as if there was a kid under the sink playing hide'n'seek or something. Again I did not question it because I was high and didn't really wanna bother finding out what made the noise. Jordan passed out on the couch, I went to his room and tried to sleep on his bed. I remember waking up around four in the morning hearing footsteps and a child giggling I'm pretty sure it was a little boy. I couldn't really tell his age but he was young; I would guess around six or seven. He was running around the house and he stopped at the door I did not see him, I only ever got to see his outline. He said "" I'm really happy I got more friends to play with now"". Suddenly after that he vanished faster than I could blink. I didn't sleep for the rest of the night. I had goosebumps for a good 30 to 45 minutes. Eventually I  calmed myself down by eating pizza and watching TV.",Hide 'N' seek,6,nosleep

We all automatically stopped and looked at each other for about a minute, then we got up and ran to my room.

Mindlesssavage,4,,8,1rhawv,,0,"I have a Where's Wally book. Well, had. Why? I'll tell you.
So I was just searching for Wally at night like I usually do, and I heard a noise.
It was sort of a scratching noise, scratching with a walking cane maybe.
I went to investigate. I went out of my room and...
Nothing.
Maybe it was just me. I went back to my bedroom door. I saw something written on really drippy red paint.
It said ""Find me if you can"". I thought it was just my little brother Mike painting on the walls again. ""Where was Mike anyway?"", I thought. Then I remembered he was outside playing with our pet dog Molly. ( Don't ask me why he was playing in the dark, because I have no idea).
I went inside my room. That's when I saw it. The book was lying on the ground open. I picked it up. This is what the title said:
""yllaW s'erehW"" Now THIS was weird. I also saw the same Wally picture except his eyes were gone and blood was dripping from them.
It was possessed, I thought. I ran outside to bury it, and I stepped on something. It sounded like it was glass because I heard it shatter.
I looked down.
A pair of broken, black rimmed glasses. I ignored it and ran even faster than before.
I ran to my dog Molly's kennel. I always feel safe when she's with me.
She was whining in the corner. That was typical, though. But wasn't she playing with Mike? I shouted out, ""Mike! Mike! Can you hear me?""
No replies.
I ran to the middle of the yard to bury the book.
I stepped in another thing. It was squishy, and slimy.
I looked down.
Blood. Blood and guts.
And Mike.
Lying on the ground.
Stomach open.
With a walking cane through his heart.
I wanted to cry, but then I saw a little Post-It note on the cane.
A poem.
This is what it said:
""I can run, and I can hide.
Tear you apart from the inside.
Waiting in the darkness, with my cane.
Used to be for children, now insane.
Red and white, in the grey fog.
Running around with my little pet dog.
With my girlfriend Wenda, with her camera,
And an old man with a white beard.
The prisoner who escaped from jail, murdering people with no fail.
That's my gang, with no doubt.
When you're in with me, there's no way out.""
This was way too bad to just BURY. We had to set it on FIRE. Or RIP IT APART. Just destroy it in whatever way I could.
So now in my backyard, a grave for Mike, some burnt and ripped pages, shattered glasses, and a walking cane.
And to this day, I never read another Where's Wally book again.
And every night, I still hear the sound of a scratching walking cane against my bedroom door.

kimmiekissies,13,,29,1rgt5c,,122,"I never even met him, I didn't know his name or face. I was, blissfully unaware, of his very existence.

 I will never know why, or when it started. I'm glad for that I guess. I moved into my very small apartment in February last year. My landlord, Olivia, was a sweet older woman who would cook to much and bring me much appreciated leftovers. She was great to me, even after telling her my problem. I'm antisocial, but she didn't mind renting to a reclusive young girl who reminded her of her daughter.

 Every few weeks she would knock on my door then leave, letting me know she was leaving something for me. I loved that. Not even my family would cook so well. The next morning I wash and leave her empty containers outside my door and by an hour or so she would take them back again. My other neighbors seemed fine, but I never talked or visited with them.

 I work from home so anytime I ever was forced to go out I rushed out and into my apartment avoiding an, uncomfortable situation. I loved living alone, it was everything I hoped for. I could just, breathe. By April though, I started noticing things were not right. They were moving, or plain disappearing. I was convinced it was just anxiety caused by my new medication and the move, another side affect was it would make me so drowsy. Since I hated seeing the doctor I just dealt.

 I took naps during the day now and eventually stopped caring. Until one incident doubled my paranoia, Olivia brought me some sort of greek tossed salad and dressing for lunch one day and I enjoyed it with my friend netflix. I fell asleep in the middle of Portlandia, and woke up that evening at 5pm. Per usual, what was not usual was my bedding on the opposite side of me was disturbed. I only sleep on the right side. Always. Even more it felt.. *warm.* My first thought was I must have rolled around a lot, but I knew it was to odd to dismiss. 

I got up and searched my apartment gripping my phone with 911 typed in. Nothing else was disturbed, everything was exactly like it should be. I let it go, for the next few weeks everything was normal pardon the occasional misplaced shoe or drawn back shower curtain. I thought about telling someone, my parents, maybe Olivia, but if it's not life or death I am not reaching out to anyone. 

I wasn't scared, I was nervous, maybe a little stubborn.. But I stayed. I am not letting some stupid anxiety ruin my lovely lonely world.
 May came and It was getting worse. My panties, toothbrush, hell even my food was being misplaced. Every time I woke up there was this strange odor in the air. I finally realized this won't go away by ignoring it. I called my mom and begged to come stay a few days, when I got home I told them everything. Saying it out loud solidified any creepy suspicions. 

That weekend my dad went to my apartment and what was found was true horror. Written all over that walls: ""COME BACK"" ""BABY PLEASE"" He ran out and called the police. There was no one living in my apartment but someone definitely had access besides me. 
The investigation revealed a man, Henry, the son of my landlord Olivia, was in a projected relationship with me.

 They showed me his confession on tape. He admitted coming into my apartment every night and everyday with his mother's extra key. He claims we were in love and he had my permission. He drugged his mother's food she left out for me causing my drowsiness and falling asleep so he could come in and watch me sleep, touch my hair, kiss my shoulder. The leftovers I had in the fridge were tested and confirmed.
 I was absolutely, horrified and disgusted. A man, I never knew existed, collected my drain hair, clothes, and trash and practically lived in my apartment for *four months.*

Thanks to everyone for your responses, I have taken a lot of your advice.
I'll just give you all a quick update on what happened after I posted yesterday. She ended up having a nap after sitting in front of the TV for a few hours. I was going to walk our dog, Zeus, but I decided to wait until she woke up just in case she woke up and was confused.


She woke up after a couple of hours and was.....well. Happy. Really, really happy. Almost manic. She woke up full of beans, and smiling like a maniac. I was initially relieved. I asked would she like to come for a walk with Zeus and I and she happily agreed. We set off for our normal walk, and she was extremely energetic, bounding off in front of Zeus and I. Zeus is a Labrador, and although he is a big boy, he's still a pup. We usually just meander along on these walks while he sniffs at everything along the way. But she set a cracking pace and Zeus and I struggled to keep up. 


We got up to this park where we usually let him off his lead for a while as we're trying to train him to not run off on us and to be sociable. It's always been a real task getting him back on the leash though, he never ever comes when he's called. Anyway, we let him off, and he's running around and smelling everything and peeing on anything that stands still long enough. My wife, she's picking flowers and sniffing them, and singing. She gets on the swings at the park and I push her for a bit, as she sings under her breath. I was feeling quite content at this point. Figured she must have just been over tired.


She's swinging vigourously when all of a sudden she comes to a dead halt. She yells, in an almost unfamiliar, masculine voice, ""Zeus! Here!"" and points in front of her feet.


I stood in disbelief as I watched Zeus, the most disobedient rascal of a dog I know, solemnly trot over to where she's pointing, sit in front of her, and stare up into her face. They both sat there for a split second, very still, looking at each other. I picked my jaw up off the floor and asked her ""Um..what the hell! How did you manage that!"" and that seemed to break both their concentration and Zeus shot off like a bat out of hell again, and she started swinging again - ""Oh"" she said, ""I used my mind to call out to him...it's something new I learned..""
She seemed kind of sheepish about it to be honest. I pressed her for more details, but the more questions I asked the more defensive she got. She knows I don't believe that for a second. I'm just happy that Zeus is finally starting to be trained. That's really the only explanation. I asked her to do it again but she refused, so I think we both know it was a fluke.


The rest of the afternoon was....nice. Kind of odd. It's like there's something that's amiss. Like when you walk into your messy bedroom and you can tell that *something* is not how it should be but you can't pin point what.


We talked a bit about the seminar. She said that it was very intense. The days were very long. She said that the premise of the seminar is to get to the root of any emotional upset, to explore the root causes for what's going on in your life. I asked if any hypnosis was used, as suggested by you guys, and she said no. They talked a lot, and were assigned to small groups, and encouraged to open up and explore their ""inner beings"". She said she felt a lot better since attending.
Still, something was not quite right. For instance, we were talking about my sister who lives in another state, and how she had recently got a new job. A few minutes later, my phone rang and it was her. I picked it up and said ""Emma! Speak of the devil..."" and my wife smashed me up the side of the head, causing me to drop the phone and shouted ""Emma is NOT the devil!! How could you say that!!! Emma is NOT THE DEVIL!!"" I told Emma I would call her back and tried to get my wife to calm down. She was very upset at what I had said. She sort of went silent again, and was very still. She seemed rather annoyed at me, but by this point, I was nearing exhaustion myself, so I let her be.

She fell asleep early, about 8pm, on the couch. I covered her with a blanket, and noticed that her eyes are kind of half opened..... I used to have a friend who slept like that at school and I've never noticed it before, I think that in my state of hyper vigilance, I am being overly perceptive of small details.
 
I read more of my original post, and all your comments, and decided to step outside and call our therapist, just to find out more about the seminar, as I knew she was there assisting.

I walked out onto our back porch and lit a cigarette and rang her. She answered on my first ring. What she said has really weirded me out. Only because although she gave me a lot of information, she has raised many more questions, as well as answered them.
 
She said these seminars are more like interactive workshops run by a man named Brian and his wife Linda, who are both self-appointed ""psychotherapists"". She said that there are psychologists such as herself on stand by to assist because sometimes when people are in such a vulnerable state, they may need assistance. She said she has referred a lot of her client's to attend these workshops and has found them to be helpful in most cases.
 
Basically, the course is about discovering your inner self, and using different methods to connect to your inner voice, to find out what the cause of your worries are. She said that it is incredibly demanding and intense. Each session goes for 14 hours with only an hour break. During these sessions, many different activities and topics are explored, including, regression. Apparently Brian does this 3 hour session on the second last day, where he gets everyone to meditate, and be still, and he regresses them back to childhood, or even, in some extreme cases, past lives. Our therapist said, it was so intense that she had to fight from being regressed herself. She did make comment that she had been concerned initially about how my wife would handle that, but that she seemed ""brighter, had a clarity about her"" after this experience. They discussed what my wife had gone back to, in her mind, and the therapist was happy that it hadn't caused her any great distress, but reminded me she couldn't discuss the specifics. She said when she wakes tomorrow I could gently try and open the lines of communication with her and she may explain her ""experience"".
 
I told her about my wife's strange behaviour. She said it is normal to be a little out of sorts after one of these sessions, but nothing major. I don't know if it's just me, but I could sense a tiny bit of alarm in her voice.... I don't know, maybe I imagined it. She said to call her if there's any further problems.
 
I hung up, and as I was putting out my cigarette, I turned to go inside and my wife's standing there staring at me. I jump and say ""Jesus Christ honey you scared me!"" and she replied ""Not as fucking much as I'm going to scare you.""
 
Ummm ok. I had to physically turn her and direct her into the house. In the moonlight she almost looked like a stranger to me. Her long blonde hair was hanging in her face, and her face was fixed in this awful scowl. I figured she must still be pissed at me from before. I put her to bed and she goes back to sleep.
 
And, well, that's where she is now.... she was supposed to be off work today too, but I was meant to go back to my job. But when my alarm went off, I just had this weird feeling that I should stick around and make sure she was ok. I rang in sick for work, and I'm just doing some household jobs, waiting to see if she's better when she wakes up, and googling what regression means, and what these intense emotional exercises can do to someone. Still nothing that convincing though. I dont know. Maybe I'm *too* skeptical. I just don't believe this crap.

The whole thing sounds a bit stupid to me, if I'm honest. But I have to say, it has caused some kind of change in my wife. She is very extreme in her emotions at the moment, and I'm worried, because we both have to go back to work tomorrow, and her work environment is very proper. She is always a perfect employee, and very dedicated to her work. I can't help but feel concerned that she might wake up tomorrow and still be in this....mood. Do you guys know anything about this ""regression""....is it the same as hypnosis? She was adamant she wasn't hypnotised, but it sounds like it to me!!



EDIT: Ok now I'm getting really freaked out. I went to check on her and she was talking and singing her sleep. I can't quit work out what song she's singing I've never heard it before. But she's saying something about being someone called Azara or something??? It's really fucking unnerving it doesn't even sound like her. Ill try and get a recording and see if you guys can shed some light. 


EDIT TWO: Ok I managed to record a bit of it...she's singing but I don't know what, has anyone heard this before????????? Ignore the TV in the background I was watching it in the lounge room to drown her out, and it was really unnerving when I turned it off and all I could hear was her. I'm kind freaked out now, I'll admit it. [Here it is](http://soundcloud.com/user165636719/a0ynmqy5tete/s-jECMW)",UPDATE!!! Need some advice.

floydnimrod,21,,25,1rhxtb,,113,"I'd just come from church for some reason. I'm not sure why I'd gone into the church, but it was the weirdest service I'd ever been too. Everybody was there. It was a packed house. Rich people, poor people, criminals, middle class folk. It was all people who didn't normally go to church. I looked into the coat room as I walked in, and some guy was snorting cocaine on this little counter top. Right in a church. I was like, what the hell? I've never see that.

I sat in a pew, and looked up. There was no minister. They were just playing a movie of an old church service on the screen. Some little old lady was playing a hymn on an organ, and the minister was applauding her. She seemed happy. But the audience was restless, not really paying attention, not sitting down, just kind of wandering around, talking to everybody. 

And then I saw a woman I used to know, someone I worked with years ago. I went to sit down next to her, and she sort of jumped on my lap and hugged me, saying she was so glad to see me. I wasn't sure if she was sad, or drunk, or terrified, or just lonely, but she whispered in my ear, offering me sex, saying she's always wanted me, ever since she'd known me. I sort of pushed her off my lap, thinking this was hardly the place for that kind of cheap pick-up. And then I got up and walked out. There wasn't really a church service going on anyway, I don't even think it was Sunday.

And then for some reason, I was in a car with this old lady. I don't even know who it was, or why I was with her. She was old like my grandma Freddie, but it wasn't her. We were driving down the street. She was driving too slow because she was kind of lost. I don't think I was in Winnipeg I was on a large street, almost the size of Portage with several lanes. But they all seemed to be deserted, like very early on a Sunday morning. I'm not sure if it was early in the morning or near sunset, but the sun was low in the sky. I think it was late in the day. The streets were mostly clear though.

The lady pulled over and for some reason she got out of the car. I think she was going to ask somebody for directions. I looked at the GPS thing she had on her dashboard, and suddenly the direction went all fuzzy and scrambled, like the satellite was confused, or just no longer there. And then the whole sky got this weird greenish tint to it for about ten seconds. It basically turned green instead of blue, but only for a moment, and then it was back to normal. Everybody stopped and looked up.

I was still in the car, but I leaned forward and looked out the window. The sun was over in the west, low in the sky. And I saw what looked like a second moon fly over the sky in a direction that was diagonal to the sun's normal path. It was huge. And my stomach got queasy for a moment. It made your stomach sick because it was so big, it actually pulled on you with its own gravity, like the moon pulls on the tides, but much bigger, and everything inside you just got tugged around.

But it went straight across the sky, without hitting. When I realized how close it was, though, I knew it was gonna hit somewhere, probably on the other side of the world. The gravity of the earth pulled it in, and it sling-shotted around to the other side somewhere. I jumped out of the car and grabbed the old lady's arm.

""Come on! We have to find shelter! It's gonna hit!"" 

We just abandoned the car in the street, and I dragged her toward a nearby fire station, or hydro office, or whatever it was. I'm not sure which it was, but there were large utility trucks, with lifts on them. It was also deserted for some reason, except for two guys loading one of the trucks. We banged on the doors, but it was locked up. We ran from door to door trying to get in, but everything was locked. 

And then I felt a great rumble under my feet. It nearly knocked me down. I've never been in an earthquake, so I don't know what it's like, but it felt like the entire planet shivered. Car alarms started going off in every direction and I heard a weird sound like gravel tumbling down a hillside, except there were no hills. I think it was pieces falling off houses in all directions. We were able to stay on our feet though. 

A few moments later, the sky in the north went dark. If I assume the sun was setting in the west, and the meteor or asteroid or whatever flew over the sky in a north-west to south-east direction, then it was north the black came from. And I mean the entire sky. Like a wall of blackness, smoke and ash suddenly filling the view from the ground to the upper atmosphere, from west to east as far as you could see, in one huge wall of black cloud. And it was coming toward us. Well, sort of going towards everyone, everywhere, I guess. It came over the horizon like an charging army, fast and steady, advancing.

""It hit on the other side of the world somewhere! Come on! we have to get indoors! We won't be able to breathe!""

The air started turning yellow. Ash started raining down, and bits of rock and debris from the blast, where ever it hit. I took a deep breath and held it as I was running. I could already smell a weird burning rock smell, like sulphur, like burnt matches, but more metallic. 

Me and the lady finally got into some doors, but it was just a little foyer. We ran in and shut the doors behind us. The inside doors were locked. But it was somewhere to hide. There was a fire alarm. I pulled it, not really knowing why I was bothering. But I was sort of in a panic and not thinking straight. The sign said, In Case of Emergency, so I pulled it. The alarm went off, and we looked out the window. The yellow air turned brown, and then dark red. Then everything went black. The black cloud fell over the whole sky with a clattering rumble that sounded like it was raining gravel instead of water. And all light went out of the world.

The world as we knew it was over. Even if we survived, life as we know it would never be the same. We'd be set back 10,000 years, reduced to hunter gatherers again, living out of caves. If we survived the impact that is. I honestly don't think anybody would have survived the shockwave. Something with that much gravity hitting the earth would pretty much end the story for everybody.

Charlies_friend,20,,9,1rhapg,,79,"A friend of mine posted a story here not too long ago, and he was pretty well received by your wonderful community, so I decided to create an account to share mine.


When I was a little girl, about nine years old, my family purchased a small ranch in western Kansas. My father had just gotten out of the Army, and I suppose after seven years of trotting around the world, and spending two of those years in active combat zones, my dad just wanted to go somewhere the world would leave him alone. He couldn't have found a better location for this purpose; anyone who's ever followed Interstate 70 westward through that area knows, there isn't much between Topeka and Denver.

I still remember the day we (my mom, dad, older sister and I) moved into that old ranch house. It had been built in the early 1900's, and being something of a history buff, I was pretty excited to live in a house that had stood through prohibition, the depression, both world wars, and everything since. The house itself sat at the bottom of a small incline from the main road, backed literally into a hill. This setup meant the back half of the home sat underground, buried in the hillside. Outside the house was a little grassy yard area, and across this yard was an old barn. We didn't have any horses, but my dad held a particular love for classic cars, and he turned that barn into an amateur autoshop where he worked refurbishing old cars from the junk yard in his spare time.

My sister and I were given seperate but adjoining rooms upstairs, while my parents took the master bedroom (oddly) on the first floor. My sister and I's rooms opened onto a sort of landing that looked out over the living room and kitchen, and the stairs led down from there.

It was only our second or third night in the house, that I began to notice some strange things occurring. I was unable to sleep one night, and I laid awake in bed long after I heard my parents and sister go to bed. The house was incredibly quiet, both from being in the middle of a very isolated area, and by virtue of being half buried. Just as I was reaching the half-sleep state...........SLAM! I heard a door downstairs slam shut. At first I tried convincing myself I had just dreamed it, but I couldn't make myself believe that. And the next thing I heard chilled me to my core. I heard footsteps coming up the stairway. I could tell from the sound that the individual must be wearing shoes, so it probably wasn't my parents coming up to check on me. I heard the steps reach the top of the stairs, and then begin down the landing. I was frozen with fear when I heard them arrive outside my door, pause for a moment, and then continue on. When the stranger was apparently in front of my sisters room, he paused again, and again he continued. He reached the far end of the landing, and then turned around and came back the way he came. He continued for what seemed like an eternity, pacing around outside my sister and I's rooms. I finally worked up some nine-year-old courage and crawled to the door. I could still hear footsteps coming from just outside. I waited until he was moving away from me, and I was between him and the stairs, planning on making a mad dash for my parents room when his back was turned. I barely cracked open the door and looked out, and saw....nothing. The footsteps had stopped, and the whole house was empty, and still. I was confused, and afraid, but even then I knew if I ran to my parents they would think I was nuts. So I slid a chair in front of my door and crept into bed. A minute later the footsteps started again, back and forth, all along the landing. Eventually, they lulled me to sleep. 

I didn't mention the noises that night to anyone, fearful of my parents thinking I was a whacko, and of being made fun of by my sister. But, over the next few weeks, everyone in my family began to notice strange happenings on our ranch. Objects moved on their own. Small things would disappear for days, only to be returned exactly where they'd gone missing from. It was what I guess you'd call typical poltergeist activity; nothing harmful or malevolent, just noises here and there and odds and ends moving around. And practically every night I heard those footsteps outside my room. 

My family eventually began referring to this entity as ""Charlie"". He seemed to be a harmless ghost, and sometimes downright helpful. Occasionally my parents would wake early in the morning for work, only to find a freshly brewed pot of coffee waiting in the kitchen. The coffee maker had no automatic timer. Sometimes when one of us had misplaced something, like car keys or the like, we'd search the house frantically only to turn around and find what we'd been searching for laying on the ground behind us. And sometimes Charlie would slam a door, or walk around loudly, or turn a sink on, seemingly just to let us know he was there. And always, those footsteps at night.

Charlie always seemed particularly active in my dad's auto shop. My dad would occasionally find car parts he'd been working on had been tinkered with, despite the fact that he was the only one who ever went in there. Sometimes tools would go missing, only to be returned a short time later. Once my dad came in from his shop one evening as white as a sheet. When we asked what was wrong he just said ""Charlie was walking around out there........Jesus, I thought you all were just hearing things!"". I wasn't sure why Charlie loved that shop so much, but incidentally, that was where I caught my first sight of him. It was a Saturday, and my Dad was hard at work putting together an old Chevy Fleetline. My mom mad him a sandwich as a working lunch, and asked me to take it to him. I eased open the barn door, and saw my dad seated at his work bench, his back to me. And I saw another man, next to the car, also out of my dad's field of vision. He was about 5'8"", with dark hair and eyes. He was dressed in what looked like typical 1930's clothing; black slacks, a pinstripe vest over a grey work shirt, and topped off by a brown ""paper boy"" hat, cocked to one side. He looked right at me for a second, a big, mischievous grin on his face, and then he simply disappeared. I didn't even realized I was still holding my dad's sandwich and continued to stare at the spot Charlie had stood until my dad snapped me back to reality.

So passed the next few months. My family was happy on our little haunted ranch, Charlie seemed happy enough to share the space with us, and life was good. And his nightly vigil outside my room began to seem almost comforting. One night in late November, however, I learned just how utterly terrifying Charlie could be.

My dad had some kind of dinner event for work in Topeka, almost two hours away, and since my Sister was almost 16 by then, and there was virtually no crime in our rural area, my parents figured we would do fine by ourselves until they returned the next morning. Of course, to my sister and I, it meant we could stay up as late as we wanted, watch scary movies, all the kid stuff you can't do with your parents around. At around midnight, I was in my Sister's room with her watching some movie on her TV, when we heard a loud CRASH from the living room. My first thought was that it was Charlie, playing another prank, by this felt different somehow. Charlie's noises were simply little bumps to remind you he was home. But this noise sounded violent, and angry. Before I could really react, we heard another loud crash, and another. My sister cautiously peeked out of her door, and down into the living room. I swear I saw her go white. She began trembling, and her hand covered her mouth. I peeked around her to see what she saw, and felt y blood run cold. We could just barely see two men, outside our from door. One of them was kicking it in. As we watched, a final smash from this man caused the door jam to give out, and they both entered our home, shining long flashlights all over. My sister and I crawled under her bed, and held each other tight. This was easily the most terrified I have ever felt. 

But as the two men began to go through the living room, another loud crash came from the kitchen. One of the cabinets had opened and slammed shut; a favorite trick of Charlie's. The man who seemed to be leading the show shined his flashlight into the kitchen and shouted ""Is there anyone in here?!?? If you are, you better come out now!! We will find you, and we will FUCK you up!!!!"". My sister and I had to cover our mouths to keep from screaming out loud. At the man's words though, Charlie apparently got angry. We heard another loud crash and a skittering of metal on the floor, as one of our silverware drawers apparently threw itself across the room. I heard one of the men say ""What.......the FUCK?!?!"". And then Charlie decided he was do e fucking around. All at once, every door, window, and cabinet in our home began opening and closing violently, and loudly. Small objects all over the house began to fling themselves into walls, across the floor, even at the intruders. At this point, the one in charge just yelled ""FUCK this"" and turned and ran out, his buddy close behind.

As soon as the men were out of the door, everything stopped, and the house was again silent. It was a long, long time before either my sister or myself finally worked up the courage to move. She had left her cell phone downstairs, and and she needed it to call the police and our parents. She began slowly creeping downstairs to get it, and since there was no way in hell I was being left alone, I followed. As we got to the bottom, I looked into the kitchen, and for just a moment, Charlie was standing there, exactly as I saw him before, with the same grin on his face. A moment later, he was gone.

The police arrived shortly, and my parents not far behind. The cops determined that the disorder in the home was caused by the robbers ransacking the place for valuables, and they must have been scared off by a passing car. Lucky for us. My sister and I didn't even try to tell them what really happened, and within thirty minutes, both men were caught, still fleeing. 

After that night, hearing Charlie's walk around my floor gave me a serene sense of security every night. When he played his little pranks, I would always look for him. And every now and then I would catch just a glimpse of him and smile.

Several years later, when I was a junior in high school, I was working on a school report at the local library. The topic was the history of our town, and I wanted to see if the library had any old news clippings that mentioned my family's ranch. I typed our address on the search bar, and the first result stopped me dead in my tracks. The date of the old article was July 17, 1936, and at the top was a picture of a man, about 5'8"", with dark hair and eyes. It was, unmistakably, Charlie. The title of the article read ""Local Man Murdered While Defending Daughter"". It seems the man we called Charlie was actually named Brian Davis. He had lived alone in the ranch with his only child, a daughter, after losing his wife to a bad case of the Flu. On the night of July 15, the article said, Mr. Davis was returning home from his job as an auto mechanic in town. When he pulled up to the house, he found the door had been forced open. He ran inside, and found a man on top of his daughter. The girl was sobbing, her dress had been ripped open, and the attacker held a knife to her throat. In a moment of sheer instinct, Mr. Davis threw himself at the intruder, tackling him of his daughter, and as he held the attacker, Mr. Davis yelled for the girl to run to the neighbors and call the police. The girl made it the mile and a half to the closest neighbor, who promptly called the sheriff. When deputies arrived, they were able to apprehend the attacker, who had been beaten half to death. Unfortunately, he had stabbed Mr. Davis three times in the chest. Brian Davis died right on our kitchen floor.",Charlie,88,nosleep

childrenofsamhain,9,,5,1rhdoj,,36,"My friend Jaime purchased a new home about six years ago when his wife was pregnant with their first child. Until recently, he lived there with his wife Claire and their two daughters, Sarah and Emily. Sarah is now five years old and Emily is three. Within the first two years living in the house, Jaime said that he never experienced anything out of the ordinary. It wasn't until his daughter Sarah was around two years old, that he started to notice she talked to herself. Jamie thought nothing of it, she was just learning to talk and he figured she was just entertaining herself. 

One afternoon when Claire was out at the grocery store, Jaime overheard his daughter in the upstairs hallway, whispering and giggling. Curious, he asked, ""Sweetie, who are you talking to?"" Sarah replied, 

""The woman standing in the hallway"".

""Is she your imaginary friend?""

""I guess."" 

Amused, he went upstairs to find her staring blankly at a wall, whispering quietly. ""What's your friends name?"" he asked her. 

""Her name is Helen Mary"", she said. 

""And what are you two whispering about?"" 

Sarah looked at him and paused before she piped ""I'm not supposed to tell you."" 

Suddenly the front door opened downstairs, and they heard Claire come through the door. Sarah rushed down the stairs to greet her. Jaime didn't think about that again for a few weeks. 

Over time, the two noticed that Sarah's interactions with ""Helen Mary"" became more frequent, but they attributed this to the fact that they had just given her the news that she was going to be a big sister. 

About two weeks before Claire gave birth to Emily, Jaime was at home alone with Sarah. He heard her playing upstairs, chatting away with her imaginary friend, when suddenly he heard glass breaking. He ran upstairs as quickly as possible to find his daughter standing in the hallway, holding a hammer. She was staring up at the wall of family pictures that were now smashed to pieces. There was glass everywhere. Jaime picked his daughter up and carried her down the stairs. He told her to stay put as he returned to the upstairs hallway to clean up the shattered fragments of their family portraits. When he returned to the living room, he asked her directly, ""Sweetie, why would you smash all of our family pictures?"" 

She looked at him, ""Helen Mary told me to do it.""

When Claire returned home that evening from her girls night with friends, Jaime told her about the incident. The crept up the stairs so as not to wake their daughter, so Claire could view the damage with her own eyes. She gasped silently at the sight. 

When they returned downstairs to the kitchen, they started to discuss possible explanations for her behavior. Suddenly, the color ran out of Claire's face and she looked at Jaime. ""There's no way she could have done that alone.""

""What?""

""There is no way she could have smashed all of those pictures by herself.""

Jaime was confused, ""I told you, I caught her with the hammer. She told me that she did it.""

But it wasn't until his wife said it aloud that it dawned on him, ""But… some of those pictures are almost five feet off the ground. How could she have reached those?""

His mind was racing, ""She must have moved a chair or something.""

She was adamant, ""There are no chairs upstairs that she is strong enough to move without you hearing it, and you would have seen her carry one upstairs, right?""

Jaime was silent. He didn't have an answer. 

They went to bed that night without any answers. The following morning their daughter had little recollection of smashing the pictures and Jamie wrote it off as sleepwalking. Though he didn't have much time to think about it, as two weeks later his second little girl was born.

Emily was two years old in the summer of 2012, and one afternoon, when Claire was at home alone with the girls, she heard Emily alone upstairs, whispering. She called up to her, ""Who you talking to, kiddo?""

""The woman standing in the hallway.""

Claire thought that her Sarah must have told her about her imaginary friend, and that she was simply trying to emulate her big sister. Then she spoke again.

""She doesn't like you, Mommy""

""Why doesn't she like me?"" Claire responded, surprised. 

""I don't know."" 

Suddenly her daughter came bounding down the stairs as if nothing had happened. Even though both Jaime and Claire both found this slightly creepy, nothing about the situation ever felt threatening or malevolent. Until one night last month.

Jaime had put the kids to sleep around eight o'clock in the evening and he and Claire had got into bed soon after. Exhausted, Jaime and his wife fell asleep extremely quickly. Jaime was awoken by the sound of screaming. He was disoriented and had no idea what time it was, but he could tell that it was his wife screaming right next to him. He turned to see what was wrong and saw it. His 3 year old daughter Emily, standing beside the bed, with a hammer in her hand. Blood poured from Claire's forehead. Jamie jumped out of bed and grabbed the hammer out of his daughters hand. He turned to his wife. She had stopped screaming now, and Jaime grabbed a towel from the bathroom and wiped the blood away from her face. She was going to be alright, but she did have a deep cut to her forehead. 

Jaime picked up his daughter and carried her out of the room. He went and checked on Sarah, who had awoken to the screaming but was clearly unharmed. He told her that everything was alright and closed her door. He was standing alone with his daughter in the upstairs hallway, and he finally asked her, ""Emily, why would you hurt Mommy?""

""She told me to, Daddy.""

""Who told you to?"" 

""The woman standing right behind you. She told me to hurt Mommy"" And then Jaime felt a chill run up his spine when his daughter leaned into his ear and whispered, ""And she told me to hurt you too, Daddy.""

I just kept clicking through - that was my greatest vice. I could have let it rest. But with every story, my blood pumped faster, my breath came quicker.

There's nothing like a good scare. Every rush of adrenaline left me wanting more. That next fix got harder to find, took longer. I grew discerning, opinionated, a veteran of the genre. Soon I was writing for myself; days spent clacking the keys and nights spent in marathon research sessions. I was a crow picking through the maggots and gore for that next juicy nibble. I was a man consumed, and like a junkie messiah I wanted to share my high with others.

Everything has a basis in reality. Think about it. Why do the holy men think your soul needs saving? Why do children fear the dark? What's there in the unknown deep, what is it that averts our gaze?

That's why I'm here now. That's why I'm writing to you. I come bringing the ultimate high. All you have to do is believe. Believe in me, in the hellish nightmares that chase after you in your sleep, in the stories you read and the movies you watch. When you believe, the hunt is on.

My stomach is in knots, every heartbeat a hammer blow against my sternum. My hands are shaking. My breath comes in stecatto bursts. I can't hold on much longer. The anticipation is mounting, building to orgasmic frenzy. I found it, the ultimate high. Or rather, it found me. All I had to do was believe. All I have to do is turn around.

lamented_dreams,4,,9,1rgqu8,,13,"I love the dark. I really do.

I don't mean going gothic and pagan and all that, but I do like the dark. I like to sit in my room for hours on end into the night watching videos, researching diseases and the supernatural, and writing stories.

Anyways, I've recently come across a quote from a game called 'Knock Knock'. And let me say, it's utterly terrifying for not just the player, but the watcher too. There's nothing but this overwhelming sense of dread throughout all of the game.

""You thought about it, and now, it is inside."" —Knock Knock

That quote has seemed to have seeped into my brain. Multiple broken theories have been written down in my notebooks and journals and I've seemed to have come to a conclusion.

The mind isn't wrong. Reality is. And, with that, imagination often holds more truth than what we accept.

Think about it. When you were a small child, things like fairytales and horror stories were much more real to your innocent mind. In fact, there is a theory that children have a sixth sense that they gradually lose as they progress into adulthood. Also when you were a child, you thought of monsters and what they would do to you as well as how terrifying they looked.

And when you thought about these things, you didn't want to turn around. Why? Because what if for the slightest moment, you were right? All those lone yellow eyes in the darkness, the sinking feeling of being watched, out of all those times, what if this was the moment you were right? Or moreover what if you were always right and they just didn't want you to know... until now.

Because honestly, we used to think the Earth was flat. Then that it had the sun revolving around us. So what makes us so absolutely sure that we are the only ones out there now?

This is my theory.

I shared with one of my colleagues about two weeks ago and five days later she called me screaming about how there was something in her house. The police showed up and they took her to the hospital. She had three slash marks down her back, resembling that of almost a wolf. She also had multiple bruises on her neck. They said there was no signs of break in and the wrecking of the house was most likely the result of her having a psychotic episode.

This could be true, but I don't like how unsettlingly close it is to when I told her about my theory.

""You thought about it, and now, it is inside.""

This is the phrase that keeps me from imagining creatures. When I went to the hospital to visit her she was curled up in the bed, shaking with her knees up as close to her chest as possible. When I asked her what happened she wouldn't tell me who, only that 'it' got inside. She just had this empty look in her eyes, something very uncommon since she was always so hyper and nice. When I asked how she just said, ""I thought about it, and it came in.""

Keep in mind I never told her about the quote at all. Those were her own words. So this is more than unsettling for me. It may be possible that this 'theory' spooked her enough for all of this to happen, but I don't like the coincidences.

angelcot,3,,2,1rh91p,,11,"Hi /r/nosleep. This is kind of embarrassing to post, but here's a few stories of things that happened to me as a kid. I was a pretty anxious kid, and a lot of weird stuff happened to me. Nothing paranormal, though There's more than just these stories, but I thought I'd at least start with this.

Ever since I was a kid, I've been afraid of windows. That's not saying much, though. I was afraid of just about everything else, too. But growing up, my house was full of big windows. Floor-to-ceiling windows in the family room, two sliding glass doors in the dining room, a huge window that looked out from our kitchen into the front yard. My mom never bought curtains or blinds for any of the windows other than the ones in our bedrooms because she'd get depressed if it were too dark in our house. 

I had light blue curtains in my bedroom that my grandmother sewed for me since my windows were an irregular size. Every night I would pull them closed, then pin them down to the walls with a pushpin so that I wasn't able to see even a sliver of the outside out of the corner of my eye. My bedroom window looked out on the backyard. I remember being so irritated whenever someone would accidentally leave the back porch light on. The light would shine through my light blue curtains and play shadows on my wall. I'd cover my head with my pillow so that I could fall asleep without worrying if I would be able to make out the silhouette of someone trying to peer through my curtains, still pinned to the wall. 

From a young age, I had problems with insomnia. My mom struggled with it, too. I remember my dad telling me stories of when my parents were still married, when my mom would wake him up just to talk because she still wasn't asleep at 4, 5, 6 in the morning. I remembered feeling envious that I didn't have someone to do that to. I listened to books on tape at bedtime to fill the silence. Sometimes I would sneak into my brothers' room and lay on their floor, hoping for sleep to come. Being uncomfortably aware of how their curtains weren't drawn completely closed. 

When I was 10, I moved from my room- which overlooked the backyard- to my brothers' room, and my brothers separated and took over my room, and the office. My new room was at the front of the house. If my curtains were open, someone could easily look in as they walked up the path to our front door. During the day, I didn't mind it. I could watch for my friends or packages from the postman. At night, it made me so anxious I began to develop a habit of vomiting nightly. My mom was sympathetic, but didn't know what to do about it. A year later, I was moved back into my old room, and my older brother moved back into his. I stopped vomiting every night. 

I feel like I had a reason for being so afraid of windows. One night- I must have been about 6 or 7- I was up late, as usual, listening to *Ralph S. Mouse* on tape for the billionth time. I had emptied the glass of water that my mom had gotten for me, so I got up to refill it. I was already wary of windows, so I kept my head down on my way to the kitchen. I'd often see things out of the corner of my eye; something moving, or something that *could* have been the shadow of a human, but would later try to convince myself it was nothing.

Even with my head down, something outside caught my attention. A car, parked in front of my house. I lived at the very bottom of a cul-de-sac, so we didn't have a lot of people drive down our street at night and stop to reorient themselves. The car had its headlights on, and I could tell there was someone sitting in the car. Looking at my house. I don't know if they were looking at me, but my paranoia told me they were. I stood there for a long time, forgetting about my glass of water. I didn't look away. Paralyzed, until my mom came in the kitchen. She'd seen my door was open and wondered what I was doing up. When she noticed the car in front of our house, she quieted and gently pushed me out of the kitchen and back to my bedroom. I noticed the car started to drive away as I was ushered away from the window. 

This staring contest with the person in the car in front of my house happened twice more, although over the course of a few months. Once, they switched their headlights off, and stayed for what might have been 45 minutes. Although my memory might be exaggerating. I still don't understand why I was so afraid of seeing someone in my bedroom window, but how I could fearlessly stare out of the kitchen window at the person in the parked car. Maybe I felt less vulnerable in the kitchen. Maybe I was comforted by the fact that they were so far away. Even though the walk from where they parked was just a few seconds from my front door and the window I was looking out. 

The third and final time I saw the car, the person got out of their car. They were tall, and I could see them standing on the other side of their car but I still wasn't able to make out their face. When they started to walk around their car and- I assume- towards my front door, I scurried back to my bed. 

I never liked sleepovers as a kid. Staying over at a friends house meant laying awake on their floor for hours with nothing to listen to but the sound of their calm breathing. Nothing to look at except for the sliver of their window I could see from behind their curtains. Having friends at my house was just as stressful. Usually we'd sleep in the family room, because it had a TV in it. It also had the floor-to-ceiling windows. Usually I would sneak off to my own room after my friends had fallen asleep, so that I could sleep peacefully away from those big windows. 

When I was about 8 years old, I was having a sleepover with a few of my friends. It was after 10, so my friends were starting to fall asleep. I knew I still had *at least* two or three more hours of being wide awake. I was laying on the couch, swaddled in my blanket. The TV was still on, but I'd turned the volume down for my sleeping friends to something barely audible. Usually, I tried to keep my eyes away from the windows. But that night my cat caught my attention, meowing and hissing at something outside. I cautiously looked out the window, worried about what my cat might have seen out there. Just another cat, skittering in front of the window. Relieved, I looked out at my dark backyard. Was that it? 

There was a man in my backyard, walking around. Even with the distance, I distinctly remember he was frowning. He had his hands in his pockets. I did not know this man. 

I woke up one of my friends, whispering in her ear and telling her there was somebody in the backyard. She stirred quickly, obviously alarmed, and looked outside. She saw him too. I'm not sure if he felt our little eyes on him or what, but he turned to face us. Neither of us made a move; not to lay back down and pretend we were asleep, not even to look at each other, or look away. 

There were a pair of french doors that lead to the back patio in my family room, right in the middle of the wall of windows. The man walked up to the doors and tapped on one of the small window panes. The handle of what looked to be a heavy flashlight hung out of the pocket of his sweatshirt. He smiled at us. Not a deranged smile, not a smile that looked too wide for his face. Just a calm, warm smile. He mouthed something and pointed at the doorknob. I was never very good at reading lips. I stared straight ahead, unblinking, not responding. I could hear my friends' breath, heavy and shaking. 

He spoke, the sound of his voice muffled through the glass, ""Open the door."" A pause, he knit his eyebrows together like he was concerned. ""I'm visiting your parent. Let me in."" 

My heart was beating out of my chest. I was a paranoid enough little kid to not fall for this line. I mustered up every ounce of courage I had in my little, anxious, 8-year-old body, and got up off the couch. For a moment, they man at the door looked relieved. I ran out of the room, screaming for my mom. I could hear my friend call out at me that he was leaving, and the rest of my friends starting to stir. I told my mom what had happened. She turned on all the outside lights and called the police while my step-dad looked out every window for any signs of the man. All of the girls at my sleepover had their moms come over and pick them up. I cried, and stayed the night in my parents bed, although I'm pretty sure I didn't sleep.

In my mom's bathroom, there was a big window that looked out at the sideyard. The glass was distorted, though, so my mom never bothered putting a curtain over it. You couldn't see into the bathroom if you were just passing by the window. If you stopped to press your face against the glass, you could see in or out, but everyone in the house knew not to do that when they were in the sideyard. I remember my mom shrieking one night, running out of the bathroom, saying she'd seen something through the glass. A rat, climbing up the windowsill and staring into the bathroom.

I always liked my mom's shower more than the one in my bathroom. My bathroom didn't have a fan in it, so the whole bathroom would get uncomfortably humid. The shower curtain in my bathroom reminded me too much of that scene from *Psycho*, too, and I'd always shower with the shower curtain pulled open, and I'd get water all over the floor. My mom's shower had a glass door that I liked much more, even if there was that big window I could see clearly from the shower. 

Once when I was 12, I was showering in my mom's bathroom because my parents were out of town. My brothers were home, but were playing video games in the family room. I would keep my head down when I showered in my mom's bathroom. Even if the window's glass was hard to see through, it was still a window, and the shower was the most vulnerable place I could think of being looked at. Every once and a while, I would glance up to quell my growing anxiety. To tell myself *nothing was out there*. 

Cautiously, I looked up to satisfy my anxiety. *Nothing was out there*, I told myself. My gaze met the window. There was a dark figure pressed up against the glass. Through the foggy, wet shower door, I couldn't see anything. All I know was that it was *somebody*. I screamed, and ducked down past the tiles so that whoever was out there, they couldn't see me. A few moments later, I heard my brothers knocking at the door, both of them calling my name and asking if I was ok. I pulled a towel from outside the shower and wrapped myself up before I stood up. Whoever was out there was gone. 

A few weeks later, my friends and I were playing in the side yard. There was a huge tree out there that we liked to climb in, and pretend we were characters from X-Men or Sonic. My friend called my attention to something in the grass, over by the window of my mom's bathroom. A polaroid picture of the distorted glass of the window it lay in front of.  ",Windows.,13,nosleep
Spudz_OCD,6,,6,1rgcw5,,9,"Hey redditors, im new at this so excuse my writing skills

All through my life ive had things happen that i just couldn't explain, i've told a couple of friends but even they don't know what to say.

My story begins when i was a kid about the age of six or seven, we lived in a poor neighbourhood in southern Ireland and had a shithole of a house, i lived in a room with my two brothers (kyle[8-9  at the time], and Dylan[3-4]) and had been for a couple of years so i was used to sharing a room. The first incident occurred after about a year in the house (our street was built on a graveyard) and happenned in our room. it was an ordinary day before it happenned, woke up, ate breakfast, went to school, nothing out of the ordinary. however when i came home from school that day, there was something odd about the house, I couldn't quite tell what it was but it just felt wrong. But being a kid at the time, i thought nothing of it and carried on with my daily routine. after dinner and a shower my mom put us to bed. After my mom turned out the lights and left the room, i began to drift off to sleep. after about an hour and a half of hazy dreams, i was suddenly awoken by a loud crashing sound, kind of like if you dropped a frying pan, i quiclky jumped up my pillow and sat upright in bed. I looked over to Dylan's bed at the other side of the room, he ws still asleep. I began to question if i had actually heard it at all. feeling curious i checked if kyle was awake (we had a bunk-bed, Kyle was on top) as i was climbing the four step ladder, i felt a burst of cold air rush from kyles bed and immediately dropped to the ground, waking up Kyle.
""what are you doing"", he said.
""i heard a noise so i wanted to see if--""
""--sshh"", he stopped me mid sentance, and focused his gaze to the back of the room; The look on his face will be forever imprinted into my mind. I turned around gingerly and what i saw was scary enough to make me cringe even today. I saw a scrawny black figure hunched over Dylan, who was still asleep. But this figure was definately not human; It was at least 7 feet tall, it's head was overpoweringly large compared to it's beyond anorexic body. It's fingers were 6-7 inches long minimum. From what i saw it wore nothing, but it very well could have, as it was late at night and i was still half asleep. Then the image that will haunt me forever; It, whatever it was, turned towards me and Kyle. It just stood there, staring at us for what felt like forever, it then jumped towards us and simply vanished into thin air right before it hit me. I was left lying on the floor and Kyle was wondering if what we had just seen was actually real. I looked at him and back to Dylan's bed, whatever it as, when it jumped it jumped with enough force to push the blanket off the end of Dylan's bed. I looked back towards Kyle, who was already asleep again, and decided to go back to sleep myself, not knowing if what we'd seen that night was just a figment of our imagination or not.
When i woke up the following morning i hesitantly asked my mom and sister if they'd seen or heard anything last night..they didn't. So i questioned kyle about it and he said that he had no idea what i was on about, he had no memory of seeing or hearing anything, he didnt even remember me falling off the bunk ladder.
To this day i still cant quite figure out what happened that night.

My second experience was only four or five years ago, a couple of months after moving to Australia. We were living in a pretty old house at the time so it was a bit creaky and what not. it was a pretty average day when it happenned;I was 14 and I was once again in bed at the time. I was sharing a room with Dylan (10) at the time. Kyle (16) was in a room across the hallway, Jenny (12) was the next door down and my parent's room was at the end of the hallway. It was about 11-12 at night, and we were all just about asleep. My mom and step-father at the time were out exploring the wild clubs of Surfers Paradise, so it ws just us kids. I was almost asleep when i heard slight footsteps coming from the kithcen area. I wondered who it was considering we were all in bed, so i opened the door to check. I headed towards the kitchen, once i reached the living room (about half-way to kitchen from my room) i could see into the kitchen, i slowly emerged from the wall; no one there..weird, i thought, so i headed back to my room, but as soon as i turned around Kyle was standing right in front of me with a knife. I jumped quicker than i'd ever jumped before. Kyle then laughed his head off and went back to bed. I did the same without the laughing.. I was back in my room, now lying in bed realising im too awake to go back to sleep. i just lay there for about five minutes staring at the ceiling untill i heard more footsteps in the kitchen. I called out
""Kyle, go to bed, idiot""
""i am you fuckwit"", he said as he emerged from his room half asleep
""well then who's upstairs?"" i asked
""It's probably just a possum in the attic or something don't worry""
I regretfully closed the door and went back to bed. But as soon as i did, loud heavy footsteps started making their way down the hallway, along with heavy thumping on the walls, they were getting closer and a hell of a lot louder, It sounded like someone was trying to stomp and bash rats out of the walls and floor. It kept coming closer and increasing in volume until it was at the point where it was like gunshots right outside my room. It then stomped right outside my door and my door swung open with extreme noise and force and standing at the door was, i shit you not, the same tall, black scrawny fucked up figure that i saw years ago. I practically shat myself. It stood there for a couple of seconds, but if felts like hours, then started stomping and sprinted towards my moms room. I don't know why but i instantly got up and ran towards the door and looked towards my moms room; nothing there, it vanished again. I dropped to the ground in shock, just as Kyle open his door and screamed ""WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT"" 
""It's back"" ,i said
""What's back?""
""the thing i saw hunched over Dylan""
I stayed up all night that night not wanting to sleep knowing that thing followed us to Australia

My most recent encounter with our old friend was last year. We'd moved into an old complex of houses that had a bit of a history in the crime side of things. We'd been living there for about 6 months and my friend from primary school, Jordan, was now living in the complex too. It was around 5PM and it was just Jordan Kyle and I in the house. I was playing my i-pod at the time, Kyle was in the kitchen and Jordan was behind me. Kyle decided to pick up a coin and throw it at an unsuspecting Jordan, who surprisingly, caught it, and returned fire. but then Jordan moved a little backwards and Kyle threw it further and harder. The coin flew through the air right past my head and stopped rigth in front of Jordans face, IT LITERALLY STOPPED IN MID AIR, it stood still in front of his face for less than a second and then was propelled back towards Kyle with nearly twice the force. We all just stood there speechless, not knowing if that had really just happened. Later that day we were showing a friend what had happened  and were back in the Kitchen messing around with coins to see if it would happen again. When suddenly a ball flew through the air at Kyle, like it had been thrown with force from the stairs leading upstairs. For the second time that day we were utterly speechless and had no idea what to do.
That night after Jordan had left and Kyle went to bed, i was making a late night snack. Dylan was in the living room watching TV and there was nobody else in the house. I finished making the snack and was about to head into the living room when in the corner of my eye, I saw the figure that i had seen twice before glide upstairs; same height, same scrawniness, same long fingers only this time it was a little misty, like a shadow, and it looked right into my eyes as it vanished upstairs.
I am still wondering what the actual fuck that figure is, all i know is that my mother has become a claire-voyant.I know for a fact that there is definately going to be a lot more of this thing which i have nicknamed ""the figure"".

For the time being i will keep an eye out for my little follower and if i see him/her again i will not hesitate to report the time, date, and details of the situation and of course reddit the fuck out of it.
for now redditors, i bid you farewell

the_dark_half,5,,1,1rhyj5,,7,"You know that feeling when you’re all alone and hear your name whispered? Maybe you’ve walked into a room only to suddenly feel a sudden temperature drop? Had things go missing only to re-appear in odd places? Maybe you’re like me and you lie in bed at night, only to feel like someone stroking your hair but when you become fully conscious and turn around, nothing. 
Think you walk through a cobweb or hair falls on your arms or neck and brushes against your skin delicately, tickling you? You check and nothing was there? I’m sure your parents tell you it’s nothing from a young age; perhaps because they themselves are deluded enough to believe that it is their imagination. They probably deep down fear it’s a ghost or apparition. Even they couldn’t know how much worse it really is.  Stop deluding yourself. It’s not a cobweb. It’s not the wind. It’s not nothing. It’s something far more sinister, an insidious force which slowly grows stronger the more you feed it your fear and attention. 

Some of you, I’m sure, will be fortunate enough only to feel cold spots and occasionally hear creaks and footsteps in your house. It’s such a common occurrence that people barely notice it and if they do, it’s the spookiest part of a generic horror movie, because those suits in Hollywood haven’t seen what these creatures are really capable of. If you believe in the paranormal you may experience the whispers of what I can only loosely refer to as their ‘voices’. I’m sure not many of you have had the misfortune to awaken to them standing over your bed, taking the forms of whatever creatures or person your subconscious fears most because it’s real form is so terrifying you’d probably die instantly or become paralysed with fear, a zombie-esque state you’ll never awaken from-and that would ruin their fun too early. If you don’t die instantly, seeing their faces will make your eyes bleed; hearing their voices unrestrained will shatter your ear drums and I’ve heard of cases where insides have been liquefied, skin melting and bleeding seeping out of every pore.

The first time I awoke to one in my room with me, it was after I’d given the footsteps and banging on the walls attention. I had thought it was cool, I even bought a stupid Ouija board and told them it was okay for them to try and talk to me. I had been lying in bed after a night of drinking so I passed off the initial taunts and laughs as nothing more than my intoxicated imagination, until my door slowly opened and in came one large hairy leg, followed by more spindly legs, followed by many eyes and two huge fucking fangs. Yep, a giant spider, bigger than a horse came into my room. I tried to scream, but that just resulted with me hyperventilating, then vomiting all over the floor. It strode in, all beady eyes on me and as it slinked atop my bed I tried to pathetically crawl away, but it held me down with its two front legs, piercing into the flesh of my shoulders as I whimpered like a small animal about to be devoured-which I was.  I felt the sharp pain of its fangs tear through my skin and inject me with poison that made my blood burn. I lay in bed, delirious, desperate, muttering for help. My ears were greeted with a cacophony of voices, screaming horrible things that were so foul that before that night had been unimaginable to me. I passed out shortly after, from fear, blood loss or the venom and awoke a few days later, believing to have all been a dream. I clung to that hope until I stepped outside my bedroom door and found dozens of small animals, birds mostly, wrapped up in what appeared to be spider’s webs, discoloured, drained of their blood and insides. All dead. I ran to the bathroom to throw up and caught sight of myself, dried blood caked on my body and face, puncture wounds all over me and strands of silky web still wrapped around my breasts, my stomach, my legs and in my hair. 

The second night I encountered one of them, they took the form of my uncle. I lived with my uncle for nearly 5 years while my father was travelling almost every week for business. I know my father loved me and desperately needed the money that he had to work from dawn until way after the sun set and had to leave me for long periods. He didn’t know what his brother did to me. That night as I became increasingly aware of the noises in my apartment and the feelings of someone touching me and whispering in my ear, I rolled over to see my uncle grinning at me. He crawled onto the bed and tied me down. I struggled, but when I did he beat me with his belt, like he had started doing when I was eight years old. I fought as hard as I could, tears burning my eyes and sobbing uncontrollably, but he kept cutting away at my clothes with a pocket knife and telling me to be a good girl. The torture that night lasted for many hours, possibly days. I try not to remember it. I thought I had moved on from those childhood years and buried them a few years ago, when my uncle died. This was not the last time the monsters took on forms like this to break me. They’ve only grown stronger with every drop of blood, with every scream and with every hopeless sob I’ve given them.

Their true form will only appear to you in dreams at first because they get to torment you in ways that won’t instantaneously butcher you or drive you insane, yet; they like to take their time with their toys. The dreams for me started after those incidents. I have seen what those beings really look like and…just thinking about it is enough for me to start violently shaking, unable to stop retching. The other day I wasn’t careful and thought about one of them and a stranger had to hold me back as I unconsciously started walking in front of a train. In my dreams, it is pure hell as they have my undivided attention for hours and can do whatever they want to me without my body breaking and bending the way it would in the waking world, but it all feels real. 
Part of me stares at length of rope on my coffee table and considers leaving this torment…but what if when I die, I get sent to their realm, to be their plaything forever? 

It’s not just the occasional brush against my skin, the odd floor creak and the rare moment of ‘is someone calling my name?’ Now I feel them on me at all times, their rough, sharp skin cutting mine, scratching me, violating every single part of my body. Their voices scream and howl at me, maniacally taunting and laughing at my never-ending misery. Even when I shut my eyes, I still see them, their hideous beings beyond any words the human language has to describe them to you. 

Most of you think of those household noises and strange occurrences as the work of ghosts, of spirits. Yes, it is so comforting for humans to believe these presences are the souls of dead people who are just sad and wandering, isn’t it? You want to be able to talk to someone no longer alive; you open your mind and let them in. Don’t. What’s out there isn’t human, it isn’t some person with unfinished business, what’s out there wants you to think that, to get comfortable with inviting it in and letting yourself become aware of it. 

Did you just hear that faint noise outside your window, like a soft breeze carrying a faint whisper? That creak outside your room? That faint sensation on your flesh? I hope not, because now you know what’s really there and they’ve always known about you.",Don't give them attention.,8,nosleep
Rhapsodeyus,1,,0,1rgtyq,,8,"Some may recall a story I posted a few months back, about shadow-like figures who visited me on a mission for knowledge, and afterwards, disappeared like ghosts. For those who do not recall, the story is [Curious Visitors](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l4dv2/curious_visitors/).

If you have not read that, well, you probably haven't missed much, but it will help with the backstory for this one if you do read it.

Done reading? Good, let's continue.

This happened last night, Sunday, November 24th, 2013. I woke up at precisely 4:27 AM, and I know this because I watched my small digital alarm clock on my bedside table flip to 4:27 AM as my eyes opened. I also noticed that my lamp was off (I sleep with the light on for safety reasons, since living with cats can be hazardous). However, I could see my plain, black clock in a pale blueish light.

My brain clicked. ""My laptop is on. I must have left it on and the power went out, so it's running on battery."" Then I remembered, quite clearly, turning it off and closing it before going to bed. That's when I felt a weight at the end of my bed, sitting in front of my laptop.

I sat up, looked, and spotted a shadowy figure sitting in front of my laptop. The NoSleep submission form was up. I coughed, and said quietly, ""You could have asked."" Instead of, say, a sudden spin and a glare from Brarger, as I expected, my visitor vanished instantly.

I didn't expect that, and it startled me thoroughly. My previous visitors would never have been so rude, and certainly would have asked my permission to access my personal computer. I shifted, tossed the covers aside, and moved to the end of the bed, to read what it had written.

I now wish I hadn't.

JUVIE_MAKER,2,,1,1rhq9j,,8,"I have a nose for things. No seriously, all my life I’ve had a very strong sense of smell and I don’t mean for the average person. I have an abnormally, freakishly, ridiculously, absurd sense of smell. It’s been that way since I was a kid. Here’s a prime example, when I was about four or five I used to visit my grandmother (god rest her soul) every month in Daytona Beach for the summer. My grandmother was notorious for making the best homemade cakes in the neighborhood. I would always leave my Gran’s house at least ten pounds heavier each summer after gorging myself on her delicious treats. One Saturday, after a day of playing outside (when kids used to play outside!) I instantly smelled the aroma of cake wafting through the air, but something was…..off. There was another smell lingering behind the cake scent. It was kinda tangy, bitter, sorta nutty …just all around unpleasant. Being so young, I couldn’t quite put my finger on what the smell was but I knew I didn’t like it. Then out comes my Gran from the kitchen with a big slice of her freshly made cake on a china plate. She passes the dining room table and spots me standing there with my nose crinkled up in disgust.

Gran:  What’s the matter baby? Come sit at the table and have a slice of cake.

Five year old me: I aint eating that cake, it smells funny!

(Let me just interject for a second.  Now if your family is old school like mine, you know that a child is to NEVER disrespect an elder’s cooking! Especially if that elder is a family member, you just don’t do it! That is unless you want a black eye, ribs broken, missing teeth… you get the picture.)

Gran: Girl, get your hind parts over here and eat this cake before I slap the hell out of you!!

Oh geez…there’s that tone. You know it, you know it well. That angry deep tone that resonates from parents when their truly pissed off. You know… that voice that scares the living shit out of you and gives you’re delicate child-like mind nightmares for a month (or your whole life). Yeah that’s what I was hearing right about then. But still I was adamant. I would not eat that damn cake. That smell! It was just too potent. Now, you might be thinking, what’s the big deal? Surely you’ve smelled worse things than that cake before, which is very true. At that point in my life I’d smelled worse things before (WAY WORSE) but I’d never been subjected to eat those things either. Also, the stench of that pastry….it was just… so very not right. I was only a child but I was still old enough to know right from wrong, and that cake was definitely wrong! Even at that very moment I could taste its bitterness in the back of my mouth. With every inhale it burned and tingled down my throat.

Gran: Come over here and take this plate now!

Okay at this point I knew I was in REAL trouble. Even if my grandmother didn’t kill me, I was pretty sure I was in for the ass whooping of my life! I slowly started to back away from Gran as she moved closer to me with that dreaded cake. Even as she inched towards me that smell seem too magnify. With every step she took it grew more and more intense! “Girl, you better take this cake!” she yelled holding the plate out in front of her. I turned to run but she quickly snatched up my arm before I could get away. “No!” I shouted feverishly trying to pull away from her grip, “I don’t want the cake, granny!!” but my pleas of desperation came to no avail. My grandmother started to tug me towards the kitchen table, her fingers angrily wrapped around my tiny forearm. Suddenly, she yanked me forward making my body jump about two feet in her direction, tilting my face towards hers. She looked down at me with an awful glare. Dark hollow eyes glowered down from Gran’s wrinkled sockets. Her once loving face was now rigid and stiff with a sadistic expression that I had by no means seen before. “You will eat this cake!” She shouted through gritted teeth. “Even if I have to shove it down your throat piece by piece!” 

I had never seen this side to my Gran before. My once sweet, devoted granny had turned into this vicious monster plucked straight out of my worst nightmares. My small frame quaked in fear and tears began to seep from my eyes. I had never known terror like this. My insides loosened and squirmed like jelly making the contents of my bladder empty and leak down my legs. To say I was afraid would be the understatement of the freakin decade! But you know what? There was something else I was more fearful of. Even as I pissed myself in sheer horror from the presence of my devil-like grandmother, there was still something more bloodcurdling, more utterly terrifying than her…that fucking cake! 

“NO!!!!!!!” echoed from my lips in a banshee scream and with all the strength I possessed I juggernauted into my grandmother. My body throttled into her torso head first making a loud solid grunt bellow from the old woman. Her arms flew in the air (letting me go in the same instance) and her vast body collapsed backwards before suddenly….CRACK!
The sound of my grandmother’s head crashing along the rim of her kitchen table splintered throughout the house. Gran thudded to the ground like a sack of potatoes and the plate with the cake she so firmly held onto shattered on the floor. I stared at her lifeless body as blood began to seep through her head and flow on the linoleum. I was still too little to know the true meaning of life and death but I did know for sure that red liquid was not suppose to be running out of her head like that. I bent down and looked into Gran’s half opened eyes. They weren’t black any more. They’d gone back to their normal brown again. Not really knowing what to do I just stared down at the gruesomeness of it all, watching the chunks of yellow cake absorb the blood until each piece was just as red. 

To make a long story short the police were eventually called. My Gran’s weekly bridge game was on that day and a couple of her elder counterparts found her body, and me sitting in a pool of piss and blood staring at it. Needless to say there were lots of screams. Oh, and you’re probably wondering what that smell was, right? I actually didn’t find out until I was well into my teens what exactly it was. I was pouring it into my foster parent’s coffee one morning when it finally hit me…Cyanide. From the smell of it, Gran probably couldn’t have used too much either. Maybe half a teaspoon, give or take; totally undetectable to the average person’s nose…but not to mine. “So that’s what that was, go figure”.  I remember thinking that to myself as I stirred the cyanide into two mugs. My foster parents passed away later on that day, I wish I could say I feel sadness over it but I really don’t.  I was more consumed with thoughts on why my grandmother was trying to kill me? Was it because of what I’d done to Oscar, her cute little Maltese? I mean, if I’d known the oven wasn’t a suitable place to put a dog I might have done things differently. I was only two at the time. Or perhaps it had something to do with what happened with Mommy…that really was unfortunate. I didn’t want to hurt her, but she was an obstacle that just had to be removed. 

But anyways, that’s neither here nor there. I’m an adult now and those days are long behind me. I’m actually on my way to my boyfriend’s…excuse me….ex-boyfriend’s apartment right now. I’m visiting him and that slut he cheated on me with. And guess what? They just had a baby, isn’t that the sweetest thing.  ",A nose for things...,9,nosleep
1234FUCK,7,,4,1rhjmk,,6,"So my uncle has always been into the paranormal and he got me into paranormal investigation, Or ghost hunting to simplify it a few years back. Well I go with him on a lot of them and we do it for free for people who think something paranormal is going on in their houses. I always saw it as a nice little hobby to do on the weekends to blow of some time and I always liked being scared. I mean that’s how I even know about this sub-reddit because I like reading it. And that’s one of the only reasons I knew about what had happened on my last investigation. 


	We got a call from a family out in the middle of the country saying they had begun hearing weird voices when they were each alone but the 16 year old son was the one who had it happen the most. I went through every scenario I could think on the way there, Something was legitimately going on that was paranormal, one of the kids was lying and was fucking with the rest of the family and other such things. Well when we got there we talked with the family and everyone seemed happy except the two children. The son was as I said earlier 16 and the girl was 14, they seemed uneasy looking off into corners and such. I took a note about it but didn’t dwell on it that much. We went around the house marking places we would put cameras and getting the lay out of the house. Once we finished that we went back to our van and started getting ready. After we set up all of our equipment we each got our POV (Point of view) cameras strapped on and started our investigation. My Uncle took the upstairs, our colleague took the first floor, And I went into the basement to do a little investigating of my own. 


I made my way downstairs and grabbed my Walky-talky and radioed my uncle asking if everyone was ready for me to hit the main light breaker. He gave me the go ahead and I flipped the little switch plunging the whole house into darkness I held up the other camera I had with me so I could have a camera move around freely ( plus it had a night vision setting so I could see where I was going.) Well I turned it on and walked slowly to the chair I had placed in the room so I could sit comfortably waiting for something to happen. And after an hour or so of me questioning the darkness.. It answered back.
My instincts kicked in and I put a call in on the radio for everyone to tell me where they were. And everyone was exactly where they said they were supposed to be. My heart froze in my throat from fear but excitement so I stood and asked who I was talking to and I heard a small wispy chuckle before it said softly “You know who I am.” I swallowed hard before continuing to walk around the room and asking questions. It stayed silent for a few questions before I asked why it was here. It chuckled again before I heard a small sound. Like a door knob jiggling and I turned towards it. My camera landed on a door knob sticking out from a sheet that I guess had covered it before. I walked towards it slowly pulling the sheet off to reveal a shabby door about waist height with peeling paint and scratch marks.  I put in a call on the radio telling my uncle and the others I had found something and for them to meet me in the basement. I got no answer back but I assumed they had gotten the message. My uncle did that a lot; he tended to get over excited with these things so I figured he was just trying to get here as fast as possible.  But the paranormal curiosity ran in the family so I reached down and grabbed the knob, it was warm as if someone had been holding it for a longtime. I steadied myself before twisting it and pushing it open. 


I looked through my camera screen as I walked into the door. The atmosphere around me seemed to change instantly, even though all the lights in the house was off it just seemed to be darker and colder in here the basement itself.  I looked around in the room through the screen until I saw a lone chair in the center of the room. I walked forward until I was right next to it and then began looking around more. I jumped a bit at the bright light on my screen until I noticed it was a mirror. It was bolted onto a beam  next to the chair and when I looked to the left I noticed the same thing. I thought it was really strange so I walked around the front of the chair and accidentally kicked something over.  It was loud and then I heard a sound of rushing water. My heart leapt into my throat as I looked down and around looking for the source until my camera came upon a metal bucket slightly rolling with water coming out. I also saw a candle and a small match book and that’s when it hit me. My whole body filled with fear as the realization flooded my head…. This was a “three kings” set up.


 I turned towards the door pointing the camera as I looked through it I saw the door slam and I stopped. My whole body froze from pure terror and it took me a few seconds before I let out a scream for help. After I stopped I heard the soft chuckle come from behind me in the darkness and I just stood there with my eyes closed shaking as I felt a soft breath on the back of my neck I heard a voice.. My voice whisper right into my ear. “ Do you know who I am now?” I stood there for a second before screaming again and then I heard the door bust open and I saw flash lights on me and my uncle asking what was wrong. I just ran from the room to the breaker box and flipped on all the lights. I then sank to the floor looking at him as he sat next to me and asked all that happened. I just held out my camera to him and he took it. Before he watched it he asked me why I didn’t call for back up and I looked at him before telling him that I did. He looked at our colleague before watching the recording.


 After that he asked me if we all went in together would I go back in. I nodded as long as we kept the lights on and we went in. and it was as I thought. It was a set up for “ The three kings.” I shuddered as I turned to my uncle asking if he knew what it was. He didn’t so I explained it to him and I pointed to the bucket “ and it has been used recently. The bucket was full of water. “ My uncle nodded to me and put a wrap on the investigation. We went back home and I have decided to type this up. Tomorrow we will be going and talking to the family about what happened and who had done the three kings in the house.  


I think the three kings set up has something to do with what has been happening at the house. I will update you all on what happens after we talk to them.

OsamaBinHiding,3,,1,1rhxdo,,6,"Last night was like every other night for me. Have dinner on my own in my small, yet cost flat and watch a little bit of TV. Around 9 or 10 o'clock, I start to crack on with some work as I had a university deadline in a couple days time. The minutes started going faster and before I knew it it was 12 o""clock. 

""Where did the time go?"" I thought. It had only felt like a few minutes. However, this was a normal occurrence for me. The world kind of, disappears when I get lost in a train of thought and for the life of me, I can't break out of it.

I had just remembered that I had a seminar early in the morning and suddenly thought ""Fuck, I better try and get some sleep"" 

See, I live in an old building that has been converted into flats in the suburbs of a major city. So it isn't uncommon to hear floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and all the walls are very thin so noises in the middle of the night just tend to go over my head. I wouldn't consider myself someone who doesn't get scared easily but when you're familiar with floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and branches tapping your window - you tend to grow some thick skin.

Last night wasn't like any other night in my flat though. 

As I mentioned earlier, I was alone. My flatmate - let's call him, Evan for the sake of the story, was away celebrating thanksgiving with his family but he's away a lot so I'm used to spending a long period of time on my own. My usual night routine of showering, brushing my teeth and cleaning the kitchen was over and I went into my room to finally rest my head for the night and that was when I first noticed something. My drawers were all pulled open. 

To most people, this is probably nothing - but for me it wasn't normal. I suffer from borderline OCD and everything, especially in my room needs to be in order and I remember waking up and everything was in order. I hadn't left my flat today either. 

""I'm too tired for this shit"" I thought and went to bed. 

It's weird though isn't it? That something like a mattress and a duvet can make you feel so safe, like nothing can hurt you. I remember being a child and I made sure none of my limbs were outside of my bed incase something grabbed me in the middle of the night. Such a feeble piece of furniture can make you feel so safe.

Well, not anymore for me. Last night I heard the usual creaking of the floorboards - no biggy, right? However, as I drew closer to conscientious, I realised that these creaking sounds weren't coming from the surrounding walls and neighbouring flats but they were coming from under my bed.

And that's when I felt the unmistakable sensation of a cold, coarse finger stroking mine over the side of my bed.

TaylorBonaseraSr,0,,2,1rhb2e,,5,"I can explain why I'm so afraid of mirrors, or anything that could reflect light, even a glass door. It's so difficult for me to talk about it sometimes, but other times I feel her pressing me on to tell as many people about her as possible. She broke my mirror the first time, just crashed right through the glass and shattered the glass into a literal hundred pieces. It was such a pain to have to clean all that up. I got at least five cuts. But she didn't care. At the very least she didn't laugh at me or yell at me to clean faster. At least she was nice enough to check herself for that. Anyway, I got my mirror replaced. She didn't break the bathroom mirror again, but she broke the great mirror in the hallway while she was running through it. I don't understand how she did it, it's pressed up right against the wall. She'd have to ram her body sideways. She didn't even have any visible cuts. She told me she was sorry, and that she would try not to do it again. I believed her, and she was true to her word. But soon enough, I hear the crashing again. But this time it's my door. The majority of my glass door has been smashed through, but the weird thing is that the hole is shaped like Quasimodo. No one lives here that has a body shaped like that. The other times I checked her she didn't have any cuts on her, but this time she was bleeding so much from every part of her body that she had to go to the hospital. I had to sit there and watch her, but she couldn't explain what had happened. When the doctor asked, neither could I, because I hadn't been there. It's strange how selective she is; she won't smash into anything except mirrors or glass-looking things. Anywhere there isn't this kind of stuff, nothing bad happens. She tells me that she feels so cold whenever she walks by something like that, and she gets an uncontrollable urge to destroy it. She talks to me about it so often I feel like I'm beginning to share the feeling.

It's starting to unnerve me, and I don't want to live with her anymore. But I can't break the joint liability contract. She told me to cover all the things in the house that could possibly create a reflection, so I did. But I find her desperately tearing off the covers when she thinks I'm not looking.

One day I'd had enough so I decided to take off one of the covers in my room. It couldn't hurt, just for a little while when she couldn't see. She wouldn't notice. But after a minute of reveling in my refreshed reflection, I saw her standing there. So close. She was so ugly. She copied my expression and mocked my horrified face. She followed me here, to my own room. I couldn't turn around. There was no point. I felt a pressure from her on my shoulders so great I couldn't keep a straight posture. She was laughing at me.

But I'd heard that laugh somewhere before. And I'd seen that face before too. It looked so much like my own. She must have heard my thoughts, because she said she told me to never look at her by means of a reflection. I couldn't stand the sight of her face anymore, it was so scary. It'd been such a long time since I'd spent so many minutes just staring at her. I had to take control. So I bashed the bedroom mirror in, balling my bare hands into fists and repeatedly thrashing until I could feel the glass cutting into my skin.

It'd been so long since I'd last done that. Now every time I look, I can see her, feel her, I see her staring at her...our...reflection, through my eyes.",My Blank Mirror,7,nosleep
SeaDweller7,2,,2,1rhilw,,4,"I go to a regular school, its kindergarten to year twelve, so its pretty big. But, my school is an old public school, and the principle is ancient. Me? I am in year twelve, and I’m graduating next year, and my friends said I should share this story with you guys. 

Ok, where to start? Well, at my school we have a pretty serious problem with bullies, and when I say serious I mean it. One year our school was even on the news, but it was pretty traumatic. When I was in year nine, there was this little girl in fifth grade, called Melody. Her and me sort of talked sometimes, as she was a new girl and I was her school buddy (to show her around and stuff) She was a sort of short, curly brown haired, blue eyed and geeky girl. Glasses and all of that stuff, so your stereotypical nerd. Which pretty much was what she was.

After I moved up in to Tenth grade it was pretty clear that she was being bullied. Instead of gossiping or playing with the other girls, she just sort of walked around the school... bouncing a tennis ball and wandering around the grounds of the school. 

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

Then, half way through the year, school was stopped. During lunch they lined us up and called our parents. Sent us home. They just said there was an accident. My mother and father lived in Melbourne and I lived with my uncle and aunty, and they’re pretty laid back and all ‘come home when you feel’ so I stayed at school.

I saw five year six girls with that sort of ‘we know nothing it wasn’t us we didn’t do anything’ look on their face before I saw an ambulance and a white body bag. Out of the end of the body bag stuck out locks of curly brown hair, and the always-screeching birds seemed to sing a sweet tune. A melody.

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

Last week we had a substitute teacher who started screaming at a girl who was outside bouncing her ball after the end of lunch bell had rung. She didn’t realise Melody wouldn’t listen. 

No one knew why the back stairs from German were out of bounds for two months, and why the German teacher quit. No one asked why those five girls we’re stared at my Melody’s sort of... ghost.

I pieced it together. A simple push, a simple tumble. A simple death.

No one cares, all the kids just skip past her, all the laughter swallows up her silence. 

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

It has been a little over a year since I last wrote - just over a year since the last nightmare.  I was foolish to think I was somehow cured, that, as Dr. Lough suggested, getting it out of my head and into a journal would help.

I read back over my last and only journal entry, as I tried to describe the nightmare.  It is so chaotic and scattered, yet I'm unable to find any other way to convey the details.  That is the terror of the dream at its core - utterly chaotic.  Jerking from one sensation to the next, the hesitant probing of my fingers as they cover the smooth flesh where my eyes should be, to the damp defeat in realizing those fingers have torn away the protective lids in confusion.  All of this, in layers of sleep - waking to the comfort of my mother's figure, only to then know it is just another stage of the dream playing out, with her eerie voice echoing through my body:

""You're connected now.""

Even now, in understanding that my last entry seemed to bleed out through the pages, I'm struggling to form coherent thoughts onto this paper.  Each detail seems to tie into the next, only to fall apart when I try to see the whole.  I wonder what type of clinical association Dr. Lough could make?  Is this what schizophrenia feels like?  I have no way to explain it.  It is as though there is a novelist's grand plot line swirling around my body in paper shreds and each time I reach out I can snatch only a sliver of a scene, unable to ever piece the parts into an understanding.  I'm fairly certain this entry, and perhaps any subsequent entries, will be just as erratic.  I just cannot force these thoughts together.

So much has changed in the last year, it is so hard to recall my state of mind the last time the nightmare came to me.  I have a son now, nearly 6 months old.  We must have just found out Rachel was pregnant around the time I last wrote.  Could that have been a factor in the nightmare returning after years of peace?  Was my mind so overwhelmed with the thought of being a father, the changes to my life, the responsibility, it somehow dredged that old horror back from my subconscious?  I can't help but think it must have played a role.  It has been a blur, so many other things seem to have fallen into place.  Though they are exciting, it seems predetermined, somehow rushed.

Over the last decade I have had a slight obsession with the home I grew up in.  I knew I would live there once again - returning it to ownership in my family - though I never anticipated it would happen so quickly.  Rachel's grandmother died, leaving her an inheritance that allowed us to leap forward several years in our plans together.  It was Christmas Day, the day she died - I guess her last gift to us.  Three months after my son was born, we were moving back into the mountains, back to the walls I had called home as a boy.  

One thing I feel for certain, this home is the source.  The nightmare started here, always took place here, was always fueled here.  I'm beginning to remember things, or have recurrent thoughts I have not had for nearly two decades.  It is as though these things are unlocked from muscle memory as I walk this house.

As a child I would reach the top of the second floor staircase, which opened onto a hallway, always with my head down staring at my feet.  Left, at the end of a long hallway was a guest room.  Large floor to ceiling windows would reflect back a warped view of the person looking down to them.  Right, across a short landing was my bedroom.  I had trained myself to never look left at night - as the small nightlight by my bedroom door would throw twisted shadows onto my reflection in the long guest room windows.  If I would look up, I would become stuck in fear with the reflection.  The windows seemed to pulse with my heartbeat, flexing my body larger then smaller in the glass.  My feet became rooted in place, the black of the windows and the emptiness behind them tunneling out for me.  The nightlight would flicker in then out, each time causing my shape to jump forward, as though I were being pulled down the hallway towards the darkness.  I never remembered breaking loose, turning and walking back to my bedroom and going to sleep.  I would wake up in my bed hours later, staring at my hands, inspecting for blood and knowing I just had the nightmare. 

I learned, I kept my head down and did not look to the left.

Our first night in the home, that muscle memory followed suit.  After turning off the main floor lights, I climbed the staircase.  My son was sleeping against my chest, his arms wrapped around my neck and shoulder.  My head was down as I crested the top step, turning to the right, towards my room which was now his.  As I neared the bedroom door, his forehead left my shoulder.  His back straightened and his arm peeled away from my neck.  I felt his arm extend straight back behind my head.  I didn't need to look at his eyes, I knew.  Those eyes followed his arm to his hand, reaching down the hallway to the windows.  The nightlight flickered as he let out a giggle.  I took the last step into his bedroom and shut the door.

Sunny day in Nevada. Families having lunch outside, fathers teaching their sons how to grill steak, playgrounds
filled with kids. Every year I plan a trip with my son. Nevada has really nice caves in it. When I was little,
my father always took me there and so did his father. I didn't want to break this chain. I told Jake, my son, about that
cave that I used to visit but I did not have enough time to take him there until now. He was still sleeping when
I stepped in his room.
""Honey wake up!"" Jake opened his little eyes and whispered:
""What?""

""We are going to see the cave I told you about!"" he instantly jumped out of his bed and become so excited that
I can't even tell about it. He got dressed and ran to have something to eat. About five minutes later he was screaming
from the garage door.
""Hurry up mom!""

One hour car ride. Not the longest one he ever had. He kept asking me about the place. I just smiled and told him to
be patient. As soon as I parked the car, he blasted out the door and ran to the back of the car to grab two flashlights. 
""You ready?"" I asked him. He obviously was so we started walking towards our destination.
It was dark in there. Darker than anywhere else. Flashlights on.  He just kept pushing forward. Sometimes I couldn't 
even catch up with that little kid. After a sharp left turn I saw him standing there. He found it. The biggest hall 
in the cave. Every wall was shining when the light of our flashlights reached them.
""Beautiful isn't it?""

""It is indeed!"" he answered. He turned his head towards me but it was only q light at a corner 
that he could see. He totally crapped himself. ""Mommy wait for me!"" He started running towards the light 
that he could see. It is a maze down there. - MOM! - he screamed.
""I'm here honey!"" He caught up with me. He just gasped there and started to be a bit relieved as he realized 
that he was not alone in that dark cave again.
""Hey calm down little boy! I'm not leaving you here!"" went closer to him and whispered:  ""Or am I ?

Anyhow, I dreamt that I lived with my boyfriend in a big house, it was night and we both were sleeping. Suddely i wake up, and I sit up in our bed. I'm fully aware that I'm sleepwalking but I can't stop myself, lay down again or do anything about my actions. I start walking out in a big hallway (this is where the main door is located), then I enter a smaller, much more narrow and dark hallway, and in the end is a small wardrobe-like room which is truly pitch black. This scared me a bit since I am afraid of the dark but I just keep walking, I don't even consider NOT to walk in to the wardrobe. So I find myself inside this pitch black tiny room and I close the door and I lock it. Once I have locked the door i just panic, I'm not afraid but I simply can't stop screaming, I remember the scream so well, it was a true scream of despair, I screamed at the top of my lungs but I still was not scared. I started to bang the door, the walls, everything while screaming and crying as hard as I could. Finally my boyfriend comes to the rescue and the door was open now, he just grabs me and tells me I was sleepwalking and I just said ""I know"" in the sternest voice. He's scared out of his life and crying and I just looks at him like he's crazy and then i just go back to bed like nothing happened.

ephique,0,,0,1rikrx,,4,"I grew up in a small town in Ohio with my mom, dad and big sister. We were a normal family, neither happy nor sad, somewhere in between. I was always interested in music as a kid so I spent most of my time playing piano, practicing guitar or trying my best to write my own songs. It was also some sort of medicine for me; it helped me drift away into my own world when my sister and my mom had disputes. You see, my sister was one of those rebellious teenagers at the time that had to have their own way or the rest of the world had to suffer their unfair ranting. I hated it; I hated hearing her yell at my poor mother.

During a lonesome walk home from school one day I got a call from my dad, making sure that I didn’t have any plans and telling me that I had to come home as fast as possible. My dad never called my cell phone unless he really wanted something so I knew right away something was up. I remember jogging most of the route home, since my dad sounded so serious. It gave me the creeps to say the least.

I jumped over the fence surrounding our villa and paced myself into our house. The kitchen was the first room you’d see upon entering and it was empty so I assumed they were in the living room upstairs. As I was making my way up the stairs I could hear my sister sobbing uncontrollably, something had definitely happened. My dad was standing up as my sister was sitting on the couch, he told me to sit down as well.

I was scared and curious at the same time. Dad and my sister never really spoke or had any arguments since my father didn’t bother caring too much about any of my sisters business, so I could figure out that this wasn’t about my sister. I remember sitting there in dead silence with the exception of my sister shedding tears and trying to keep her crying as quiet as possible. My dad was looking like he had no idea what to do or say, as if he didn’t know how to explain something to me.

Finally, after a long pause my dad made an introduction to whatever I thought this was about at the time. He said: “Your mother…” and then he needed to grasp some air, and he continued: “Your mother has passed away.”

I was eight years old and I couldn’t grasp that concept. I didn’t understand death, or that my mom was eternally gone. I just sat there as I was developing an irrational anger towards god-knows-what, I remember thinking how unfair this was. I do however forgive my dad for telling me so bluntly, he didn’t know what to do and he was in shock at the time.

My sister continued crying, she asked dad how mom died although it was obvious she didn’t actually care to know at that precise moment. She was just being desperate and no one could blame her. I thought it was my sisters fault when I was there, I thought that was why she was crying so much. I didn’t shed a single tear; I kept it all inside. Of course that didn’t mean this incident didn’t haunt me for years, I never stopped thinking about my mother. 

The aftermath of my mother’s death is what has been shaping my life the recent years. My sister was very weak emotionally and it basically drove her insane. My dad had to take her to an actual mental hospital. Something I didn’t even think existed when I was eight. This resulted in that I didn’t get to meet my sister very often, my dad kept telling me she was in a special school for students that wanted a challenge; but I overheard enough conversations to know where she really was. I guess my dad was trying to keep me out of it, and I didn’t blame him. 

I was guessing that my sister wasn’t doing very well at the hospital since we got to see her less and less as years went by, something that troubled me; I hated living in this big villa of ours with just my dad. It felt so dead, and my dad had been more kept to himself after mom died. We didn’t do anything, I literally spent all time at home in my room, making or playing music. Me and my dad didn’t even greet sometimes when I came home from school, it was depressing. My theory for his change in behavior has always been that he blamed himself for my mother’s death, something that I’m about to get into.

You are probably wondering how she died by now, and it’s a legit question to be asking. The best answer I could give you is that I don’t know. My dad has always told me she died of liver-failure but for some reason that has always sounded like a lie to me. It didn’t add up, my mom never had any problems with her liver before and she didn’t drink. I think it was something he made up when I was younger because he assumed I wasn’t mature enough to hear the truth. In addition to this, whenever I asked my dad about this matter he’d get heavily upset. Nowadays I never ask about my mom’s death, nor do I even bring up mom as a topic.

Years went by and I ended up being fourteen. It kept going like I just described, I spent most times in my room playing music as my dad did whatever he was doing on his own in the house. My dad did work, he had the night-time shift at a local bottle factory, I’m not joking, he actually made glass bottles for a living. He had higher ambitions but most of them got crushed when he and my mother got my sister, they had to move and dad basically had no other financial option than to quit the university he was attending at the time and get a quick and close job. You guessed it, the bottle factory.

I was riding my bike home late at night after spending the evening in the school library at one point when I was fourteen. My school was the type that had an after-school library that didn’t close till 11 pm. I didn’t need any of the books or supplies that the library offered; I just studied there sometimes since it felt less depressing than my father and our lonely villa. Either way, I hadn’t seen my sister for two years that night and I was starting to get the idea that I wouldn’t see her again for another two. 

When I arrived at the house the front door was open, “This is odd?” I thought. Upon closer examination I realized that someone had taken the spare key from its hidden spot underneath one of my mother’s old jars. It’s never smart to have a spare key hidden right next to the door, number one mistake people do when it comes to spare keys. It did look like whoever had taken it did suffer a struggle before finding it. The rug outside the door was all muffled up and there were scratches on the door, around the lock. I suspected we had been robbed so I pulled out my cell phone, ready to call the police. 

This is when I heard something coming from inside the house. I was dead scared to say the least, this could have been armed robbers or maybe something worse, I didn’t know. It sounded like someone was grinding furniture against the floor, trying to move it. It was so dark as well, I remember not seeing more than pitch black looking into the open door, technically if someone was in there they would have seen me because of the street lights. I started to slowly pace into the house, walking towards the noise. This is where I had to make a decision, was I going to suddenly turn on the lights in order to reveal whatever was in there or was I going to approach it in the dark? I picked the former. I was just going to switch the lights on when I could see someone strafe into the light coming in through the kitchen window. It was my sister, naked. My entire mindset had to change into a totally different way of dealing with the situation; it took me a good couple of seconds to assume she escaped the hospital. 

I switched on the lights in an instant. She had redecorated the entire kitchen, in the dark. Of course it all looked hideous and random; she didn’t know what the hell she was doing. I remember being in a slight discomfort, I had never seen my sister naked in my entire life. I also hadn’t seen her for a good couple of years at all. She didn’t look very comfortable either, she looked like she didn’t know who I was and was wondering what I was doing there.

I uttered “Linda?” out loud, that was her name. She didn’t respond, she just continued standing there looking at me. “Don’t you remember me, I’m your brother.” I still couldn’t get any feedback out of her; it was as if the wheel wasn’t spinning at all. I wasn’t sure what the protocol here was, not knowing the number to the mental institution or anything I figured I’d try to call dad, before I got to press the call button on my cell phone she uttered: “Don’t call dad.” This is when I realized she couldn’t be completely empty inside after all.

“You don’t want to call dad.” She continued.  I had no idea what to do, I assumed this was part of the reason she was in the mental hospital in the first place. Luckily my dad got home at that point, not coming from a finished shift at work. He had a good five hours at least left, I assumed the hospital had phoned him and told him about the situation. My father ran into the house as fast as he could.

This is when something I didn’t expect happened, he told me to leave. He pointed at the door as if I had no idea how to find my way out of my own house. I asked him where I was supposed to go, he told me to wait in his car. Judging from how serious my dad seemed I didn’t think twice about it, I ran out to the car. As I was sitting in the car I could see my sister walk past the kitchen window a couple of times, I remember how she made no effort to cover her breasts. I had no clue what the two of them were discussing, although I never saw my sister move her lips so I’m guessing my dad did most of the talking. 

After a couple of minutes my dad started to walk to the car, he joined me inside. I remember asking why he didn’t bring Linda with him, “Don’t call her that name!” he shouted in response. I was so confused at this point. Dad started the car and drove me to my only friend’s house; I didn’t see him very often though. I was a lone wolf growing up and I still was at this point, I didn’t really create any friendships. I remember sitting in the car as he ran up the steps to ring my friend’s doorbell, his mother opened in her night dress and looked confused. I assumed my dad made up some emergency story to cover what was going on in order to get me a place to stay overnight. I didn’t even know what was going on to be fair.

Whatever he told them worked, I got to spend the night at my friend’s place. Tim’s place, to be exact. It was pretty awkward I remember, I only saw Tim a couple of times a week and that was when we shared classes in Spanish. We got to be desk-mates because the teacher made up whom to sit next to each semester, so we weren’t very close. 

It was a Friday so there was no school the morning after; I guessed that made it easier for my dad, leaving him the freedom to pick me up whenever he wanted to. He did, but not before giving me enough time to fully experience the awkward breakfast conversations with Tim’s parents, both trying to justify me as Tim’s best friend. I don’t know. Tim didn’t have many friends I guess.

On the way home I asked my dad what was going on the night before and he basically stopped the car and stared at me, as if I was mocking him. I remember how desperate he looked, as if he had no fire left in his heart. He uttered the words: “Do you think I wanted any of this?” as he grabbed his hair in regret. “All I wanted was a normal family with no circumstances, and I’m not blaming you when I’m saying this because frankly you are the only sane member left in this livelihood of ours.” Is what came out of his mouth next. I tried to comfort him, telling him that he had done a good job raising me and what not; I really didn’t have a lot of cards in my deck at this point. I mean my dad was basically losing it.

When we got home he told me that he was sorry, and that I should go up to my room. I did go up to my room but I got to tell you; I was starting to get very anxious about my dad. I really wanted to know what the hell was going on. I spent that night recording some guitar sessions for a song and reading books while listening to some ambient records I had found online, I couldn’t sleep so pulling an all-nighter was my only real option. I was reading “A Brief History of Time” for a science project in school, I was somewhere in the middle section of the book and started to get dry eyes. I figured I’d go downstairs into the kitchen to get myself something to drink when I got shocked upon opening the door to the hallway. I saw my mother standing just outside, looking right at me for a fraction of a second. Had all this hassle from the last couple of days driven me insane? It freaked me out so much that I ended up never getting a drink. 

The image of my mother outside my door haunted me that entire night, I kept thinking about it as I couldn’t sleep. She looked deranged, scared and raw. The shortage of light sources in the hallway made her look like she was from a black and white 50’s movie. I kept begging for the sun to rise up, I even did that thing when you close your eyes and try not to open them because you never know what you’ll see. I might have been fourteen, but I can openly admit that I was dead scared.

It finally came to be morning and I ran downstairs, still not fully opening my eyes while passing the hallway. I remember greeting my dad who was sitting in the kitchen drinking orange juice. I was just about to pour myself a glass when he said: “I think I need help.” While holding the glass of juice as if he wasn’t sure he was going to drink the rest of it. I asked him what he meant and he said that he wasn’t sure, that he had felt very uncomfortable and unstable lately. He also mentioned that he was thinking of joining some people from his work in playing golf, he thought that could give him some relief. I told him that sounded like a pretty good idea, jokingly adding that it’s better than hanging around the house doing nothing. He looked offended when I said that, something I didn’t really understand since he obviously worked all night, so that would justify him sleeping through the days.

I understand that some of you reading this are wondering how the hell I could have been fourteen and still not know how my mother died. Well, it’s hard to explain how uncomfortable of a character my dad was at times, and it felt a bit like I was offending him whenever I had to ask because part of me did actually believe she died of liver-failure. I mean it was possible. Imagine if it was true, and I kept asking my dad as if he lied to me. That’s the type of thoughts I had in my head about the whole thing.

Having that explanation out of the way, I did summon the courage to confront my dad one last time. It was a couple of days after the conversation about my dad picking up golf; I just walked into his room unexpected. A part of me had wanted to do this for a long time because I really never knew what he did in his room; it looked similar to an office which is nothing he’d ever need since he was a labor worker in a bottle factory. He was actually sitting at his desk. Not only that, but the desk was flooded with paper-work of some sort, maybe he had picked up an accounting job for the factory during the day, something he could manage from home. I didn’t ask; I had a big enough question for him as it were.

I dragged out a small chair he had behind the door and figured I’d sit on it. It was somewhat squeaky and not very comfortable, better than standing up anyway. Then I leaned forward and I was just about to ask when he interrupted my train of thought by saying: “You want to know about your sister, and what happened the other night. Don’t you?” This is where I started to play along because he was already looking emotionally hurt, bringing up mom here would have been a car-crash. I told him that I was indeed there to ask about my sister. He took a good pause before he bluntly exclaimed it to me: “Your sister is not right in the head; she’s in a mental hospital.” I couldn’t believe he hadn’t figured out that I would have known this by then. Not wanting to make a scene I just pretended like I didn’t know. He explained the context, telling me that she couldn’t take our mother’s death. A tear started climbing down his cheeks, and then he asked me if there was anything else I wanted to talk about. There was no way I could bring up something as sensitive as my mother at this point so I told him that everything was fine, and then I left the room.

I realized on my way up to my room that my dad was fragile and very close to losing his mind in this problematic family business. I had no idea how I’d ever get the truth about my mother out of him. When I finally had landed on my bed in my room again, the image of my mom started crawling back to me. The grey scaled portrait of her in the hallway, was my mind playing tricks on me? I also had a slight feeling that I remembered it from somewhere. I mean it was my mom but that exact stare and look she had, not only did it frighten me but I swore I had seen it before. 

Night landed again, I hadn’t spoken to my father again that day. I was facing the same obstacle that I had the other night, I was too afraid to go downstairs because I thought I’d see my mother again. We all know you can imagine things in the dark, kids do it all the time. It’s as if your mind fills in the gaps, but that incident the other night was different. I got more scared the more I thought of it and figured that I’d open the door to the darn hallway, and turn on the lights in order to feel slightly safer. I’m not going to lie, I did open that door very slowly but as it turned out; there was no sign of my mother. I turned on the lights and went back into my room.

Still not wanting to go to bed, not only because it was spring break at this point but also because I was a bit scared I figured I’d listen through some of my older songs. I had loads of them; most of which weren’t very good however. I was still learning how to create music and I never really thought of myself as particularly good, especially not at writing my own songs. I guess I was decent at playing other people’s songs. I basically went through my songs in chronological order, it was interesting because was able to hear how much I had improved over the years. 
It took me a good three hours to get past most of my songs, and I was reaching the more recent creations of mine. I heard something in one of the songs that I never had paid any attention to before; it was a slight breeze of white noise in the middle of one of my guitar riffs. Knowing that this wasn’t an overworked track yet, it was made just days ago and I hadn’t gotten around to mastering it yet, I figured I wasn’t going to give it more of a thought. That was until the neurons fired, that track was made the day I couldn’t sleep, the day I saw my mother in the hallway. Being a bit gullible I figured that I’d give it a go using my acoustic headphones. I tried everything. I played the song backwards; I cut out bass, middle frequencies, high frequencies and even listened to individual recordings of the instruments and samples. I couldn’t hear anything suspicious, just that white noise. 

I was a bit disappointed, at the same time relieved. Although that white noise shouldn’t have been there, nothing in my room could have made a noise like that. I didn’t want to over-think the situation, so I ended up hitting the bed. Later that night, as I still had problems sleeping I was laying in bed listening to the same ambient soundtracks that I was using nights before, slowly dozing off to sleep. I hadn’t been asleep for much more than ten minutes when I started to ascend into that state of sleep when you’re in a dream at the same time as real life is somewhat happening to you. I could hear a thumping sound coming from somewhere. Before I knew it I got woken up by a loud bass noise, it sounded like some kind of a technical disorder. I continued lying in bed, trying to figure out if I just dreamt about the noise or if it actually occurred, this is when I heard a much dampened sound coming from the other side of my room. It sounded a lot like someone was trying to get some kind of sound device to work. It got quieter and quieter and when I thought it was about to disappear I could hear a voice; very distorted and unstable speaking in what I believe was Russian. 

It took me a couple of minutes but I finally realized what I thought the sound was coming from, I had left my old amplifier on from when I was playing guitar. I bounced out of bed in order to turn on the lights. I was overlooking the entire room as I hit the switch, for the blink of an eye, just next to the amplifier I saw my mom again; just as the light went on. The same stare, same face, still that black and white filtered look from before. I got so shocked I fell down on the floor, the noise coming from the amplifier stopped in the same instant. I wasn’t sure what to make of this, and I definitely didn’t want to tell my father about what I had seen, knowing he has already thrown one of his kin to a mental hospital. 

I had a lot of sleep to catch up on but unfortunately this wouldn’t let me sleep, I just couldn’t sleep at all. I never believed in ghosts or anything growing up, these two small incidents with my mom being my only experience in what could be categorized into the matter. I thought and assumed I was becoming what my sister had become. Whatever this all meant, and needless to say; I didn’t get any sleep that night either.

I met my father in the kitchen the next day, he was looking a lot better than the last time I had seen him. He kept going on and on about how much he was looking forward to playing golf with his work-crew later that afternoon. I was happy for him; he deserved some time out of the stress. After the conversation about an afternoon of longing for a spot in the shade and waiting for your turn on a grass field he added: “Have you been thinking of your mother lately?” As if he could read my mind. I told him that I was always missing my mother, and that I had indeed thought of her a lot lately. He stated that he thought I had. I had no clue why.  Short after that he left for playing golf.

I kept thinking of why my amplifier was acting up that night, I started recalling a clear memory of turning it off after I was done playing. In fact, I knew I did since the amplifier was connected to an electricity hub that I used to turn off a small lamp I had next to my bed, how could it have been on? I had no idea. 

Since my dad was out of the building I figured I could use this afternoon without his presence to get some answers. I stepped into his room to investigate what he had been doing sitting at that desk of his all those hours. I grabbed a bunch of paperwork and sat myself on the double bed next to his desk, it got me a slight reminder on how he hadn’t gotten rid of the bed he shared with my mother yet. The first paper I started examining looked like a letter of some sort, as if it was a letter inside a legal template of some company. I don’t know how I’d describe it better than that. After further examination I found out it was a letter from my sister sent to our address, I remember wondering why dad wouldn’t show me something like this: 

“Daddy, why didn’t you visit me last weekend. I thought you were coming back, I was waiting for you. I’m sorry if I made a scene, I thought something had happened to you! I ran to you because I wanted answers, no one has answers here. I’ve been getting visits lately, why can’t you come to me at the same time?”

I fixed some grammar and a whole lot of spelling errors for the sake of explaining this to you, my sister had the linguistic abilities of a five year-old in this state. On after-thought I guessed my dad didn’t tell me about letters from my sister since they would inevitably prove that she wasn’t in a special school for people who were after tougher challenges. Although thinking about it, that doesn’t sound ridiculously different than a mental hospital.

The rest of the papers seemed to be a real mixture of work-related things and records of local police-investigations. Why would my father be looking into cases of murder, pedophilia, rape and almost anything you can think of? It wasn’t really my business what he did with his spare time but this was just outright messed up. I knew he had a friend in the police force, that was either the reason he had these or just the tool he used to get them. I didn’t even want to know at the time, I had enough stuff on my mind already and I hadn’t slept in far too long.
I apologize to whoever reading this if it seems that I’m dragging it out with details a bit too much here and there, I’m only taking precautions to make sure that I’m telling it right. If I’m finally going to tell my story I want it to sound right. 

My father never came home after golfing so I assumed he went directly to work, which made complete sense. It was starting to get late into the evening and I had absolutely nothing better to do than to once again sit in my room, I was trying to figure out ideas for new songs on my guitar. This time I wasn’t using the amplifier since I was legitimately scared of the noises occurring again. My amplifier has been known to pick up foreign radio broadcasts before, something that explains the distorted Russian speech last time, I wasn’t worrying about that. I was thinking about my mother showing herself again. Not that I was sure that it had anything to do with the amplifier itself.

Not too long into that night I started feeling sick of being in-doors for so long, and I felt like I could use some kind of fresh air as a vacation from all this unexplained mystery I had been experiencing. I remember being on the sane side of the fence, thinking critically and trying to find solutions, not marking everything as if it was a conspiracy from hell. I figured I’d take my bike down to a local gas station, not more than ten minutes from my house; I wanted some chips, candy and maybe a couple cans of soda. 

I scrambled together some change I found in my room and took off; I got there faster than I thought I would. It wasn’t cold outside either; it was a pretty smooth night. After grabbing some generic brand of chips, Skittles and a couple cans of coke I paid for it and left. I didn’t spend much time in the store, but apparently enough time to get my bike stolen. With no bike, feeling like a stupid idiot for not locking it I had to walk home. 

Something out of the ordinary happened after this, and I wasn’t even sure if I was seeing things at first. I was walking on this huge open road; I guess you could say it was somewhat of a country road. It was tied together with the forest behind our house. It was the type of road that didn’t have any traffic other than truck drivers, passing once every couple of hours at night. I didn’t want to believe my eyes at this point but I saw my sister standing alone wearing what you’d imagine someone coming from a mental hospital would wear. I assumed she was looking for me; she was definitely staring at me. 

I continued walking, not necessarily fearing my sister. It somehow still felt as if I had a bond with her, that she would never have done anything to hurt me. As I approached her she didn’t give me any response what so ever, she was just staring at me in a light-blue scrub-coat, looking lifeless. I had reached talking-distance; I couldn’t believe this was happening. It felt surreal, like one of those scenarios you can’t be prepared for in real life. She had started to shake a bit, I couldn’t tell if she was freezing or if she was nervous. I asked her if she was looking for me out there, and if she had escaped the hospital. She didn’t respond. I got the notion that she was slightly scared of me, as if I was a threat to her. 

After a short gap of silence I noticed that she was holding something behind her back. I got a bit worried that she had some kind of a weapon, or a blunt object to swing at me so I stepped back when I spotted it. She started to slowly bring it forth, it was a plastic bag. From the way she was holding it I could tell it wasn’t heavy, or dangerous for that matter. I withdrew the step back I took earlier and tried to peer down into the bag, then she started to stretch it out to me: “I took this from your house the other day, I’m sorry. I think this belongs to you. Jonathan.” 

I do realize that I never told you my name, it is indeed Jonathan. I was slightly astonished that she had remembered my name even; she seemed to be so out of it. I remember grabbing the plastic bag, she wouldn’t let go of it too lightly either, it was as if she still wanted it. After I had gotten whatever was in the bag we shared another brief moment of silence, she wouldn’t stop staring into my eyes during these. Then she told me to never mention any of this to our dad. Shortly after she started walking towards the forest; as if she knew where she was heading. 

I saw the headlights of a car coming straight at me and my sister, whoever was in this car was driving way ahead of the speed limit. I noticed when it started to get closer to us that it was my dad’s car, acting on impulse I threw myself into a nearby ditch, as I got to witness my dad chasing after my sister. I didn’t even know if I wanted him to catch her or not, she was purposely running away from him. He dragged her into his car and they both drove away, heading the direction he was originally going. This was the second time she had successfully escaped this mental hospital, and how the hell did my sister make it so far both times? Something wasn’t right, I knew from when I was younger that the hospital wasn’t anywhere close to where we lived since my dad sometimes was gone for ten hours upon visiting her. Of course at the time it was supposedly a special school, but that doesn’t change the logic of it. He never brought me with him whenever he visited my sister, since he kept me in the dark about the whole hospital thing.

I ran the rest of the way home, trying not to drop anything; I still had all the items I bought at the gas station. I wanted to make sure that I could get home before my dad did; I had no clue whenever he would get back, and not wanting him to find out whatever was in the bag my sister gave me. I couldn’t spot my dad’s car in the driveway so I felt relieved as I stepped into the house. I didn’t bother putting my drinks in the fridge or anything, I made my way back to my room as fast as I could. I don’t really know why but I locked the door after me, as if there was something to fear. I sat myself on the bed with all the lights in the entire room switched on. I made sure to put all the bags with snacks in them aside; as I was getting ready to dig into whatever my sister ran into the night to give me. 

I never really thought of something until now, and that is how my sister could have found me. It must have been a coincidence, or she had been following me for a while; knowing she couldn’t approach me in the store. I don’t know.

I looked into the bag, it seemed to be random belongings from the drawers in our living room, and maybe some stuff from one of the cupboards we had in the kitchen. After sorting out stuff that had no relevance what so ever, for example there was a roll of tape in there. I planned to spend more time on the more interesting items. The first thing I picked up was a small collection of family photos, most being after mom died. The next thing I could grab was a couple of rocks; they weren’t even dry, I guessed she must have gotten those just before she passed me the bag. There was only one thing left in the bag, an usb-stick. 

I took the stick out and threw away the bag. Then I started looking at the photos as I was trying to reason why she would have taken any of these from our house. The only thing that somewhat made sense is that a couple of them were from when she wasn’t sent to the hospital yet, but it was pretty much pending already. In fact, most of these photos took place a couple of weeks after our mother passed away. On one of them it’s my sister showing off her prom dress she was planning on wearing, she actually wasn’t acting too badly the first couple of weeks. I guess she didn’t process our mother’s death until later or something. Another photo is of dad’s old car, he had to sell it in order to compensate for our family’s financial depression from when we lost the main income our family had, my mother’s candle business. He loved that damn car with his entire heart; we even used to joke about how mom was jealous of the car. 

There were more photos but I stopped going through them when I realized a couple of them had a handwritten marking of the letter “x” behind them. It noticed this when I was flipping them as I was trying to get them all to be facing me. I sorted the photos with no marking away and started to focus more on the ones with the marking. I figured my sister must have had done this, for what reason I was about to find out. I kept staring at the first picture; it was the one I told you about earlier, the one of my father’s old car. It was a Pontiac from the early 80’s and it must have cost him a fortune. I never had any particular memories of the car; I remember it spending most of its time in our garage.

I kept looking at the photograph and the more I stared at it the more I started to wonder why my dad hadn’t use the car more, he obviously loved it. The photo was taken for an ad in the newspaper, for selling it of course. I was just about to put the sad photo away when I caught a glimpse of my mother sitting in the backseat. It wasn’t very clear and she seemed somewhat transparent. She had the same drained-out appearance and blank stare that she had from when I saw her in the hallway outside my room, and this was taken after her death. I couldn’t believe what I was looking at. I remember dropping the photo out of shock; so many thoughts started circling inside of my head.

dinofinger,0,,1,1rie11,,1,"    17^th May 2007.
I followed my dad went to Grandma's house. My cousin who lives with grandma, had a suspicion that something had happen to Aunt L &gt; *Her initial would be appropriate here* &lt; Aunt L was never in her sound mind but she prefer to live alone which is the best option avoiding the troubles she would cause to others. Grandma has a problem of [nagging](https://www.google.com/search?q=nagging&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a) disease which makes more Aunt L better suit live far from her lectures. 

Back again to my cousin, who received a call from Aunt L's neighbour. Her respond was *there was a sudden silent for the past four days*. Aunt L was never a social person who goes anywhere she wants and always out. She prefered to live in her tiny apartment secluded only her herself and herself she enjoys being with. But her neighbour help us to watch for her just in case for anything. So we respond to go and visit her house. My father, my cousin and I, the three of us went together with nothing held us back. 

As we arrive by the door, we knock and knock. From the window we can see noise screen from her small tv at the corner. But there was no sign of her. Somehow her grill lock and the door were changed, the key my cousin brought didn't fit at all. Maybe she doesn't want us to barge in anytime we want. My dad took the liberty to call the locksmith while giving positive thoughts to my cousin that everything was fine. 

30 minutes pass. The locksmith do his magic and opened the door. Such stench came out in full loaded right to our faces. Right in front of the door we can see Aunt L laid still in the toilet facing the floor. A 15 year old me shocked and I just watched her body in strip condition only a towel covered her other half and her faeces was right below her and all over behind her. Yet she is still alive, blinking and gasping.

My dad pull me back allowing my cousin to go in. I can still feel my father clenches my arms so tightly when he saw his sister. He said ""*[I better call the ambulance](http://www.wikihow.com/Call-an-Ambulance)*"", so he did and left. My cousin call me out to help pick her up. But she was too heavy, we can't even push her to the side. So my cousin rinse her with water to clean her off. I was told to took a towel and wipe her face. I could say her face was in a total blankness. 

25 minutes later the ambulance arrive. They took her with a stretcher. Both of us went down to send her off. I can remember certain vision of some neighbours pry on their window looking out what was happening. My dad went together with Aunt L, so left me and my cousin. Soon my mom and sister arrive bringing cleaning equipment. We spent whole 3 hours cleaning her house. Based on what I heard my cousin said ""*The man who always deliver her food got no respond from her for three days. That's when he ask the neighbour if she had gone somewhere. I bet if we were too late, she might have gone by any minute unconscious on the floor*""


    18^th May, 2013
We had her funeral in the day after the day we thought she would died 6 years ago. Funny the coincidence of the date just *one day after* we laughed. My cousin gave a speech said she was a fighter. Indeed she was. I think her life is better after that 17^th May living in the retirement home. She was more happier than before she was a shut-in. R.I.P Aunt L, our auntie we always concern hereafter. ",Brief moments,2,nosleep

As I was doing this, the big rocking chair next to his litter box was swaying, and I gave him a quick glance. I felt him sniff at my ear. He then jumped off the chair and walked into the kitchen. I thought nothing of it for a few seconds, then froze. ""Oliver!"", I called. I then walked to the door and looked outside, he was napping on the steps.

echoes007,4,,2,1rhee9,,2,"I’ve always been a non-religious person. I was brought up by parents who told me to question everything. To not believe the crap that is forced down our throats daily. But I’ve always felt a whole in my life when it came to that stuff. I went as far as trying LSD and DMT to achieve this “religious experience” we all want, but I never got it. So, after a while, I just gave up and moved on and accepted there is no God, or spiritual experience, or anything that’s real, that will make me see life in a whole new perspective. Naturally, this got me down and depressed a bit. It was then when I started seeing 11:11 everywhere. It started one night when I was doing some heavy drinking and decided to do some coke lines. I remember vividly, my heart stopped, and I remember a sound, like a blender going off in my head. When I forced myself to snap out of what had happened to me, I remember the first thing I looked at was the clock on the cable box. It read 11:11. This stuck with me for a long long time. I felt like some force or spirit was forcing me to look at the clock when it was 11:11 in the morning and 11:11 at night. As if reminding me that it saved my life. This was going on for a while, when I went as far as Googling what it was. Unfortunately, the 11:11 thing was associated to some spiritual stuff, things I thought were bullshit to begin with. But still, 11:11 was always there. Slowly I stopped thinking about it, and my 11:11 experiences were less and less. It wasn’t until last week when I was driving home (I was butt sober) from an event when it started raining. My tires and brakes were messed up and I didn’t get a chance to change them, and besides, it hardly ever rains in this town, so this came as a surprise to me. As I was driving up a hill, I lost control of my car completely on the wet road, and was literally fighting my steering wheel and slamming on my brakes to stop the car, but I couldn’t. This went on for about five seconds until I finally stopped the car in the middle of the road. Again, when I snapped out of my panic mode, the first thing I looked at was the time, and it said 11:11. I’m not one who believes in coincidences, but this has me thinking I have some angel or spiritual entity looking after me. Even though I don’t believe this stuff, there is NO way that could happen. Has anyone else experienced 11:11, or has randomly been “forced” to look at a clock when it’s 11:11? Or is it my brain playing tricks on me because of the LSD/DMT I took? ",11:11,4,nosleep
Jerbsybear,0,,0,1rh5g6,,2,"There are tales of a man committed to Central State

Who killed his wife and children while he asphyxiates

His doctors with the bloody spinal cord

Of his fat nurse, who cares if she was old

When the guards rushed in, it was no problem at all

bashing their brutish faces straight into the wall

Bursting through the heavy front doors

He killed everyone on the first floor

No one would stop him, no, not this time

5 years of waiting, no stopping on a dime

He had to get out on this night

To meet his lover, one at first sight

Taking his science class, year after year

Convinced that she loved him, held him dear

Called her ""favorite student"" and all

Had her parents give him a call

To invite him to dinner, on a cold winter's night

Slaughtered her family, their faces were a sight

In the judge's court, he mercilessly pleaded insanity

When, in reality, it was egotistical vanity

If he couldn't have her, no one can

To kill her new parents was the plan

Standing outside of the house that was soon to be theirs,

Looking to seek justice, to seek what's fair

So as he broke in and brandished the knife

She knew he was back to take a life

So quickly she fled into the night

Leaving behind more victims, as she took flight

She ran two miles straight to the highway

Waving for anyone to stop, to go her way

As hand grabbed her from behind the bushes

His knife drives deeper and deeper as it pushes

Past her vitals and deep into her heart

All flashbacks of her life seemed to fall apart

As he whispers ""This...feels so right""

Her mind tries to escape into the night

The fires of his greed are not yet doused

As he tries to get back to the house

He plans to take another life

While sharpening his serrated knife

""Am I next, is he coming,"" you cry with fear

InsanityInABottle,0,,1,1rgw03,,2,"“Extra, Extra! The Piggy killer is at it again!” Yelled the paperboy, holding a darkened paper above his head, screaming the same phrase over again, as if it was no big deal. I walked towards him and asked him “How much?”
“Only ten cents sir.”
“Ha. Must be a pretty good story then.” I said, as I fumbled for a large dime. I handed it into the boy’s hand, it’s gleam bouncing the light of the sun, veiled through the mist of rain into my eyes. I blinked quickly and grabbed the paper, quickly turning from the boy, hearing “How about a tip sir?”
“How about you wipe your ass with the metal I’ve already given you.” I said back to the boy, who furrowed his brow and continued screaming for new customers. As I walked along Hero’s Avenue, I kept the paper open, reading it over again. In large font, shouted “Piggy killer’s new victim!” with a picture of a woman, apparently known by the name of “Jessica Turrow.” She wore a large smile on her face, as she raised a glass of champagne above her head for a toast, I presumed.
	The article read “The psychopath, depicted as a man with a pig’s head on worn over his own face, has struck again. Witnesses described him as large, while wearing a reddened trench coat, then finally, a bib, which read the term KISS THE COOK, slathered neatly against his chest in gore. He had organs and even a human spinal cord attached to his coat and as usual, was found was mist was floating through the air and at dawn. We had identified the victim, through a ring found on the hand of the woman, who had been chopped to pieces and nailed against the side of the church. If you are to spot anyone fitting under the description, contact the police immediately, or you may be his next victim.”
	I laughed as I watched terror shrouding the faces of everybody who grasped a paper in their hands, all walking along the street as automobiles drove recklessly between one another, threading the needle on the two way street, not large enough for two cars to fit on.
	I walked towards the police station, which was cleverly located across the street from a coffee shop, a brothel and a printing office. A police car drove by; it’s loud horn sounding, flashing red and white, reflecting the light from the rain directly into my eyes. I walked into the station, the smell of fresh cigars flooding into my nose. A man screamed from across a large waiting room, looking down at the paper, then looked up and said “Oh. It’s the wonderful Flynn. Of course my dear, come, come.” I walked past him, glaring at his smug face, and then opening the door into my office.
	A man sitting on a chair for those waiting to enter my office abruptly greeted me. He smiled and said, “Well hello sir, I am Dean Osterrietch and believe I have a lead on the notorious killer”
“The pig one?”
“Y- wait, there are more?”
“I believe there are, just they might not like attention as much as our friend here.”
“Well… thanks for informing me of that rather morbid concept, but I have gotten hundreds of pictures of the killer, coming out of his lair.”
	The man pulled out a large portfolio of pictures and dumped them onto my desk, arranging them appropriately. “So, if you look at these pictures, it was for when he first got into the business, holding small weapons, all identifiable, all related to the cutting of meat. Then as you look to the left, these are the later pictures, which are of him coming out, holding bodies on his shoulders, sitting in the back of his eatery and chopping them up, putting them into boxes and looking pleased with himself, all the while in his pig mask. But, he seems to be getting careless. He cam outside, barely slipping on his mask in time for my camera to flash a photo, his face seemed veiled in… something. Something sticky, something gruesome. But if you look closer, you can quite easily see the silhouette of his face. Large, hooked nose, eyes, clouded in blue, teeth, sharpened to perfection and a dripping mouth.”
“Ha. So you’re basically implying that you’ve seen a notorious killer walk in and out of a location multiple times and not even dared to act on it? I beginning to suspect you’re the killer!”
“But that would be silly. Why would a crazy give himself away?”
“I don’t know, why don’t you tell me?”
“I believe this conversation is getting a bit heated. I saw the ad in the paper that I should contact the police and thought I’d tell you where I’ve seen such events. Have you ever seen the abandoned butchery on 1800 Bellcove Street? Well there’s your place. Sir!” said the man as he gathered his pictures and threw them into his bag, which smelled of defecation and nickels. I watched as he slammed the door, then sighed and sat down on my desk, rapidly pressing the keys of my typewriter, updating the information I’ve received from the man.
“Mysterious man visits police station, says he has a lead on the piggy killer. As you all know, the notorious killer has crossed the line now. Enough to even be called a serial killer! What a sick bastard he is.” I continued being as pessimistic as possible, updating the paper, then grabbing my camera as I finished the article. Typing in my name, finishing with my name, saying “Written by: Flynn Covetail.”
	Darkness was beginning to shroud the air, perfect night for the killer to strike in his typical environment. Light rain was spattering against my window, racing down to the bottom of the screening, only to fall against an umbrella below. As I left my office, throwing on my coat, I screamed to the man in the front desk, “Going out to…oh, let’s see...1800 Bellcove Street? If I don’t come back, Phone someone.” I said with a laugh, while walking outside.
	Instantly my boots splashed against the small walkway paved on “Western Lagoon highway” as the frivolously worthless people would say. I walked down towards the street, which was naught but four blocks from here. I passed by Dontell’s Donuts, Redgar’s Rotisserie and Salam’s Spices, all involved in the fattening of desperate cops, as only fattening diners were located near the station, so I developed a theory that every restaurant owner is against us.
	I reached the butcher’s place, which had been looted to hell by the anarchists, who were just a group of thugs that didn’t do shit to overthrow the government. The door had been pried off it’s hinges, yet now it was replaced by a veil of chains, hanging off of rusted hooks attached to the doorframe. Within the butchery, the first thing I noticed was a bed, a homeless man sleeping on it.
	I simply ignored the bum and walked around, searching for anything considered suspicious. I walked through the door, smelling the bum’s shit in the corner and closing my nostrils as well as I could. I looked through the shop, behind the counter I found several rusted knifes, which were corroded to the counter, which was a wooden rotten thing, with three cutting boards lining it, all of which nobody needed. The front of the shop seemed completely normal, but I listened to the bum waking, instantly screaming, “Who’s there! I will kill you if you’re trespassing on my property!” I laughed and screamed to him “I suggest you run out of here, or I may just have to turn you in as a key suspect for the crimes.” I heard the scuffing of his shoes against the floor, running towards me.
	I quickly turned, backing up against the wall, my sidearm pointed at the bum and screamed “GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!” I shot to the side of the man, who quickly bolted for the door, a rat following closely behind him. I sat for a minute, catching my breath, while my vocal chords seemed to scratch against one another in a uncomfortable clunky fashion. As I stood, I felt the hard callused flesh of an arm pressing against the front of my throat and the sudden feeling of something hard hitting the back of my head.








	Ha. Damn fool didn’t even know what he had coming. Shouldn’t have fucked with my grandpa… shouldn’t have yelled. My ears hurt. Are they ringing? Why the FUCK am I here? I thought a conversation to myself as I raised the man into the air, the familiar heaviness of my mask pressing against my face, the pig’s blood leaking down my neck, warming me, keeping the cold away. I looked at my setup, which was simply the back room of a butcher’s shop, a heavy steel door muffling sounds on both sides of the fifty wood wide hallway of a room.
	Blood dripped into wooden bowls I’d gotten from the shop, the bodies of fresh meat hanging from the ceiling. Pigs, cows, chickens, even a few deer, but the most stubborn of prey, the pigs. The sticky cunts hung from the ceiling, their wrists cut, their feet missing, their hands stuffed into their fucking loud mouths. The damned pigs that walked the streets, reading their stories about who? About me! The beautiful man, who is dealing righteousness to the crazies, to the rich. Though they think that they’re so safe in their leather homes, they should be the ones making chairs; their dried hides need to be a part of furniture!
	Oh, what an inventor I will be! But the best part is, nobody looks twice at the photographer. Nobody looks at who’s behind the camera; they only care about the picture! And I am finally the one in the picture! Flynn, the little anus that believed he owned the whole world, because the police were backing him up. NO, NO, NO! YOU ARE MY FUCKING BITCH!
	I whistled a tune of sorrow and greed that humans so openly express. I raise him in the air, catch a hook to his leg and strip him down to his bare neck. This self-conceited asshole needs one thing. A hook curving through the cheek, wrenched from his cheek. He thought I was the killer? NO! THAT IS NOT THE FUCKING WORD!
	Oh! My friend is waking up! Finally a new toy to play with. Oh, what a joy he will be! Oh no! What will I say to him? I guess I’ll just wing it. I guess I’ll just talk to him.  Where will I display this beauty? Ooh! The police station! Mmm, how delectable would that be? To show the pigs that even their weapons can’t defend them from me. THEY ARE GOING TO LOVE ME! I am a hero. I love being a hero and don’t try to talk me out of my heroism! I AM AMAING!








	My eyes slowly opened, to find a man in a pig mask, the rotting dreaded animal seemed to have a grin on it’s face. I was hanging upside down and fuck my leg hurts! Why does my leg hurt? Where the hell am I? “Oh… you’ve awakened!” spouted the pig; it’s squeaky voice ringing through my ears. I screamed, “Help me! Help! HE’S GOING TO KILL ME!” 
“Now that’s not how you treat a guest, is it?”
“Fuck you.”
“Oh… language, language my dear friend. If you even try saying something like that, I will cut off your cock and feed it to my friend Mr.Squeaks over here!”
	I looked to where he was pointing, which was a large column in the room, a decomposing rat nailed to the pole. “Somebody is going to catch you. They know where I am!”
“Oh, I believe they do, if only your little desk friend was there to hear what you had to say!” said the phsyco with a smile. He pointed at the ceiling, which had two hooks on it, chains hanging from them and a headless man, blood dripping in a steady stream of thickness, into a wooden bowl. “Why are you doing this to these people?”
“Okay, okay, story time. Oh yay, stories! FUCK OFF GREG, THIS IS MY TIME TO SHINE!”
	I looked at the pig with doubt, pain shooting up my leg, throbbing slowly into my brain. “SO, let me tell you why I love my job, okay? Okay. So, when I was twelve, I thought, I’m going to take pictures of weddings! I’m going to take pictures of people in love, because everyone else’s happiness, is mine.” He said this, while pinning his right hand against his heart, which contained an extra few layers of flesh, sewed against his own, along with a tattoo, stolen from his victim.
	“Okay, so anyways! What do ya know! I’m doing that now! I am a photographer! I love people being happy. SO, I one day, was at this one glorious wedding, full of lovely people. I had started talking to a woman and a little, oh what is it called? Fetish of mine was developed. As we were in bed, I took out my camera and took shots of my experience and little did I know, I have a few other… kinks. I wrung my hands around her delicate throat, stuck my finger down her throat and felt the vomit shoot from her mouth! I felt the rush as eventually, she started to fuckin’ bleed! WHAT A WHORE! She began to cough up blood, she began to wheeze and it is as these coughs echoed from her throat, landing inside of my mouth as our lips touched, did I realize how wonderful blood tastes. Rich, creamy, delicious, blood, coursing from the fountains of our decapitated stumps. I invented ways of sucking people dry, licking them dry! Well, at first I was only an amateur, but, as I got better! Oh BOY did I start to love my job! Every wedding became a slaughter, every wedding gave me a new friend, because after all, nobody cares about who’s behind the camera! NOBODY GIVES TWO FUCKING SHITS!
	So, pretty boy, I believe it’s time; you… started looking into my eyes, whenever I snap a photo of your beautiful body.” He said this as his hand slid down from my chest, slowly down to my cock, grinning, spittle flying out of his mouth as he coughed, slid a blade against it as chopped it off. I screamed out loud, blood spurting from me and all the smile he smiled, then I fell asleep, never to wake again.

ReiKoroshiya,0,,0,1rgsca,,2,"Here I am and im going to write about some of the things that go on in my life. Sorry for bombarding you with some trivial things and please just hear me out.
how about I start at the beginning that seems easier. Well back in elementary, I was that kid the kid that really no one liked. I had a friend here and there but that's about it. I was basically a social outcast, 
I never really got my work done, I still don't. Note that I was a very, very angry child and no I was not spoiled if that's what your thinking, im the oldest of 3 kids who had been and are growing up in poverty, but my father is very good at managing money which means he is very cheap.
I had shared a room with my younger brother and for some reason I never grew out of the stage where you sleep with your blankets over your head. I had always liked horror even though none of it really scared me even in elementary in the 3rd grade I found an author by the
name of R.L.Stine and I had read tons of his books which remotely captured my interests.
A few of the simple things had scared me, and I most likely have experiences that I have blocked out of my mind, I don't remember much about my childhood at all.
I don't know why I can't but that's just how it is. I do remember bits and pieces though, not anything like birthdays, mind you. Here Ile give some examples, I remember
when I thought my stuffed animal had red eyes, I freaked out a little bit called my parents and my father calmed me down and took it away. Years later I went back and found it, and of course it wasn't scary anymore. Another example
would be when I saw a ""witch"" in my closet, but again my father came in and turned the light on to show me that there was nothing there, I had clearly saw something but it was gone as soon as the light turned back on.
Once he had left and turned the light back of the figure was back again. I remember when my body shot up in bed and I let out a blood curtling scream and my parents rushed into the room
and they had tried to comfort me and to calm me down I was bawling my eyes out while hugging my father he had asked me what had happened and I was just mumbling incoherently 
about it. I can't remember what it was that had freaked me out so badly. Something else that just pokes out at me was when I was lying in bed and I hear talking so I sit up strait in bed and I see my parents right there talking to each other I couldn't understand what they were saying because they were mumbling and I said hey and they say love you simultaneously and I said aww I love you too you guys, I reached out to hug them and they both just vanished and I almost fell out of bed(I got top bunk). Then their are the things that I have learned from my family throughout the years, not much really
they don't seem to want to talk much about when I was younger. I got that I was a horrible child when they brought me to church, and that I would bite and snarl when anyone got within an arms reach of me.
keep in mind I don't remember that about going to church, as a matter of fact I don't remember going to church at all. hmmm.... well skip forward to middle school where I had
actually made friends. I did got in so much trouble in middle school its not even funny. I could barely even go a week without at least one detention. Saturday school and suspensions I had gotten a ton too, now
drugs are prevalent where I live and when I say that drugs were prevalent I truly mean that, but honestly the thought of drugs never really appealed to me well I mean
certain ones that is, the only mind altering substance that I would actually want to do, smoke, drink, etc would be alcohol cause it seems fun and really any hallucinogenic drug and there
is no way I could get ahold of hallucinogenic drugs without paying a ton of money and with my broke ass I can't afford it and because of that im drug free. Not to much
happened in middle school, only a few things I started to get hellish demonic dreams (oh and speaking of dreams I have always been able to feel pain in my dreams so if
say I was to get ran through with a spear or had my flesh pealed off in a dream I would wake up and still feel it, I also talk in my sleep) which sucks ass, The vast 
majority of my dreams became violent and with me being an avid gamer there was usually a sword nearby in my dreams and usually I could and would fight back and be home
free. I enjoyed those violent dreams where I won, even though I would battle hellish creatures and people I wouldn't consider it a nightmare. I got my own room in the basement which was nice, and well my brother he was, how do you put it? 
Gassy so yeah hot air rises and all that. Electronic malfunctions had started occurring, like waking up to my radio playing static, my alarm clock started to malfunction, etc. I remember waking up minutes before my alarm clock 
went off I awoke with a shot of electricity to my left ear. Skip forward to highschool in the 9th grade I found out what creepypasta and scp were it was amazing to find real horror for a change.
I read the hell out of creepypasta's and found some really cool narrators for them, listening to those was very enjoyable I didn't read scps often and I found a very long series called the holders.
Near the end of the year I started to feel a presence in my room which was interesting because it didn't have a bad feeling to it, the only word that comes to mind to describe it would be light if that makes any sense.
Jump forward one more year, I had flunked my freshman year because I don't do my work. On those professional tests that they make you take S.A.T's or some shit I did 
insanely good on those like I should be an A- student overall. Now i reside in alternative ed. Im 15 right now. I declared to my parents that im agnostic instead of
Baptist a few months ago. Anyway that presence in my room i hardly feel it anymore and now there is something more sinister and not just in my room anymore.
That thing I actually saw it, I fucking saw it, it was short like about a foot and a half tall. I went to bed last night and you know how earlier I had said I sleep
with my blankets over my head. Well I was moving around under the covers and I glanced out underneath the covers and there it was just staring at me a few inches away 
from my face I had to resist not to punch it because half of me was saying its just my imagination and the other half says that if its real  then im going to freak the fuck out and well I never did hit it and its creepy as fuck that its been watching me. I tried to calm my breathing as to not alert it to the fact that I have seen it I
think it knows I saw it because I have been getting glances of it all day. It might have seen me and it might be watching me type this.
It is very short and I can never manage to see any features on its face it just looks dark like a shadow its really, really dark, everything distorts when I look at it like my depth perception gets thrown off and space distorts around it.

highchairchildren,3,,1,1rgqmu,,2,"I'm looking for any input. If anyone has had experiences like this, is there a way to stop it?

So this started about two years ago. In the beginning it was just a perpetual bad feeling, like something bad was going to happen all the time.  I was anxious, always alert and never at rest. I hardly slept, primarily keeping myself awake in order to feel safer. 

Then, I started seeing things.

When I say seeings things I don't mean like hallucinations, well not really. I'm not crazy. There were never any voices and there never have been. It was more like a blackout moment in which the worst possible scenario for my environment would play out seemingly right before my eyes. 

Mostly accidents.  It happened once while I was sledding.  The hill was a steep drop and then inclined back up about 20 ft. or so where it met a busy road. Usually people lost momentum and slid back down the hill and came to a rest in the valley but sometimes, people would make it all the way up and hit the metal road block that was put up along the hill. A watched as a kid went down the hill and then it happened. I continued to watch as he went all the way back up the hill and under the metal road block right into the speeding car that was passing by. There was blood everywhere. I snapped back to reality and looked around. Everything was fine. There was no blood, nobody was hurt, just kids sledding around having fun. 

I continued to have random ""visions"" for the entire year. They varied in severity. The worst one left me shaken for a few days afterwards.  I was home babysitting my younger sisters and boiling pot of spaghetti for dinner.  I moved to the sink to strain the pasta and then went back to turn off the electric stove.  My little sister approached me to ask a question and then I had my flash.  As I was seeing it, I grabbed her by her hair and pressed her face into the stove. In that moments I watched as her eyes rolled around in her head and she screamed, begging me to stop.  I snapped back and couldn't speak. I teared up and thought I was going to puke.  I ran to the bathroom, washed my face, sat down on the ground and cried. I had never felt such a mixture of fear and remorse in my life. I got up and reentered the kitchen, finished dinner and continued the night as if nothing happened.  She asked me what was wrong and I played it off as a bout of sickness.  I sat awake for hours that night and I still couldn't come up with a reason for why this kept happening to me.  I asked my mom to see a psychiatrist but unfortunately it was a luxury we simply couldn't afford. 

Then it stopped. As quickly as it came in it left and I had no more of an idea about what it was than I'd had before.  It stayed away for a while. I mean really a long time.  I was vision free for an entire year.

I was prompted to write this because I had another one the other.  The first in over a year but I am scared. I don't want it to start again.  The most recent one was more subtle.  I was shaving in the shower went as I brought the razor up my leg, somehow or another I cut myself and there was blood everywhere.  The tub was washed red with it and there was nothing I could do but stand and watch as it oozed out of my leg and swirled around in the water before going down the drain.  Then I flashed back and it wasn't there. I hadn't even cut myself.

I know this must sound crazy, like some Final Destination bullshit.  I swear to you I wouldn't have posted it if I didn't have hopes that someone could help.  Any input is welcomed.",Can anyone help?,3,nosleep

You might remember my journal entries from last month. Last month, I can't believe it's been that long. Days and weeks run now in an endless loop. Where I am now time doesn't matter. It's a nuisance, it's a hinderance. 

A lot has happened. I just wanted to let those who cared, who reached out to me, know that I am alive. Very much so. And I have met some friends. Real human beings. There is so much I want to tell you. So much I want to explain. But I can't. Not now. 

Just know that the monster under your bed is real. That shadow in the closet exists. And those voices, the voices you hear in the dead of the night are not your imagination. All your life you have been told horror stories. And now you seek them out, on this subreddit. To be entertained, to be thrilled. But these stories exist for a reason. Every story has a truth. A small bit of reality wrapped around trigger words and exaggeration. 

That truth is what lurks in the shadows of your house, just at the corner of your eye. The truth is what is waiting for you when you close your eyes to sleep, hoping for a peaceful night's rest. But nothing is peaceful in the dark. Where the light is eclipsed by the slithering, rotting presence that knows you oh so well. One day you'll know. You will wake up and know. All those stories. All those scary tales. All those fears.

Past this the note is unreadable, spewed with a fluid I can only assume is meant to go on the inside of people. Not that I’d really want to read much more anyways. I already know what happens. Well, not really “know”, but I can feel it. Who wrote it? I can only assume it was my dear Uncle Drewson, if he’s even my uncle. What is this? No clue. A note, obviously, but beyond that speculation reigns. Where did I find this? My new house, in a drawer. Nothing is inherently terrifying about that – Oh, except that it was under the clothing I had already packed there. I just missed it before, I keep telling myself. I half believe it. A few pills later and I’m not worrying about it anymore.

Before this, I didn’t even know I had an Uncle Drewson, let alone that I was to inherit his estate in the event of his untimely, but now enacted, demise. With a heavily estranged family, growing up in between various friends or close relatives passed around by uncaring parents looking to shirk responsibility, one loses track of aunts and uncles. It was in a familiar neighborhood, a spacious three bedroom, so I was in no way eager to turn it down. As a poor, regularly unemployed person I’d been accustomed to sleeping on generous friends floors in the all too often occurrence I couldn’t afford anywhere else. I thought, it’ll all be worth it one day, the day I make it in the world. I can pay all these people back tenfold. “The day I make it”, yeah right. A consistent – and more pressingly, free – living space was a welcome antonym to my recent fortunes. So I was moved in within a couple weeks. Absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened. Till that note seemed to start some kind of vicious domino effect on my life, I was content.

You know when you think back to something embarrassing, stupid, or otherwise shameful act you may have done in your younger, brasher days? Once you recall it, it starts eating away, regret seeping in to every corner of your thoughts, till you would give the world to go back and change it, or at least erase the memory. Imagine that, only you can’t remember what it was you’ve done. It’s simply gone from you. The more you try, the less you realize. The less you realize, the more you regret. The more you regret, the more you try. That’s what’s happening to me, ever since I moved here. But it even goes past that. It’s the sudden feeling you’re being watched from barely out of sight. And at the same time, a crushing loneliness in that feeling. I pop a few more pills. Of course, I’m not being watched. There’s no one else here. If you think you’re being rather clever, figuring this out, oh-no-someone’s-been-in-the-house-with-you-all-along, I was most certainly the only one here. Anyway, this was about the time I found the note. If it was this Drewson, what is he talking about? Who does he want back? What is his need? Do I even want to know the answer to any of these? Insatiable curiosity will ensure I do, personal preference notwithstanding. Putting it all to the back of my mind, I chop up steak for dinner. I like to think of myself as a fairly accomplished chef, particularly where matters of slicing and/or dicing are concerned. I once worked a sushi bar, as a side job to pay the bills, and was quite proud of my ability to launch various morsels into the air and sever them in two with one fell swipe, like you see in commercials. Until the day my knife slipped and nearly skewered a customer’s eyeball. Maybe I’m not quite as proficient as I thought… I grab the bottle of pills and take a few. I don’t really like thinking about that time in my life.

I’m digging through my drawer later, that same drawer, when I stumble upon another discovery. Instead of a clue, it only deepens my mystery. A USB stick is secured to the very back of the board. I carefully remove it, and spend a few minutes simply gawking at my find, my inner curiosity again sparring with my better senses. I think, this will perhaps answer some questions about the note, and hopefully clear up my imaginations conjuring brought on by its conclusion’s implications. As per your previous assumptions, I couldn’t be farther from the truth. I secure the stick in its dock. View files. Two folders: “Reminders” and “Media”. Reminders is empty, media contains one subfolder: “Vids”. I open the folder. Two more: “memories” and “triggers”. Memories is empty. I open triggers. I’m confronted with one video file: shotinthedark.wmv. It’s 0:40 long. I press play.

Before I continue, if you’ll permit me one aside to validate the severity of this. I’m a massive horror movie fan, and I like them brutal. The more blood and guts, the better. I like truly graphic, heart wrenching stuff, and I very rarely squirm at it. Three seconds into shotinthedark.wmv and I rushed over the trash can to puke what felt like my very soul out. The scene I’m immediately confronted with was a man on a chair wearing nothing but an undershirt and briefs. There is a single light source on the chair, but I can faintly make out a figure in the background. Then, without a word, the man’s brains are ejected out his face, accompanied with a thunderous bang. Bone and cartilage spew forth in the foreground. Nearly black red sludge runs down his white undershirt, accompanied with brain matter that had just been crackling with life, likely flooded by fear, but life. I don’t have too much time to process anymore; I’m preoccupied with regurgitating my expertly made steak into the wastebasket. I think, it must be fake, but I know it’s not. I’ve got to tell someone about this, I think, the police, someone. Yeah, I’ll talk to the cops. Then, over my subsiding retching, I hear a familiar voice utter “Are you sorry now?” in the tone of a disappointed parent talking to their disobedient toddler. Something in that voice is chilling. Something… I return my gaze to the computer screen, where the barely visible figure now stands in full view, smiling.

I recognize the smile too.

It’s me, smiling back at myself, gripping a smoking sawed off.

The computer screen goes black. My head spins. I lie down.

youngsterjose42,1,,5,1rge20,,1,"He woke up in the morning like every other day. Yet this day was different; Jordan was going back to school after being expelled last year. He was caught with drugs and his school wanted nothing to do with it. He moved, now resides in york, Pennsylvania and now goes to William Penn High. He moved to a house which was quite old and just had some renovations a while back. The rent was quite cheap so his mother said ""why not?"". I was one of Jordan's first friends, since moving to york he told me things about that house really strange things. He soon moved away a little after I moved away so I have no idea where he is now. If any of you happen to live in york I'm talking about the old burned down house on market street across the street from the kindergarten/daycare. This story takes place about 2 years before the house burned down. 

A month since school started and about two weeks since I started talking to Jordan he invited me over to his house. Jordan said ""cmon dude come and stay the night my moms gone and im pretty sure wont give a shit"". So I thought why not I haven't spent the night at a friends house in a while ""yea sure ill spend the night man"". We went around town skated for a while, went to McDonald's with a few other friends then it came around 10 or maybe 11 everyone was ready to go home and i was ready to just go to a place and chill, play video games, and maybe eat some more. We got to his place, sat down in the living room, and lit up a blunt. Playing grand auto 3, high off our asses, we ordered some pizza. We ate and everything was fine till I felt like heading over to the bathroom. As soon as I opened the door I notice under the sink there was like a small cabinet and the doors slammed shut. I was high so I didn't really questioned it much. I used the bathroom and then as I exit I suddenly hear a giggle coming from under the sink. A child's giggle, as if there was a kid under the sink playing hide'n'seek or something. Again I did not question it because I was high and didn't really wanna bother finding out what made the noise. Jordan passed out on the couch, I went to his room and tried to sleep on his bed. I remember waking up around four in the morning hearing footsteps and a child giggling I'm pretty sure it was a little boy. I couldn't really tell his age but he was young; I would guess around six or seven. He was running around the house and he stopped at the door I did not see him, I only ever got to see his outline. He said "" I'm really happy I got more friends to play with now"". Suddenly after that he vanished faster than I could blink. I didn't sleep for the rest of the night. I had goosebumps for a good 30 to 45 minutes. Eventually I  calmed myself down by eating pizza and watching TV.",Hide 'N' seek,6,nosleep

We were watching Toy Story 3 in my downstairs, and we have 2 pillars downstairs to support our house and the framing on a the one behind the couch is loose, so sometimes it snags on clothes and makes a loud noise when it hits the pillar. So, we were close to the end of the movie, and we heard the loose framing hit it like someone pulled it away from the pillar. We all automatically stopped and looked at each other for about a minute, then we got up and ran to my room. We had to go past the pillar to get to my room so it snagged on my blanket and made the snapping noise again, which made everyone go faster.

Mindlesssavage,4,,8,1rhawv,,0,"I have a Where's Wally book. Well, had. Why? I'll tell you.
So I was just searching for Wally at night like I usually do, and I heard a noise.
It was sort of a scratching noise, scratching with a walking cane maybe.
I went to investigate. I went out of my room and...
Nothing.
Maybe it was just me. I went back to my bedroom door. I saw something written on really drippy red paint.
It said ""Find me if you can"". I thought it was just my little brother Mike painting on the walls again. ""Where was Mike anyway?"", I thought. Then I remembered he was outside playing with our pet dog Molly. ( Don't ask me why he was playing in the dark, because I have no idea).
I went inside my room. That's when I saw it. The book was lying on the ground open. I picked it up. This is what the title said:
""yllaW s'erehW"" Now THIS was weird. I also saw the same Wally picture except his eyes were gone and blood was dripping from them.
It was possessed, I thought. I ran outside to bury it, and I stepped on something. It sounded like it was glass because I heard it shatter.
I looked down.
A pair of broken, black rimmed glasses. I ignored it and ran even faster than before.
I ran to my dog Molly's kennel. I always feel safe when she's with me.
She was whining in the corner. That was typical, though. But wasn't she playing with Mike? I shouted out, ""Mike! Mike! Can you hear me?""
No replies.
I ran to the middle of the yard to bury the book.
I stepped in another thing. It was squishy, and slimy.
I looked down.
Blood. Blood and guts.
And Mike.
Lying on the ground.
Stomach open.
With a walking cane through his heart.
I wanted to cry, but then I saw a little Post-It note on the cane.
A poem.
This is what it said:
""I can run, and I can hide.
Tear you apart from the inside.
Waiting in the darkness, with my cane.
Used to be for children, now insane.
Red and white, in the grey fog.
Running around with my little pet dog.
With my girlfriend Wenda, with her camera,
And an old man with a white beard.
The prisoner who escaped from jail, murdering people with no fail.
That's my gang, with no doubt.
When you're in with me, there's no way out.""
This was way too bad to just BURY. We had to set it on FIRE. Or RIP IT APART. Just destroy it in whatever way I could.
So now in my backyard, a grave for Mike, some burnt and ripped pages, shattered glasses, and a walking cane.
And to this day, I never read another Where's Wally book again.
And every night, I still hear the sound of a scratching walking cane against my bedroom door.
THE END.

kimmiekissies,13,,29,1rgt5c,,122,"I never even met him, I didn't know his name or face. I was, blissfully unaware, of his very existence.

 I will never know why, or when it started. I'm glad for that I guess. I moved into my very small apartment in February last year. My landlord, Olivia, was a sweet older woman who would cook to much and bring me much appreciated leftovers. She was great to me, even after telling her my problem. I'm antisocial, but she didn't mind renting to a reclusive young girl who reminded her of her daughter.

 Every few weeks she would knock on my door then leave, letting me know she was leaving something for me. I loved that. Not even my family would cook so well. The next morning I wash and leave her empty containers outside my door and by an hour or so she would take them back again. My other neighbors seemed fine, but I never talked or visited with them.

 I work from home so anytime I ever was forced to go out I rushed out and into my apartment avoiding an, uncomfortable situation. I loved living alone, it was everything I hoped for. I could just, breathe. By April though, I started noticing things were not right. They were moving, or plain disappearing. I was convinced it was just anxiety caused by my new medication and the move, another side affect was it would make me so drowsy. Since I hated seeing the doctor I just dealt.

 I took naps during the day now and eventually stopped caring. Until one incident doubled my paranoia, Olivia brought me some sort of greek tossed salad and dressing for lunch one day and I enjoyed it with my friend netflix. I fell asleep in the middle of Portlandia, and woke up that evening at 5pm. Per usual, what was not usual was my bedding on the opposite side of me was disturbed. I only sleep on the right side. Always. Even more it felt.. *warm.* My first thought was I must have rolled around a lot, but I knew it was to odd to dismiss. 

I got up and searched my apartment gripping my phone with 911 typed in. Nothing else was disturbed, everything was exactly like it should be. I let it go, for the next few weeks everything was normal pardon the occasional misplaced shoe or drawn back shower curtain. I thought about telling someone, my parents, maybe Olivia, but if it's not life or death I am not reaching out to anyone. 

I wasn't scared, I was nervous, maybe a little stubborn.. But I stayed. I am not letting some stupid anxiety ruin my lovely lonely world.
 May came and It was getting worse. My panties, toothbrush, hell even my food was being misplaced. Every time I woke up there was this strange odor in the air. I finally realized this won't go away by ignoring it. I called my mom and begged to come stay a few days, when I got home I told them everything. Saying it out loud solidified any creepy suspicions. 

That weekend my dad went to my apartment and what was found was true horror. Written all over that walls: ""COME BACK"" ""BABY PLEASE"" He ran out and called the police. There was no one living in my apartment but someone definitely had access besides me. 
The investigation revealed a man, Henry, the son of my landlord Olivia, was in a projected relationship with me.

 They showed me his confession on tape. He admitted coming into my apartment every night and everyday with his mother's extra key. He claims we were in love and he had my permission. He drugged his mother's food she left out for me causing my drowsiness and falling asleep so he could come in and watch me sleep, touch my hair, kiss my shoulder. The leftovers I had in the fridge were tested and confirmed.
 I was absolutely, horrified and disgusted. A man, I never knew existed, collected my drain hair, clothes, and trash and practically lived in my apartment for *four months.*

Thanks to everyone for your responses, I have taken a lot of your advice.
I'll just give you all a quick update on what happened after I posted yesterday. She ended up having a nap after sitting in front of the TV for a few hours. I was going to walk our dog, Zeus, but I decided to wait until she woke up just in case she woke up and was confused.


She woke up after a couple of hours and was.....well. Happy. Really, really happy. Almost manic. She woke up full of beans, and smiling like a maniac. I was initially relieved. I asked would she like to come for a walk with Zeus and I and she happily agreed. We set off for our normal walk, and she was extremely energetic, bounding off in front of Zeus and I. Zeus is a Labrador, and although he is a big boy, he's still a pup. We usually just meander along on these walks while he sniffs at everything along the way. But she set a cracking pace and Zeus and I struggled to keep up. 


We got up to this park where we usually let him off his lead for a while as we're trying to train him to not run off on us and to be sociable. It's always been a real task getting him back on the leash though, he never ever comes when he's called. Anyway, we let him off, and he's running around and smelling everything and peeing on anything that stands still long enough. My wife, she's picking flowers and sniffing them, and singing. She gets on the swings at the park and I push her for a bit, as she sings under her breath. I was feeling quite content at this point. Figured she must have just been over tired.


She's swinging vigourously when all of a sudden she comes to a dead halt. She yells, in an almost unfamiliar, masculine voice, ""Zeus! Here!"" and points in front of her feet.


I stood in disbelief as I watched Zeus, the most disobedient rascal of a dog I know, solemnly trot over to where she's pointing, sit in front of her, and stare up into her face. They both sat there for a split second, very still, looking at each other. I picked my jaw up off the floor and asked her ""Um..what the hell! How did you manage that!"" and that seemed to break both their concentration and Zeus shot off like a bat out of hell again, and she started swinging again - ""Oh"" she said, ""I used my mind to call out to him...it's something new I learned..""
She seemed kind of sheepish about it to be honest. I pressed her for more details, but the more questions I asked the more defensive she got. She knows I don't believe that for a second. I'm just happy that Zeus is finally starting to be trained. That's really the only explanation. I asked her to do it again but she refused, so I think we both know it was a fluke.


The rest of the afternoon was....nice. Kind of odd. It's like there's something that's amiss. Like when you walk into your messy bedroom and you can tell that *something* is not how it should be but you can't pin point what.


We talked a bit about the seminar. She said that it was very intense. The days were very long. She said that the premise of the seminar is to get to the root of any emotional upset, to explore the root causes for what's going on in your life. I asked if any hypnosis was used, as suggested by you guys, and she said no. They talked a lot, and were assigned to small groups, and encouraged to open up and explore their ""inner beings"". She said she felt a lot better since attending.
Still, something was not quite right. For instance, we were talking about my sister who lives in another state, and how she had recently got a new job. A few minutes later, my phone rang and it was her. I picked it up and said ""Emma! Speak of the devil..."" and my wife smashed me up the side of the head, causing me to drop the phone and shouted ""Emma is NOT the devil!! How could you say that!!! Emma is NOT THE DEVIL!!"" I told Emma I would call her back and tried to get my wife to calm down. She was very upset at what I had said. She sort of went silent again, and was very still. She seemed rather annoyed at me, but by this point, I was nearing exhaustion myself, so I let her be.

She fell asleep early, about 8pm, on the couch. I covered her with a blanket, and noticed that her eyes are kind of half opened..... I used to have a friend who slept like that at school and I've never noticed it before, I think that in my state of hyper vigilance, I am being overly perceptive of small details.
 
I read more of my original post, and all your comments, and decided to step outside and call our therapist, just to find out more about the seminar, as I knew she was there assisting.

I walked out onto our back porch and lit a cigarette and rang her. She answered on my first ring. What she said has really weirded me out. Only because although she gave me a lot of information, she has raised many more questions, as well as answered them.
 
She said these seminars are more like interactive workshops run by a man named Brian and his wife Linda, who are both self-appointed ""psychotherapists"". She said that there are psychologists such as herself on stand by to assist because sometimes when people are in such a vulnerable state, they may need assistance. She said she has referred a lot of her client's to attend these workshops and has found them to be helpful in most cases.
 
Basically, the course is about discovering your inner self, and using different methods to connect to your inner voice, to find out what the cause of your worries are. She said that it is incredibly demanding and intense. Each session goes for 14 hours with only an hour break. During these sessions, many different activities and topics are explored, including, regression. Apparently Brian does this 3 hour session on the second last day, where he gets everyone to meditate, and be still, and he regresses them back to childhood, or even, in some extreme cases, past lives. Our therapist said, it was so intense that she had to fight from being regressed herself. She did make comment that she had been concerned initially about how my wife would handle that, but that she seemed ""brighter, had a clarity about her"" after this experience. They discussed what my wife had gone back to, in her mind, and the therapist was happy that it hadn't caused her any great distress, but reminded me she couldn't discuss the specifics. She said when she wakes tomorrow I could gently try and open the lines of communication with her and she may explain her ""experience"".
 
I told her about my wife's strange behaviour. She said it is normal to be a little out of sorts after one of these sessions, but nothing major. I don't know if it's just me, but I could sense a tiny bit of alarm in her voice.... I don't know, maybe I imagined it. She said to call her if there's any further problems.
 
I hung up, and as I was putting out my cigarette, I turned to go inside and my wife's standing there staring at me. I jump and say ""Jesus Christ honey you scared me!"" and she replied ""Not as fucking much as I'm going to scare you.""
 
Ummm ok. I had to physically turn her and direct her into the house. In the moonlight she almost looked like a stranger to me. Her long blonde hair was hanging in her face, and her face was fixed in this awful scowl. I figured she must still be pissed at me from before. I put her to bed and she goes back to sleep.
 
And, well, that's where she is now.... she was supposed to be off work today too, but I was meant to go back to my job. But when my alarm went off, I just had this weird feeling that I should stick around and make sure she was ok. I rang in sick for work, and I'm just doing some household jobs, waiting to see if she's better when she wakes up, and googling what regression means, and what these intense emotional exercises can do to someone. Still nothing that convincing though. I dont know. Maybe I'm *too* skeptical. I just don't believe this crap.

The whole thing sounds a bit stupid to me, if I'm honest. But I have to say, it has caused some kind of change in my wife. She is very extreme in her emotions at the moment, and I'm worried, because we both have to go back to work tomorrow, and her work environment is very proper. She is always a perfect employee, and very dedicated to her work. I can't help but feel concerned that she might wake up tomorrow and still be in this....mood. Do you guys know anything about this ""regression""....is it the same as hypnosis? She was adamant she wasn't hypnotised, but it sounds like it to me!!



EDIT: Ok now I'm getting really freaked out. I went to check on her and she was talking and singing her sleep. I can't quit work out what song she's singing I've never heard it before. But she's saying something about being someone called Azara or something??? It's really fucking unnerving it doesn't even sound like her. Ill try and get a recording and see if you guys can shed some light. 


EDIT TWO: Ok I managed to record a bit of it...she's singing but I don't know what, has anyone heard this before????????? Ignore the TV in the background I was watching it in the lounge room to drown her out, and it was really unnerving when I turned it off and all I could hear was her.

floydnimrod,21,,25,1rhxtb,,113,"I'd just come from church for some reason. I'm not sure why I'd gone into the church, but it was the weirdest service I'd ever been too. Everybody was there. It was a packed house. Rich people, poor people, criminals, middle class folk. It was all people who didn't normally go to church. I looked into the coat room as I walked in, and some guy was snorting cocaine on this little counter top. Right in a church. I was like, what the hell? I've never see that.

I sat in a pew, and looked up. There was no minister. They were just playing a movie of an old church service on the screen. Some little old lady was playing a hymn on an organ, and the minister was applauding her. She seemed happy. But the audience was restless, not really paying attention, not sitting down, just kind of wandering around, talking to everybody. 

And then I saw a woman I used to know, someone I worked with years ago. I went to sit down next to her, and she sort of jumped on my lap and hugged me, saying she was so glad to see me. I wasn't sure if she was sad, or drunk, or terrified, or just lonely, but she whispered in my ear, offering me sex, saying she's always wanted me, ever since she'd known me. I sort of pushed her off my lap, thinking this was hardly the place for that kind of cheap pick-up. And then I got up and walked out. There wasn't really a church service going on anyway, I don't even think it was Sunday.

And then for some reason, I was in a car with this old lady. I don't even know who it was, or why I was with her. She was old like my grandma Freddie, but it wasn't her. We were driving down the street. She was driving too slow because she was kind of lost. I don't think I was in Winnipeg I was on a large street, almost the size of Portage with several lanes. But they all seemed to be deserted, like very early on a Sunday morning. I'm not sure if it was early in the morning or near sunset, but the sun was low in the sky. I think it was late in the day. The streets were mostly clear though.

The lady pulled over and for some reason she got out of the car. I think she was going to ask somebody for directions. I looked at the GPS thing she had on her dashboard, and suddenly the direction went all fuzzy and scrambled, like the satellite was confused, or just no longer there. And then the whole sky got this weird greenish tint to it for about ten seconds. It basically turned green instead of blue, but only for a moment, and then it was back to normal. Everybody stopped and looked up.

I was still in the car, but I leaned forward and looked out the window. The sun was over in the west, low in the sky. And I saw what looked like a second moon fly over the sky in a direction that was diagonal to the sun's normal path. It was huge. And my stomach got queasy for a moment. It made your stomach sick because it was so big, it actually pulled on you with its own gravity, like the moon pulls on the tides, but much bigger, and everything inside you just got tugged around.

But it went straight across the sky, without hitting. When I realized how close it was, though, I knew it was gonna hit somewhere, probably on the other side of the world. The gravity of the earth pulled it in, and it sling-shotted around to the other side somewhere. I jumped out of the car and grabbed the old lady's arm.

""Come on! We have to find shelter! It's gonna hit!"" 

We just abandoned the car in the street, and I dragged her toward a nearby fire station, or hydro office, or whatever it was. I'm not sure which it was, but there were large utility trucks, with lifts on them. It was also deserted for some reason, except for two guys loading one of the trucks. We banged on the doors, but it was locked up. We ran from door to door trying to get in, but everything was locked. 

And then I felt a great rumble under my feet. It nearly knocked me down. I've never been in an earthquake, so I don't know what it's like, but it felt like the entire planet shivered. Car alarms started going off in every direction and I heard a weird sound like gravel tumbling down a hillside, except there were no hills. I think it was pieces falling off houses in all directions. We were able to stay on our feet though. 

A few moments later, the sky in the north went dark. If I assume the sun was setting in the west, and the meteor or asteroid or whatever flew over the sky in a north-west to south-east direction, then it was north the black came from. And I mean the entire sky. Like a wall of blackness, smoke and ash suddenly filling the view from the ground to the upper atmosphere, from west to east as far as you could see, in one huge wall of black cloud. And it was coming toward us. Well, sort of going towards everyone, everywhere, I guess. It came over the horizon like an charging army, fast and steady, advancing.

""It hit on the other side of the world somewhere! Come on! we have to get indoors! We won't be able to breathe!""

The air started turning yellow. Ash started raining down, and bits of rock and debris from the blast, where ever it hit. I took a deep breath and held it as I was running. I could already smell a weird burning rock smell, like sulphur, like burnt matches, but more metallic. 

Me and the lady finally got into some doors, but it was just a little foyer. We ran in and shut the doors behind us. The inside doors were locked. But it was somewhere to hide. There was a fire alarm. I pulled it, not really knowing why I was bothering. But I was sort of in a panic and not thinking straight. The sign said, In Case of Emergency, so I pulled it. The alarm went off, and we looked out the window. The yellow air turned brown, and then dark red. Then everything went black. The black cloud fell over the whole sky with a clattering rumble that sounded like it was raining gravel instead of water. And all light went out of the world.

The world as we knew it was over. Even if we survived, life as we know it would never be the same. We'd be set back 10,000 years, reduced to hunter gatherers again, living out of caves. If we survived the impact that is. I honestly don't think anybody would have survived the shockwave. Something with that much gravity hitting the earth would pretty much end the story for everybody.

Charlies_friend,20,,9,1rhapg,,79,"A friend of mine posted a story here not too long ago, and he was pretty well received by your wonderful community, so I decided to create an account to share mine.


When I was a little girl, about nine years old, my family purchased a small ranch in western Kansas. My father had just gotten out of the Army, and I suppose after seven years of trotting around the world, and spending two of those years in active combat zones, my dad just wanted to go somewhere the world would leave him alone. He couldn't have found a better location for this purpose; anyone who's ever followed Interstate 70 westward through that area knows, there isn't much between Topeka and Denver.

I still remember the day we (my mom, dad, older sister and I) moved into that old ranch house. It had been built in the early 1900's, and being something of a history buff, I was pretty excited to live in a house that had stood through prohibition, the depression, both world wars, and everything since. The house itself sat at the bottom of a small incline from the main road, backed literally into a hill. This setup meant the back half of the home sat underground, buried in the hillside. Outside the house was a little grassy yard area, and across this yard was an old barn. We didn't have any horses, but my dad held a particular love for classic cars, and he turned that barn into an amateur autoshop where he worked refurbishing old cars from the junk yard in his spare time.

My sister and I were given seperate but adjoining rooms upstairs, while my parents took the master bedroom (oddly) on the first floor. My sister and I's rooms opened onto a sort of landing that looked out over the living room and kitchen, and the stairs led down from there.

It was only our second or third night in the house, that I began to notice some strange things occurring. I was unable to sleep one night, and I laid awake in bed long after I heard my parents and sister go to bed. The house was incredibly quiet, both from being in the middle of a very isolated area, and by virtue of being half buried. Just as I was reaching the half-sleep state...........SLAM! I heard a door downstairs slam shut. At first I tried convincing myself I had just dreamed it, but I couldn't make myself believe that. And the next thing I heard chilled me to my core. I heard footsteps coming up the stairway. I could tell from the sound that the individual must be wearing shoes, so it probably wasn't my parents coming up to check on me. I heard the steps reach the top of the stairs, and then begin down the landing. I was frozen with fear when I heard them arrive outside my door, pause for a moment, and then continue on. When the stranger was apparently in front of my sisters room, he paused again, and again he continued. He reached the far end of the landing, and then turned around and came back the way he came. He continued for what seemed like an eternity, pacing around outside my sister and I's rooms. I finally worked up some nine-year-old courage and crawled to the door. I could still hear footsteps coming from just outside. I waited until he was moving away from me, and I was between him and the stairs, planning on making a mad dash for my parents room when his back was turned. I barely cracked open the door and looked out, and saw....nothing. The footsteps had stopped, and the whole house was empty, and still. I was confused, and afraid, but even then I knew if I ran to my parents they would think I was nuts. So I slid a chair in front of my door and crept into bed. A minute later the footsteps started again, back and forth, all along the landing. Eventually, they lulled me to sleep. 

I didn't mention the noises that night to anyone, fearful of my parents thinking I was a whacko, and of being made fun of by my sister. But, over the next few weeks, everyone in my family began to notice strange happenings on our ranch. Objects moved on their own. Small things would disappear for days, only to be returned exactly where they'd gone missing from. It was what I guess you'd call typical poltergeist activity; nothing harmful or malevolent, just noises here and there and odds and ends moving around. And practically every night I heard those footsteps outside my room. 

My family eventually began referring to this entity as ""Charlie"". He seemed to be a harmless ghost, and sometimes downright helpful. Occasionally my parents would wake early in the morning for work, only to find a freshly brewed pot of coffee waiting in the kitchen. The coffee maker had no automatic timer. Sometimes when one of us had misplaced something, like car keys or the like, we'd search the house frantically only to turn around and find what we'd been searching for laying on the ground behind us. And sometimes Charlie would slam a door, or walk around loudly, or turn a sink on, seemingly just to let us know he was there. And always, those footsteps at night.

Charlie always seemed particularly active in my dad's auto shop. My dad would occasionally find car parts he'd been working on had been tinkered with, despite the fact that he was the only one who ever went in there. Sometimes tools would go missing, only to be returned a short time later. Once my dad came in from his shop one evening as white as a sheet. When we asked what was wrong he just said ""Charlie was walking around out there........Jesus, I thought you all were just hearing things!"". I wasn't sure why Charlie loved that shop so much, but incidentally, that was where I caught my first sight of him. It was a Saturday, and my Dad was hard at work putting together an old Chevy Fleetline. My mom mad him a sandwich as a working lunch, and asked me to take it to him. I eased open the barn door, and saw my dad seated at his work bench, his back to me. And I saw another man, next to the car, also out of my dad's field of vision. He was about 5'8"", with dark hair and eyes. He was dressed in what looked like typical 1930's clothing; black slacks, a pinstripe vest over a grey work shirt, and topped off by a brown ""paper boy"" hat, cocked to one side. He looked right at me for a second, a big, mischievous grin on his face, and then he simply disappeared. I didn't even realized I was still holding my dad's sandwich and continued to stare at the spot Charlie had stood until my dad snapped me back to reality.

So passed the next few months. My family was happy on our little haunted ranch, Charlie seemed happy enough to share the space with us, and life was good. And his nightly vigil outside my room began to seem almost comforting. One night in late November, however, I learned just how utterly terrifying Charlie could be.

My dad had some kind of dinner event for work in Topeka, almost two hours away, and since my Sister was almost 16 by then, and there was virtually no crime in our rural area, my parents figured we would do fine by ourselves until they returned the next morning. Of course, to my sister and I, it meant we could stay up as late as we wanted, watch scary movies, all the kid stuff you can't do with your parents around. At around midnight, I was in my Sister's room with her watching some movie on her TV, when we heard a loud CRASH from the living room. My first thought was that it was Charlie, playing another prank, by this felt different somehow. Charlie's noises were simply little bumps to remind you he was home. But this noise sounded violent, and angry. Before I could really react, we heard another loud crash, and another. My sister cautiously peeked out of her door, and down into the living room. I swear I saw her go white. She began trembling, and her hand covered her mouth. I peeked around her to see what she saw, and felt y blood run cold. We could just barely see two men, outside our from door. One of them was kicking it in. As we watched, a final smash from this man caused the door jam to give out, and they both entered our home, shining long flashlights all over. My sister and I crawled under her bed, and held each other tight. This was easily the most terrified I have ever felt. 

But as the two men began to go through the living room, another loud crash came from the kitchen. One of the cabinets had opened and slammed shut; a favorite trick of Charlie's. The man who seemed to be leading the show shined his flashlight into the kitchen and shouted ""Is there anyone in here?!?? If you are, you better come out now!! We will find you, and we will FUCK you up!!!!"". My sister and I had to cover our mouths to keep from screaming out loud. At the man's words though, Charlie apparently got angry. We heard another loud crash and a skittering of metal on the floor, as one of our silverware drawers apparently threw itself across the room. I heard one of the men say ""What.......the FUCK?!?!"". And then Charlie decided he was do e fucking around. All at once, every door, window, and cabinet in our home began opening and closing violently, and loudly. Small objects all over the house began to fling themselves into walls, across the floor, even at the intruders. At this point, the one in charge just yelled ""FUCK this"" and turned and ran out, his buddy close behind.

As soon as the men were out of the door, everything stopped, and the house was again silent. It was a long, long time before either my sister or myself finally worked up the courage to move. She had left her cell phone downstairs, and and she needed it to call the police and our parents. She began slowly creeping downstairs to get it, and since there was no way in hell I was being left alone, I followed. As we got to the bottom, I looked into the kitchen, and for just a moment, Charlie was standing there, exactly as I saw him before, with the same grin on his face. A moment later, he was gone.

The police arrived shortly, and my parents not far behind. The cops determined that the disorder in the home was caused by the robbers ransacking the place for valuables, and they must have been scared off by a passing car. Lucky for us. My sister and I didn't even try to tell them what really happened, and within thirty minutes, both men were caught, still fleeing. 

After that night, hearing Charlie's walk around my floor gave me a serene sense of security every night. When he played his little pranks, I would always look for him. And every now and then I would catch just a glimpse of him and smile.

Several years later, when I was a junior in high school, I was working on a school report at the local library. The topic was the history of our town, and I wanted to see if the library had any old news clippings that mentioned my family's ranch. I typed our address on the search bar, and the first result stopped me dead in my tracks. The date of the old article was July 17, 1936, and at the top was a picture of a man, about 5'8"", with dark hair and eyes. It was, unmistakably, Charlie. The title of the article read ""Local Man Murdered While Defending Daughter"". It seems the man we called Charlie was actually named Brian Davis. He had lived alone in the ranch with his only child, a daughter, after losing his wife to a bad case of the Flu. On the night of July 15, the article said, Mr. Davis was returning home from his job as an auto mechanic in town. When he pulled up to the house, he found the door had been forced open. He ran inside, and found a man on top of his daughter. The girl was sobbing, her dress had been ripped open, and the attacker held a knife to her throat. In a moment of sheer instinct, Mr. Davis threw himself at the intruder, tackling him of his daughter, and as he held the attacker, Mr. Davis yelled for the girl to run to the neighbors and call the police. The girl made it the mile and a half to the closest neighbor, who promptly called the sheriff. When deputies arrived, they were able to apprehend the attacker, who had been beaten half to death. Unfortunately, he had stabbed Mr. Davis three times in the chest. Brian Davis died right on our kitchen floor.",Charlie,88,nosleep

childrenofsamhain,9,,5,1rhdoj,,36,"My friend Jaime purchased a new home about six years ago when his wife was pregnant with their first child. Until recently, he lived there with his wife Claire and their two daughters, Sarah and Emily. Sarah is now five years old and Emily is three. Within the first two years living in the house, Jaime said that he never experienced anything out of the ordinary. It wasn't until his daughter Sarah was around two years old, that he started to notice she talked to herself. Jamie thought nothing of it, she was just learning to talk and he figured she was just entertaining herself. 

One afternoon when Claire was out at the grocery store, Jaime overheard his daughter in the upstairs hallway, whispering and giggling. Curious, he asked, ""Sweetie, who are you talking to?"" Sarah replied, 

""The woman standing in the hallway"".

""Is she your imaginary friend?""

""I guess."" 

Amused, he went upstairs to find her staring blankly at a wall, whispering quietly. ""What's your friends name?"" he asked her. 

""Her name is Helen Mary"", she said. 

""And what are you two whispering about?"" 

Sarah looked at him and paused before she piped ""I'm not supposed to tell you."" 

Suddenly the front door opened downstairs, and they heard Claire come through the door. Sarah rushed down the stairs to greet her. Jaime didn't think about that again for a few weeks. 

Over time, the two noticed that Sarah's interactions with ""Helen Mary"" became more frequent, but they attributed this to the fact that they had just given her the news that she was going to be a big sister. 

About two weeks before Claire gave birth to Emily, Jaime was at home alone with Sarah. He heard her playing upstairs, chatting away with her imaginary friend, when suddenly he heard glass breaking. He ran upstairs as quickly as possible to find his daughter standing in the hallway, holding a hammer. She was staring up at the wall of family pictures that were now smashed to pieces. There was glass everywhere. Jaime picked his daughter up and carried her down the stairs. He told her to stay put as he returned to the upstairs hallway to clean up the shattered fragments of their family portraits. When he returned to the living room, he asked her directly, ""Sweetie, why would you smash all of our family pictures?"" 

She looked at him, ""Helen Mary told me to do it.""

When Claire returned home that evening from her girls night with friends, Jaime told her about the incident. The crept up the stairs so as not to wake their daughter, so Claire could view the damage with her own eyes. She gasped silently at the sight. 

When they returned downstairs to the kitchen, they started to discuss possible explanations for her behavior. Suddenly, the color ran out of Claire's face and she looked at Jaime. ""There's no way she could have done that alone.""

""What?""

""There is no way she could have smashed all of those pictures by herself.""

Jaime was confused, ""I told you, I caught her with the hammer. She told me that she did it.""

But it wasn't until his wife said it aloud that it dawned on him, ""But… some of those pictures are almost five feet off the ground. How could she have reached those?""

His mind was racing, ""She must have moved a chair or something.""

She was adamant, ""There are no chairs upstairs that she is strong enough to move without you hearing it, and you would have seen her carry one upstairs, right?""

Jaime was silent. He didn't have an answer. 

They went to bed that night without any answers. The following morning their daughter had little recollection of smashing the pictures and Jamie wrote it off as sleepwalking. Though he didn't have much time to think about it, as two weeks later his second little girl was born.

Emily was two years old in the summer of 2012, and one afternoon, when Claire was at home alone with the girls, she heard Emily alone upstairs, whispering. She called up to her, ""Who you talking to, kiddo?""

""The woman standing in the hallway.""

Claire thought that her Sarah must have told her about her imaginary friend, and that she was simply trying to emulate her big sister. Then she spoke again.

""She doesn't like you, Mommy""

""Why doesn't she like me?"" Claire responded, surprised. 

""I don't know."" 

Suddenly her daughter came bounding down the stairs as if nothing had happened. Even though both Jaime and Claire both found this slightly creepy, nothing about the situation ever felt threatening or malevolent. Until one night last month.

Jaime had put the kids to sleep around eight o'clock in the evening and he and Claire had got into bed soon after. Exhausted, Jaime and his wife fell asleep extremely quickly. Jaime was awoken by the sound of screaming. He was disoriented and had no idea what time it was, but he could tell that it was his wife screaming right next to him. He turned to see what was wrong and saw it. His 3 year old daughter Emily, standing beside the bed, with a hammer in her hand. Blood poured from Claire's forehead. Jamie jumped out of bed and grabbed the hammer out of his daughters hand. He turned to his wife. She had stopped screaming now, and Jaime grabbed a towel from the bathroom and wiped the blood away from her face. She was going to be alright, but she did have a deep cut to her forehead. 

Jaime picked up his daughter and carried her out of the room. He went and checked on Sarah, who had awoken to the screaming but was clearly unharmed. He told her that everything was alright and closed her door. He was standing alone with his daughter in the upstairs hallway, and he finally asked her, ""Emily, why would you hurt Mommy?""

""She told me to, Daddy.""

""Who told you to?"" 

""The woman standing right behind you. She told me to hurt Mommy"" And then Jaime felt a chill run up his spine when his daughter leaned into his ear and whispered, ""And she told me to hurt you too, Daddy.""

I just kept clicking through - that was my greatest vice. I could have let it rest. But with every story, my blood pumped faster, my breath came quicker.

There's nothing like a good scare. Every rush of adrenaline left me wanting more. That next fix got harder to find, took longer. I grew discerning, opinionated, a veteran of the genre. Soon I was writing for myself; days spent clacking the keys and nights spent in marathon research sessions. I was a crow picking through the maggots and gore for that next juicy nibble. I was a man consumed, and like a junkie messiah I wanted to share my high with others.

Everything has a basis in reality. Think about it. Why do the holy men think your soul needs saving? Why do children fear the dark? What's there in the unknown deep, what is it that averts our gaze?

That's why I'm here now. That's why I'm writing to you. I come bringing the ultimate high. All you have to do is believe. Believe in me, in the hellish nightmares that chase after you in your sleep, in the stories you read and the movies you watch. When you believe, the hunt is on.

My stomach is in knots, every heartbeat a hammer blow against my sternum. My hands are shaking. My breath comes in stecatto bursts. I can't hold on much longer. The anticipation is mounting, building to orgasmic frenzy. I found it, the ultimate high. Or rather, it found me. All I had to do was believe. All I have to do is turn around.

lamented_dreams,4,,9,1rgqu8,,13,"I love the dark. I really do.

I don't mean going gothic and pagan and all that, but I do like the dark. I like to sit in my room for hours on end into the night watching videos, researching diseases and the supernatural, and writing stories.

Anyways, I've recently come across a quote from a game called 'Knock Knock'. And let me say, it's utterly terrifying for not just the player, but the watcher too. There's nothing but this overwhelming sense of dread throughout all of the game.

""You thought about it, and now, it is inside."" —Knock Knock

That quote has seemed to have seeped into my brain. Multiple broken theories have been written down in my notebooks and journals and I've seemed to have come to a conclusion.

The mind isn't wrong. Reality is. And, with that, imagination often holds more truth than what we accept.

Think about it. When you were a small child, things like fairytales and horror stories were much more real to your innocent mind. In fact, there is a theory that children have a sixth sense that they gradually lose as they progress into adulthood. Also when you were a child, you thought of monsters and what they would do to you as well as how terrifying they looked.

And when you thought about these things, you didn't want to turn around. Why? Because what if for the slightest moment, you were right? All those lone yellow eyes in the darkness, the sinking feeling of being watched, out of all those times, what if this was the moment you were right? Or moreover what if you were always right and they just didn't want you to know... until now.

Because honestly, we used to think the Earth was flat. Then that it had the sun revolving around us. So what makes us so absolutely sure that we are the only ones out there now?

This is my theory.

I shared with one of my colleagues about two weeks ago and five days later she called me screaming about how there was something in her house. The police showed up and they took her to the hospital. She had three slash marks down her back, resembling that of almost a wolf. She also had multiple bruises on her neck. They said there was no signs of break in and the wrecking of the house was most likely the result of her having a psychotic episode.

This could be true, but I don't like how unsettlingly close it is to when I told her about my theory.

""You thought about it, and now, it is inside.""

This is the phrase that keeps me from imagining creatures. When I went to the hospital to visit her she was curled up in the bed, shaking with her knees up as close to her chest as possible. When I asked her what happened she wouldn't tell me who, only that 'it' got inside. She just had this empty look in her eyes, something very uncommon since she was always so hyper and nice. When I asked how she just said, ""I thought about it, and it came in.""

Keep in mind I never told her about the quote at all. Those were her own words. So this is more than unsettling for me. It may be possible that this 'theory' spooked her enough for all of this to happen, but I don't like the coincidences.

What do you think?",The Theory,22,nosleep
angelcot,3,,2,1rh91p,,11,"Hi /r/nosleep. This is kind of embarrassing to post, but here's a few stories of things that happened to me as a kid. I was a pretty anxious kid, and a lot of weird stuff happened to me. Nothing paranormal, though There's more than just these stories, but I thought I'd at least start with this.

Ever since I was a kid, I've been afraid of windows. That's not saying much, though. I was afraid of just about everything else, too. But growing up, my house was full of big windows. Floor-to-ceiling windows in the family room, two sliding glass doors in the dining room, a huge window that looked out from our kitchen into the front yard. My mom never bought curtains or blinds for any of the windows other than the ones in our bedrooms because she'd get depressed if it were too dark in our house. 

I had light blue curtains in my bedroom that my grandmother sewed for me since my windows were an irregular size. Every night I would pull them closed, then pin them down to the walls with a pushpin so that I wasn't able to see even a sliver of the outside out of the corner of my eye. My bedroom window looked out on the backyard. I remember being so irritated whenever someone would accidentally leave the back porch light on. The light would shine through my light blue curtains and play shadows on my wall. I'd cover my head with my pillow so that I could fall asleep without worrying if I would be able to make out the silhouette of someone trying to peer through my curtains, still pinned to the wall. 

From a young age, I had problems with insomnia. My mom struggled with it, too. I remember my dad telling me stories of when my parents were still married, when my mom would wake him up just to talk because she still wasn't asleep at 4, 5, 6 in the morning. I remembered feeling envious that I didn't have someone to do that to. I listened to books on tape at bedtime to fill the silence. Sometimes I would sneak into my brothers' room and lay on their floor, hoping for sleep to come. Being uncomfortably aware of how their curtains weren't drawn completely closed. 

When I was 10, I moved from my room- which overlooked the backyard- to my brothers' room, and my brothers separated and took over my room, and the office. My new room was at the front of the house. If my curtains were open, someone could easily look in as they walked up the path to our front door. During the day, I didn't mind it. I could watch for my friends or packages from the postman. At night, it made me so anxious I began to develop a habit of vomiting nightly. My mom was sympathetic, but didn't know what to do about it. A year later, I was moved back into my old room, and my older brother moved back into his. I stopped vomiting every night. 

I feel like I had a reason for being so afraid of windows. One night- I must have been about 6 or 7- I was up late, as usual, listening to *Ralph S. Mouse* on tape for the billionth time. I had emptied the glass of water that my mom had gotten for me, so I got up to refill it. I was already wary of windows, so I kept my head down on my way to the kitchen. I'd often see things out of the corner of my eye; something moving, or something that *could* have been the shadow of a human, but would later try to convince myself it was nothing.

Even with my head down, something outside caught my attention. A car, parked in front of my house. I lived at the very bottom of a cul-de-sac, so we didn't have a lot of people drive down our street at night and stop to reorient themselves. The car had its headlights on, and I could tell there was someone sitting in the car. Looking at my house. I don't know if they were looking at me, but my paranoia told me they were. I stood there for a long time, forgetting about my glass of water. I didn't look away. Paralyzed, until my mom came in the kitchen. She'd seen my door was open and wondered what I was doing up. When she noticed the car in front of our house, she quieted and gently pushed me out of the kitchen and back to my bedroom. I noticed the car started to drive away as I was ushered away from the window. 

This staring contest with the person in the car in front of my house happened twice more, although over the course of a few months. Once, they switched their headlights off, and stayed for what might have been 45 minutes. Although my memory might be exaggerating. I still don't understand why I was so afraid of seeing someone in my bedroom window, but how I could fearlessly stare out of the kitchen window at the person in the parked car. Maybe I felt less vulnerable in the kitchen. Maybe I was comforted by the fact that they were so far away. Even though the walk from where they parked was just a few seconds from my front door and the window I was looking out. 

The third and final time I saw the car, the person got out of their car. They were tall, and I could see them standing on the other side of their car but I still wasn't able to make out their face. When they started to walk around their car and- I assume- towards my front door, I scurried back to my bed. 

I never liked sleepovers as a kid. Staying over at a friends house meant laying awake on their floor for hours with nothing to listen to but the sound of their calm breathing. Nothing to look at except for the sliver of their window I could see from behind their curtains. Having friends at my house was just as stressful. Usually we'd sleep in the family room, because it had a TV in it. It also had the floor-to-ceiling windows. Usually I would sneak off to my own room after my friends had fallen asleep, so that I could sleep peacefully away from those big windows. 

When I was about 8 years old, I was having a sleepover with a few of my friends. It was after 10, so my friends were starting to fall asleep. I knew I still had *at least* two or three more hours of being wide awake. I was laying on the couch, swaddled in my blanket. The TV was still on, but I'd turned the volume down for my sleeping friends to something barely audible. Usually, I tried to keep my eyes away from the windows. But that night my cat caught my attention, meowing and hissing at something outside. I cautiously looked out the window, worried about what my cat might have seen out there. Just another cat, skittering in front of the window. Relieved, I looked out at my dark backyard. Was that it? 

There was a man in my backyard, walking around. Even with the distance, I distinctly remember he was frowning. He had his hands in his pockets. I did not know this man. 

I woke up one of my friends, whispering in her ear and telling her there was somebody in the backyard. She stirred quickly, obviously alarmed, and looked outside. She saw him too. I'm not sure if he felt our little eyes on him or what, but he turned to face us. Neither of us made a move; not to lay back down and pretend we were asleep, not even to look at each other, or look away. 

There were a pair of french doors that lead to the back patio in my family room, right in the middle of the wall of windows. The man walked up to the doors and tapped on one of the small window panes. The handle of what looked to be a heavy flashlight hung out of the pocket of his sweatshirt. He smiled at us. Not a deranged smile, not a smile that looked too wide for his face. Just a calm, warm smile. He mouthed something and pointed at the doorknob. I was never very good at reading lips. I stared straight ahead, unblinking, not responding. I could hear my friends' breath, heavy and shaking. 

He spoke, the sound of his voice muffled through the glass, ""Open the door."" A pause, he knit his eyebrows together like he was concerned. ""I'm visiting your parent. Let me in."" 

My heart was beating out of my chest. I was a paranoid enough little kid to not fall for this line. I mustered up every ounce of courage I had in my little, anxious, 8-year-old body, and got up off the couch. For a moment, they man at the door looked relieved. I ran out of the room, screaming for my mom. I could hear my friend call out at me that he was leaving, and the rest of my friends starting to stir. I told my mom what had happened. She turned on all the outside lights and called the police while my step-dad looked out every window for any signs of the man. All of the girls at my sleepover had their moms come over and pick them up. I cried, and stayed the night in my parents bed, although I'm pretty sure I didn't sleep.

In my mom's bathroom, there was a big window that looked out at the sideyard. The glass was distorted, though, so my mom never bothered putting a curtain over it. You couldn't see into the bathroom if you were just passing by the window. If you stopped to press your face against the glass, you could see in or out, but everyone in the house knew not to do that when they were in the sideyard. I remember my mom shrieking one night, running out of the bathroom, saying she'd seen something through the glass. A rat, climbing up the windowsill and staring into the bathroom.

I always liked my mom's shower more than the one in my bathroom. My bathroom didn't have a fan in it, so the whole bathroom would get uncomfortably humid. The shower curtain in my bathroom reminded me too much of that scene from *Psycho*, too, and I'd always shower with the shower curtain pulled open, and I'd get water all over the floor. My mom's shower had a glass door that I liked much more, even if there was that big window I could see clearly from the shower. 

Once when I was 12, I was showering in my mom's bathroom because my parents were out of town. My brothers were home, but were playing video games in the family room. I would keep my head down when I showered in my mom's bathroom. Even if the window's glass was hard to see through, it was still a window, and the shower was the most vulnerable place I could think of being looked at. Every once and a while, I would glance up to quell my growing anxiety. To tell myself *nothing was out there*. 

Cautiously, I looked up to satisfy my anxiety. *Nothing was out there*, I told myself. My gaze met the window. There was a dark figure pressed up against the glass. Through the foggy, wet shower door, I couldn't see anything. All I know was that it was *somebody*. I screamed, and ducked down past the tiles so that whoever was out there, they couldn't see me. A few moments later, I heard my brothers knocking at the door, both of them calling my name and asking if I was ok. I pulled a towel from outside the shower and wrapped myself up before I stood up. Whoever was out there was gone. 

A few weeks later, my friends and I were playing in the side yard. There was a huge tree out there that we liked to climb in, and pretend we were characters from X-Men or Sonic. My friend called my attention to something in the grass, over by the window of my mom's bathroom. A polaroid picture of the distorted glass of the window it lay in front of.  ",Windows.,13,nosleep
Spudz_OCD,6,,6,1rgcw5,,9,"Hey redditors, im new at this so excuse my writing skills

All through my life ive had things happen that i just couldn't explain, i've told a couple of friends but even they don't know what to say.

My story begins when i was a kid about the age of six or seven, we lived in a poor neighbourhood in southern Ireland and had a shithole of a house, i lived in a room with my two brothers (kyle[8-9  at the time], and Dylan[3-4]) and had been for a couple of years so i was used to sharing a room. The first incident occurred after about a year in the house (our street was built on a graveyard) and happenned in our room. it was an ordinary day before it happenned, woke up, ate breakfast, went to school, nothing out of the ordinary. however when i came home from school that day, there was something odd about the house, I couldn't quite tell what it was but it just felt wrong. But being a kid at the time, i thought nothing of it and carried on with my daily routine. after dinner and a shower my mom put us to bed. After my mom turned out the lights and left the room, i began to drift off to sleep. after about an hour and a half of hazy dreams, i was suddenly awoken by a loud crashing sound, kind of like if you dropped a frying pan, i quiclky jumped up my pillow and sat upright in bed. I looked over to Dylan's bed at the other side of the room, he ws still asleep. I began to question if i had actually heard it at all. feeling curious i checked if kyle was awake (we had a bunk-bed, Kyle was on top) as i was climbing the four step ladder, i felt a burst of cold air rush from kyles bed and immediately dropped to the ground, waking up Kyle.
""what are you doing"", he said.
""i heard a noise so i wanted to see if--""
""--sshh"", he stopped me mid sentance, and focused his gaze to the back of the room; The look on his face will be forever imprinted into my mind. I turned around gingerly and what i saw was scary enough to make me cringe even today. I saw a scrawny black figure hunched over Dylan, who was still asleep. But this figure was definately not human; It was at least 7 feet tall, it's head was overpoweringly large compared to it's beyond anorexic body. It's fingers were 6-7 inches long minimum. From what i saw it wore nothing, but it very well could have, as it was late at night and i was still half asleep. Then the image that will haunt me forever; It, whatever it was, turned towards me and Kyle. It just stood there, staring at us for what felt like forever, it then jumped towards us and simply vanished into thin air right before it hit me. I was left lying on the floor and Kyle was wondering if what we had just seen was actually real. I looked at him and back to Dylan's bed, whatever it as, when it jumped it jumped with enough force to push the blanket off the end of Dylan's bed. I looked back towards Kyle, who was already asleep again, and decided to go back to sleep myself, not knowing if what we'd seen that night was just a figment of our imagination or not.
When i woke up the following morning i hesitantly asked my mom and sister if they'd seen or heard anything last night..they didn't. So i questioned kyle about it and he said that he had no idea what i was on about, he had no memory of seeing or hearing anything, he didnt even remember me falling off the bunk ladder.
To this day i still cant quite figure out what happened that night.

My second experience was only four or five years ago, a couple of months after moving to Australia. We were living in a pretty old house at the time so it was a bit creaky and what not. it was a pretty average day when it happenned;I was 14 and I was once again in bed at the time. I was sharing a room with Dylan (10) at the time. Kyle (16) was in a room across the hallway, Jenny (12) was the next door down and my parent's room was at the end of the hallway. It was about 11-12 at night, and we were all just about asleep. My mom and step-father at the time were out exploring the wild clubs of Surfers Paradise, so it ws just us kids. I was almost asleep when i heard slight footsteps coming from the kithcen area. I wondered who it was considering we were all in bed, so i opened the door to check. I headed towards the kitchen, once i reached the living room (about half-way to kitchen from my room) i could see into the kitchen, i slowly emerged from the wall; no one there..weird, i thought, so i headed back to my room, but as soon as i turned around Kyle was standing right in front of me with a knife. I jumped quicker than i'd ever jumped before. Kyle then laughed his head off and went back to bed. I did the same without the laughing.. I was back in my room, now lying in bed realising im too awake to go back to sleep. i just lay there for about five minutes staring at the ceiling untill i heard more footsteps in the kitchen. I called out
""Kyle, go to bed, idiot""
""i am you fuckwit"", he said as he emerged from his room half asleep
""well then who's upstairs?"" i asked
""It's probably just a possum in the attic or something don't worry""
I regretfully closed the door and went back to bed. But as soon as i did, loud heavy footsteps started making their way down the hallway, along with heavy thumping on the walls, they were getting closer and a hell of a lot louder, It sounded like someone was trying to stomp and bash rats out of the walls and floor. It kept coming closer and increasing in volume until it was at the point where it was like gunshots right outside my room. It then stomped right outside my door and my door swung open with extreme noise and force and standing at the door was, i shit you not, the same tall, black scrawny fucked up figure that i saw years ago. I practically shat myself. It stood there for a couple of seconds, but if felts like hours, then started stomping and sprinted towards my moms room. I don't know why but i instantly got up and ran towards the door and looked towards my moms room; nothing there, it vanished again. I dropped to the ground in shock, just as Kyle open his door and screamed ""WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT"" 
""It's back"" ,i said
""What's back?""
""the thing i saw hunched over Dylan""
I stayed up all night that night not wanting to sleep knowing that thing followed us to Australia

My most recent encounter with our old friend was last year. We'd moved into an old complex of houses that had a bit of a history in the crime side of things. We'd been living there for about 6 months and my friend from primary school, Jordan, was now living in the complex too. It was around 5PM and it was just Jordan Kyle and I in the house. I was playing my i-pod at the time, Kyle was in the kitchen and Jordan was behind me. Kyle decided to pick up a coin and throw it at an unsuspecting Jordan, who surprisingly, caught it, and returned fire. but then Jordan moved a little backwards and Kyle threw it further and harder. The coin flew through the air right past my head and stopped rigth in front of Jordans face, IT LITERALLY STOPPED IN MID AIR, it stood still in front of his face for less than a second and then was propelled back towards Kyle with nearly twice the force. We all just stood there speechless, not knowing if that had really just happened. Later that day we were showing a friend what had happened  and were back in the Kitchen messing around with coins to see if it would happen again. When suddenly a ball flew through the air at Kyle, like it had been thrown with force from the stairs leading upstairs. For the second time that day we were utterly speechless and had no idea what to do.
That night after Jordan had left and Kyle went to bed, i was making a late night snack. Dylan was in the living room watching TV and there was nobody else in the house. I finished making the snack and was about to head into the living room when in the corner of my eye, I saw the figure that i had seen twice before glide upstairs; same height, same scrawniness, same long fingers only this time it was a little misty, like a shadow, and it looked right into my eyes as it vanished upstairs.
I am still wondering what the actual fuck that figure is, all i know is that my mother has become a claire-voyant.I know for a fact that there is definately going to be a lot more of this thing which i have nicknamed ""the figure"".

For the time being i will keep an eye out for my little follower and if i see him/her again i will not hesitate to report the time, date, and details of the situation and of course reddit the fuck out of it.
for now redditors, i bid you farewell

the_dark_half,5,,1,1rhyj5,,7,"You know that feeling when you’re all alone and hear your name whispered? Maybe you’ve walked into a room only to suddenly feel a sudden temperature drop? Had things go missing only to re-appear in odd places? Maybe you’re like me and you lie in bed at night, only to feel like someone stroking your hair but when you become fully conscious and turn around, nothing. 
Think you walk through a cobweb or hair falls on your arms or neck and brushes against your skin delicately, tickling you? You check and nothing was there? I’m sure your parents tell you it’s nothing from a young age; perhaps because they themselves are deluded enough to believe that it is their imagination. They probably deep down fear it’s a ghost or apparition. Even they couldn’t know how much worse it really is.  Stop deluding yourself. It’s not a cobweb. It’s not the wind. It’s not nothing. It’s something far more sinister, an insidious force which slowly grows stronger the more you feed it your fear and attention. 

Some of you, I’m sure, will be fortunate enough only to feel cold spots and occasionally hear creaks and footsteps in your house. It’s such a common occurrence that people barely notice it and if they do, it’s the spookiest part of a generic horror movie, because those suits in Hollywood haven’t seen what these creatures are really capable of. If you believe in the paranormal you may experience the whispers of what I can only loosely refer to as their ‘voices’. I’m sure not many of you have had the misfortune to awaken to them standing over your bed, taking the forms of whatever creatures or person your subconscious fears most because it’s real form is so terrifying you’d probably die instantly or become paralysed with fear, a zombie-esque state you’ll never awaken from-and that would ruin their fun too early. If you don’t die instantly, seeing their faces will make your eyes bleed; hearing their voices unrestrained will shatter your ear drums and I’ve heard of cases where insides have been liquefied, skin melting and bleeding seeping out of every pore.

The first time I awoke to one in my room with me, it was after I’d given the footsteps and banging on the walls attention. I had thought it was cool, I even bought a stupid Ouija board and told them it was okay for them to try and talk to me. I had been lying in bed after a night of drinking so I passed off the initial taunts and laughs as nothing more than my intoxicated imagination, until my door slowly opened and in came one large hairy leg, followed by more spindly legs, followed by many eyes and two huge fucking fangs. Yep, a giant spider, bigger than a horse came into my room. I tried to scream, but that just resulted with me hyperventilating, then vomiting all over the floor. It strode in, all beady eyes on me and as it slinked atop my bed I tried to pathetically crawl away, but it held me down with its two front legs, piercing into the flesh of my shoulders as I whimpered like a small animal about to be devoured-which I was.  I felt the sharp pain of its fangs tear through my skin and inject me with poison that made my blood burn. I lay in bed, delirious, desperate, muttering for help. My ears were greeted with a cacophony of voices, screaming horrible things that were so foul that before that night had been unimaginable to me. I passed out shortly after, from fear, blood loss or the venom and awoke a few days later, believing to have all been a dream. I clung to that hope until I stepped outside my bedroom door and found dozens of small animals, birds mostly, wrapped up in what appeared to be spider’s webs, discoloured, drained of their blood and insides. All dead. I ran to the bathroom to throw up and caught sight of myself, dried blood caked on my body and face, puncture wounds all over me and strands of silky web still wrapped around my breasts, my stomach, my legs and in my hair. 

The second night I encountered one of them, they took the form of my uncle. I lived with my uncle for nearly 5 years while my father was travelling almost every week for business. I know my father loved me and desperately needed the money that he had to work from dawn until way after the sun set and had to leave me for long periods. He didn’t know what his brother did to me. That night as I became increasingly aware of the noises in my apartment and the feelings of someone touching me and whispering in my ear, I rolled over to see my uncle grinning at me. He crawled onto the bed and tied me down. I struggled, but when I did he beat me with his belt, like he had started doing when I was eight years old. I fought as hard as I could, tears burning my eyes and sobbing uncontrollably, but he kept cutting away at my clothes with a pocket knife and telling me to be a good girl. The torture that night lasted for many hours, possibly days. I try not to remember it. I thought I had moved on from those childhood years and buried them a few years ago, when my uncle died. This was not the last time the monsters took on forms like this to break me. They’ve only grown stronger with every drop of blood, with every scream and with every hopeless sob I’ve given them.

Their true form will only appear to you in dreams at first because they get to torment you in ways that won’t instantaneously butcher you or drive you insane, yet; they like to take their time with their toys. The dreams for me started after those incidents. I have seen what those beings really look like and…just thinking about it is enough for me to start violently shaking, unable to stop retching. The other day I wasn’t careful and thought about one of them and a stranger had to hold me back as I unconsciously started walking in front of a train. In my dreams, it is pure hell as they have my undivided attention for hours and can do whatever they want to me without my body breaking and bending the way it would in the waking world, but it all feels real. 
Part of me stares at length of rope on my coffee table and considers leaving this torment…but what if when I die, I get sent to their realm, to be their plaything forever? 

It’s not just the occasional brush against my skin, the odd floor creak and the rare moment of ‘is someone calling my name?’ Now I feel them on me at all times, their rough, sharp skin cutting mine, scratching me, violating every single part of my body. Their voices scream and howl at me, maniacally taunting and laughing at my never-ending misery. Even when I shut my eyes, I still see them, their hideous beings beyond any words the human language has to describe them to you. 

Most of you think of those household noises and strange occurrences as the work of ghosts, of spirits. Yes, it is so comforting for humans to believe these presences are the souls of dead people who are just sad and wandering, isn’t it? You want to be able to talk to someone no longer alive; you open your mind and let them in. Don’t. What’s out there isn’t human, it isn’t some person with unfinished business, what’s out there wants you to think that, to get comfortable with inviting it in and letting yourself become aware of it. 

Did you just hear that faint noise outside your window, like a soft breeze carrying a faint whisper? That creak outside your room? That faint sensation on your flesh? I hope not, because now you know what’s really there and they’ve always known about you.",Don't give them attention.,8,nosleep
Rhapsodeyus,1,,0,1rgtyq,,8,"Some may recall a story I posted a few months back, about shadow-like figures who visited me on a mission for knowledge, and afterwards, disappeared like ghosts. For those who do not recall, the story is [Curious Visitors](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l4dv2/curious_visitors/).

If you have not read that, well, you probably haven't missed much, but it will help with the backstory for this one if you do read it.

Done reading? Good, let's continue.

This happened last night, Sunday, November 24th, 2013. I woke up at precisely 4:27 AM, and I know this because I watched my small digital alarm clock on my bedside table flip to 4:27 AM as my eyes opened. I also noticed that my lamp was off (I sleep with the light on for safety reasons, since living with cats can be hazardous). However, I could see my plain, black clock in a pale blueish light.

My brain clicked. ""My laptop is on. I must have left it on and the power went out, so it's running on battery."" Then I remembered, quite clearly, turning it off and closing it before going to bed. That's when I felt a weight at the end of my bed, sitting in front of my laptop.

I sat up, looked, and spotted a shadowy figure sitting in front of my laptop. The NoSleep submission form was up. I coughed, and said quietly, ""You could have asked."" Instead of, say, a sudden spin and a glare from Brarger, as I expected, my visitor vanished instantly.

I didn't expect that, and it startled me thoroughly. My previous visitors would never have been so rude, and certainly would have asked my permission to access my personal computer. I shifted, tossed the covers aside, and moved to the end of the bed, to read what it had written.

I now wish I hadn't.

The message ends there. I suppose I interrupted the agent and he fled.

Whether this is genuine or not, I cannot know. If it is a fake by a rogue agent, then its purpose is unclear, but it is certainly unsettling. If this is a prank, then it's impressively elaborate, yet in poor taste.

JUVIE_MAKER,2,,1,1rhq9j,,8,"I have a nose for things. No seriously, all my life I’ve had a very strong sense of smell and I don’t mean for the average person. I have an abnormally, freakishly, ridiculously, absurd sense of smell. It’s been that way since I was a kid. Here’s a prime example, when I was about four or five I used to visit my grandmother (god rest her soul) every month in Daytona Beach for the summer. My grandmother was notorious for making the best homemade cakes in the neighborhood. I would always leave my Gran’s house at least ten pounds heavier each summer after gorging myself on her delicious treats. One Saturday, after a day of playing outside (when kids used to play outside!) I instantly smelled the aroma of cake wafting through the air, but something was…..off. There was another smell lingering behind the cake scent. It was kinda tangy, bitter, sorta nutty …just all around unpleasant. Being so young, I couldn’t quite put my finger on what the smell was but I knew I didn’t like it. Then out comes my Gran from the kitchen with a big slice of her freshly made cake on a china plate. She passes the dining room table and spots me standing there with my nose crinkled up in disgust.

Gran:  What’s the matter baby? Come sit at the table and have a slice of cake.

Five year old me: I aint eating that cake, it smells funny!

(Let me just interject for a second.  Now if your family is old school like mine, you know that a child is to NEVER disrespect an elder’s cooking! Especially if that elder is a family member, you just don’t do it! That is unless you want a black eye, ribs broken, missing teeth… you get the picture.)

Gran: Girl, get your hind parts over here and eat this cake before I slap the hell out of you!!

Oh geez…there’s that tone. You know it, you know it well. That angry deep tone that resonates from parents when their truly pissed off. You know… that voice that scares the living shit out of you and gives you’re delicate child-like mind nightmares for a month (or your whole life). Yeah that’s what I was hearing right about then. But still I was adamant. I would not eat that damn cake. That smell! It was just too potent. Now, you might be thinking, what’s the big deal? Surely you’ve smelled worse things than that cake before, which is very true. At that point in my life I’d smelled worse things before (WAY WORSE) but I’d never been subjected to eat those things either. Also, the stench of that pastry….it was just… so very not right. I was only a child but I was still old enough to know right from wrong, and that cake was definitely wrong! Even at that very moment I could taste its bitterness in the back of my mouth. With every inhale it burned and tingled down my throat.

Gran: Come over here and take this plate now!

Okay at this point I knew I was in REAL trouble. Even if my grandmother didn’t kill me, I was pretty sure I was in for the ass whooping of my life! I slowly started to back away from Gran as she moved closer to me with that dreaded cake. Even as she inched towards me that smell seem too magnify. With every step she took it grew more and more intense! “Girl, you better take this cake!” she yelled holding the plate out in front of her. I turned to run but she quickly snatched up my arm before I could get away. “No!” I shouted feverishly trying to pull away from her grip, “I don’t want the cake, granny!!” but my pleas of desperation came to no avail. My grandmother started to tug me towards the kitchen table, her fingers angrily wrapped around my tiny forearm. Suddenly, she yanked me forward making my body jump about two feet in her direction, tilting my face towards hers. She looked down at me with an awful glare. Dark hollow eyes glowered down from Gran’s wrinkled sockets. Her once loving face was now rigid and stiff with a sadistic expression that I had by no means seen before. “You will eat this cake!” She shouted through gritted teeth. “Even if I have to shove it down your throat piece by piece!” 

I had never seen this side to my Gran before. My once sweet, devoted granny had turned into this vicious monster plucked straight out of my worst nightmares. My small frame quaked in fear and tears began to seep from my eyes. I had never known terror like this. My insides loosened and squirmed like jelly making the contents of my bladder empty and leak down my legs. To say I was afraid would be the understatement of the freakin decade! But you know what? There was something else I was more fearful of. Even as I pissed myself in sheer horror from the presence of my devil-like grandmother, there was still something more bloodcurdling, more utterly terrifying than her…that fucking cake! 

“NO!!!!!!!” echoed from my lips in a banshee scream and with all the strength I possessed I juggernauted into my grandmother. My body throttled into her torso head first making a loud solid grunt bellow from the old woman. Her arms flew in the air (letting me go in the same instance) and her vast body collapsed backwards before suddenly….CRACK!
The sound of my grandmother’s head crashing along the rim of her kitchen table splintered throughout the house. Gran thudded to the ground like a sack of potatoes and the plate with the cake she so firmly held onto shattered on the floor. I stared at her lifeless body as blood began to seep through her head and flow on the linoleum. I was still too little to know the true meaning of life and death but I did know for sure that red liquid was not suppose to be running out of her head like that. I bent down and looked into Gran’s half opened eyes. They weren’t black any more. They’d gone back to their normal brown again. Not really knowing what to do I just stared down at the gruesomeness of it all, watching the chunks of yellow cake absorb the blood until each piece was just as red. 

To make a long story short the police were eventually called. My Gran’s weekly bridge game was on that day and a couple of her elder counterparts found her body, and me sitting in a pool of piss and blood staring at it. Needless to say there were lots of screams. Oh, and you’re probably wondering what that smell was, right? I actually didn’t find out until I was well into my teens what exactly it was. I was pouring it into my foster parent’s coffee one morning when it finally hit me…Cyanide. From the smell of it, Gran probably couldn’t have used too much either. Maybe half a teaspoon, give or take; totally undetectable to the average person’s nose…but not to mine. “So that’s what that was, go figure”.  I remember thinking that to myself as I stirred the cyanide into two mugs. My foster parents passed away later on that day, I wish I could say I feel sadness over it but I really don’t.  I was more consumed with thoughts on why my grandmother was trying to kill me? Was it because of what I’d done to Oscar, her cute little Maltese? I mean, if I’d known the oven wasn’t a suitable place to put a dog I might have done things differently. I was only two at the time. Or perhaps it had something to do with what happened with Mommy…that really was unfortunate. I didn’t want to hurt her, but she was an obstacle that just had to be removed. 

But anyways, that’s neither here nor there. I’m an adult now and those days are long behind me. I’m actually on my way to my boyfriend’s…excuse me….ex-boyfriend’s apartment right now. I’m visiting him and that slut he cheated on me with. And guess what? They just had a baby, isn’t that the sweetest thing.  ",A nose for things...,9,nosleep
1234FUCK,7,,4,1rhjmk,,6,"So my uncle has always been into the paranormal and he got me into paranormal investigation, Or ghost hunting to simplify it a few years back. Well I go with him on a lot of them and we do it for free for people who think something paranormal is going on in their houses. I always saw it as a nice little hobby to do on the weekends to blow of some time and I always liked being scared. I mean that’s how I even know about this sub-reddit because I like reading it. And that’s one of the only reasons I knew about what had happened on my last investigation. 


	We got a call from a family out in the middle of the country saying they had begun hearing weird voices when they were each alone but the 16 year old son was the one who had it happen the most. I went through every scenario I could think on the way there, Something was legitimately going on that was paranormal, one of the kids was lying and was fucking with the rest of the family and other such things. Well when we got there we talked with the family and everyone seemed happy except the two children. The son was as I said earlier 16 and the girl was 14, they seemed uneasy looking off into corners and such. I took a note about it but didn’t dwell on it that much. We went around the house marking places we would put cameras and getting the lay out of the house. Once we finished that we went back to our van and started getting ready. After we set up all of our equipment we each got our POV (Point of view) cameras strapped on and started our investigation. My Uncle took the upstairs, our colleague took the first floor, And I went into the basement to do a little investigating of my own. 


I made my way downstairs and grabbed my Walky-talky and radioed my uncle asking if everyone was ready for me to hit the main light breaker. He gave me the go ahead and I flipped the little switch plunging the whole house into darkness I held up the other camera I had with me so I could have a camera move around freely ( plus it had a night vision setting so I could see where I was going.) Well I turned it on and walked slowly to the chair I had placed in the room so I could sit comfortably waiting for something to happen. And after an hour or so of me questioning the darkness.. It answered back.
My instincts kicked in and I put a call in on the radio for everyone to tell me where they were. And everyone was exactly where they said they were supposed to be. My heart froze in my throat from fear but excitement so I stood and asked who I was talking to and I heard a small wispy chuckle before it said softly “You know who I am.” I swallowed hard before continuing to walk around the room and asking questions. It stayed silent for a few questions before I asked why it was here. It chuckled again before I heard a small sound. Like a door knob jiggling and I turned towards it. My camera landed on a door knob sticking out from a sheet that I guess had covered it before. I walked towards it slowly pulling the sheet off to reveal a shabby door about waist height with peeling paint and scratch marks.  I put in a call on the radio telling my uncle and the others I had found something and for them to meet me in the basement. I got no answer back but I assumed they had gotten the message. My uncle did that a lot; he tended to get over excited with these things so I figured he was just trying to get here as fast as possible.  But the paranormal curiosity ran in the family so I reached down and grabbed the knob, it was warm as if someone had been holding it for a longtime. I steadied myself before twisting it and pushing it open. 


I looked through my camera screen as I walked into the door. The atmosphere around me seemed to change instantly, even though all the lights in the house was off it just seemed to be darker and colder in here the basement itself.  I looked around in the room through the screen until I saw a lone chair in the center of the room. I walked forward until I was right next to it and then began looking around more. I jumped a bit at the bright light on my screen until I noticed it was a mirror. It was bolted onto a beam  next to the chair and when I looked to the left I noticed the same thing. I thought it was really strange so I walked around the front of the chair and accidentally kicked something over.  It was loud and then I heard a sound of rushing water. My heart leapt into my throat as I looked down and around looking for the source until my camera came upon a metal bucket slightly rolling with water coming out. I also saw a candle and a small match book and that’s when it hit me. My whole body filled with fear as the realization flooded my head…. This was a “three kings” set up.


 I turned towards the door pointing the camera as I looked through it I saw the door slam and I stopped. My whole body froze from pure terror and it took me a few seconds before I let out a scream for help. After I stopped I heard the soft chuckle come from behind me in the darkness and I just stood there with my eyes closed shaking as I felt a soft breath on the back of my neck I heard a voice.. My voice whisper right into my ear. “ Do you know who I am now?” I stood there for a second before screaming again and then I heard the door bust open and I saw flash lights on me and my uncle asking what was wrong. I just ran from the room to the breaker box and flipped on all the lights. I then sank to the floor looking at him as he sat next to me and asked all that happened. I just held out my camera to him and he took it. Before he watched it he asked me why I didn’t call for back up and I looked at him before telling him that I did. He looked at our colleague before watching the recording.


 After that he asked me if we all went in together would I go back in. I nodded as long as we kept the lights on and we went in. and it was as I thought. It was a set up for “ The three kings.” I shuddered as I turned to my uncle asking if he knew what it was. He didn’t so I explained it to him and I pointed to the bucket “ and it has been used recently. The bucket was full of water. “ My uncle nodded to me and put a wrap on the investigation. We went back home and I have decided to type this up. Tomorrow we will be going and talking to the family about what happened and who had done the three kings in the house.  


I think the three kings set up has something to do with what has been happening at the house. I will update you all on what happens after we talk to them.

OsamaBinHiding,3,,1,1rhxdo,,6,"Last night was like every other night for me. Have dinner on my own in my small, yet cost flat and watch a little bit of TV. Around 9 or 10 o'clock, I start to crack on with some work as I had a university deadline in a couple days time. The minutes started going faster and before I knew it it was 12 o""clock. 

""Where did the time go?"" I thought. It had only felt like a few minutes. However, this was a normal occurrence for me. The world kind of, disappears when I get lost in a train of thought and for the life of me, I can't break out of it.

I had just remembered that I had a seminar early in the morning and suddenly thought ""Fuck, I better try and get some sleep"" 

See, I live in an old building that has been converted into flats in the suburbs of a major city. So it isn't uncommon to hear floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and all the walls are very thin so noises in the middle of the night just tend to go over my head. I wouldn't consider myself someone who doesn't get scared easily but when you're familiar with floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and branches tapping your window - you tend to grow some thick skin.

Last night wasn't like any other night in my flat though. 

As I mentioned earlier, I was alone. My flatmate - let's call him, Evan for the sake of the story, was away celebrating thanksgiving with his family but he's away a lot so I'm used to spending a long period of time on my own. My usual night routine of showering, brushing my teeth and cleaning the kitchen was over and I went into my room to finally rest my head for the night and that was when I first noticed something. My drawers were all pulled open. 

To most people, this is probably nothing - but for me it wasn't normal. I suffer from borderline OCD and everything, especially in my room needs to be in order and I remember waking up and everything was in order. I hadn't left my flat today either. 

""I'm too tired for this shit"" I thought and went to bed. 

It's weird though isn't it? That something like a mattress and a duvet can make you feel so safe, like nothing can hurt you. I remember being a child and I made sure none of my limbs were outside of my bed incase something grabbed me in the middle of the night. Such a feeble piece of furniture can make you feel so safe.

Well, not anymore for me. Last night I heard the usual creaking of the floorboards - no biggy, right? However, as I drew closer to conscientious, I realised that these creaking sounds weren't coming from the surrounding walls and neighbouring flats but they were coming from under my bed.

And that's when I felt the unmistakable sensation of a cold, coarse finger stroking mine over the side of my bed.

TaylorBonaseraSr,0,,2,1rhb2e,,5,"I can explain why I'm so afraid of mirrors, or anything that could reflect light, even a glass door. It's so difficult for me to talk about it sometimes, but other times I feel her pressing me on to tell as many people about her as possible. She broke my mirror the first time, just crashed right through the glass and shattered the glass into a literal hundred pieces. It was such a pain to have to clean all that up. I got at least five cuts. But she didn't care. At the very least she didn't laugh at me or yell at me to clean faster. At least she was nice enough to check herself for that. Anyway, I got my mirror replaced. She didn't break the bathroom mirror again, but she broke the great mirror in the hallway while she was running through it. I don't understand how she did it, it's pressed up right against the wall. She'd have to ram her body sideways. She didn't even have any visible cuts. She told me she was sorry, and that she would try not to do it again. I believed her, and she was true to her word. But soon enough, I hear the crashing again. But this time it's my door. The majority of my glass door has been smashed through, but the weird thing is that the hole is shaped like Quasimodo. No one lives here that has a body shaped like that. The other times I checked her she didn't have any cuts on her, but this time she was bleeding so much from every part of her body that she had to go to the hospital. I had to sit there and watch her, but she couldn't explain what had happened. When the doctor asked, neither could I, because I hadn't been there. It's strange how selective she is; she won't smash into anything except mirrors or glass-looking things. Anywhere there isn't this kind of stuff, nothing bad happens. She tells me that she feels so cold whenever she walks by something like that, and she gets an uncontrollable urge to destroy it. She talks to me about it so often I feel like I'm beginning to share the feeling.

It's starting to unnerve me, and I don't want to live with her anymore. But I can't break the joint liability contract. She told me to cover all the things in the house that could possibly create a reflection, so I did. But I find her desperately tearing off the covers when she thinks I'm not looking.

One day I'd had enough so I decided to take off one of the covers in my room. It couldn't hurt, just for a little while when she couldn't see. She wouldn't notice. But after a minute of reveling in my refreshed reflection, I saw her standing there. So close. She was so ugly. She copied my expression and mocked my horrified face. She followed me here, to my own room. I couldn't turn around. There was no point. I felt a pressure from her on my shoulders so great I couldn't keep a straight posture. She was laughing at me.

But I'd heard that laugh somewhere before. And I'd seen that face before too. It looked so much like my own. She must have heard my thoughts, because she said she told me to never look at her by means of a reflection. I couldn't stand the sight of her face anymore, it was so scary. It'd been such a long time since I'd spent so many minutes just staring at her. I had to take control. So I bashed the bedroom mirror in, balling my bare hands into fists and repeatedly thrashing until I could feel the glass cutting into my skin.

It'd been so long since I'd last done that. Now every time I look, I can see her, feel her, I see her staring at her...our...reflection, through my eyes.",My Blank Mirror,7,nosleep
SeaDweller7,2,,2,1rhilw,,4,"I go to a regular school, its kindergarten to year twelve, so its pretty big. But, my school is an old public school, and the principle is ancient. Me? I am in year twelve, and I’m graduating next year, and my friends said I should share this story with you guys. 

Ok, where to start? Well, at my school we have a pretty serious problem with bullies, and when I say serious I mean it. One year our school was even on the news, but it was pretty traumatic. When I was in year nine, there was this little girl in fifth grade, called Melody. Her and me sort of talked sometimes, as she was a new girl and I was her school buddy (to show her around and stuff) She was a sort of short, curly brown haired, blue eyed and geeky girl. Glasses and all of that stuff, so your stereotypical nerd. Which pretty much was what she was.

After I moved up in to Tenth grade it was pretty clear that she was being bullied. Instead of gossiping or playing with the other girls, she just sort of walked around the school... bouncing a tennis ball and wandering around the grounds of the school. 

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

Then, half way through the year, school was stopped. During lunch they lined us up and called our parents. Sent us home. They just said there was an accident. My mother and father lived in Melbourne and I lived with my uncle and aunty, and they’re pretty laid back and all ‘come home when you feel’ so I stayed at school.

I saw five year six girls with that sort of ‘we know nothing it wasn’t us we didn’t do anything’ look on their face before I saw an ambulance and a white body bag. Out of the end of the body bag stuck out locks of curly brown hair, and the always-screeching birds seemed to sing a sweet tune. A melody.

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

Last week we had a substitute teacher who started screaming at a girl who was outside bouncing her ball after the end of lunch bell had rung. She didn’t realise Melody wouldn’t listen. 

No one knew why the back stairs from German were out of bounds for two months, and why the German teacher quit. No one asked why those five girls we’re stared at my Melody’s sort of... ghost.

I pieced it together. A simple push, a simple tumble. A simple death.

No one cares, all the kids just skip past her, all the laughter swallows up her silence. 

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

It has been a little over a year since I last wrote - just over a year since the last nightmare.  I was foolish to think I was somehow cured, that, as Dr. Lough suggested, getting it out of my head and into a journal would help.

I read back over my last and only journal entry, as I tried to describe the nightmare.  It is so chaotic and scattered, yet I'm unable to find any other way to convey the details.  That is the terror of the dream at its core - utterly chaotic.  Jerking from one sensation to the next, the hesitant probing of my fingers as they cover the smooth flesh where my eyes should be, to the damp defeat in realizing those fingers have torn away the protective lids in confusion.  All of this, in layers of sleep - waking to the comfort of my mother's figure, only to then know it is just another stage of the dream playing out, with her eerie voice echoing through my body:

""You're connected now.""

Even now, in understanding that my last entry seemed to bleed out through the pages, I'm struggling to form coherent thoughts onto this paper.  Each detail seems to tie into the next, only to fall apart when I try to see the whole.  I wonder what type of clinical association Dr. Lough could make?  Is this what schizophrenia feels like?  I have no way to explain it.  It is as though there is a novelist's grand plot line swirling around my body in paper shreds and each time I reach out I can snatch only a sliver of a scene, unable to ever piece the parts into an understanding.  I'm fairly certain this entry, and perhaps any subsequent entries, will be just as erratic.  I just cannot force these thoughts together.

So much has changed in the last year, it is so hard to recall my state of mind the last time the nightmare came to me.  I have a son now, nearly 6 months old.  We must have just found out Rachel was pregnant around the time I last wrote.  Could that have been a factor in the nightmare returning after years of peace?  Was my mind so overwhelmed with the thought of being a father, the changes to my life, the responsibility, it somehow dredged that old horror back from my subconscious?  I can't help but think it must have played a role.  It has been a blur, so many other things seem to have fallen into place.  Though they are exciting, it seems predetermined, somehow rushed.

Over the last decade I have had a slight obsession with the home I grew up in.  I knew I would live there once again - returning it to ownership in my family - though I never anticipated it would happen so quickly.  Rachel's grandmother died, leaving her an inheritance that allowed us to leap forward several years in our plans together.  It was Christmas Day, the day she died - I guess her last gift to us.  Three months after my son was born, we were moving back into the mountains, back to the walls I had called home as a boy.  

One thing I feel for certain, this home is the source.  The nightmare started here, always took place here, was always fueled here.  I'm beginning to remember things, or have recurrent thoughts I have not had for nearly two decades.  It is as though these things are unlocked from muscle memory as I walk this house.

As a child I would reach the top of the second floor staircase, which opened onto a hallway, always with my head down staring at my feet.  Left, at the end of a long hallway was a guest room.  Large floor to ceiling windows would reflect back a warped view of the person looking down to them.  Right, across a short landing was my bedroom.  I had trained myself to never look left at night - as the small nightlight by my bedroom door would throw twisted shadows onto my reflection in the long guest room windows.  If I would look up, I would become stuck in fear with the reflection.  The windows seemed to pulse with my heartbeat, flexing my body larger then smaller in the glass.  My feet became rooted in place, the black of the windows and the emptiness behind them tunneling out for me.  The nightlight would flicker in then out, each time causing my shape to jump forward, as though I were being pulled down the hallway towards the darkness.  I never remembered breaking loose, turning and walking back to my bedroom and going to sleep.  I would wake up in my bed hours later, staring at my hands, inspecting for blood and knowing I just had the nightmare. 

I learned, I kept my head down and did not look to the left.

Our first night in the home, that muscle memory followed suit.  After turning off the main floor lights, I climbed the staircase.  My son was sleeping against my chest, his arms wrapped around my neck and shoulder.  My head was down as I crested the top step, turning to the right, towards my room which was now his.  As I neared the bedroom door, his forehead left my shoulder.  His back straightened and his arm peeled away from my neck.  I felt his arm extend straight back behind my head.  I didn't need to look at his eyes, I knew.  Those eyes followed his arm to his hand, reaching down the hallway to the windows.  The nightlight flickered as he let out a giggle.  I took the last step into his bedroom and shut the door.

Sunny day in Nevada. Families having lunch outside, fathers teaching their sons how to grill steak, playgrounds
filled with kids. Every year I plan a trip with my son. Nevada has really nice caves in it. When I was little,
my father always took me there and so did his father. I didn't want to break this chain. I told Jake, my son, about that
cave that I used to visit but I did not have enough time to take him there until now. He was still sleeping when
I stepped in his room.
""Honey wake up!"" Jake opened his little eyes and whispered:
""What?""

""We are going to see the cave I told you about!"" he instantly jumped out of his bed and become so excited that
I can't even tell about it. He got dressed and ran to have something to eat. About five minutes later he was screaming
from the garage door.
""Hurry up mom!""

One hour car ride. Not the longest one he ever had. He kept asking me about the place. I just smiled and told him to
be patient. As soon as I parked the car, he blasted out the door and ran to the back of the car to grab two flashlights. 
""You ready?"" I asked him. He obviously was so we started walking towards our destination.
It was dark in there. Darker than anywhere else. Flashlights on.  He just kept pushing forward. Sometimes I couldn't 
even catch up with that little kid. After a sharp left turn I saw him standing there. He found it. The biggest hall 
in the cave. Every wall was shining when the light of our flashlights reached them.
""Beautiful isn't it?""

""It is indeed!"" he answered. He turned his head towards me but it was only q light at a corner 
that he could see. He totally crapped himself. ""Mommy wait for me!"" He started running towards the light 
that he could see. It is a maze down there. - MOM! - he screamed.
""I'm here honey!"" He caught up with me. He just gasped there and started to be a bit relieved as he realized 
that he was not alone in that dark cave again.
""Hey calm down little boy! I'm not leaving you here!"" went closer to him and whispered:  ""Or am I ?

I've been having a lot of bad dreams for the past 3 weeks, but i think this one tops all of them. Anyhow, I dreamt that I lived with my boyfriend in a big house, it was night and we both were sleeping. Suddely i wake up, and I sit up in our bed. I'm fully aware that I'm sleepwalking but I can't stop myself, lay down again or do anything about my actions. I start walking out in a big hallway (this is where the main door is located), then I enter a smaller, much more narrow and dark hallway, and in the end is a small wardrobe-like room which is truly pitch black. This scared me a bit since I am afraid of the dark but I just keep walking, I don't even consider NOT to walk in to the wardrobe. So I find myself inside this pitch black tiny room and I close the door and I lock it. Once I have locked the door i just panic, I'm not afraid but I simply can't stop screaming, I remember the scream so well, it was a true scream of despair, I screamed at the top of my lungs but I still was not scared. I started to bang the door, the walls, everything while screaming and crying as hard as I could. Finally my boyfriend comes to the rescue and the door was open now, he just grabs me and tells me I was sleepwalking and I just said ""I know"" in the sternest voice. He's scared out of his life and crying and I just looks at him like he's crazy and then i just go back to bed like nothing happened.

ephique,0,,0,1rikrx,,4,"I grew up in a small town in Ohio with my mom, dad and big sister. We were a normal family, neither happy nor sad, somewhere in between. I was always interested in music as a kid so I spent most of my time playing piano, practicing guitar or trying my best to write my own songs. It was also some sort of medicine for me; it helped me drift away into my own world when my sister and my mom had disputes. You see, my sister was one of those rebellious teenagers at the time that had to have their own way or the rest of the world had to suffer their unfair ranting. I hated it; I hated hearing her yell at my poor mother.

During a lonesome walk home from school one day I got a call from my dad, making sure that I didn’t have any plans and telling me that I had to come home as fast as possible. My dad never called my cell phone unless he really wanted something so I knew right away something was up. I remember jogging most of the route home, since my dad sounded so serious. It gave me the creeps to say the least.

I jumped over the fence surrounding our villa and paced myself into our house. The kitchen was the first room you’d see upon entering and it was empty so I assumed they were in the living room upstairs. As I was making my way up the stairs I could hear my sister sobbing uncontrollably, something had definitely happened. My dad was standing up as my sister was sitting on the couch, he told me to sit down as well.

I was scared and curious at the same time. Dad and my sister never really spoke or had any arguments since my father didn’t bother caring too much about any of my sisters business, so I could figure out that this wasn’t about my sister. I remember sitting there in dead silence with the exception of my sister shedding tears and trying to keep her crying as quiet as possible. My dad was looking like he had no idea what to do or say, as if he didn’t know how to explain something to me.

Finally, after a long pause my dad made an introduction to whatever I thought this was about at the time. He said: “Your mother…” and then he needed to grasp some air, and he continued: “Your mother has passed away.”

I was eight years old and I couldn’t grasp that concept. I didn’t understand death, or that my mom was eternally gone. I just sat there as I was developing an irrational anger towards god-knows-what, I remember thinking how unfair this was. I do however forgive my dad for telling me so bluntly, he didn’t know what to do and he was in shock at the time.

My sister continued crying, she asked dad how mom died although it was obvious she didn’t actually care to know at that precise moment. She was just being desperate and no one could blame her. I thought it was my sisters fault when I was there, I thought that was why she was crying so much. I didn’t shed a single tear; I kept it all inside. Of course that didn’t mean this incident didn’t haunt me for years, I never stopped thinking about my mother. 

The aftermath of my mother’s death is what has been shaping my life the recent years. My sister was very weak emotionally and it basically drove her insane. My dad had to take her to an actual mental hospital. Something I didn’t even think existed when I was eight. This resulted in that I didn’t get to meet my sister very often, my dad kept telling me she was in a special school for students that wanted a challenge; but I overheard enough conversations to know where she really was. I guess my dad was trying to keep me out of it, and I didn’t blame him. 

I was guessing that my sister wasn’t doing very well at the hospital since we got to see her less and less as years went by, something that troubled me; I hated living in this big villa of ours with just my dad. It felt so dead, and my dad had been more kept to himself after mom died. We didn’t do anything, I literally spent all time at home in my room, making or playing music. Me and my dad didn’t even greet sometimes when I came home from school, it was depressing. My theory for his change in behavior has always been that he blamed himself for my mother’s death, something that I’m about to get into.

You are probably wondering how she died by now, and it’s a legit question to be asking. The best answer I could give you is that I don’t know. My dad has always told me she died of liver-failure but for some reason that has always sounded like a lie to me. It didn’t add up, my mom never had any problems with her liver before and she didn’t drink. I think it was something he made up when I was younger because he assumed I wasn’t mature enough to hear the truth. In addition to this, whenever I asked my dad about this matter he’d get heavily upset. Nowadays I never ask about my mom’s death, nor do I even bring up mom as a topic.

Years went by and I ended up being fourteen. It kept going like I just described, I spent most times in my room playing music as my dad did whatever he was doing on his own in the house. My dad did work, he had the night-time shift at a local bottle factory, I’m not joking, he actually made glass bottles for a living. He had higher ambitions but most of them got crushed when he and my mother got my sister, they had to move and dad basically had no other financial option than to quit the university he was attending at the time and get a quick and close job. You guessed it, the bottle factory.

I was riding my bike home late at night after spending the evening in the school library at one point when I was fourteen. My school was the type that had an after-school library that didn’t close till 11 pm. I didn’t need any of the books or supplies that the library offered; I just studied there sometimes since it felt less depressing than my father and our lonely villa. Either way, I hadn’t seen my sister for two years that night and I was starting to get the idea that I wouldn’t see her again for another two. 

When I arrived at the house the front door was open, “This is odd?” I thought. Upon closer examination I realized that someone had taken the spare key from its hidden spot underneath one of my mother’s old jars. It’s never smart to have a spare key hidden right next to the door, number one mistake people do when it comes to spare keys. It did look like whoever had taken it did suffer a struggle before finding it. The rug outside the door was all muffled up and there were scratches on the door, around the lock. I suspected we had been robbed so I pulled out my cell phone, ready to call the police. 

This is when I heard something coming from inside the house. I was dead scared to say the least, this could have been armed robbers or maybe something worse, I didn’t know. It sounded like someone was grinding furniture against the floor, trying to move it. It was so dark as well, I remember not seeing more than pitch black looking into the open door, technically if someone was in there they would have seen me because of the street lights. I started to slowly pace into the house, walking towards the noise. This is where I had to make a decision, was I going to suddenly turn on the lights in order to reveal whatever was in there or was I going to approach it in the dark? I picked the former. I was just going to switch the lights on when I could see someone strafe into the light coming in through the kitchen window. It was my sister, naked. My entire mindset had to change into a totally different way of dealing with the situation; it took me a good couple of seconds to assume she escaped the hospital. 

I switched on the lights in an instant. She had redecorated the entire kitchen, in the dark. Of course it all looked hideous and random; she didn’t know what the hell she was doing. I remember being in a slight discomfort, I had never seen my sister naked in my entire life. I also hadn’t seen her for a good couple of years at all. She didn’t look very comfortable either, she looked like she didn’t know who I was and was wondering what I was doing there.

I uttered “Linda?” out loud, that was her name. She didn’t respond, she just continued standing there looking at me. “Don’t you remember me, I’m your brother.” I still couldn’t get any feedback out of her; it was as if the wheel wasn’t spinning at all. I wasn’t sure what the protocol here was, not knowing the number to the mental institution or anything I figured I’d try to call dad, before I got to press the call button on my cell phone she uttered: “Don’t call dad.” This is when I realized she couldn’t be completely empty inside after all.

“You don’t want to call dad.” She continued.  I had no idea what to do, I assumed this was part of the reason she was in the mental hospital in the first place. Luckily my dad got home at that point, not coming from a finished shift at work. He had a good five hours at least left, I assumed the hospital had phoned him and told him about the situation. My father ran into the house as fast as he could.

This is when something I didn’t expect happened, he told me to leave. He pointed at the door as if I had no idea how to find my way out of my own house. I asked him where I was supposed to go, he told me to wait in his car. Judging from how serious my dad seemed I didn’t think twice about it, I ran out to the car. As I was sitting in the car I could see my sister walk past the kitchen window a couple of times, I remember how she made no effort to cover her breasts. I had no clue what the two of them were discussing, although I never saw my sister move her lips so I’m guessing my dad did most of the talking. 

After a couple of minutes my dad started to walk to the car, he joined me inside. I remember asking why he didn’t bring Linda with him, “Don’t call her that name!” he shouted in response. I was so confused at this point. Dad started the car and drove me to my only friend’s house; I didn’t see him very often though. I was a lone wolf growing up and I still was at this point, I didn’t really create any friendships. I remember sitting in the car as he ran up the steps to ring my friend’s doorbell, his mother opened in her night dress and looked confused. I assumed my dad made up some emergency story to cover what was going on in order to get me a place to stay overnight. I didn’t even know what was going on to be fair.

Whatever he told them worked, I got to spend the night at my friend’s place. Tim’s place, to be exact. It was pretty awkward I remember, I only saw Tim a couple of times a week and that was when we shared classes in Spanish. We got to be desk-mates because the teacher made up whom to sit next to each semester, so we weren’t very close. 

It was a Friday so there was no school the morning after; I guessed that made it easier for my dad, leaving him the freedom to pick me up whenever he wanted to. He did, but not before giving me enough time to fully experience the awkward breakfast conversations with Tim’s parents, both trying to justify me as Tim’s best friend. I don’t know. Tim didn’t have many friends I guess.

On the way home I asked my dad what was going on the night before and he basically stopped the car and stared at me, as if I was mocking him. I remember how desperate he looked, as if he had no fire left in his heart. He uttered the words: “Do you think I wanted any of this?” as he grabbed his hair in regret. “All I wanted was a normal family with no circumstances, and I’m not blaming you when I’m saying this because frankly you are the only sane member left in this livelihood of ours.” Is what came out of his mouth next. I tried to comfort him, telling him that he had done a good job raising me and what not; I really didn’t have a lot of cards in my deck at this point. I mean my dad was basically losing it.

When we got home he told me that he was sorry, and that I should go up to my room. I did go up to my room but I got to tell you; I was starting to get very anxious about my dad. I really wanted to know what the hell was going on. I spent that night recording some guitar sessions for a song and reading books while listening to some ambient records I had found online, I couldn’t sleep so pulling an all-nighter was my only real option. I was reading “A Brief History of Time” for a science project in school, I was somewhere in the middle section of the book and started to get dry eyes. I figured I’d go downstairs into the kitchen to get myself something to drink when I got shocked upon opening the door to the hallway. I saw my mother standing just outside, looking right at me for a fraction of a second. Had all this hassle from the last couple of days driven me insane? It freaked me out so much that I ended up never getting a drink. 

The image of my mother outside my door haunted me that entire night, I kept thinking about it as I couldn’t sleep. She looked deranged, scared and raw. The shortage of light sources in the hallway made her look like she was from a black and white 50’s movie. I kept begging for the sun to rise up, I even did that thing when you close your eyes and try not to open them because you never know what you’ll see. I might have been fourteen, but I can openly admit that I was dead scared.

It finally came to be morning and I ran downstairs, still not fully opening my eyes while passing the hallway. I remember greeting my dad who was sitting in the kitchen drinking orange juice. I was just about to pour myself a glass when he said: “I think I need help.” While holding the glass of juice as if he wasn’t sure he was going to drink the rest of it. I asked him what he meant and he said that he wasn’t sure, that he had felt very uncomfortable and unstable lately. He also mentioned that he was thinking of joining some people from his work in playing golf, he thought that could give him some relief. I told him that sounded like a pretty good idea, jokingly adding that it’s better than hanging around the house doing nothing. He looked offended when I said that, something I didn’t really understand since he obviously worked all night, so that would justify him sleeping through the days.

I understand that some of you reading this are wondering how the hell I could have been fourteen and still not know how my mother died. Well, it’s hard to explain how uncomfortable of a character my dad was at times, and it felt a bit like I was offending him whenever I had to ask because part of me did actually believe she died of liver-failure. I mean it was possible. Imagine if it was true, and I kept asking my dad as if he lied to me. That’s the type of thoughts I had in my head about the whole thing.

Having that explanation out of the way, I did summon the courage to confront my dad one last time. It was a couple of days after the conversation about my dad picking up golf; I just walked into his room unexpected. A part of me had wanted to do this for a long time because I really never knew what he did in his room; it looked similar to an office which is nothing he’d ever need since he was a labor worker in a bottle factory. He was actually sitting at his desk. Not only that, but the desk was flooded with paper-work of some sort, maybe he had picked up an accounting job for the factory during the day, something he could manage from home. I didn’t ask; I had a big enough question for him as it were.

I dragged out a small chair he had behind the door and figured I’d sit on it. It was somewhat squeaky and not very comfortable, better than standing up anyway. Then I leaned forward and I was just about to ask when he interrupted my train of thought by saying: “You want to know about your sister, and what happened the other night. Don’t you?” This is where I started to play along because he was already looking emotionally hurt, bringing up mom here would have been a car-crash. I told him that I was indeed there to ask about my sister. He took a good pause before he bluntly exclaimed it to me: “Your sister is not right in the head; she’s in a mental hospital.” I couldn’t believe he hadn’t figured out that I would have known this by then. Not wanting to make a scene I just pretended like I didn’t know. He explained the context, telling me that she couldn’t take our mother’s death. A tear started climbing down his cheeks, and then he asked me if there was anything else I wanted to talk about. There was no way I could bring up something as sensitive as my mother at this point so I told him that everything was fine, and then I left the room.

I realized on my way up to my room that my dad was fragile and very close to losing his mind in this problematic family business. I had no idea how I’d ever get the truth about my mother out of him. When I finally had landed on my bed in my room again, the image of my mom started crawling back to me. The grey scaled portrait of her in the hallway, was my mind playing tricks on me? I also had a slight feeling that I remembered it from somewhere. I mean it was my mom but that exact stare and look she had, not only did it frighten me but I swore I had seen it before. 

Night landed again, I hadn’t spoken to my father again that day. I was facing the same obstacle that I had the other night, I was too afraid to go downstairs because I thought I’d see my mother again. We all know you can imagine things in the dark, kids do it all the time. It’s as if your mind fills in the gaps, but that incident the other night was different. I got more scared the more I thought of it and figured that I’d open the door to the darn hallway, and turn on the lights in order to feel slightly safer. I’m not going to lie, I did open that door very slowly but as it turned out; there was no sign of my mother. I turned on the lights and went back into my room.

Still not wanting to go to bed, not only because it was spring break at this point but also because I was a bit scared I figured I’d listen through some of my older songs. I had loads of them; most of which weren’t very good however. I was still learning how to create music and I never really thought of myself as particularly good, especially not at writing my own songs. I guess I was decent at playing other people’s songs. I basically went through my songs in chronological order, it was interesting because was able to hear how much I had improved over the years. 
It took me a good three hours to get past most of my songs, and I was reaching the more recent creations of mine. I heard something in one of the songs that I never had paid any attention to before; it was a slight breeze of white noise in the middle of one of my guitar riffs. Knowing that this wasn’t an overworked track yet, it was made just days ago and I hadn’t gotten around to mastering it yet, I figured I wasn’t going to give it more of a thought. That was until the neurons fired, that track was made the day I couldn’t sleep, the day I saw my mother in the hallway. Being a bit gullible I figured that I’d give it a go using my acoustic headphones. I tried everything. I played the song backwards; I cut out bass, middle frequencies, high frequencies and even listened to individual recordings of the instruments and samples. I couldn’t hear anything suspicious, just that white noise. 

I was a bit disappointed, at the same time relieved. Although that white noise shouldn’t have been there, nothing in my room could have made a noise like that. I didn’t want to over-think the situation, so I ended up hitting the bed. Later that night, as I still had problems sleeping I was laying in bed listening to the same ambient soundtracks that I was using nights before, slowly dozing off to sleep. I hadn’t been asleep for much more than ten minutes when I started to ascend into that state of sleep when you’re in a dream at the same time as real life is somewhat happening to you. I could hear a thumping sound coming from somewhere. Before I knew it I got woken up by a loud bass noise, it sounded like some kind of a technical disorder. I continued lying in bed, trying to figure out if I just dreamt about the noise or if it actually occurred, this is when I heard a much dampened sound coming from the other side of my room. It sounded a lot like someone was trying to get some kind of sound device to work. It got quieter and quieter and when I thought it was about to disappear I could hear a voice; very distorted and unstable speaking in what I believe was Russian. 

It took me a couple of minutes but I finally realized what I thought the sound was coming from, I had left my old amplifier on from when I was playing guitar. I bounced out of bed in order to turn on the lights. I was overlooking the entire room as I hit the switch, for the blink of an eye, just next to the amplifier I saw my mom again; just as the light went on. The same stare, same face, still that black and white filtered look from before. I got so shocked I fell down on the floor, the noise coming from the amplifier stopped in the same instant. I wasn’t sure what to make of this, and I definitely didn’t want to tell my father about what I had seen, knowing he has already thrown one of his kin to a mental hospital. 

I had a lot of sleep to catch up on but unfortunately this wouldn’t let me sleep, I just couldn’t sleep at all. I never believed in ghosts or anything growing up, these two small incidents with my mom being my only experience in what could be categorized into the matter. I thought and assumed I was becoming what my sister had become. Whatever this all meant, and needless to say; I didn’t get any sleep that night either.

I met my father in the kitchen the next day, he was looking a lot better than the last time I had seen him. He kept going on and on about how much he was looking forward to playing golf with his work-crew later that afternoon. I was happy for him; he deserved some time out of the stress. After the conversation about an afternoon of longing for a spot in the shade and waiting for your turn on a grass field he added: “Have you been thinking of your mother lately?” As if he could read my mind. I told him that I was always missing my mother, and that I had indeed thought of her a lot lately. He stated that he thought I had. I had no clue why.  Short after that he left for playing golf.

I kept thinking of why my amplifier was acting up that night, I started recalling a clear memory of turning it off after I was done playing. In fact, I knew I did since the amplifier was connected to an electricity hub that I used to turn off a small lamp I had next to my bed, how could it have been on? I had no idea. 

Since my dad was out of the building I figured I could use this afternoon without his presence to get some answers. I stepped into his room to investigate what he had been doing sitting at that desk of his all those hours. I grabbed a bunch of paperwork and sat myself on the double bed next to his desk, it got me a slight reminder on how he hadn’t gotten rid of the bed he shared with my mother yet. The first paper I started examining looked like a letter of some sort, as if it was a letter inside a legal template of some company. I don’t know how I’d describe it better than that. After further examination I found out it was a letter from my sister sent to our address, I remember wondering why dad wouldn’t show me something like this: 

“Daddy, why didn’t you visit me last weekend. I thought you were coming back, I was waiting for you. I’m sorry if I made a scene, I thought something had happened to you! I ran to you because I wanted answers, no one has answers here. I’ve been getting visits lately, why can’t you come to me at the same time?”

I fixed some grammar and a whole lot of spelling errors for the sake of explaining this to you, my sister had the linguistic abilities of a five year-old in this state. On after-thought I guessed my dad didn’t tell me about letters from my sister since they would inevitably prove that she wasn’t in a special school for people who were after tougher challenges. Although thinking about it, that doesn’t sound ridiculously different than a mental hospital.

The rest of the papers seemed to be a real mixture of work-related things and records of local police-investigations. Why would my father be looking into cases of murder, pedophilia, rape and almost anything you can think of? It wasn’t really my business what he did with his spare time but this was just outright messed up. I knew he had a friend in the police force, that was either the reason he had these or just the tool he used to get them. I didn’t even want to know at the time, I had enough stuff on my mind already and I hadn’t slept in far too long.
I apologize to whoever reading this if it seems that I’m dragging it out with details a bit too much here and there, I’m only taking precautions to make sure that I’m telling it right. If I’m finally going to tell my story I want it to sound right. 

My father never came home after golfing so I assumed he went directly to work, which made complete sense. It was starting to get late into the evening and I had absolutely nothing better to do than to once again sit in my room, I was trying to figure out ideas for new songs on my guitar. This time I wasn’t using the amplifier since I was legitimately scared of the noises occurring again. My amplifier has been known to pick up foreign radio broadcasts before, something that explains the distorted Russian speech last time, I wasn’t worrying about that. I was thinking about my mother showing herself again. Not that I was sure that it had anything to do with the amplifier itself.

Not too long into that night I started feeling sick of being in-doors for so long, and I felt like I could use some kind of fresh air as a vacation from all this unexplained mystery I had been experiencing. I remember being on the sane side of the fence, thinking critically and trying to find solutions, not marking everything as if it was a conspiracy from hell. I figured I’d take my bike down to a local gas station, not more than ten minutes from my house; I wanted some chips, candy and maybe a couple cans of soda. 

I scrambled together some change I found in my room and took off; I got there faster than I thought I would. It wasn’t cold outside either; it was a pretty smooth night. After grabbing some generic brand of chips, Skittles and a couple cans of coke I paid for it and left. I didn’t spend much time in the store, but apparently enough time to get my bike stolen. With no bike, feeling like a stupid idiot for not locking it I had to walk home. 

Something out of the ordinary happened after this, and I wasn’t even sure if I was seeing things at first. I was walking on this huge open road; I guess you could say it was somewhat of a country road. It was tied together with the forest behind our house. It was the type of road that didn’t have any traffic other than truck drivers, passing once every couple of hours at night. I didn’t want to believe my eyes at this point but I saw my sister standing alone wearing what you’d imagine someone coming from a mental hospital would wear. I assumed she was looking for me; she was definitely staring at me. 

I continued walking, not necessarily fearing my sister. It somehow still felt as if I had a bond with her, that she would never have done anything to hurt me. As I approached her she didn’t give me any response what so ever, she was just staring at me in a light-blue scrub-coat, looking lifeless. I had reached talking-distance; I couldn’t believe this was happening. It felt surreal, like one of those scenarios you can’t be prepared for in real life. She had started to shake a bit, I couldn’t tell if she was freezing or if she was nervous. I asked her if she was looking for me out there, and if she had escaped the hospital. She didn’t respond. I got the notion that she was slightly scared of me, as if I was a threat to her. 

After a short gap of silence I noticed that she was holding something behind her back. I got a bit worried that she had some kind of a weapon, or a blunt object to swing at me so I stepped back when I spotted it. She started to slowly bring it forth, it was a plastic bag. From the way she was holding it I could tell it wasn’t heavy, or dangerous for that matter. I withdrew the step back I took earlier and tried to peer down into the bag, then she started to stretch it out to me: “I took this from your house the other day, I’m sorry. I think this belongs to you. Jonathan.” 

I do realize that I never told you my name, it is indeed Jonathan. I was slightly astonished that she had remembered my name even; she seemed to be so out of it. I remember grabbing the plastic bag, she wouldn’t let go of it too lightly either, it was as if she still wanted it. After I had gotten whatever was in the bag we shared another brief moment of silence, she wouldn’t stop staring into my eyes during these. Then she told me to never mention any of this to our dad. Shortly after she started walking towards the forest; as if she knew where she was heading. 

I saw the headlights of a car coming straight at me and my sister, whoever was in this car was driving way ahead of the speed limit. I noticed when it started to get closer to us that it was my dad’s car, acting on impulse I threw myself into a nearby ditch, as I got to witness my dad chasing after my sister. I didn’t even know if I wanted him to catch her or not, she was purposely running away from him. He dragged her into his car and they both drove away, heading the direction he was originally going. This was the second time she had successfully escaped this mental hospital, and how the hell did my sister make it so far both times? Something wasn’t right, I knew from when I was younger that the hospital wasn’t anywhere close to where we lived since my dad sometimes was gone for ten hours upon visiting her. Of course at the time it was supposedly a special school, but that doesn’t change the logic of it. He never brought me with him whenever he visited my sister, since he kept me in the dark about the whole hospital thing.

I ran the rest of the way home, trying not to drop anything; I still had all the items I bought at the gas station. I wanted to make sure that I could get home before my dad did; I had no clue whenever he would get back, and not wanting him to find out whatever was in the bag my sister gave me. I couldn’t spot my dad’s car in the driveway so I felt relieved as I stepped into the house. I didn’t bother putting my drinks in the fridge or anything, I made my way back to my room as fast as I could. I don’t really know why but I locked the door after me, as if there was something to fear. I sat myself on the bed with all the lights in the entire room switched on. I made sure to put all the bags with snacks in them aside; as I was getting ready to dig into whatever my sister ran into the night to give me. 

I never really thought of something until now, and that is how my sister could have found me. It must have been a coincidence, or she had been following me for a while; knowing she couldn’t approach me in the store. I don’t know.

I looked into the bag, it seemed to be random belongings from the drawers in our living room, and maybe some stuff from one of the cupboards we had in the kitchen. After sorting out stuff that had no relevance what so ever, for example there was a roll of tape in there. I planned to spend more time on the more interesting items. The first thing I picked up was a small collection of family photos, most being after mom died. The next thing I could grab was a couple of rocks; they weren’t even dry, I guessed she must have gotten those just before she passed me the bag. There was only one thing left in the bag, an usb-stick. 

I took the stick out and threw away the bag. Then I started looking at the photos as I was trying to reason why she would have taken any of these from our house. The only thing that somewhat made sense is that a couple of them were from when she wasn’t sent to the hospital yet, but it was pretty much pending already. In fact, most of these photos took place a couple of weeks after our mother passed away. On one of them it’s my sister showing off her prom dress she was planning on wearing, she actually wasn’t acting too badly the first couple of weeks. I guess she didn’t process our mother’s death until later or something. Another photo is of dad’s old car, he had to sell it in order to compensate for our family’s financial depression from when we lost the main income our family had, my mother’s candle business. He loved that damn car with his entire heart; we even used to joke about how mom was jealous of the car. 

There were more photos but I stopped going through them when I realized a couple of them had a handwritten marking of the letter “x” behind them. It noticed this when I was flipping them as I was trying to get them all to be facing me. I sorted the photos with no marking away and started to focus more on the ones with the marking. I figured my sister must have had done this, for what reason I was about to find out. I kept staring at the first picture; it was the one I told you about earlier, the one of my father’s old car. It was a Pontiac from the early 80’s and it must have cost him a fortune. I never had any particular memories of the car; I remember it spending most of its time in our garage.

I kept looking at the photograph and the more I stared at it the more I started to wonder why my dad hadn’t use the car more, he obviously loved it. The photo was taken for an ad in the newspaper, for selling it of course. I was just about to put the sad photo away when I caught a glimpse of my mother sitting in the backseat. It wasn’t very clear and she seemed somewhat transparent. She had the same drained-out appearance and blank stare that she had from when I saw her in the hallway outside my room, and this was taken after her death. I couldn’t believe what I was looking at. I remember dropping the photo out of shock; so many thoughts started circling inside of my head.

dinofinger,0,,1,1rie11,,1,"    17^th May 2007.
I followed my dad went to Grandma's house. My cousin who lives with grandma, had a suspicion that something had happen to Aunt L &gt; *Her initial would be appropriate here* &lt; Aunt L was never in her sound mind but she prefer to live alone which is the best option avoiding the troubles she would cause to others. Grandma has a problem of [nagging](https://www.google.com/search?q=nagging&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a) disease which makes more Aunt L better suit live far from her lectures. 

Back again to my cousin, who received a call from Aunt L's neighbour. Her respond was *there was a sudden silent for the past four days*. Aunt L was never a social person who goes anywhere she wants and always out. She prefered to live in her tiny apartment secluded only her herself and herself she enjoys being with. But her neighbour help us to watch for her just in case for anything. So we respond to go and visit her house. My father, my cousin and I, the three of us went together with nothing held us back. 

As we arrive by the door, we knock and knock. From the window we can see noise screen from her small tv at the corner. But there was no sign of her. Somehow her grill lock and the door were changed, the key my cousin brought didn't fit at all. Maybe she doesn't want us to barge in anytime we want. My dad took the liberty to call the locksmith while giving positive thoughts to my cousin that everything was fine. 

30 minutes pass. The locksmith do his magic and opened the door. Such stench came out in full loaded right to our faces. Right in front of the door we can see Aunt L laid still in the toilet facing the floor. A 15 year old me shocked and I just watched her body in strip condition only a towel covered her other half and her faeces was right below her and all over behind her. Yet she is still alive, blinking and gasping.

My dad pull me back allowing my cousin to go in. I can still feel my father clenches my arms so tightly when he saw his sister. He said ""*[I better call the ambulance](http://www.wikihow.com/Call-an-Ambulance)*"", so he did and left. My cousin call me out to help pick her up. But she was too heavy, we can't even push her to the side. So my cousin rinse her with water to clean her off. I was told to took a towel and wipe her face. I could say her face was in a total blankness. 

25 minutes later the ambulance arrive. They took her with a stretcher. Both of us went down to send her off. I can remember certain vision of some neighbours pry on their window looking out what was happening. My dad went together with Aunt L, so left me and my cousin. Soon my mom and sister arrive bringing cleaning equipment. We spent whole 3 hours cleaning her house. Based on what I heard my cousin said ""*The man who always deliver her food got no respond from her for three days. That's when he ask the neighbour if she had gone somewhere. I bet if we were too late, she might have gone by any minute unconscious on the floor*""


    18^th May, 2013
We had her funeral in the day after the day we thought she would died 6 years ago. Funny the coincidence of the date just *one day after* we laughed. My cousin gave a speech said she was a fighter. Indeed she was. I think her life is better after that 17^th May living in the retirement home. She was more happier than before she was a shut-in.

As I was doing this, the big rocking chair next to his litter box was swaying, and I gave him a quick glance. I felt him sniff at my ear. He then jumped off the chair and walked into the kitchen. I thought nothing of it for a few seconds, then froze. ""Oliver!"", I called. I then walked to the door and looked outside, he was napping on the steps.

echoes007,4,,2,1rhee9,,2,"I’ve always been a non-religious person. I was brought up by parents who told me to question everything. To not believe the crap that is forced down our throats daily. But I’ve always felt a whole in my life when it came to that stuff. I went as far as trying LSD and DMT to achieve this “religious experience” we all want, but I never got it. So, after a while, I just gave up and moved on and accepted there is no God, or spiritual experience, or anything that’s real, that will make me see life in a whole new perspective. Naturally, this got me down and depressed a bit. It was then when I started seeing 11:11 everywhere. It started one night when I was doing some heavy drinking and decided to do some coke lines. I remember vividly, my heart stopped, and I remember a sound, like a blender going off in my head. When I forced myself to snap out of what had happened to me, I remember the first thing I looked at was the clock on the cable box. It read 11:11. This stuck with me for a long long time. I felt like some force or spirit was forcing me to look at the clock when it was 11:11 in the morning and 11:11 at night. As if reminding me that it saved my life. This was going on for a while, when I went as far as Googling what it was. Unfortunately, the 11:11 thing was associated to some spiritual stuff, things I thought were bullshit to begin with. But still, 11:11 was always there. Slowly I stopped thinking about it, and my 11:11 experiences were less and less. It wasn’t until last week when I was driving home (I was butt sober) from an event when it started raining. My tires and brakes were messed up and I didn’t get a chance to change them, and besides, it hardly ever rains in this town, so this came as a surprise to me. As I was driving up a hill, I lost control of my car completely on the wet road, and was literally fighting my steering wheel and slamming on my brakes to stop the car, but I couldn’t. This went on for about five seconds until I finally stopped the car in the middle of the road. Again, when I snapped out of my panic mode, the first thing I looked at was the time, and it said 11:11. I’m not one who believes in coincidences, but this has me thinking I have some angel or spiritual entity looking after me. Even though I don’t believe this stuff, there is NO way that could happen. Has anyone else experienced 11:11, or has randomly been “forced” to look at a clock when it’s 11:11? Or is it my brain playing tricks on me because of the LSD/DMT I took? ",11:11,4,nosleep
Jerbsybear,0,,0,1rh5g6,,2,"There are tales of a man committed to Central State

Who killed his wife and children while he asphyxiates

His doctors with the bloody spinal cord

Of his fat nurse, who cares if she was old

When the guards rushed in, it was no problem at all

bashing their brutish faces straight into the wall

Bursting through the heavy front doors

He killed everyone on the first floor

No one would stop him, no, not this time

5 years of waiting, no stopping on a dime

He had to get out on this night

To meet his lover, one at first sight

Taking his science class, year after year

Convinced that she loved him, held him dear

Called her ""favorite student"" and all

Had her parents give him a call

To invite him to dinner, on a cold winter's night

Slaughtered her family, their faces were a sight

In the judge's court, he mercilessly pleaded insanity

When, in reality, it was egotistical vanity

If he couldn't have her, no one can

To kill her new parents was the plan

Standing outside of the house that was soon to be theirs,

Looking to seek justice, to seek what's fair

So as he broke in and brandished the knife

She knew he was back to take a life

So quickly she fled into the night

Leaving behind more victims, as she took flight

She ran two miles straight to the highway

Waving for anyone to stop, to go her way

As hand grabbed her from behind the bushes

His knife drives deeper and deeper as it pushes

Past her vitals and deep into her heart

All flashbacks of her life seemed to fall apart

As he whispers ""This...feels so right""

Her mind tries to escape into the night

The fires of his greed are not yet doused

As he tries to get back to the house

He plans to take another life

""Am I next, is he coming,"" you cry with fear

InsanityInABottle,0,,1,1rgw03,,2,"“Extra, Extra! The Piggy killer is at it again!” Yelled the paperboy, holding a darkened paper above his head, screaming the same phrase over again, as if it was no big deal. I walked towards him and asked him “How much?”
“Only ten cents sir.”
“Ha. Must be a pretty good story then.” I said, as I fumbled for a large dime. I handed it into the boy’s hand, it’s gleam bouncing the light of the sun, veiled through the mist of rain into my eyes. I blinked quickly and grabbed the paper, quickly turning from the boy, hearing “How about a tip sir?”
“How about you wipe your ass with the metal I’ve already given you.” I said back to the boy, who furrowed his brow and continued screaming for new customers. As I walked along Hero’s Avenue, I kept the paper open, reading it over again. In large font, shouted “Piggy killer’s new victim!” with a picture of a woman, apparently known by the name of “Jessica Turrow.” She wore a large smile on her face, as she raised a glass of champagne above her head for a toast, I presumed.
	The article read “The psychopath, depicted as a man with a pig’s head on worn over his own face, has struck again. Witnesses described him as large, while wearing a reddened trench coat, then finally, a bib, which read the term KISS THE COOK, slathered neatly against his chest in gore. He had organs and even a human spinal cord attached to his coat and as usual, was found was mist was floating through the air and at dawn. We had identified the victim, through a ring found on the hand of the woman, who had been chopped to pieces and nailed against the side of the church. If you are to spot anyone fitting under the description, contact the police immediately, or you may be his next victim.”
	I laughed as I watched terror shrouding the faces of everybody who grasped a paper in their hands, all walking along the street as automobiles drove recklessly between one another, threading the needle on the two way street, not large enough for two cars to fit on.
	I walked towards the police station, which was cleverly located across the street from a coffee shop, a brothel and a printing office. A police car drove by; it’s loud horn sounding, flashing red and white, reflecting the light from the rain directly into my eyes. I walked into the station, the smell of fresh cigars flooding into my nose. A man screamed from across a large waiting room, looking down at the paper, then looked up and said “Oh. It’s the wonderful Flynn. Of course my dear, come, come.” I walked past him, glaring at his smug face, and then opening the door into my office.
	A man sitting on a chair for those waiting to enter my office abruptly greeted me. He smiled and said, “Well hello sir, I am Dean Osterrietch and believe I have a lead on the notorious killer”
“The pig one?”
“Y- wait, there are more?”
“I believe there are, just they might not like attention as much as our friend here.”
“Well… thanks for informing me of that rather morbid concept, but I have gotten hundreds of pictures of the killer, coming out of his lair.”
	The man pulled out a large portfolio of pictures and dumped them onto my desk, arranging them appropriately. “So, if you look at these pictures, it was for when he first got into the business, holding small weapons, all identifiable, all related to the cutting of meat. Then as you look to the left, these are the later pictures, which are of him coming out, holding bodies on his shoulders, sitting in the back of his eatery and chopping them up, putting them into boxes and looking pleased with himself, all the while in his pig mask. But, he seems to be getting careless. He cam outside, barely slipping on his mask in time for my camera to flash a photo, his face seemed veiled in… something. Something sticky, something gruesome. But if you look closer, you can quite easily see the silhouette of his face. Large, hooked nose, eyes, clouded in blue, teeth, sharpened to perfection and a dripping mouth.”
“Ha. So you’re basically implying that you’ve seen a notorious killer walk in and out of a location multiple times and not even dared to act on it? I beginning to suspect you’re the killer!”
“But that would be silly. Why would a crazy give himself away?”
“I don’t know, why don’t you tell me?”
“I believe this conversation is getting a bit heated. I saw the ad in the paper that I should contact the police and thought I’d tell you where I’ve seen such events. Have you ever seen the abandoned butchery on 1800 Bellcove Street? Well there’s your place. Sir!” said the man as he gathered his pictures and threw them into his bag, which smelled of defecation and nickels. I watched as he slammed the door, then sighed and sat down on my desk, rapidly pressing the keys of my typewriter, updating the information I’ve received from the man.
“Mysterious man visits police station, says he has a lead on the piggy killer. As you all know, the notorious killer has crossed the line now. Enough to even be called a serial killer! What a sick bastard he is.” I continued being as pessimistic as possible, updating the paper, then grabbing my camera as I finished the article. Typing in my name, finishing with my name, saying “Written by: Flynn Covetail.”
	Darkness was beginning to shroud the air, perfect night for the killer to strike in his typical environment. Light rain was spattering against my window, racing down to the bottom of the screening, only to fall against an umbrella below. As I left my office, throwing on my coat, I screamed to the man in the front desk, “Going out to…oh, let’s see...1800 Bellcove Street? If I don’t come back, Phone someone.” I said with a laugh, while walking outside.
	Instantly my boots splashed against the small walkway paved on “Western Lagoon highway” as the frivolously worthless people would say. I walked down towards the street, which was naught but four blocks from here. I passed by Dontell’s Donuts, Redgar’s Rotisserie and Salam’s Spices, all involved in the fattening of desperate cops, as only fattening diners were located near the station, so I developed a theory that every restaurant owner is against us.
	I reached the butcher’s place, which had been looted to hell by the anarchists, who were just a group of thugs that didn’t do shit to overthrow the government. The door had been pried off it’s hinges, yet now it was replaced by a veil of chains, hanging off of rusted hooks attached to the doorframe. Within the butchery, the first thing I noticed was a bed, a homeless man sleeping on it.
	I simply ignored the bum and walked around, searching for anything considered suspicious. I walked through the door, smelling the bum’s shit in the corner and closing my nostrils as well as I could. I looked through the shop, behind the counter I found several rusted knifes, which were corroded to the counter, which was a wooden rotten thing, with three cutting boards lining it, all of which nobody needed. The front of the shop seemed completely normal, but I listened to the bum waking, instantly screaming, “Who’s there! I will kill you if you’re trespassing on my property!” I laughed and screamed to him “I suggest you run out of here, or I may just have to turn you in as a key suspect for the crimes.” I heard the scuffing of his shoes against the floor, running towards me.
	I quickly turned, backing up against the wall, my sidearm pointed at the bum and screamed “GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!” I shot to the side of the man, who quickly bolted for the door, a rat following closely behind him. I sat for a minute, catching my breath, while my vocal chords seemed to scratch against one another in a uncomfortable clunky fashion. As I stood, I felt the hard callused flesh of an arm pressing against the front of my throat and the sudden feeling of something hard hitting the back of my head.








	Ha. Damn fool didn’t even know what he had coming. Shouldn’t have fucked with my grandpa… shouldn’t have yelled. My ears hurt. Are they ringing? Why the FUCK am I here? I thought a conversation to myself as I raised the man into the air, the familiar heaviness of my mask pressing against my face, the pig’s blood leaking down my neck, warming me, keeping the cold away. I looked at my setup, which was simply the back room of a butcher’s shop, a heavy steel door muffling sounds on both sides of the fifty wood wide hallway of a room.
	Blood dripped into wooden bowls I’d gotten from the shop, the bodies of fresh meat hanging from the ceiling. Pigs, cows, chickens, even a few deer, but the most stubborn of prey, the pigs. The sticky cunts hung from the ceiling, their wrists cut, their feet missing, their hands stuffed into their fucking loud mouths. The damned pigs that walked the streets, reading their stories about who? About me! The beautiful man, who is dealing righteousness to the crazies, to the rich. Though they think that they’re so safe in their leather homes, they should be the ones making chairs; their dried hides need to be a part of furniture!
	Oh, what an inventor I will be! But the best part is, nobody looks twice at the photographer. Nobody looks at who’s behind the camera; they only care about the picture! And I am finally the one in the picture! Flynn, the little anus that believed he owned the whole world, because the police were backing him up. NO, NO, NO! YOU ARE MY FUCKING BITCH!
	I whistled a tune of sorrow and greed that humans so openly express. I raise him in the air, catch a hook to his leg and strip him down to his bare neck. This self-conceited asshole needs one thing. A hook curving through the cheek, wrenched from his cheek. He thought I was the killer? NO! THAT IS NOT THE FUCKING WORD!
	Oh! My friend is waking up! Finally a new toy to play with. Oh, what a joy he will be! Oh no! What will I say to him? I guess I’ll just wing it. I guess I’ll just talk to him.  Where will I display this beauty? Ooh! The police station! Mmm, how delectable would that be? To show the pigs that even their weapons can’t defend them from me. THEY ARE GOING TO LOVE ME! I am a hero. I love being a hero and don’t try to talk me out of my heroism! I AM AMAING!








	My eyes slowly opened, to find a man in a pig mask, the rotting dreaded animal seemed to have a grin on it’s face. I was hanging upside down and fuck my leg hurts! Why does my leg hurt? Where the hell am I? “Oh… you’ve awakened!” spouted the pig; it’s squeaky voice ringing through my ears. I screamed, “Help me! Help! HE’S GOING TO KILL ME!” 
“Now that’s not how you treat a guest, is it?”
“Fuck you.”
“Oh… language, language my dear friend. If you even try saying something like that, I will cut off your cock and feed it to my friend Mr.Squeaks over here!”
	I looked to where he was pointing, which was a large column in the room, a decomposing rat nailed to the pole. “Somebody is going to catch you. They know where I am!”
“Oh, I believe they do, if only your little desk friend was there to hear what you had to say!” said the phsyco with a smile. He pointed at the ceiling, which had two hooks on it, chains hanging from them and a headless man, blood dripping in a steady stream of thickness, into a wooden bowl. “Why are you doing this to these people?”
“Okay, okay, story time. Oh yay, stories! FUCK OFF GREG, THIS IS MY TIME TO SHINE!”
	I looked at the pig with doubt, pain shooting up my leg, throbbing slowly into my brain. “SO, let me tell you why I love my job, okay? Okay. So, when I was twelve, I thought, I’m going to take pictures of weddings! I’m going to take pictures of people in love, because everyone else’s happiness, is mine.” He said this, while pinning his right hand against his heart, which contained an extra few layers of flesh, sewed against his own, along with a tattoo, stolen from his victim.
	“Okay, so anyways! What do ya know! I’m doing that now! I am a photographer! I love people being happy. SO, I one day, was at this one glorious wedding, full of lovely people. I had started talking to a woman and a little, oh what is it called? Fetish of mine was developed. As we were in bed, I took out my camera and took shots of my experience and little did I know, I have a few other… kinks. I wrung my hands around her delicate throat, stuck my finger down her throat and felt the vomit shoot from her mouth! I felt the rush as eventually, she started to fuckin’ bleed! WHAT A WHORE! She began to cough up blood, she began to wheeze and it is as these coughs echoed from her throat, landing inside of my mouth as our lips touched, did I realize how wonderful blood tastes. Rich, creamy, delicious, blood, coursing from the fountains of our decapitated stumps. I invented ways of sucking people dry, licking them dry! Well, at first I was only an amateur, but, as I got better! Oh BOY did I start to love my job! Every wedding became a slaughter, every wedding gave me a new friend, because after all, nobody cares about who’s behind the camera! NOBODY GIVES TWO FUCKING SHITS!
	So, pretty boy, I believe it’s time; you… started looking into my eyes, whenever I snap a photo of your beautiful body.” He said this as his hand slid down from my chest, slowly down to my cock, grinning, spittle flying out of his mouth as he coughed, slid a blade against it as chopped it off. I screamed out loud, blood spurting from me and all the smile he smiled, then I fell asleep, never to wake again.

ReiKoroshiya,0,,0,1rgsca,,2,"Here I am and im going to write about some of the things that go on in my life. Sorry for bombarding you with some trivial things and please just hear me out.
how about I start at the beginning that seems easier. Well back in elementary, I was that kid the kid that really no one liked. I had a friend here and there but that's about it. I was basically a social outcast, 
I never really got my work done, I still don't. Note that I was a very, very angry child and no I was not spoiled if that's what your thinking, im the oldest of 3 kids who had been and are growing up in poverty, but my father is very good at managing money which means he is very cheap.
I had shared a room with my younger brother and for some reason I never grew out of the stage where you sleep with your blankets over your head. I had always liked horror even though none of it really scared me even in elementary in the 3rd grade I found an author by the
name of R.L.Stine and I had read tons of his books which remotely captured my interests.
A few of the simple things had scared me, and I most likely have experiences that I have blocked out of my mind, I don't remember much about my childhood at all.
I don't know why I can't but that's just how it is. I do remember bits and pieces though, not anything like birthdays, mind you. Here Ile give some examples, I remember
when I thought my stuffed animal had red eyes, I freaked out a little bit called my parents and my father calmed me down and took it away. Years later I went back and found it, and of course it wasn't scary anymore. Another example
would be when I saw a ""witch"" in my closet, but again my father came in and turned the light on to show me that there was nothing there, I had clearly saw something but it was gone as soon as the light turned back on.
Once he had left and turned the light back of the figure was back again. I remember when my body shot up in bed and I let out a blood curtling scream and my parents rushed into the room
and they had tried to comfort me and to calm me down I was bawling my eyes out while hugging my father he had asked me what had happened and I was just mumbling incoherently 
about it. I can't remember what it was that had freaked me out so badly. Something else that just pokes out at me was when I was lying in bed and I hear talking so I sit up strait in bed and I see my parents right there talking to each other I couldn't understand what they were saying because they were mumbling and I said hey and they say love you simultaneously and I said aww I love you too you guys, I reached out to hug them and they both just vanished and I almost fell out of bed(I got top bunk). Then their are the things that I have learned from my family throughout the years, not much really
they don't seem to want to talk much about when I was younger. I got that I was a horrible child when they brought me to church, and that I would bite and snarl when anyone got within an arms reach of me.
keep in mind I don't remember that about going to church, as a matter of fact I don't remember going to church at all. hmmm.... well skip forward to middle school where I had
actually made friends. I did got in so much trouble in middle school its not even funny. I could barely even go a week without at least one detention. Saturday school and suspensions I had gotten a ton too, now
drugs are prevalent where I live and when I say that drugs were prevalent I truly mean that, but honestly the thought of drugs never really appealed to me well I mean
certain ones that is, the only mind altering substance that I would actually want to do, smoke, drink, etc would be alcohol cause it seems fun and really any hallucinogenic drug and there
is no way I could get ahold of hallucinogenic drugs without paying a ton of money and with my broke ass I can't afford it and because of that im drug free. Not to much
happened in middle school, only a few things I started to get hellish demonic dreams (oh and speaking of dreams I have always been able to feel pain in my dreams so if
say I was to get ran through with a spear or had my flesh pealed off in a dream I would wake up and still feel it, I also talk in my sleep) which sucks ass, The vast 
majority of my dreams became violent and with me being an avid gamer there was usually a sword nearby in my dreams and usually I could and would fight back and be home
free. I enjoyed those violent dreams where I won, even though I would battle hellish creatures and people I wouldn't consider it a nightmare. I got my own room in the basement which was nice, and well my brother he was, how do you put it? 
Gassy so yeah hot air rises and all that. Electronic malfunctions had started occurring, like waking up to my radio playing static, my alarm clock started to malfunction, etc. I remember waking up minutes before my alarm clock 
went off I awoke with a shot of electricity to my left ear. Skip forward to highschool in the 9th grade I found out what creepypasta and scp were it was amazing to find real horror for a change.
I read the hell out of creepypasta's and found some really cool narrators for them, listening to those was very enjoyable I didn't read scps often and I found a very long series called the holders.
Near the end of the year I started to feel a presence in my room which was interesting because it didn't have a bad feeling to it, the only word that comes to mind to describe it would be light if that makes any sense.
Jump forward one more year, I had flunked my freshman year because I don't do my work. On those professional tests that they make you take S.A.T's or some shit I did 
insanely good on those like I should be an A- student overall. Now i reside in alternative ed. Im 15 right now. I declared to my parents that im agnostic instead of
Baptist a few months ago. Anyway that presence in my room i hardly feel it anymore and now there is something more sinister and not just in my room anymore.
That thing I actually saw it, I fucking saw it, it was short like about a foot and a half tall. I went to bed last night and you know how earlier I had said I sleep
with my blankets over my head. Well I was moving around under the covers and I glanced out underneath the covers and there it was just staring at me a few inches away 
from my face I had to resist not to punch it because half of me was saying its just my imagination and the other half says that if its real  then im going to freak the fuck out and well I never did hit it and its creepy as fuck that its been watching me. I tried to calm my breathing as to not alert it to the fact that I have seen it I
think it knows I saw it because I have been getting glances of it all day. It might have seen me and it might be watching me type this.
It is very short and I can never manage to see any features on its face it just looks dark like a shadow its really, really dark, everything distorts when I look at it like my depth perception gets thrown off and space distorts around it.

highchairchildren,3,,1,1rgqmu,,2,"I'm looking for any input. If anyone has had experiences like this, is there a way to stop it?

So this started about two years ago. In the beginning it was just a perpetual bad feeling, like something bad was going to happen all the time.  I was anxious, always alert and never at rest. I hardly slept, primarily keeping myself awake in order to feel safer. 

Then, I started seeing things.

When I say seeings things I don't mean like hallucinations, well not really. I'm not crazy. There were never any voices and there never have been. It was more like a blackout moment in which the worst possible scenario for my environment would play out seemingly right before my eyes. 

Mostly accidents.  It happened once while I was sledding.  The hill was a steep drop and then inclined back up about 20 ft. or so where it met a busy road. Usually people lost momentum and slid back down the hill and came to a rest in the valley but sometimes, people would make it all the way up and hit the metal road block that was put up along the hill. A watched as a kid went down the hill and then it happened. I continued to watch as he went all the way back up the hill and under the metal road block right into the speeding car that was passing by. There was blood everywhere. I snapped back to reality and looked around. Everything was fine. There was no blood, nobody was hurt, just kids sledding around having fun. 

I continued to have random ""visions"" for the entire year. They varied in severity. The worst one left me shaken for a few days afterwards.  I was home babysitting my younger sisters and boiling pot of spaghetti for dinner.  I moved to the sink to strain the pasta and then went back to turn off the electric stove.  My little sister approached me to ask a question and then I had my flash.  As I was seeing it, I grabbed her by her hair and pressed her face into the stove. In that moments I watched as her eyes rolled around in her head and she screamed, begging me to stop.  I snapped back and couldn't speak. I teared up and thought I was going to puke.  I ran to the bathroom, washed my face, sat down on the ground and cried. I had never felt such a mixture of fear and remorse in my life. I got up and reentered the kitchen, finished dinner and continued the night as if nothing happened.  She asked me what was wrong and I played it off as a bout of sickness.  I sat awake for hours that night and I still couldn't come up with a reason for why this kept happening to me.  I asked my mom to see a psychiatrist but unfortunately it was a luxury we simply couldn't afford. 

Then it stopped. As quickly as it came in it left and I had no more of an idea about what it was than I'd had before.  It stayed away for a while. I mean really a long time.  I was vision free for an entire year.

I was prompted to write this because I had another one the other.  The first in over a year but I am scared. I don't want it to start again.  The most recent one was more subtle.  I was shaving in the shower went as I brought the razor up my leg, somehow or another I cut myself and there was blood everywhere.  The tub was washed red with it and there was nothing I could do but stand and watch as it oozed out of my leg and swirled around in the water before going down the drain.  Then I flashed back and it wasn't there. I hadn't even cut myself.

I know this must sound crazy, like some Final Destination bullshit.  I swear to you I wouldn't have posted it if I didn't have hopes that someone could help.  Any input is welcomed.",Can anyone help?,3,nosleep

You might remember my journal entries from last month. Last month, I can't believe it's been that long. Days and weeks run now in an endless loop. Where I am now time doesn't matter. It's a nuisance, it's a hinderance. 

A lot has happened. I just wanted to let those who cared, who reached out to me, know that I am alive. Very much so. And I have met some friends. Real human beings. There is so much I want to tell you. So much I want to explain. But I can't. Not now. 

Just know that the monster under your bed is real. That shadow in the closet exists. And those voices, the voices you hear in the dead of the night are not your imagination. All your life you have been told horror stories. And now you seek them out, on this subreddit. To be entertained, to be thrilled. But these stories exist for a reason. Every story has a truth. A small bit of reality wrapped around trigger words and exaggeration. 

That truth is what lurks in the shadows of your house, just at the corner of your eye. The truth is what is waiting for you when you close your eyes to sleep, hoping for a peaceful night's rest. But nothing is peaceful in the dark. Where the light is eclipsed by the slithering, rotting presence that knows you oh so well. One day you'll know. You will wake up and know. All those stories. All those scary tales. All those fears.

Are real.

WHY WON’T I COME BACK WHY IS HE HERE ARE YOU SORRY ARE YOU SORRY ARE YOU SOR-*

Past this the note is unreadable, spewed with a fluid I can only assume is meant to go on the inside of people. Not that I’d really want to read much more anyways. I already know what happens. Well, not really “know”, but I can feel it. Who wrote it? I can only assume it was my dear Uncle Drewson, if he’s even my uncle. What is this? No clue. A note, obviously, but beyond that speculation reigns. Where did I find this? My new house, in a drawer. Nothing is inherently terrifying about that – Oh, except that it was under the clothing I had already packed there. I just missed it before, I keep telling myself. I half believe it. A few pills later and I’m not worrying about it anymore.

Before this, I didn’t even know I had an Uncle Drewson, let alone that I was to inherit his estate in the event of his untimely, but now enacted, demise. With a heavily estranged family, growing up in between various friends or close relatives passed around by uncaring parents looking to shirk responsibility, one loses track of aunts and uncles. It was in a familiar neighborhood, a spacious three bedroom, so I was in no way eager to turn it down. As a poor, regularly unemployed person I’d been accustomed to sleeping on generous friends floors in the all too often occurrence I couldn’t afford anywhere else. I thought, it’ll all be worth it one day, the day I make it in the world. I can pay all these people back tenfold. “The day I make it”, yeah right. A consistent – and more pressingly, free – living space was a welcome antonym to my recent fortunes. So I was moved in within a couple weeks. Absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened. Till that note seemed to start some kind of vicious domino effect on my life, I was content.

You know when you think back to something embarrassing, stupid, or otherwise shameful act you may have done in your younger, brasher days? Once you recall it, it starts eating away, regret seeping in to every corner of your thoughts, till you would give the world to go back and change it, or at least erase the memory. Imagine that, only you can’t remember what it was you’ve done. It’s simply gone from you. The more you try, the less you realize. The less you realize, the more you regret. The more you regret, the more you try. That’s what’s happening to me, ever since I moved here. But it even goes past that. It’s the sudden feeling you’re being watched from barely out of sight. And at the same time, a crushing loneliness in that feeling. I pop a few more pills. Of course, I’m not being watched. There’s no one else here. If you think you’re being rather clever, figuring this out, oh-no-someone’s-been-in-the-house-with-you-all-along, I was most certainly the only one here. Anyway, this was about the time I found the note. If it was this Drewson, what is he talking about? Who does he want back? What is his need? Do I even want to know the answer to any of these? Insatiable curiosity will ensure I do, personal preference notwithstanding. Putting it all to the back of my mind, I chop up steak for dinner. I like to think of myself as a fairly accomplished chef, particularly where matters of slicing and/or dicing are concerned. I once worked a sushi bar, as a side job to pay the bills, and was quite proud of my ability to launch various morsels into the air and sever them in two with one fell swipe, like you see in commercials. Until the day my knife slipped and nearly skewered a customer’s eyeball. Maybe I’m not quite as proficient as I thought… I grab the bottle of pills and take a few. I don’t really like thinking about that time in my life.

I’m digging through my drawer later, that same drawer, when I stumble upon another discovery. Instead of a clue, it only deepens my mystery. A USB stick is secured to the very back of the board. I carefully remove it, and spend a few minutes simply gawking at my find, my inner curiosity again sparring with my better senses. I think, this will perhaps answer some questions about the note, and hopefully clear up my imaginations conjuring brought on by its conclusion’s implications. As per your previous assumptions, I couldn’t be farther from the truth. I secure the stick in its dock. View files. Two folders: “Reminders” and “Media”. Reminders is empty, media contains one subfolder: “Vids”. I open the folder. Two more: “memories” and “triggers”. Memories is empty. I open triggers. I’m confronted with one video file: shotinthedark.wmv. It’s 0:40 long. I press play.

Before I continue, if you’ll permit me one aside to validate the severity of this. I’m a massive horror movie fan, and I like them brutal. The more blood and guts, the better. I like truly graphic, heart wrenching stuff, and I very rarely squirm at it. Three seconds into shotinthedark.wmv and I rushed over the trash can to puke what felt like my very soul out. The scene I’m immediately confronted with was a man on a chair wearing nothing but an undershirt and briefs. There is a single light source on the chair, but I can faintly make out a figure in the background. Then, without a word, the man’s brains are ejected out his face, accompanied with a thunderous bang. Bone and cartilage spew forth in the foreground. Nearly black red sludge runs down his white undershirt, accompanied with brain matter that had just been crackling with life, likely flooded by fear, but life. I don’t have too much time to process anymore; I’m preoccupied with regurgitating my expertly made steak into the wastebasket. I think, it must be fake, but I know it’s not. I’ve got to tell someone about this, I think, the police, someone. Yeah, I’ll talk to the cops. Then, over my subsiding retching, I hear a familiar voice utter “Are you sorry now?” in the tone of a disappointed parent talking to their disobedient toddler. Something in that voice is chilling. Something… I return my gaze to the computer screen, where the barely visible figure now stands in full view, smiling.

I recognize the smile too.

It’s me, smiling back at myself, gripping a smoking sawed off.

The computer screen goes black. My head spins. I lie down.

youngsterjose42,1,,5,1rge20,,1,"He woke up in the morning like every other day. Yet this day was different; Jordan was going back to school after being expelled last year. He was caught with drugs and his school wanted nothing to do with it. He moved, now resides in york, Pennsylvania and now goes to William Penn High. He moved to a house which was quite old and just had some renovations a while back. The rent was quite cheap so his mother said ""why not?"". I was one of Jordan's first friends, since moving to york he told me things about that house really strange things. He soon moved away a little after I moved away so I have no idea where he is now. If any of you happen to live in york I'm talking about the old burned down house on market street across the street from the kindergarten/daycare. This story takes place about 2 years before the house burned down. 

A month since school started and about two weeks since I started talking to Jordan he invited me over to his house. Jordan said ""cmon dude come and stay the night my moms gone and im pretty sure wont give a shit"". So I thought why not I haven't spent the night at a friends house in a while ""yea sure ill spend the night man"". We went around town skated for a while, went to McDonald's with a few other friends then it came around 10 or maybe 11 everyone was ready to go home and i was ready to just go to a place and chill, play video games, and maybe eat some more. We got to his place, sat down in the living room, and lit up a blunt. Playing grand auto 3, high off our asses, we ordered some pizza. We ate and everything was fine till I felt like heading over to the bathroom. As soon as I opened the door I notice under the sink there was like a small cabinet and the doors slammed shut. I was high so I didn't really questioned it much. I used the bathroom and then as I exit I suddenly hear a giggle coming from under the sink. A child's giggle, as if there was a kid under the sink playing hide'n'seek or something. Again I did not question it because I was high and didn't really wanna bother finding out what made the noise. Jordan passed out on the couch, I went to his room and tried to sleep on his bed. I remember waking up around four in the morning hearing footsteps and a child giggling I'm pretty sure it was a little boy. I couldn't really tell his age but he was young; I would guess around six or seven. He was running around the house and he stopped at the door I did not see him, I only ever got to see his outline. He said "" I'm really happy I got more friends to play with now"". Suddenly after that he vanished faster than I could blink. I didn't sleep for the rest of the night. I had goosebumps for a good 30 to 45 minutes. Eventually I  calmed myself down by eating pizza and watching TV.",Hide 'N' seek,6,nosleep
amandaandbrooke,0,,3,1rgdaq,,0,"One night in early 2012, me and some friends were over at my house having a sleep over. We were watching Toy Story 3 in my downstairs, and we have 2 pillars downstairs to support our house and the framing on a the one behind the couch is loose, so sometimes it snags on clothes and makes a loud noise when it hits the pillar. So, we were close to the end of the movie, and we heard the loose framing hit it like someone pulled it away from the pillar. We all automatically stopped and looked at each other for about a minute, then we got up and ran to my room. We had to go past the pillar to get to my room so it snagged on my blanket and made the snapping noise again, which made everyone go faster. The rest of the night, we all kept hearing footsteps walking around like they were looking for something. It hasn't happened again since that night.",Just a normal night,3,nosleep
Mindlesssavage,4,,8,1rhawv,,0,"I have a Where's Wally book. Well, had. Why? I'll tell you.
So I was just searching for Wally at night like I usually do, and I heard a noise.
It was sort of a scratching noise, scratching with a walking cane maybe.
I went to investigate. I went out of my room and...
Nothing.
Maybe it was just me. I went back to my bedroom door. I saw something written on really drippy red paint.
It said ""Find me if you can"". I thought it was just my little brother Mike painting on the walls again. ""Where was Mike anyway?"", I thought. Then I remembered he was outside playing with our pet dog Molly. ( Don't ask me why he was playing in the dark, because I have no idea).
I went inside my room. That's when I saw it. The book was lying on the ground open. I picked it up. This is what the title said:
""yllaW s'erehW"" Now THIS was weird. I also saw the same Wally picture except his eyes were gone and blood was dripping from them.
It was possessed, I thought. I ran outside to bury it, and I stepped on something. It sounded like it was glass because I heard it shatter.
I looked down.
A pair of broken, black rimmed glasses. I ignored it and ran even faster than before.
I ran to my dog Molly's kennel. I always feel safe when she's with me.
She was whining in the corner. That was typical, though. But wasn't she playing with Mike? I shouted out, ""Mike! Mike! Can you hear me?""
No replies.
I ran to the middle of the yard to bury the book.
I stepped in another thing. It was squishy, and slimy.
I looked down.
Blood. Blood and guts.
And Mike.
Lying on the ground.
Stomach open.
With a walking cane through his heart.
I wanted to cry, but then I saw a little Post-It note on the cane.
A poem.
This is what it said:
""I can run, and I can hide.
Tear you apart from the inside.
Waiting in the darkness, with my cane.
Used to be for children, now insane.
Red and white, in the grey fog.
Running around with my little pet dog.
With my girlfriend Wenda, with her camera,
And an old man with a white beard.
The prisoner who escaped from jail, murdering people with no fail.
That's my gang, with no doubt.
When you're in with me, there's no way out.""
This was way too bad to just BURY. We had to set it on FIRE. Or RIP IT APART. Just destroy it in whatever way I could.
So now in my backyard, a grave for Mike, some burnt and ripped pages, shattered glasses, and a walking cane.
And to this day, I never read another Where's Wally book again.
And every night, I still hear the sound of a scratching walking cane against my bedroom door.
THE END.

kimmiekissies,13,,29,1rgt5c,,122,"I never even met him, I didn't know his name or face. I was, blissfully unaware, of his very existence.

 I will never know why, or when it started. I'm glad for that I guess. I moved into my very small apartment in February last year. My landlord, Olivia, was a sweet older woman who would cook to much and bring me much appreciated leftovers. She was great to me, even after telling her my problem. I'm antisocial, but she didn't mind renting to a reclusive young girl who reminded her of her daughter.

 Every few weeks she would knock on my door then leave, letting me know she was leaving something for me. I loved that. Not even my family would cook so well. The next morning I wash and leave her empty containers outside my door and by an hour or so she would take them back again. My other neighbors seemed fine, but I never talked or visited with them.

 I work from home so anytime I ever was forced to go out I rushed out and into my apartment avoiding an, uncomfortable situation. I loved living alone, it was everything I hoped for. I could just, breathe. By April though, I started noticing things were not right. They were moving, or plain disappearing. I was convinced it was just anxiety caused by my new medication and the move, another side affect was it would make me so drowsy. Since I hated seeing the doctor I just dealt.

 I took naps during the day now and eventually stopped caring. Until one incident doubled my paranoia, Olivia brought me some sort of greek tossed salad and dressing for lunch one day and I enjoyed it with my friend netflix. I fell asleep in the middle of Portlandia, and woke up that evening at 5pm. Per usual, what was not usual was my bedding on the opposite side of me was disturbed. I only sleep on the right side. Always. Even more it felt.. *warm.* My first thought was I must have rolled around a lot, but I knew it was to odd to dismiss. 

I got up and searched my apartment gripping my phone with 911 typed in. Nothing else was disturbed, everything was exactly like it should be. I let it go, for the next few weeks everything was normal pardon the occasional misplaced shoe or drawn back shower curtain. I thought about telling someone, my parents, maybe Olivia, but if it's not life or death I am not reaching out to anyone. 

I wasn't scared, I was nervous, maybe a little stubborn.. But I stayed. I am not letting some stupid anxiety ruin my lovely lonely world.
 May came and It was getting worse. My panties, toothbrush, hell even my food was being misplaced. Every time I woke up there was this strange odor in the air. I finally realized this won't go away by ignoring it. I called my mom and begged to come stay a few days, when I got home I told them everything. Saying it out loud solidified any creepy suspicions. 

That weekend my dad went to my apartment and what was found was true horror. Written all over that walls: ""COME BACK"" ""BABY PLEASE"" He ran out and called the police. There was no one living in my apartment but someone definitely had access besides me. 
The investigation revealed a man, Henry, the son of my landlord Olivia, was in a projected relationship with me.

 They showed me his confession on tape. He admitted coming into my apartment every night and everyday with his mother's extra key. He claims we were in love and he had my permission. He drugged his mother's food she left out for me causing my drowsiness and falling asleep so he could come in and watch me sleep, touch my hair, kiss my shoulder. The leftovers I had in the fridge were tested and confirmed.
 I was absolutely, horrified and disgusted. A man, I never knew existed, collected my drain hair, clothes, and trash and practically lived in my apartment for *four months.*

Thanks to everyone for your responses, I have taken a lot of your advice.
I'll just give you all a quick update on what happened after I posted yesterday. She ended up having a nap after sitting in front of the TV for a few hours. I was going to walk our dog, Zeus, but I decided to wait until she woke up just in case she woke up and was confused.


She woke up after a couple of hours and was.....well. Happy. Really, really happy. Almost manic. She woke up full of beans, and smiling like a maniac. I was initially relieved. I asked would she like to come for a walk with Zeus and I and she happily agreed. We set off for our normal walk, and she was extremely energetic, bounding off in front of Zeus and I. Zeus is a Labrador, and although he is a big boy, he's still a pup. We usually just meander along on these walks while he sniffs at everything along the way. But she set a cracking pace and Zeus and I struggled to keep up. 


We got up to this park where we usually let him off his lead for a while as we're trying to train him to not run off on us and to be sociable. It's always been a real task getting him back on the leash though, he never ever comes when he's called. Anyway, we let him off, and he's running around and smelling everything and peeing on anything that stands still long enough. My wife, she's picking flowers and sniffing them, and singing. She gets on the swings at the park and I push her for a bit, as she sings under her breath. I was feeling quite content at this point. Figured she must have just been over tired.


She's swinging vigourously when all of a sudden she comes to a dead halt. She yells, in an almost unfamiliar, masculine voice, ""Zeus! Here!"" and points in front of her feet.


I stood in disbelief as I watched Zeus, the most disobedient rascal of a dog I know, solemnly trot over to where she's pointing, sit in front of her, and stare up into her face. They both sat there for a split second, very still, looking at each other. I picked my jaw up off the floor and asked her ""Um..what the hell! How did you manage that!"" and that seemed to break both their concentration and Zeus shot off like a bat out of hell again, and she started swinging again - ""Oh"" she said, ""I used my mind to call out to him...it's something new I learned..""
She seemed kind of sheepish about it to be honest. I pressed her for more details, but the more questions I asked the more defensive she got. She knows I don't believe that for a second. I'm just happy that Zeus is finally starting to be trained. That's really the only explanation. I asked her to do it again but she refused, so I think we both know it was a fluke.


The rest of the afternoon was....nice. Kind of odd. It's like there's something that's amiss. Like when you walk into your messy bedroom and you can tell that *something* is not how it should be but you can't pin point what.


We talked a bit about the seminar. She said that it was very intense. The days were very long. She said that the premise of the seminar is to get to the root of any emotional upset, to explore the root causes for what's going on in your life. I asked if any hypnosis was used, as suggested by you guys, and she said no. They talked a lot, and were assigned to small groups, and encouraged to open up and explore their ""inner beings"". She said she felt a lot better since attending.
Still, something was not quite right. For instance, we were talking about my sister who lives in another state, and how she had recently got a new job. A few minutes later, my phone rang and it was her. I picked it up and said ""Emma! Speak of the devil..."" and my wife smashed me up the side of the head, causing me to drop the phone and shouted ""Emma is NOT the devil!! How could you say that!!! Emma is NOT THE DEVIL!!"" I told Emma I would call her back and tried to get my wife to calm down. She was very upset at what I had said. She sort of went silent again, and was very still. She seemed rather annoyed at me, but by this point, I was nearing exhaustion myself, so I let her be.

She fell asleep early, about 8pm, on the couch. I covered her with a blanket, and noticed that her eyes are kind of half opened..... I used to have a friend who slept like that at school and I've never noticed it before, I think that in my state of hyper vigilance, I am being overly perceptive of small details.
 
I read more of my original post, and all your comments, and decided to step outside and call our therapist, just to find out more about the seminar, as I knew she was there assisting.

I walked out onto our back porch and lit a cigarette and rang her. She answered on my first ring. What she said has really weirded me out. Only because although she gave me a lot of information, she has raised many more questions, as well as answered them.
 
She said these seminars are more like interactive workshops run by a man named Brian and his wife Linda, who are both self-appointed ""psychotherapists"". She said that there are psychologists such as herself on stand by to assist because sometimes when people are in such a vulnerable state, they may need assistance. She said she has referred a lot of her client's to attend these workshops and has found them to be helpful in most cases.
 
Basically, the course is about discovering your inner self, and using different methods to connect to your inner voice, to find out what the cause of your worries are. She said that it is incredibly demanding and intense. Each session goes for 14 hours with only an hour break. During these sessions, many different activities and topics are explored, including, regression. Apparently Brian does this 3 hour session on the second last day, where he gets everyone to meditate, and be still, and he regresses them back to childhood, or even, in some extreme cases, past lives. Our therapist said, it was so intense that she had to fight from being regressed herself. She did make comment that she had been concerned initially about how my wife would handle that, but that she seemed ""brighter, had a clarity about her"" after this experience. They discussed what my wife had gone back to, in her mind, and the therapist was happy that it hadn't caused her any great distress, but reminded me she couldn't discuss the specifics. She said when she wakes tomorrow I could gently try and open the lines of communication with her and she may explain her ""experience"".
 
I told her about my wife's strange behaviour. She said it is normal to be a little out of sorts after one of these sessions, but nothing major. I don't know if it's just me, but I could sense a tiny bit of alarm in her voice.... I don't know, maybe I imagined it. She said to call her if there's any further problems.
 
I hung up, and as I was putting out my cigarette, I turned to go inside and my wife's standing there staring at me. I jump and say ""Jesus Christ honey you scared me!"" and she replied ""Not as fucking much as I'm going to scare you.""
 
Ummm ok. I had to physically turn her and direct her into the house. In the moonlight she almost looked like a stranger to me. Her long blonde hair was hanging in her face, and her face was fixed in this awful scowl. I figured she must still be pissed at me from before. I put her to bed and she goes back to sleep.
 
And, well, that's where she is now.... she was supposed to be off work today too, but I was meant to go back to my job. But when my alarm went off, I just had this weird feeling that I should stick around and make sure she was ok. I rang in sick for work, and I'm just doing some household jobs, waiting to see if she's better when she wakes up, and googling what regression means, and what these intense emotional exercises can do to someone. Still nothing that convincing though. I dont know. Maybe I'm *too* skeptical. I just don't believe this crap.

The whole thing sounds a bit stupid to me, if I'm honest. But I have to say, it has caused some kind of change in my wife. She is very extreme in her emotions at the moment, and I'm worried, because we both have to go back to work tomorrow, and her work environment is very proper. She is always a perfect employee, and very dedicated to her work. I can't help but feel concerned that she might wake up tomorrow and still be in this....mood. Do you guys know anything about this ""regression""....is it the same as hypnosis? She was adamant she wasn't hypnotised, but it sounds like it to me!!



EDIT: Ok now I'm getting really freaked out. I went to check on her and she was talking and singing her sleep. I can't quit work out what song she's singing I've never heard it before. But she's saying something about being someone called Azara or something??? It's really fucking unnerving it doesn't even sound like her. Ill try and get a recording and see if you guys can shed some light. 


EDIT TWO: Ok I managed to record a bit of it...she's singing but I don't know what, has anyone heard this before????????? Ignore the TV in the background I was watching it in the lounge room to drown her out, and it was really unnerving when I turned it off and all I could hear was her. I'm kind freaked out now, I'll admit it. [Here it is](http://soundcloud.com/user165636719/a0ynmqy5tete/s-jECMW)",UPDATE!!! Need some advice.

floydnimrod,21,,25,1rhxtb,,113,"I'd just come from church for some reason. I'm not sure why I'd gone into the church, but it was the weirdest service I'd ever been too. Everybody was there. It was a packed house. Rich people, poor people, criminals, middle class folk. It was all people who didn't normally go to church. I looked into the coat room as I walked in, and some guy was snorting cocaine on this little counter top. Right in a church. I was like, what the hell? I've never see that.

I sat in a pew, and looked up. There was no minister. They were just playing a movie of an old church service on the screen. Some little old lady was playing a hymn on an organ, and the minister was applauding her. She seemed happy. But the audience was restless, not really paying attention, not sitting down, just kind of wandering around, talking to everybody. 

And then I saw a woman I used to know, someone I worked with years ago. I went to sit down next to her, and she sort of jumped on my lap and hugged me, saying she was so glad to see me. I wasn't sure if she was sad, or drunk, or terrified, or just lonely, but she whispered in my ear, offering me sex, saying she's always wanted me, ever since she'd known me. I sort of pushed her off my lap, thinking this was hardly the place for that kind of cheap pick-up. And then I got up and walked out. There wasn't really a church service going on anyway, I don't even think it was Sunday.

And then for some reason, I was in a car with this old lady. I don't even know who it was, or why I was with her. She was old like my grandma Freddie, but it wasn't her. We were driving down the street. She was driving too slow because she was kind of lost. I don't think I was in Winnipeg I was on a large street, almost the size of Portage with several lanes. But they all seemed to be deserted, like very early on a Sunday morning. I'm not sure if it was early in the morning or near sunset, but the sun was low in the sky. I think it was late in the day. The streets were mostly clear though.

The lady pulled over and for some reason she got out of the car. I think she was going to ask somebody for directions. I looked at the GPS thing she had on her dashboard, and suddenly the direction went all fuzzy and scrambled, like the satellite was confused, or just no longer there. And then the whole sky got this weird greenish tint to it for about ten seconds. It basically turned green instead of blue, but only for a moment, and then it was back to normal. Everybody stopped and looked up.

I was still in the car, but I leaned forward and looked out the window. The sun was over in the west, low in the sky. And I saw what looked like a second moon fly over the sky in a direction that was diagonal to the sun's normal path. It was huge. And my stomach got queasy for a moment. It made your stomach sick because it was so big, it actually pulled on you with its own gravity, like the moon pulls on the tides, but much bigger, and everything inside you just got tugged around.

But it went straight across the sky, without hitting. When I realized how close it was, though, I knew it was gonna hit somewhere, probably on the other side of the world. The gravity of the earth pulled it in, and it sling-shotted around to the other side somewhere. I jumped out of the car and grabbed the old lady's arm.

""Come on! We have to find shelter! It's gonna hit!"" 

We just abandoned the car in the street, and I dragged her toward a nearby fire station, or hydro office, or whatever it was. I'm not sure which it was, but there were large utility trucks, with lifts on them. It was also deserted for some reason, except for two guys loading one of the trucks. We banged on the doors, but it was locked up. We ran from door to door trying to get in, but everything was locked. 

And then I felt a great rumble under my feet. It nearly knocked me down. I've never been in an earthquake, so I don't know what it's like, but it felt like the entire planet shivered. Car alarms started going off in every direction and I heard a weird sound like gravel tumbling down a hillside, except there were no hills. I think it was pieces falling off houses in all directions. We were able to stay on our feet though. 

A few moments later, the sky in the north went dark. If I assume the sun was setting in the west, and the meteor or asteroid or whatever flew over the sky in a north-west to south-east direction, then it was north the black came from. And I mean the entire sky. Like a wall of blackness, smoke and ash suddenly filling the view from the ground to the upper atmosphere, from west to east as far as you could see, in one huge wall of black cloud. And it was coming toward us. Well, sort of going towards everyone, everywhere, I guess. It came over the horizon like an charging army, fast and steady, advancing.

""It hit on the other side of the world somewhere! Come on! we have to get indoors! We won't be able to breathe!""

The air started turning yellow. Ash started raining down, and bits of rock and debris from the blast, where ever it hit. I took a deep breath and held it as I was running. I could already smell a weird burning rock smell, like sulphur, like burnt matches, but more metallic. 

Me and the lady finally got into some doors, but it was just a little foyer. We ran in and shut the doors behind us. The inside doors were locked. But it was somewhere to hide. There was a fire alarm. I pulled it, not really knowing why I was bothering. But I was sort of in a panic and not thinking straight. The sign said, In Case of Emergency, so I pulled it. The alarm went off, and we looked out the window. The yellow air turned brown, and then dark red. Then everything went black. The black cloud fell over the whole sky with a clattering rumble that sounded like it was raining gravel instead of water. And all light went out of the world.

The world as we knew it was over. Even if we survived, life as we know it would never be the same. We'd be set back 10,000 years, reduced to hunter gatherers again, living out of caves. If we survived the impact that is. I honestly don't think anybody would have survived the shockwave. Something with that much gravity hitting the earth would pretty much end the story for everybody.

Of course, that's when I woke up.",I just dreamed of the apocalypse. I probably won't sleep for a few days now.,138,nosleep
Charlies_friend,20,,9,1rhapg,,79,"A friend of mine posted a story here not too long ago, and he was pretty well received by your wonderful community, so I decided to create an account to share mine.


When I was a little girl, about nine years old, my family purchased a small ranch in western Kansas. My father had just gotten out of the Army, and I suppose after seven years of trotting around the world, and spending two of those years in active combat zones, my dad just wanted to go somewhere the world would leave him alone. He couldn't have found a better location for this purpose; anyone who's ever followed Interstate 70 westward through that area knows, there isn't much between Topeka and Denver.

I still remember the day we (my mom, dad, older sister and I) moved into that old ranch house. It had been built in the early 1900's, and being something of a history buff, I was pretty excited to live in a house that had stood through prohibition, the depression, both world wars, and everything since. The house itself sat at the bottom of a small incline from the main road, backed literally into a hill. This setup meant the back half of the home sat underground, buried in the hillside. Outside the house was a little grassy yard area, and across this yard was an old barn. We didn't have any horses, but my dad held a particular love for classic cars, and he turned that barn into an amateur autoshop where he worked refurbishing old cars from the junk yard in his spare time.

My sister and I were given seperate but adjoining rooms upstairs, while my parents took the master bedroom (oddly) on the first floor. My sister and I's rooms opened onto a sort of landing that looked out over the living room and kitchen, and the stairs led down from there.

It was only our second or third night in the house, that I began to notice some strange things occurring. I was unable to sleep one night, and I laid awake in bed long after I heard my parents and sister go to bed. The house was incredibly quiet, both from being in the middle of a very isolated area, and by virtue of being half buried. Just as I was reaching the half-sleep state...........SLAM! I heard a door downstairs slam shut. At first I tried convincing myself I had just dreamed it, but I couldn't make myself believe that. And the next thing I heard chilled me to my core. I heard footsteps coming up the stairway. I could tell from the sound that the individual must be wearing shoes, so it probably wasn't my parents coming up to check on me. I heard the steps reach the top of the stairs, and then begin down the landing. I was frozen with fear when I heard them arrive outside my door, pause for a moment, and then continue on. When the stranger was apparently in front of my sisters room, he paused again, and again he continued. He reached the far end of the landing, and then turned around and came back the way he came. He continued for what seemed like an eternity, pacing around outside my sister and I's rooms. I finally worked up some nine-year-old courage and crawled to the door. I could still hear footsteps coming from just outside. I waited until he was moving away from me, and I was between him and the stairs, planning on making a mad dash for my parents room when his back was turned. I barely cracked open the door and looked out, and saw....nothing. The footsteps had stopped, and the whole house was empty, and still. I was confused, and afraid, but even then I knew if I ran to my parents they would think I was nuts. So I slid a chair in front of my door and crept into bed. A minute later the footsteps started again, back and forth, all along the landing. Eventually, they lulled me to sleep. 

I didn't mention the noises that night to anyone, fearful of my parents thinking I was a whacko, and of being made fun of by my sister. But, over the next few weeks, everyone in my family began to notice strange happenings on our ranch. Objects moved on their own. Small things would disappear for days, only to be returned exactly where they'd gone missing from. It was what I guess you'd call typical poltergeist activity; nothing harmful or malevolent, just noises here and there and odds and ends moving around. And practically every night I heard those footsteps outside my room. 

My family eventually began referring to this entity as ""Charlie"". He seemed to be a harmless ghost, and sometimes downright helpful. Occasionally my parents would wake early in the morning for work, only to find a freshly brewed pot of coffee waiting in the kitchen. The coffee maker had no automatic timer. Sometimes when one of us had misplaced something, like car keys or the like, we'd search the house frantically only to turn around and find what we'd been searching for laying on the ground behind us. And sometimes Charlie would slam a door, or walk around loudly, or turn a sink on, seemingly just to let us know he was there. And always, those footsteps at night.

Charlie always seemed particularly active in my dad's auto shop. My dad would occasionally find car parts he'd been working on had been tinkered with, despite the fact that he was the only one who ever went in there. Sometimes tools would go missing, only to be returned a short time later. Once my dad came in from his shop one evening as white as a sheet. When we asked what was wrong he just said ""Charlie was walking around out there........Jesus, I thought you all were just hearing things!"". I wasn't sure why Charlie loved that shop so much, but incidentally, that was where I caught my first sight of him. It was a Saturday, and my Dad was hard at work putting together an old Chevy Fleetline. My mom mad him a sandwich as a working lunch, and asked me to take it to him. I eased open the barn door, and saw my dad seated at his work bench, his back to me. And I saw another man, next to the car, also out of my dad's field of vision. He was about 5'8"", with dark hair and eyes. He was dressed in what looked like typical 1930's clothing; black slacks, a pinstripe vest over a grey work shirt, and topped off by a brown ""paper boy"" hat, cocked to one side. He looked right at me for a second, a big, mischievous grin on his face, and then he simply disappeared. I didn't even realized I was still holding my dad's sandwich and continued to stare at the spot Charlie had stood until my dad snapped me back to reality.

So passed the next few months. My family was happy on our little haunted ranch, Charlie seemed happy enough to share the space with us, and life was good. And his nightly vigil outside my room began to seem almost comforting. One night in late November, however, I learned just how utterly terrifying Charlie could be.

My dad had some kind of dinner event for work in Topeka, almost two hours away, and since my Sister was almost 16 by then, and there was virtually no crime in our rural area, my parents figured we would do fine by ourselves until they returned the next morning. Of course, to my sister and I, it meant we could stay up as late as we wanted, watch scary movies, all the kid stuff you can't do with your parents around. At around midnight, I was in my Sister's room with her watching some movie on her TV, when we heard a loud CRASH from the living room. My first thought was that it was Charlie, playing another prank, by this felt different somehow. Charlie's noises were simply little bumps to remind you he was home. But this noise sounded violent, and angry. Before I could really react, we heard another loud crash, and another. My sister cautiously peeked out of her door, and down into the living room. I swear I saw her go white. She began trembling, and her hand covered her mouth. I peeked around her to see what she saw, and felt y blood run cold. We could just barely see two men, outside our from door. One of them was kicking it in. As we watched, a final smash from this man caused the door jam to give out, and they both entered our home, shining long flashlights all over. My sister and I crawled under her bed, and held each other tight. This was easily the most terrified I have ever felt. 

But as the two men began to go through the living room, another loud crash came from the kitchen. One of the cabinets had opened and slammed shut; a favorite trick of Charlie's. The man who seemed to be leading the show shined his flashlight into the kitchen and shouted ""Is there anyone in here?!?? If you are, you better come out now!! We will find you, and we will FUCK you up!!!!"". My sister and I had to cover our mouths to keep from screaming out loud. At the man's words though, Charlie apparently got angry. We heard another loud crash and a skittering of metal on the floor, as one of our silverware drawers apparently threw itself across the room. I heard one of the men say ""What.......the FUCK?!?!"". And then Charlie decided he was do e fucking around. All at once, every door, window, and cabinet in our home began opening and closing violently, and loudly. Small objects all over the house began to fling themselves into walls, across the floor, even at the intruders. At this point, the one in charge just yelled ""FUCK this"" and turned and ran out, his buddy close behind.

As soon as the men were out of the door, everything stopped, and the house was again silent. It was a long, long time before either my sister or myself finally worked up the courage to move. She had left her cell phone downstairs, and and she needed it to call the police and our parents. She began slowly creeping downstairs to get it, and since there was no way in hell I was being left alone, I followed. As we got to the bottom, I looked into the kitchen, and for just a moment, Charlie was standing there, exactly as I saw him before, with the same grin on his face. A moment later, he was gone.

The police arrived shortly, and my parents not far behind. The cops determined that the disorder in the home was caused by the robbers ransacking the place for valuables, and they must have been scared off by a passing car. Lucky for us. My sister and I didn't even try to tell them what really happened, and within thirty minutes, both men were caught, still fleeing. 

After that night, hearing Charlie's walk around my floor gave me a serene sense of security every night. When he played his little pranks, I would always look for him. And every now and then I would catch just a glimpse of him and smile.

Several years later, when I was a junior in high school, I was working on a school report at the local library. The topic was the history of our town, and I wanted to see if the library had any old news clippings that mentioned my family's ranch. I typed our address on the search bar, and the first result stopped me dead in my tracks. The date of the old article was July 17, 1936, and at the top was a picture of a man, about 5'8"", with dark hair and eyes. It was, unmistakably, Charlie. The title of the article read ""Local Man Murdered While Defending Daughter"". It seems the man we called Charlie was actually named Brian Davis. He had lived alone in the ranch with his only child, a daughter, after losing his wife to a bad case of the Flu. On the night of July 15, the article said, Mr. Davis was returning home from his job as an auto mechanic in town. When he pulled up to the house, he found the door had been forced open. He ran inside, and found a man on top of his daughter. The girl was sobbing, her dress had been ripped open, and the attacker held a knife to her throat. In a moment of sheer instinct, Mr. Davis threw himself at the intruder, tackling him of his daughter, and as he held the attacker, Mr. Davis yelled for the girl to run to the neighbors and call the police. The girl made it the mile and a half to the closest neighbor, who promptly called the sheriff. When deputies arrived, they were able to apprehend the attacker, who had been beaten half to death. Unfortunately, he had stabbed Mr. Davis three times in the chest. Brian Davis died right on our kitchen floor.",Charlie,88,nosleep

childrenofsamhain,9,,5,1rhdoj,,36,"My friend Jaime purchased a new home about six years ago when his wife was pregnant with their first child. Until recently, he lived there with his wife Claire and their two daughters, Sarah and Emily. Sarah is now five years old and Emily is three. Within the first two years living in the house, Jaime said that he never experienced anything out of the ordinary. It wasn't until his daughter Sarah was around two years old, that he started to notice she talked to herself. Jamie thought nothing of it, she was just learning to talk and he figured she was just entertaining herself. 

One afternoon when Claire was out at the grocery store, Jaime overheard his daughter in the upstairs hallway, whispering and giggling. Curious, he asked, ""Sweetie, who are you talking to?"" Sarah replied, 

""The woman standing in the hallway"".

""Is she your imaginary friend?""

""I guess."" 

Amused, he went upstairs to find her staring blankly at a wall, whispering quietly. ""What's your friends name?"" he asked her. 

""Her name is Helen Mary"", she said. 

""And what are you two whispering about?"" 

Sarah looked at him and paused before she piped ""I'm not supposed to tell you."" 

Suddenly the front door opened downstairs, and they heard Claire come through the door. Sarah rushed down the stairs to greet her. Jaime didn't think about that again for a few weeks. 

Over time, the two noticed that Sarah's interactions with ""Helen Mary"" became more frequent, but they attributed this to the fact that they had just given her the news that she was going to be a big sister. 

About two weeks before Claire gave birth to Emily, Jaime was at home alone with Sarah. He heard her playing upstairs, chatting away with her imaginary friend, when suddenly he heard glass breaking. He ran upstairs as quickly as possible to find his daughter standing in the hallway, holding a hammer. She was staring up at the wall of family pictures that were now smashed to pieces. There was glass everywhere. Jaime picked his daughter up and carried her down the stairs. He told her to stay put as he returned to the upstairs hallway to clean up the shattered fragments of their family portraits. When he returned to the living room, he asked her directly, ""Sweetie, why would you smash all of our family pictures?"" 

She looked at him, ""Helen Mary told me to do it.""

When Claire returned home that evening from her girls night with friends, Jaime told her about the incident. The crept up the stairs so as not to wake their daughter, so Claire could view the damage with her own eyes. She gasped silently at the sight. 

When they returned downstairs to the kitchen, they started to discuss possible explanations for her behavior. Suddenly, the color ran out of Claire's face and she looked at Jaime. ""There's no way she could have done that alone.""

""What?""

""There is no way she could have smashed all of those pictures by herself.""

Jaime was confused, ""I told you, I caught her with the hammer. She told me that she did it.""

But it wasn't until his wife said it aloud that it dawned on him, ""But… some of those pictures are almost five feet off the ground. How could she have reached those?""

His mind was racing, ""She must have moved a chair or something.""

She was adamant, ""There are no chairs upstairs that she is strong enough to move without you hearing it, and you would have seen her carry one upstairs, right?""

Jaime was silent. He didn't have an answer. 

They went to bed that night without any answers. The following morning their daughter had little recollection of smashing the pictures and Jamie wrote it off as sleepwalking. Though he didn't have much time to think about it, as two weeks later his second little girl was born.

Emily was two years old in the summer of 2012, and one afternoon, when Claire was at home alone with the girls, she heard Emily alone upstairs, whispering. She called up to her, ""Who you talking to, kiddo?""

""The woman standing in the hallway.""

Claire thought that her Sarah must have told her about her imaginary friend, and that she was simply trying to emulate her big sister. Then she spoke again.

""She doesn't like you, Mommy""

""Why doesn't she like me?"" Claire responded, surprised. 

""I don't know."" 

Suddenly her daughter came bounding down the stairs as if nothing had happened. Even though both Jaime and Claire both found this slightly creepy, nothing about the situation ever felt threatening or malevolent. Until one night last month.

Jaime had put the kids to sleep around eight o'clock in the evening and he and Claire had got into bed soon after. Exhausted, Jaime and his wife fell asleep extremely quickly. Jaime was awoken by the sound of screaming. He was disoriented and had no idea what time it was, but he could tell that it was his wife screaming right next to him. He turned to see what was wrong and saw it. His 3 year old daughter Emily, standing beside the bed, with a hammer in her hand. Blood poured from Claire's forehead. Jamie jumped out of bed and grabbed the hammer out of his daughters hand. He turned to his wife. She had stopped screaming now, and Jaime grabbed a towel from the bathroom and wiped the blood away from her face. She was going to be alright, but she did have a deep cut to her forehead. 

Jaime picked up his daughter and carried her out of the room. He went and checked on Sarah, who had awoken to the screaming but was clearly unharmed. He told her that everything was alright and closed her door. He was standing alone with his daughter in the upstairs hallway, and he finally asked her, ""Emily, why would you hurt Mommy?""

""She told me to, Daddy.""

""Who told you to?"" 

""The woman standing right behind you. She told me to hurt Mommy"" And then Jaime felt a chill run up his spine when his daughter leaned into his ear and whispered, ""And she told me to hurt you too, Daddy.""

darkened-thoughts,1,,5,1rg1d9,,21,"I want to turn around. It's three in the morning, the lights are off, and I'm bathed in the luminescent glow of this old monitor. I just kept clicking through - that was my greatest vice. I could have let it rest. But with every story, my blood pumped faster, my breath came quicker.

There's nothing like a good scare. Every rush of adrenaline left me wanting more. That next fix got harder to find, took longer. I grew discerning, opinionated, a veteran of the genre. Soon I was writing for myself; days spent clacking the keys and nights spent in marathon research sessions. I was a crow picking through the maggots and gore for that next juicy nibble. I was a man consumed, and like a junkie messiah I wanted to share my high with others.

Everything has a basis in reality. Think about it. Why do the holy men think your soul needs saving? Why do children fear the dark? What's there in the unknown deep, what is it that averts our gaze?

That's why I'm here now. That's why I'm writing to you. I come bringing the ultimate high. All you have to do is believe. Believe in me, in the hellish nightmares that chase after you in your sleep, in the stories you read and the movies you watch. When you believe, the hunt is on.

My stomach is in knots, every heartbeat a hammer blow against my sternum. My hands are shaking. My breath comes in stecatto bursts. I can't hold on much longer. The anticipation is mounting, building to orgasmic frenzy. I found it, the ultimate high. Or rather, it found me. All I had to do was believe. All I have to do is turn around.

My faith is sure, and I know it with every fiber in my being:

It's here. And it hates me.",I couldn't stop.,26,nosleep
lamented_dreams,4,,9,1rgqu8,,13,"I love the dark. I really do.

I don't mean going gothic and pagan and all that, but I do like the dark. I like to sit in my room for hours on end into the night watching videos, researching diseases and the supernatural, and writing stories.

Anyways, I've recently come across a quote from a game called 'Knock Knock'. And let me say, it's utterly terrifying for not just the player, but the watcher too. There's nothing but this overwhelming sense of dread throughout all of the game.

""You thought about it, and now, it is inside."" —Knock Knock

That quote has seemed to have seeped into my brain. Multiple broken theories have been written down in my notebooks and journals and I've seemed to have come to a conclusion.

The mind isn't wrong. Reality is. And, with that, imagination often holds more truth than what we accept.

Think about it. When you were a small child, things like fairytales and horror stories were much more real to your innocent mind. In fact, there is a theory that children have a sixth sense that they gradually lose as they progress into adulthood. Also when you were a child, you thought of monsters and what they would do to you as well as how terrifying they looked.

And when you thought about these things, you didn't want to turn around. Why? Because what if for the slightest moment, you were right? All those lone yellow eyes in the darkness, the sinking feeling of being watched, out of all those times, what if this was the moment you were right? Or moreover what if you were always right and they just didn't want you to know... until now.

Because honestly, we used to think the Earth was flat. Then that it had the sun revolving around us. So what makes us so absolutely sure that we are the only ones out there now?

This is my theory.

I shared with one of my colleagues about two weeks ago and five days later she called me screaming about how there was something in her house. The police showed up and they took her to the hospital. She had three slash marks down her back, resembling that of almost a wolf. She also had multiple bruises on her neck. They said there was no signs of break in and the wrecking of the house was most likely the result of her having a psychotic episode.

This could be true, but I don't like how unsettlingly close it is to when I told her about my theory.

""You thought about it, and now, it is inside.""

This is the phrase that keeps me from imagining creatures. When I went to the hospital to visit her she was curled up in the bed, shaking with her knees up as close to her chest as possible. When I asked her what happened she wouldn't tell me who, only that 'it' got inside. She just had this empty look in her eyes, something very uncommon since she was always so hyper and nice. When I asked how she just said, ""I thought about it, and it came in.""

Keep in mind I never told her about the quote at all. Those were her own words. So this is more than unsettling for me. It may be possible that this 'theory' spooked her enough for all of this to happen, but I don't like the coincidences.

What do you think?",The Theory,22,nosleep
angelcot,3,,2,1rh91p,,11,"Hi /r/nosleep. This is kind of embarrassing to post, but here's a few stories of things that happened to me as a kid. I was a pretty anxious kid, and a lot of weird stuff happened to me. Nothing paranormal, though There's more than just these stories, but I thought I'd at least start with this.

Ever since I was a kid, I've been afraid of windows. That's not saying much, though. I was afraid of just about everything else, too. But growing up, my house was full of big windows. Floor-to-ceiling windows in the family room, two sliding glass doors in the dining room, a huge window that looked out from our kitchen into the front yard. My mom never bought curtains or blinds for any of the windows other than the ones in our bedrooms because she'd get depressed if it were too dark in our house. 

I had light blue curtains in my bedroom that my grandmother sewed for me since my windows were an irregular size. Every night I would pull them closed, then pin them down to the walls with a pushpin so that I wasn't able to see even a sliver of the outside out of the corner of my eye. My bedroom window looked out on the backyard. I remember being so irritated whenever someone would accidentally leave the back porch light on. The light would shine through my light blue curtains and play shadows on my wall. I'd cover my head with my pillow so that I could fall asleep without worrying if I would be able to make out the silhouette of someone trying to peer through my curtains, still pinned to the wall. 

From a young age, I had problems with insomnia. My mom struggled with it, too. I remember my dad telling me stories of when my parents were still married, when my mom would wake him up just to talk because she still wasn't asleep at 4, 5, 6 in the morning. I remembered feeling envious that I didn't have someone to do that to. I listened to books on tape at bedtime to fill the silence. Sometimes I would sneak into my brothers' room and lay on their floor, hoping for sleep to come. Being uncomfortably aware of how their curtains weren't drawn completely closed. 

When I was 10, I moved from my room- which overlooked the backyard- to my brothers' room, and my brothers separated and took over my room, and the office. My new room was at the front of the house. If my curtains were open, someone could easily look in as they walked up the path to our front door. During the day, I didn't mind it. I could watch for my friends or packages from the postman. At night, it made me so anxious I began to develop a habit of vomiting nightly. My mom was sympathetic, but didn't know what to do about it. A year later, I was moved back into my old room, and my older brother moved back into his. I stopped vomiting every night. 

I feel like I had a reason for being so afraid of windows. One night- I must have been about 6 or 7- I was up late, as usual, listening to *Ralph S. Mouse* on tape for the billionth time. I had emptied the glass of water that my mom had gotten for me, so I got up to refill it. I was already wary of windows, so I kept my head down on my way to the kitchen. I'd often see things out of the corner of my eye; something moving, or something that *could* have been the shadow of a human, but would later try to convince myself it was nothing.

Even with my head down, something outside caught my attention. A car, parked in front of my house. I lived at the very bottom of a cul-de-sac, so we didn't have a lot of people drive down our street at night and stop to reorient themselves. The car had its headlights on, and I could tell there was someone sitting in the car. Looking at my house. I don't know if they were looking at me, but my paranoia told me they were. I stood there for a long time, forgetting about my glass of water. I didn't look away. Paralyzed, until my mom came in the kitchen. She'd seen my door was open and wondered what I was doing up. When she noticed the car in front of our house, she quieted and gently pushed me out of the kitchen and back to my bedroom. I noticed the car started to drive away as I was ushered away from the window. 

This staring contest with the person in the car in front of my house happened twice more, although over the course of a few months. Once, they switched their headlights off, and stayed for what might have been 45 minutes. Although my memory might be exaggerating. I still don't understand why I was so afraid of seeing someone in my bedroom window, but how I could fearlessly stare out of the kitchen window at the person in the parked car. Maybe I felt less vulnerable in the kitchen. Maybe I was comforted by the fact that they were so far away. Even though the walk from where they parked was just a few seconds from my front door and the window I was looking out. 

The third and final time I saw the car, the person got out of their car. They were tall, and I could see them standing on the other side of their car but I still wasn't able to make out their face. When they started to walk around their car and- I assume- towards my front door, I scurried back to my bed. 

I never liked sleepovers as a kid. Staying over at a friends house meant laying awake on their floor for hours with nothing to listen to but the sound of their calm breathing. Nothing to look at except for the sliver of their window I could see from behind their curtains. Having friends at my house was just as stressful. Usually we'd sleep in the family room, because it had a TV in it. It also had the floor-to-ceiling windows. Usually I would sneak off to my own room after my friends had fallen asleep, so that I could sleep peacefully away from those big windows. 

When I was about 8 years old, I was having a sleepover with a few of my friends. It was after 10, so my friends were starting to fall asleep. I knew I still had *at least* two or three more hours of being wide awake. I was laying on the couch, swaddled in my blanket. The TV was still on, but I'd turned the volume down for my sleeping friends to something barely audible. Usually, I tried to keep my eyes away from the windows. But that night my cat caught my attention, meowing and hissing at something outside. I cautiously looked out the window, worried about what my cat might have seen out there. Just another cat, skittering in front of the window. Relieved, I looked out at my dark backyard. Was that it? 

There was a man in my backyard, walking around. Even with the distance, I distinctly remember he was frowning. He had his hands in his pockets. I did not know this man. 

I woke up one of my friends, whispering in her ear and telling her there was somebody in the backyard. She stirred quickly, obviously alarmed, and looked outside. She saw him too. I'm not sure if he felt our little eyes on him or what, but he turned to face us. Neither of us made a move; not to lay back down and pretend we were asleep, not even to look at each other, or look away. 

There were a pair of french doors that lead to the back patio in my family room, right in the middle of the wall of windows. The man walked up to the doors and tapped on one of the small window panes. The handle of what looked to be a heavy flashlight hung out of the pocket of his sweatshirt. He smiled at us. Not a deranged smile, not a smile that looked too wide for his face. Just a calm, warm smile. He mouthed something and pointed at the doorknob. I was never very good at reading lips. I stared straight ahead, unblinking, not responding. I could hear my friends' breath, heavy and shaking. 

He spoke, the sound of his voice muffled through the glass, ""Open the door."" A pause, he knit his eyebrows together like he was concerned. ""I'm visiting your parent. Let me in."" 

My heart was beating out of my chest. I was a paranoid enough little kid to not fall for this line. I mustered up every ounce of courage I had in my little, anxious, 8-year-old body, and got up off the couch. For a moment, they man at the door looked relieved. I ran out of the room, screaming for my mom. I could hear my friend call out at me that he was leaving, and the rest of my friends starting to stir. I told my mom what had happened. She turned on all the outside lights and called the police while my step-dad looked out every window for any signs of the man. All of the girls at my sleepover had their moms come over and pick them up. I cried, and stayed the night in my parents bed, although I'm pretty sure I didn't sleep.

In my mom's bathroom, there was a big window that looked out at the sideyard. The glass was distorted, though, so my mom never bothered putting a curtain over it. You couldn't see into the bathroom if you were just passing by the window. If you stopped to press your face against the glass, you could see in or out, but everyone in the house knew not to do that when they were in the sideyard. I remember my mom shrieking one night, running out of the bathroom, saying she'd seen something through the glass. A rat, climbing up the windowsill and staring into the bathroom.

I always liked my mom's shower more than the one in my bathroom. My bathroom didn't have a fan in it, so the whole bathroom would get uncomfortably humid. The shower curtain in my bathroom reminded me too much of that scene from *Psycho*, too, and I'd always shower with the shower curtain pulled open, and I'd get water all over the floor. My mom's shower had a glass door that I liked much more, even if there was that big window I could see clearly from the shower. 

Once when I was 12, I was showering in my mom's bathroom because my parents were out of town. My brothers were home, but were playing video games in the family room. I would keep my head down when I showered in my mom's bathroom. Even if the window's glass was hard to see through, it was still a window, and the shower was the most vulnerable place I could think of being looked at. Every once and a while, I would glance up to quell my growing anxiety. To tell myself *nothing was out there*. 

Cautiously, I looked up to satisfy my anxiety. *Nothing was out there*, I told myself. My gaze met the window. There was a dark figure pressed up against the glass. Through the foggy, wet shower door, I couldn't see anything. All I know was that it was *somebody*. I screamed, and ducked down past the tiles so that whoever was out there, they couldn't see me. A few moments later, I heard my brothers knocking at the door, both of them calling my name and asking if I was ok. I pulled a towel from outside the shower and wrapped myself up before I stood up. Whoever was out there was gone. 

A few weeks later, my friends and I were playing in the side yard. There was a huge tree out there that we liked to climb in, and pretend we were characters from X-Men or Sonic. My friend called my attention to something in the grass, over by the window of my mom's bathroom. A polaroid picture of the distorted glass of the window it lay in front of.  ",Windows.,13,nosleep
Spudz_OCD,6,,6,1rgcw5,,9,"Hey redditors, im new at this so excuse my writing skills

All through my life ive had things happen that i just couldn't explain, i've told a couple of friends but even they don't know what to say.

My story begins when i was a kid about the age of six or seven, we lived in a poor neighbourhood in southern Ireland and had a shithole of a house, i lived in a room with my two brothers (kyle[8-9  at the time], and Dylan[3-4]) and had been for a couple of years so i was used to sharing a room. The first incident occurred after about a year in the house (our street was built on a graveyard) and happenned in our room. it was an ordinary day before it happenned, woke up, ate breakfast, went to school, nothing out of the ordinary. however when i came home from school that day, there was something odd about the house, I couldn't quite tell what it was but it just felt wrong. But being a kid at the time, i thought nothing of it and carried on with my daily routine. after dinner and a shower my mom put us to bed. After my mom turned out the lights and left the room, i began to drift off to sleep. after about an hour and a half of hazy dreams, i was suddenly awoken by a loud crashing sound, kind of like if you dropped a frying pan, i quiclky jumped up my pillow and sat upright in bed. I looked over to Dylan's bed at the other side of the room, he ws still asleep. I began to question if i had actually heard it at all. feeling curious i checked if kyle was awake (we had a bunk-bed, Kyle was on top) as i was climbing the four step ladder, i felt a burst of cold air rush from kyles bed and immediately dropped to the ground, waking up Kyle.
""what are you doing"", he said.
""i heard a noise so i wanted to see if--""
""--sshh"", he stopped me mid sentance, and focused his gaze to the back of the room; The look on his face will be forever imprinted into my mind. I turned around gingerly and what i saw was scary enough to make me cringe even today. I saw a scrawny black figure hunched over Dylan, who was still asleep. But this figure was definately not human; It was at least 7 feet tall, it's head was overpoweringly large compared to it's beyond anorexic body. It's fingers were 6-7 inches long minimum. From what i saw it wore nothing, but it very well could have, as it was late at night and i was still half asleep. Then the image that will haunt me forever; It, whatever it was, turned towards me and Kyle. It just stood there, staring at us for what felt like forever, it then jumped towards us and simply vanished into thin air right before it hit me. I was left lying on the floor and Kyle was wondering if what we had just seen was actually real. I looked at him and back to Dylan's bed, whatever it as, when it jumped it jumped with enough force to push the blanket off the end of Dylan's bed. I looked back towards Kyle, who was already asleep again, and decided to go back to sleep myself, not knowing if what we'd seen that night was just a figment of our imagination or not.
When i woke up the following morning i hesitantly asked my mom and sister if they'd seen or heard anything last night..they didn't. So i questioned kyle about it and he said that he had no idea what i was on about, he had no memory of seeing or hearing anything, he didnt even remember me falling off the bunk ladder.
To this day i still cant quite figure out what happened that night.

My second experience was only four or five years ago, a couple of months after moving to Australia. We were living in a pretty old house at the time so it was a bit creaky and what not. it was a pretty average day when it happenned;I was 14 and I was once again in bed at the time. I was sharing a room with Dylan (10) at the time. Kyle (16) was in a room across the hallway, Jenny (12) was the next door down and my parent's room was at the end of the hallway. It was about 11-12 at night, and we were all just about asleep. My mom and step-father at the time were out exploring the wild clubs of Surfers Paradise, so it ws just us kids. I was almost asleep when i heard slight footsteps coming from the kithcen area. I wondered who it was considering we were all in bed, so i opened the door to check. I headed towards the kitchen, once i reached the living room (about half-way to kitchen from my room) i could see into the kitchen, i slowly emerged from the wall; no one there..weird, i thought, so i headed back to my room, but as soon as i turned around Kyle was standing right in front of me with a knife. I jumped quicker than i'd ever jumped before. Kyle then laughed his head off and went back to bed. I did the same without the laughing.. I was back in my room, now lying in bed realising im too awake to go back to sleep. i just lay there for about five minutes staring at the ceiling untill i heard more footsteps in the kitchen. I called out
""Kyle, go to bed, idiot""
""i am you fuckwit"", he said as he emerged from his room half asleep
""well then who's upstairs?"" i asked
""It's probably just a possum in the attic or something don't worry""
I regretfully closed the door and went back to bed. But as soon as i did, loud heavy footsteps started making their way down the hallway, along with heavy thumping on the walls, they were getting closer and a hell of a lot louder, It sounded like someone was trying to stomp and bash rats out of the walls and floor. It kept coming closer and increasing in volume until it was at the point where it was like gunshots right outside my room. It then stomped right outside my door and my door swung open with extreme noise and force and standing at the door was, i shit you not, the same tall, black scrawny fucked up figure that i saw years ago. I practically shat myself. It stood there for a couple of seconds, but if felts like hours, then started stomping and sprinted towards my moms room. I don't know why but i instantly got up and ran towards the door and looked towards my moms room; nothing there, it vanished again. I dropped to the ground in shock, just as Kyle open his door and screamed ""WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT"" 
""It's back"" ,i said
""What's back?""
""the thing i saw hunched over Dylan""
I stayed up all night that night not wanting to sleep knowing that thing followed us to Australia

My most recent encounter with our old friend was last year. We'd moved into an old complex of houses that had a bit of a history in the crime side of things. We'd been living there for about 6 months and my friend from primary school, Jordan, was now living in the complex too. It was around 5PM and it was just Jordan Kyle and I in the house. I was playing my i-pod at the time, Kyle was in the kitchen and Jordan was behind me. Kyle decided to pick up a coin and throw it at an unsuspecting Jordan, who surprisingly, caught it, and returned fire. but then Jordan moved a little backwards and Kyle threw it further and harder. The coin flew through the air right past my head and stopped rigth in front of Jordans face, IT LITERALLY STOPPED IN MID AIR, it stood still in front of his face for less than a second and then was propelled back towards Kyle with nearly twice the force. We all just stood there speechless, not knowing if that had really just happened. Later that day we were showing a friend what had happened  and were back in the Kitchen messing around with coins to see if it would happen again. When suddenly a ball flew through the air at Kyle, like it had been thrown with force from the stairs leading upstairs. For the second time that day we were utterly speechless and had no idea what to do.
That night after Jordan had left and Kyle went to bed, i was making a late night snack. Dylan was in the living room watching TV and there was nobody else in the house. I finished making the snack and was about to head into the living room when in the corner of my eye, I saw the figure that i had seen twice before glide upstairs; same height, same scrawniness, same long fingers only this time it was a little misty, like a shadow, and it looked right into my eyes as it vanished upstairs.
I am still wondering what the actual fuck that figure is, all i know is that my mother has become a claire-voyant.I know for a fact that there is definately going to be a lot more of this thing which i have nicknamed ""the figure"".

For the time being i will keep an eye out for my little follower and if i see him/her again i will not hesitate to report the time, date, and details of the situation and of course reddit the fuck out of it.
for now redditors, i bid you farewell

the_dark_half,5,,1,1rhyj5,,7,"You know that feeling when you’re all alone and hear your name whispered? Maybe you’ve walked into a room only to suddenly feel a sudden temperature drop? Had things go missing only to re-appear in odd places? Maybe you’re like me and you lie in bed at night, only to feel like someone stroking your hair but when you become fully conscious and turn around, nothing. 
Think you walk through a cobweb or hair falls on your arms or neck and brushes against your skin delicately, tickling you? You check and nothing was there? I’m sure your parents tell you it’s nothing from a young age; perhaps because they themselves are deluded enough to believe that it is their imagination. They probably deep down fear it’s a ghost or apparition. Even they couldn’t know how much worse it really is.  Stop deluding yourself. It’s not a cobweb. It’s not the wind. It’s not nothing. It’s something far more sinister, an insidious force which slowly grows stronger the more you feed it your fear and attention. 

Some of you, I’m sure, will be fortunate enough only to feel cold spots and occasionally hear creaks and footsteps in your house. It’s such a common occurrence that people barely notice it and if they do, it’s the spookiest part of a generic horror movie, because those suits in Hollywood haven’t seen what these creatures are really capable of. If you believe in the paranormal you may experience the whispers of what I can only loosely refer to as their ‘voices’. I’m sure not many of you have had the misfortune to awaken to them standing over your bed, taking the forms of whatever creatures or person your subconscious fears most because it’s real form is so terrifying you’d probably die instantly or become paralysed with fear, a zombie-esque state you’ll never awaken from-and that would ruin their fun too early. If you don’t die instantly, seeing their faces will make your eyes bleed; hearing their voices unrestrained will shatter your ear drums and I’ve heard of cases where insides have been liquefied, skin melting and bleeding seeping out of every pore.

The first time I awoke to one in my room with me, it was after I’d given the footsteps and banging on the walls attention. I had thought it was cool, I even bought a stupid Ouija board and told them it was okay for them to try and talk to me. I had been lying in bed after a night of drinking so I passed off the initial taunts and laughs as nothing more than my intoxicated imagination, until my door slowly opened and in came one large hairy leg, followed by more spindly legs, followed by many eyes and two huge fucking fangs. Yep, a giant spider, bigger than a horse came into my room. I tried to scream, but that just resulted with me hyperventilating, then vomiting all over the floor. It strode in, all beady eyes on me and as it slinked atop my bed I tried to pathetically crawl away, but it held me down with its two front legs, piercing into the flesh of my shoulders as I whimpered like a small animal about to be devoured-which I was.  I felt the sharp pain of its fangs tear through my skin and inject me with poison that made my blood burn. I lay in bed, delirious, desperate, muttering for help. My ears were greeted with a cacophony of voices, screaming horrible things that were so foul that before that night had been unimaginable to me. I passed out shortly after, from fear, blood loss or the venom and awoke a few days later, believing to have all been a dream. I clung to that hope until I stepped outside my bedroom door and found dozens of small animals, birds mostly, wrapped up in what appeared to be spider’s webs, discoloured, drained of their blood and insides. All dead. I ran to the bathroom to throw up and caught sight of myself, dried blood caked on my body and face, puncture wounds all over me and strands of silky web still wrapped around my breasts, my stomach, my legs and in my hair. 

The second night I encountered one of them, they took the form of my uncle. I lived with my uncle for nearly 5 years while my father was travelling almost every week for business. I know my father loved me and desperately needed the money that he had to work from dawn until way after the sun set and had to leave me for long periods. He didn’t know what his brother did to me. That night as I became increasingly aware of the noises in my apartment and the feelings of someone touching me and whispering in my ear, I rolled over to see my uncle grinning at me. He crawled onto the bed and tied me down. I struggled, but when I did he beat me with his belt, like he had started doing when I was eight years old. I fought as hard as I could, tears burning my eyes and sobbing uncontrollably, but he kept cutting away at my clothes with a pocket knife and telling me to be a good girl. The torture that night lasted for many hours, possibly days. I try not to remember it. I thought I had moved on from those childhood years and buried them a few years ago, when my uncle died. This was not the last time the monsters took on forms like this to break me. They’ve only grown stronger with every drop of blood, with every scream and with every hopeless sob I’ve given them.

Their true form will only appear to you in dreams at first because they get to torment you in ways that won’t instantaneously butcher you or drive you insane, yet; they like to take their time with their toys. The dreams for me started after those incidents. I have seen what those beings really look like and…just thinking about it is enough for me to start violently shaking, unable to stop retching. The other day I wasn’t careful and thought about one of them and a stranger had to hold me back as I unconsciously started walking in front of a train. In my dreams, it is pure hell as they have my undivided attention for hours and can do whatever they want to me without my body breaking and bending the way it would in the waking world, but it all feels real. 
Part of me stares at length of rope on my coffee table and considers leaving this torment…but what if when I die, I get sent to their realm, to be their plaything forever? 

It’s not just the occasional brush against my skin, the odd floor creak and the rare moment of ‘is someone calling my name?’ Now I feel them on me at all times, their rough, sharp skin cutting mine, scratching me, violating every single part of my body. Their voices scream and howl at me, maniacally taunting and laughing at my never-ending misery. Even when I shut my eyes, I still see them, their hideous beings beyond any words the human language has to describe them to you. 

Most of you think of those household noises and strange occurrences as the work of ghosts, of spirits. Yes, it is so comforting for humans to believe these presences are the souls of dead people who are just sad and wandering, isn’t it? You want to be able to talk to someone no longer alive; you open your mind and let them in. Don’t. What’s out there isn’t human, it isn’t some person with unfinished business, what’s out there wants you to think that, to get comfortable with inviting it in and letting yourself become aware of it. 

Did you just hear that faint noise outside your window, like a soft breeze carrying a faint whisper? That creak outside your room? That faint sensation on your flesh? I hope not, because now you know what’s really there and they’ve always known about you.",Don't give them attention.,8,nosleep
Rhapsodeyus,1,,0,1rgtyq,,8,"Some may recall a story I posted a few months back, about shadow-like figures who visited me on a mission for knowledge, and afterwards, disappeared like ghosts. For those who do not recall, the story is [Curious Visitors](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l4dv2/curious_visitors/).

If you have not read that, well, you probably haven't missed much, but it will help with the backstory for this one if you do read it.

Done reading? Good, let's continue.

This happened last night, Sunday, November 24th, 2013. I woke up at precisely 4:27 AM, and I know this because I watched my small digital alarm clock on my bedside table flip to 4:27 AM as my eyes opened. I also noticed that my lamp was off (I sleep with the light on for safety reasons, since living with cats can be hazardous). However, I could see my plain, black clock in a pale blueish light.

My brain clicked. ""My laptop is on. I must have left it on and the power went out, so it's running on battery."" Then I remembered, quite clearly, turning it off and closing it before going to bed. That's when I felt a weight at the end of my bed, sitting in front of my laptop.

I sat up, looked, and spotted a shadowy figure sitting in front of my laptop. The NoSleep submission form was up. I coughed, and said quietly, ""You could have asked."" Instead of, say, a sudden spin and a glare from Brarger, as I expected, my visitor vanished instantly.

I didn't expect that, and it startled me thoroughly. My previous visitors would never have been so rude, and certainly would have asked my permission to access my personal computer. I shifted, tossed the covers aside, and moved to the end of the bed, to read what it had written.

I now wish I hadn't.

The message ends there. I suppose I interrupted the agent and he fled.

Whether this is genuine or not, I cannot know. If it is a fake by a rogue agent, then its purpose is unclear, but it is certainly unsettling. If this is a prank, then it's impressively elaborate, yet in poor taste.

But if this is real... Then I'll be on my guard. But I have to wonder... What, or who, were they telling me not to trust?",Interrupted Warnings,8,nosleep
JUVIE_MAKER,2,,1,1rhq9j,,8,"I have a nose for things. No seriously, all my life I’ve had a very strong sense of smell and I don’t mean for the average person. I have an abnormally, freakishly, ridiculously, absurd sense of smell. It’s been that way since I was a kid. Here’s a prime example, when I was about four or five I used to visit my grandmother (god rest her soul) every month in Daytona Beach for the summer. My grandmother was notorious for making the best homemade cakes in the neighborhood. I would always leave my Gran’s house at least ten pounds heavier each summer after gorging myself on her delicious treats. One Saturday, after a day of playing outside (when kids used to play outside!) I instantly smelled the aroma of cake wafting through the air, but something was…..off. There was another smell lingering behind the cake scent. It was kinda tangy, bitter, sorta nutty …just all around unpleasant. Being so young, I couldn’t quite put my finger on what the smell was but I knew I didn’t like it. Then out comes my Gran from the kitchen with a big slice of her freshly made cake on a china plate. She passes the dining room table and spots me standing there with my nose crinkled up in disgust.

Gran:  What’s the matter baby? Come sit at the table and have a slice of cake.

Five year old me: I aint eating that cake, it smells funny!

(Let me just interject for a second.  Now if your family is old school like mine, you know that a child is to NEVER disrespect an elder’s cooking! Especially if that elder is a family member, you just don’t do it! That is unless you want a black eye, ribs broken, missing teeth… you get the picture.)

Gran: Girl, get your hind parts over here and eat this cake before I slap the hell out of you!!

Oh geez…there’s that tone. You know it, you know it well. That angry deep tone that resonates from parents when their truly pissed off. You know… that voice that scares the living shit out of you and gives you’re delicate child-like mind nightmares for a month (or your whole life). Yeah that’s what I was hearing right about then. But still I was adamant. I would not eat that damn cake. That smell! It was just too potent. Now, you might be thinking, what’s the big deal? Surely you’ve smelled worse things than that cake before, which is very true. At that point in my life I’d smelled worse things before (WAY WORSE) but I’d never been subjected to eat those things either. Also, the stench of that pastry….it was just… so very not right. I was only a child but I was still old enough to know right from wrong, and that cake was definitely wrong! Even at that very moment I could taste its bitterness in the back of my mouth. With every inhale it burned and tingled down my throat.

Gran: Come over here and take this plate now!

Okay at this point I knew I was in REAL trouble. Even if my grandmother didn’t kill me, I was pretty sure I was in for the ass whooping of my life! I slowly started to back away from Gran as she moved closer to me with that dreaded cake. Even as she inched towards me that smell seem too magnify. With every step she took it grew more and more intense! “Girl, you better take this cake!” she yelled holding the plate out in front of her. I turned to run but she quickly snatched up my arm before I could get away. “No!” I shouted feverishly trying to pull away from her grip, “I don’t want the cake, granny!!” but my pleas of desperation came to no avail. My grandmother started to tug me towards the kitchen table, her fingers angrily wrapped around my tiny forearm. Suddenly, she yanked me forward making my body jump about two feet in her direction, tilting my face towards hers. She looked down at me with an awful glare. Dark hollow eyes glowered down from Gran’s wrinkled sockets. Her once loving face was now rigid and stiff with a sadistic expression that I had by no means seen before. “You will eat this cake!” She shouted through gritted teeth. “Even if I have to shove it down your throat piece by piece!” 

I had never seen this side to my Gran before. My once sweet, devoted granny had turned into this vicious monster plucked straight out of my worst nightmares. My small frame quaked in fear and tears began to seep from my eyes. I had never known terror like this. My insides loosened and squirmed like jelly making the contents of my bladder empty and leak down my legs. To say I was afraid would be the understatement of the freakin decade! But you know what? There was something else I was more fearful of. Even as I pissed myself in sheer horror from the presence of my devil-like grandmother, there was still something more bloodcurdling, more utterly terrifying than her…that fucking cake! 

“NO!!!!!!!” echoed from my lips in a banshee scream and with all the strength I possessed I juggernauted into my grandmother. My body throttled into her torso head first making a loud solid grunt bellow from the old woman. Her arms flew in the air (letting me go in the same instance) and her vast body collapsed backwards before suddenly….CRACK!
The sound of my grandmother’s head crashing along the rim of her kitchen table splintered throughout the house. Gran thudded to the ground like a sack of potatoes and the plate with the cake she so firmly held onto shattered on the floor. I stared at her lifeless body as blood began to seep through her head and flow on the linoleum. I was still too little to know the true meaning of life and death but I did know for sure that red liquid was not suppose to be running out of her head like that. I bent down and looked into Gran’s half opened eyes. They weren’t black any more. They’d gone back to their normal brown again. Not really knowing what to do I just stared down at the gruesomeness of it all, watching the chunks of yellow cake absorb the blood until each piece was just as red. 

To make a long story short the police were eventually called. My Gran’s weekly bridge game was on that day and a couple of her elder counterparts found her body, and me sitting in a pool of piss and blood staring at it. Needless to say there were lots of screams. Oh, and you’re probably wondering what that smell was, right? I actually didn’t find out until I was well into my teens what exactly it was. I was pouring it into my foster parent’s coffee one morning when it finally hit me…Cyanide. From the smell of it, Gran probably couldn’t have used too much either. Maybe half a teaspoon, give or take; totally undetectable to the average person’s nose…but not to mine. “So that’s what that was, go figure”.  I remember thinking that to myself as I stirred the cyanide into two mugs. My foster parents passed away later on that day, I wish I could say I feel sadness over it but I really don’t.  I was more consumed with thoughts on why my grandmother was trying to kill me? Was it because of what I’d done to Oscar, her cute little Maltese? I mean, if I’d known the oven wasn’t a suitable place to put a dog I might have done things differently. I was only two at the time. Or perhaps it had something to do with what happened with Mommy…that really was unfortunate. I didn’t want to hurt her, but she was an obstacle that just had to be removed. 

But anyways, that’s neither here nor there. I’m an adult now and those days are long behind me. I’m actually on my way to my boyfriend’s…excuse me….ex-boyfriend’s apartment right now. I’m visiting him and that slut he cheated on me with. And guess what? They just had a baby, isn’t that the sweetest thing.  ",A nose for things...,9,nosleep
1234FUCK,7,,4,1rhjmk,,6,"So my uncle has always been into the paranormal and he got me into paranormal investigation, Or ghost hunting to simplify it a few years back. Well I go with him on a lot of them and we do it for free for people who think something paranormal is going on in their houses. I always saw it as a nice little hobby to do on the weekends to blow of some time and I always liked being scared. I mean that’s how I even know about this sub-reddit because I like reading it. And that’s one of the only reasons I knew about what had happened on my last investigation. 


	We got a call from a family out in the middle of the country saying they had begun hearing weird voices when they were each alone but the 16 year old son was the one who had it happen the most. I went through every scenario I could think on the way there, Something was legitimately going on that was paranormal, one of the kids was lying and was fucking with the rest of the family and other such things. Well when we got there we talked with the family and everyone seemed happy except the two children. The son was as I said earlier 16 and the girl was 14, they seemed uneasy looking off into corners and such. I took a note about it but didn’t dwell on it that much. We went around the house marking places we would put cameras and getting the lay out of the house. Once we finished that we went back to our van and started getting ready. After we set up all of our equipment we each got our POV (Point of view) cameras strapped on and started our investigation. My Uncle took the upstairs, our colleague took the first floor, And I went into the basement to do a little investigating of my own. 


I made my way downstairs and grabbed my Walky-talky and radioed my uncle asking if everyone was ready for me to hit the main light breaker. He gave me the go ahead and I flipped the little switch plunging the whole house into darkness I held up the other camera I had with me so I could have a camera move around freely ( plus it had a night vision setting so I could see where I was going.) Well I turned it on and walked slowly to the chair I had placed in the room so I could sit comfortably waiting for something to happen. And after an hour or so of me questioning the darkness.. It answered back.
My instincts kicked in and I put a call in on the radio for everyone to tell me where they were. And everyone was exactly where they said they were supposed to be. My heart froze in my throat from fear but excitement so I stood and asked who I was talking to and I heard a small wispy chuckle before it said softly “You know who I am.” I swallowed hard before continuing to walk around the room and asking questions. It stayed silent for a few questions before I asked why it was here. It chuckled again before I heard a small sound. Like a door knob jiggling and I turned towards it. My camera landed on a door knob sticking out from a sheet that I guess had covered it before. I walked towards it slowly pulling the sheet off to reveal a shabby door about waist height with peeling paint and scratch marks.  I put in a call on the radio telling my uncle and the others I had found something and for them to meet me in the basement. I got no answer back but I assumed they had gotten the message. My uncle did that a lot; he tended to get over excited with these things so I figured he was just trying to get here as fast as possible.  But the paranormal curiosity ran in the family so I reached down and grabbed the knob, it was warm as if someone had been holding it for a longtime. I steadied myself before twisting it and pushing it open. 


I looked through my camera screen as I walked into the door. The atmosphere around me seemed to change instantly, even though all the lights in the house was off it just seemed to be darker and colder in here the basement itself.  I looked around in the room through the screen until I saw a lone chair in the center of the room. I walked forward until I was right next to it and then began looking around more. I jumped a bit at the bright light on my screen until I noticed it was a mirror. It was bolted onto a beam  next to the chair and when I looked to the left I noticed the same thing. I thought it was really strange so I walked around the front of the chair and accidentally kicked something over.  It was loud and then I heard a sound of rushing water. My heart leapt into my throat as I looked down and around looking for the source until my camera came upon a metal bucket slightly rolling with water coming out. I also saw a candle and a small match book and that’s when it hit me. My whole body filled with fear as the realization flooded my head…. This was a “three kings” set up.


 I turned towards the door pointing the camera as I looked through it I saw the door slam and I stopped. My whole body froze from pure terror and it took me a few seconds before I let out a scream for help. After I stopped I heard the soft chuckle come from behind me in the darkness and I just stood there with my eyes closed shaking as I felt a soft breath on the back of my neck I heard a voice.. My voice whisper right into my ear. “ Do you know who I am now?” I stood there for a second before screaming again and then I heard the door bust open and I saw flash lights on me and my uncle asking what was wrong. I just ran from the room to the breaker box and flipped on all the lights. I then sank to the floor looking at him as he sat next to me and asked all that happened. I just held out my camera to him and he took it. Before he watched it he asked me why I didn’t call for back up and I looked at him before telling him that I did. He looked at our colleague before watching the recording.


 After that he asked me if we all went in together would I go back in. I nodded as long as we kept the lights on and we went in. and it was as I thought. It was a set up for “ The three kings.” I shuddered as I turned to my uncle asking if he knew what it was. He didn’t so I explained it to him and I pointed to the bucket “ and it has been used recently. The bucket was full of water. “ My uncle nodded to me and put a wrap on the investigation. We went back home and I have decided to type this up. Tomorrow we will be going and talking to the family about what happened and who had done the three kings in the house.  


I think the three kings set up has something to do with what has been happening at the house. I will update you all on what happens after we talk to them.

OsamaBinHiding,3,,1,1rhxdo,,6,"Last night was like every other night for me. Have dinner on my own in my small, yet cost flat and watch a little bit of TV. Around 9 or 10 o'clock, I start to crack on with some work as I had a university deadline in a couple days time. The minutes started going faster and before I knew it it was 12 o""clock. 

""Where did the time go?"" I thought. It had only felt like a few minutes. However, this was a normal occurrence for me. The world kind of, disappears when I get lost in a train of thought and for the life of me, I can't break out of it.

I had just remembered that I had a seminar early in the morning and suddenly thought ""Fuck, I better try and get some sleep"" 

See, I live in an old building that has been converted into flats in the suburbs of a major city. So it isn't uncommon to hear floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and all the walls are very thin so noises in the middle of the night just tend to go over my head. I wouldn't consider myself someone who doesn't get scared easily but when you're familiar with floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and branches tapping your window - you tend to grow some thick skin.

Last night wasn't like any other night in my flat though. 

As I mentioned earlier, I was alone. My flatmate - let's call him, Evan for the sake of the story, was away celebrating thanksgiving with his family but he's away a lot so I'm used to spending a long period of time on my own. My usual night routine of showering, brushing my teeth and cleaning the kitchen was over and I went into my room to finally rest my head for the night and that was when I first noticed something. My drawers were all pulled open. 

To most people, this is probably nothing - but for me it wasn't normal. I suffer from borderline OCD and everything, especially in my room needs to be in order and I remember waking up and everything was in order. I hadn't left my flat today either. 

""I'm too tired for this shit"" I thought and went to bed. 

It's weird though isn't it? That something like a mattress and a duvet can make you feel so safe, like nothing can hurt you. I remember being a child and I made sure none of my limbs were outside of my bed incase something grabbed me in the middle of the night. Such a feeble piece of furniture can make you feel so safe.

Well, not anymore for me. Last night I heard the usual creaking of the floorboards - no biggy, right? However, as I drew closer to conscientious, I realised that these creaking sounds weren't coming from the surrounding walls and neighbouring flats but they were coming from under my bed.

And that's when I felt the unmistakable sensation of a cold, coarse finger stroking mine over the side of my bed.

TaylorBonaseraSr,0,,2,1rhb2e,,5,"I can explain why I'm so afraid of mirrors, or anything that could reflect light, even a glass door. It's so difficult for me to talk about it sometimes, but other times I feel her pressing me on to tell as many people about her as possible. She broke my mirror the first time, just crashed right through the glass and shattered the glass into a literal hundred pieces. It was such a pain to have to clean all that up. I got at least five cuts. But she didn't care. At the very least she didn't laugh at me or yell at me to clean faster. At least she was nice enough to check herself for that. Anyway, I got my mirror replaced. She didn't break the bathroom mirror again, but she broke the great mirror in the hallway while she was running through it. I don't understand how she did it, it's pressed up right against the wall. She'd have to ram her body sideways. She didn't even have any visible cuts. She told me she was sorry, and that she would try not to do it again. I believed her, and she was true to her word. But soon enough, I hear the crashing again. But this time it's my door. The majority of my glass door has been smashed through, but the weird thing is that the hole is shaped like Quasimodo. No one lives here that has a body shaped like that. The other times I checked her she didn't have any cuts on her, but this time she was bleeding so much from every part of her body that she had to go to the hospital. I had to sit there and watch her, but she couldn't explain what had happened. When the doctor asked, neither could I, because I hadn't been there. It's strange how selective she is; she won't smash into anything except mirrors or glass-looking things. Anywhere there isn't this kind of stuff, nothing bad happens. She tells me that she feels so cold whenever she walks by something like that, and she gets an uncontrollable urge to destroy it. She talks to me about it so often I feel like I'm beginning to share the feeling.

It's starting to unnerve me, and I don't want to live with her anymore. But I can't break the joint liability contract. She told me to cover all the things in the house that could possibly create a reflection, so I did. But I find her desperately tearing off the covers when she thinks I'm not looking.

One day I'd had enough so I decided to take off one of the covers in my room. It couldn't hurt, just for a little while when she couldn't see. She wouldn't notice. But after a minute of reveling in my refreshed reflection, I saw her standing there. So close. She was so ugly. She copied my expression and mocked my horrified face. She followed me here, to my own room. I couldn't turn around. There was no point. I felt a pressure from her on my shoulders so great I couldn't keep a straight posture. She was laughing at me.

But I'd heard that laugh somewhere before. And I'd seen that face before too. It looked so much like my own. She must have heard my thoughts, because she said she told me to never look at her by means of a reflection. I couldn't stand the sight of her face anymore, it was so scary. It'd been such a long time since I'd spent so many minutes just staring at her. I had to take control. So I bashed the bedroom mirror in, balling my bare hands into fists and repeatedly thrashing until I could feel the glass cutting into my skin.

It'd been so long since I'd last done that. Now every time I look, I can see her, feel her, I see her staring at her...our...reflection, through my eyes.",My Blank Mirror,7,nosleep
SeaDweller7,2,,2,1rhilw,,4,"I go to a regular school, its kindergarten to year twelve, so its pretty big. But, my school is an old public school, and the principle is ancient. Me? I am in year twelve, and I’m graduating next year, and my friends said I should share this story with you guys. 

Ok, where to start? Well, at my school we have a pretty serious problem with bullies, and when I say serious I mean it. One year our school was even on the news, but it was pretty traumatic. When I was in year nine, there was this little girl in fifth grade, called Melody. Her and me sort of talked sometimes, as she was a new girl and I was her school buddy (to show her around and stuff) She was a sort of short, curly brown haired, blue eyed and geeky girl. Glasses and all of that stuff, so your stereotypical nerd. Which pretty much was what she was.

After I moved up in to Tenth grade it was pretty clear that she was being bullied. Instead of gossiping or playing with the other girls, she just sort of walked around the school... bouncing a tennis ball and wandering around the grounds of the school. 

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

Then, half way through the year, school was stopped. During lunch they lined us up and called our parents. Sent us home. They just said there was an accident. My mother and father lived in Melbourne and I lived with my uncle and aunty, and they’re pretty laid back and all ‘come home when you feel’ so I stayed at school.

I saw five year six girls with that sort of ‘we know nothing it wasn’t us we didn’t do anything’ look on their face before I saw an ambulance and a white body bag. Out of the end of the body bag stuck out locks of curly brown hair, and the always-screeching birds seemed to sing a sweet tune. A melody.

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

Last week we had a substitute teacher who started screaming at a girl who was outside bouncing her ball after the end of lunch bell had rung. She didn’t realise Melody wouldn’t listen. 

No one knew why the back stairs from German were out of bounds for two months, and why the German teacher quit. No one asked why those five girls we’re stared at my Melody’s sort of... ghost.

I pieced it together. A simple push, a simple tumble. A simple death.

No one cares, all the kids just skip past her, all the laughter swallows up her silence. 

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

It has been a little over a year since I last wrote - just over a year since the last nightmare.  I was foolish to think I was somehow cured, that, as Dr. Lough suggested, getting it out of my head and into a journal would help.

I read back over my last and only journal entry, as I tried to describe the nightmare.  It is so chaotic and scattered, yet I'm unable to find any other way to convey the details.  That is the terror of the dream at its core - utterly chaotic.  Jerking from one sensation to the next, the hesitant probing of my fingers as they cover the smooth flesh where my eyes should be, to the damp defeat in realizing those fingers have torn away the protective lids in confusion.  All of this, in layers of sleep - waking to the comfort of my mother's figure, only to then know it is just another stage of the dream playing out, with her eerie voice echoing through my body:

""You're connected now.""

Even now, in understanding that my last entry seemed to bleed out through the pages, I'm struggling to form coherent thoughts onto this paper.  Each detail seems to tie into the next, only to fall apart when I try to see the whole.  I wonder what type of clinical association Dr. Lough could make?  Is this what schizophrenia feels like?  I have no way to explain it.  It is as though there is a novelist's grand plot line swirling around my body in paper shreds and each time I reach out I can snatch only a sliver of a scene, unable to ever piece the parts into an understanding.  I'm fairly certain this entry, and perhaps any subsequent entries, will be just as erratic.  I just cannot force these thoughts together.

So much has changed in the last year, it is so hard to recall my state of mind the last time the nightmare came to me.  I have a son now, nearly 6 months old.  We must have just found out Rachel was pregnant around the time I last wrote.  Could that have been a factor in the nightmare returning after years of peace?  Was my mind so overwhelmed with the thought of being a father, the changes to my life, the responsibility, it somehow dredged that old horror back from my subconscious?  I can't help but think it must have played a role.  It has been a blur, so many other things seem to have fallen into place.  Though they are exciting, it seems predetermined, somehow rushed.

Over the last decade I have had a slight obsession with the home I grew up in.  I knew I would live there once again - returning it to ownership in my family - though I never anticipated it would happen so quickly.  Rachel's grandmother died, leaving her an inheritance that allowed us to leap forward several years in our plans together.  It was Christmas Day, the day she died - I guess her last gift to us.  Three months after my son was born, we were moving back into the mountains, back to the walls I had called home as a boy.  

One thing I feel for certain, this home is the source.  The nightmare started here, always took place here, was always fueled here.  I'm beginning to remember things, or have recurrent thoughts I have not had for nearly two decades.  It is as though these things are unlocked from muscle memory as I walk this house.

As a child I would reach the top of the second floor staircase, which opened onto a hallway, always with my head down staring at my feet.  Left, at the end of a long hallway was a guest room.  Large floor to ceiling windows would reflect back a warped view of the person looking down to them.  Right, across a short landing was my bedroom.  I had trained myself to never look left at night - as the small nightlight by my bedroom door would throw twisted shadows onto my reflection in the long guest room windows.  If I would look up, I would become stuck in fear with the reflection.  The windows seemed to pulse with my heartbeat, flexing my body larger then smaller in the glass.  My feet became rooted in place, the black of the windows and the emptiness behind them tunneling out for me.  The nightlight would flicker in then out, each time causing my shape to jump forward, as though I were being pulled down the hallway towards the darkness.  I never remembered breaking loose, turning and walking back to my bedroom and going to sleep.  I would wake up in my bed hours later, staring at my hands, inspecting for blood and knowing I just had the nightmare. 

I learned, I kept my head down and did not look to the left.

Our first night in the home, that muscle memory followed suit.  After turning off the main floor lights, I climbed the staircase.  My son was sleeping against my chest, his arms wrapped around my neck and shoulder.  My head was down as I crested the top step, turning to the right, towards my room which was now his.  As I neared the bedroom door, his forehead left my shoulder.  His back straightened and his arm peeled away from my neck.  I felt his arm extend straight back behind my head.  I didn't need to look at his eyes, I knew.  Those eyes followed his arm to his hand, reaching down the hallway to the windows.  The nightlight flickered as he let out a giggle.  I took the last step into his bedroom and shut the door.

Sunny day in Nevada. Families having lunch outside, fathers teaching their sons how to grill steak, playgrounds
filled with kids. Every year I plan a trip with my son. Nevada has really nice caves in it. When I was little,
my father always took me there and so did his father. I didn't want to break this chain. I told Jake, my son, about that
cave that I used to visit but I did not have enough time to take him there until now. He was still sleeping when
I stepped in his room.
""Honey wake up!"" Jake opened his little eyes and whispered:
""What?""

""We are going to see the cave I told you about!"" he instantly jumped out of his bed and become so excited that
I can't even tell about it. He got dressed and ran to have something to eat. About five minutes later he was screaming
from the garage door.
""Hurry up mom!""

One hour car ride. Not the longest one he ever had. He kept asking me about the place. I just smiled and told him to
be patient. As soon as I parked the car, he blasted out the door and ran to the back of the car to grab two flashlights. 
""You ready?"" I asked him. He obviously was so we started walking towards our destination.
It was dark in there. Darker than anywhere else. Flashlights on.  He just kept pushing forward. Sometimes I couldn't 
even catch up with that little kid. After a sharp left turn I saw him standing there. He found it. The biggest hall 
in the cave. Every wall was shining when the light of our flashlights reached them.
""Beautiful isn't it?""

""It is indeed!"" he answered. He turned his head towards me but it was only q light at a corner 
that he could see. He totally crapped himself. ""Mommy wait for me!"" He started running towards the light 
that he could see. It is a maze down there. - MOM! - he screamed.
""I'm here honey!"" He caught up with me. He just gasped there and started to be a bit relieved as he realized 
that he was not alone in that dark cave again.
""Hey calm down little boy! I'm not leaving you here!"" went closer to him and whispered:  ""Or am I ?

I've been having a lot of bad dreams for the past 3 weeks, but i think this one tops all of them. Anyhow, I dreamt that I lived with my boyfriend in a big house, it was night and we both were sleeping. Suddely i wake up, and I sit up in our bed. I'm fully aware that I'm sleepwalking but I can't stop myself, lay down again or do anything about my actions. I start walking out in a big hallway (this is where the main door is located), then I enter a smaller, much more narrow and dark hallway, and in the end is a small wardrobe-like room which is truly pitch black. This scared me a bit since I am afraid of the dark but I just keep walking, I don't even consider NOT to walk in to the wardrobe. So I find myself inside this pitch black tiny room and I close the door and I lock it. Once I have locked the door i just panic, I'm not afraid but I simply can't stop screaming, I remember the scream so well, it was a true scream of despair, I screamed at the top of my lungs but I still was not scared. I started to bang the door, the walls, everything while screaming and crying as hard as I could. Finally my boyfriend comes to the rescue and the door was open now, he just grabs me and tells me I was sleepwalking and I just said ""I know"" in the sternest voice. He's scared out of his life and crying and I just looks at him like he's crazy and then i just go back to bed like nothing happened.

ephique,0,,0,1rikrx,,4,"I grew up in a small town in Ohio with my mom, dad and big sister. We were a normal family, neither happy nor sad, somewhere in between. I was always interested in music as a kid so I spent most of my time playing piano, practicing guitar or trying my best to write my own songs. It was also some sort of medicine for me; it helped me drift away into my own world when my sister and my mom had disputes. You see, my sister was one of those rebellious teenagers at the time that had to have their own way or the rest of the world had to suffer their unfair ranting. I hated it; I hated hearing her yell at my poor mother.

During a lonesome walk home from school one day I got a call from my dad, making sure that I didn’t have any plans and telling me that I had to come home as fast as possible. My dad never called my cell phone unless he really wanted something so I knew right away something was up. I remember jogging most of the route home, since my dad sounded so serious. It gave me the creeps to say the least.

I jumped over the fence surrounding our villa and paced myself into our house. The kitchen was the first room you’d see upon entering and it was empty so I assumed they were in the living room upstairs. As I was making my way up the stairs I could hear my sister sobbing uncontrollably, something had definitely happened. My dad was standing up as my sister was sitting on the couch, he told me to sit down as well.

I was scared and curious at the same time. Dad and my sister never really spoke or had any arguments since my father didn’t bother caring too much about any of my sisters business, so I could figure out that this wasn’t about my sister. I remember sitting there in dead silence with the exception of my sister shedding tears and trying to keep her crying as quiet as possible. My dad was looking like he had no idea what to do or say, as if he didn’t know how to explain something to me.

Finally, after a long pause my dad made an introduction to whatever I thought this was about at the time. He said: “Your mother…” and then he needed to grasp some air, and he continued: “Your mother has passed away.”

I was eight years old and I couldn’t grasp that concept. I didn’t understand death, or that my mom was eternally gone. I just sat there as I was developing an irrational anger towards god-knows-what, I remember thinking how unfair this was. I do however forgive my dad for telling me so bluntly, he didn’t know what to do and he was in shock at the time.

My sister continued crying, she asked dad how mom died although it was obvious she didn’t actually care to know at that precise moment. She was just being desperate and no one could blame her. I thought it was my sisters fault when I was there, I thought that was why she was crying so much. I didn’t shed a single tear; I kept it all inside. Of course that didn’t mean this incident didn’t haunt me for years, I never stopped thinking about my mother. 

The aftermath of my mother’s death is what has been shaping my life the recent years. My sister was very weak emotionally and it basically drove her insane. My dad had to take her to an actual mental hospital. Something I didn’t even think existed when I was eight. This resulted in that I didn’t get to meet my sister very often, my dad kept telling me she was in a special school for students that wanted a challenge; but I overheard enough conversations to know where she really was. I guess my dad was trying to keep me out of it, and I didn’t blame him. 

I was guessing that my sister wasn’t doing very well at the hospital since we got to see her less and less as years went by, something that troubled me; I hated living in this big villa of ours with just my dad. It felt so dead, and my dad had been more kept to himself after mom died. We didn’t do anything, I literally spent all time at home in my room, making or playing music. Me and my dad didn’t even greet sometimes when I came home from school, it was depressing. My theory for his change in behavior has always been that he blamed himself for my mother’s death, something that I’m about to get into.

You are probably wondering how she died by now, and it’s a legit question to be asking. The best answer I could give you is that I don’t know. My dad has always told me she died of liver-failure but for some reason that has always sounded like a lie to me. It didn’t add up, my mom never had any problems with her liver before and she didn’t drink. I think it was something he made up when I was younger because he assumed I wasn’t mature enough to hear the truth. In addition to this, whenever I asked my dad about this matter he’d get heavily upset. Nowadays I never ask about my mom’s death, nor do I even bring up mom as a topic.

Years went by and I ended up being fourteen. It kept going like I just described, I spent most times in my room playing music as my dad did whatever he was doing on his own in the house. My dad did work, he had the night-time shift at a local bottle factory, I’m not joking, he actually made glass bottles for a living. He had higher ambitions but most of them got crushed when he and my mother got my sister, they had to move and dad basically had no other financial option than to quit the university he was attending at the time and get a quick and close job. You guessed it, the bottle factory.

I was riding my bike home late at night after spending the evening in the school library at one point when I was fourteen. My school was the type that had an after-school library that didn’t close till 11 pm. I didn’t need any of the books or supplies that the library offered; I just studied there sometimes since it felt less depressing than my father and our lonely villa. Either way, I hadn’t seen my sister for two years that night and I was starting to get the idea that I wouldn’t see her again for another two. 

When I arrived at the house the front door was open, “This is odd?” I thought. Upon closer examination I realized that someone had taken the spare key from its hidden spot underneath one of my mother’s old jars. It’s never smart to have a spare key hidden right next to the door, number one mistake people do when it comes to spare keys. It did look like whoever had taken it did suffer a struggle before finding it. The rug outside the door was all muffled up and there were scratches on the door, around the lock. I suspected we had been robbed so I pulled out my cell phone, ready to call the police. 

This is when I heard something coming from inside the house. I was dead scared to say the least, this could have been armed robbers or maybe something worse, I didn’t know. It sounded like someone was grinding furniture against the floor, trying to move it. It was so dark as well, I remember not seeing more than pitch black looking into the open door, technically if someone was in there they would have seen me because of the street lights. I started to slowly pace into the house, walking towards the noise. This is where I had to make a decision, was I going to suddenly turn on the lights in order to reveal whatever was in there or was I going to approach it in the dark? I picked the former. I was just going to switch the lights on when I could see someone strafe into the light coming in through the kitchen window. It was my sister, naked. My entire mindset had to change into a totally different way of dealing with the situation; it took me a good couple of seconds to assume she escaped the hospital. 

I switched on the lights in an instant. She had redecorated the entire kitchen, in the dark. Of course it all looked hideous and random; she didn’t know what the hell she was doing. I remember being in a slight discomfort, I had never seen my sister naked in my entire life. I also hadn’t seen her for a good couple of years at all. She didn’t look very comfortable either, she looked like she didn’t know who I was and was wondering what I was doing there.

I uttered “Linda?” out loud, that was her name. She didn’t respond, she just continued standing there looking at me. “Don’t you remember me, I’m your brother.” I still couldn’t get any feedback out of her; it was as if the wheel wasn’t spinning at all. I wasn’t sure what the protocol here was, not knowing the number to the mental institution or anything I figured I’d try to call dad, before I got to press the call button on my cell phone she uttered: “Don’t call dad.” This is when I realized she couldn’t be completely empty inside after all.

“You don’t want to call dad.” She continued.  I had no idea what to do, I assumed this was part of the reason she was in the mental hospital in the first place. Luckily my dad got home at that point, not coming from a finished shift at work. He had a good five hours at least left, I assumed the hospital had phoned him and told him about the situation. My father ran into the house as fast as he could.

This is when something I didn’t expect happened, he told me to leave. He pointed at the door as if I had no idea how to find my way out of my own house. I asked him where I was supposed to go, he told me to wait in his car. Judging from how serious my dad seemed I didn’t think twice about it, I ran out to the car. As I was sitting in the car I could see my sister walk past the kitchen window a couple of times, I remember how she made no effort to cover her breasts. I had no clue what the two of them were discussing, although I never saw my sister move her lips so I’m guessing my dad did most of the talking. 

After a couple of minutes my dad started to walk to the car, he joined me inside. I remember asking why he didn’t bring Linda with him, “Don’t call her that name!” he shouted in response. I was so confused at this point. Dad started the car and drove me to my only friend’s house; I didn’t see him very often though. I was a lone wolf growing up and I still was at this point, I didn’t really create any friendships. I remember sitting in the car as he ran up the steps to ring my friend’s doorbell, his mother opened in her night dress and looked confused. I assumed my dad made up some emergency story to cover what was going on in order to get me a place to stay overnight. I didn’t even know what was going on to be fair.

Whatever he told them worked, I got to spend the night at my friend’s place. Tim’s place, to be exact. It was pretty awkward I remember, I only saw Tim a couple of times a week and that was when we shared classes in Spanish. We got to be desk-mates because the teacher made up whom to sit next to each semester, so we weren’t very close. 

It was a Friday so there was no school the morning after; I guessed that made it easier for my dad, leaving him the freedom to pick me up whenever he wanted to. He did, but not before giving me enough time to fully experience the awkward breakfast conversations with Tim’s parents, both trying to justify me as Tim’s best friend. I don’t know. Tim didn’t have many friends I guess.

On the way home I asked my dad what was going on the night before and he basically stopped the car and stared at me, as if I was mocking him. I remember how desperate he looked, as if he had no fire left in his heart. He uttered the words: “Do you think I wanted any of this?” as he grabbed his hair in regret. “All I wanted was a normal family with no circumstances, and I’m not blaming you when I’m saying this because frankly you are the only sane member left in this livelihood of ours.” Is what came out of his mouth next. I tried to comfort him, telling him that he had done a good job raising me and what not; I really didn’t have a lot of cards in my deck at this point. I mean my dad was basically losing it.

When we got home he told me that he was sorry, and that I should go up to my room. I did go up to my room but I got to tell you; I was starting to get very anxious about my dad. I really wanted to know what the hell was going on. I spent that night recording some guitar sessions for a song and reading books while listening to some ambient records I had found online, I couldn’t sleep so pulling an all-nighter was my only real option. I was reading “A Brief History of Time” for a science project in school, I was somewhere in the middle section of the book and started to get dry eyes. I figured I’d go downstairs into the kitchen to get myself something to drink when I got shocked upon opening the door to the hallway. I saw my mother standing just outside, looking right at me for a fraction of a second. Had all this hassle from the last couple of days driven me insane? It freaked me out so much that I ended up never getting a drink. 

The image of my mother outside my door haunted me that entire night, I kept thinking about it as I couldn’t sleep. She looked deranged, scared and raw. The shortage of light sources in the hallway made her look like she was from a black and white 50’s movie. I kept begging for the sun to rise up, I even did that thing when you close your eyes and try not to open them because you never know what you’ll see. I might have been fourteen, but I can openly admit that I was dead scared.

It finally came to be morning and I ran downstairs, still not fully opening my eyes while passing the hallway. I remember greeting my dad who was sitting in the kitchen drinking orange juice. I was just about to pour myself a glass when he said: “I think I need help.” While holding the glass of juice as if he wasn’t sure he was going to drink the rest of it. I asked him what he meant and he said that he wasn’t sure, that he had felt very uncomfortable and unstable lately. He also mentioned that he was thinking of joining some people from his work in playing golf, he thought that could give him some relief. I told him that sounded like a pretty good idea, jokingly adding that it’s better than hanging around the house doing nothing. He looked offended when I said that, something I didn’t really understand since he obviously worked all night, so that would justify him sleeping through the days.

I understand that some of you reading this are wondering how the hell I could have been fourteen and still not know how my mother died. Well, it’s hard to explain how uncomfortable of a character my dad was at times, and it felt a bit like I was offending him whenever I had to ask because part of me did actually believe she died of liver-failure. I mean it was possible. Imagine if it was true, and I kept asking my dad as if he lied to me. That’s the type of thoughts I had in my head about the whole thing.

Having that explanation out of the way, I did summon the courage to confront my dad one last time. It was a couple of days after the conversation about my dad picking up golf; I just walked into his room unexpected. A part of me had wanted to do this for a long time because I really never knew what he did in his room; it looked similar to an office which is nothing he’d ever need since he was a labor worker in a bottle factory. He was actually sitting at his desk. Not only that, but the desk was flooded with paper-work of some sort, maybe he had picked up an accounting job for the factory during the day, something he could manage from home. I didn’t ask; I had a big enough question for him as it were.

I dragged out a small chair he had behind the door and figured I’d sit on it. It was somewhat squeaky and not very comfortable, better than standing up anyway. Then I leaned forward and I was just about to ask when he interrupted my train of thought by saying: “You want to know about your sister, and what happened the other night. Don’t you?” This is where I started to play along because he was already looking emotionally hurt, bringing up mom here would have been a car-crash. I told him that I was indeed there to ask about my sister. He took a good pause before he bluntly exclaimed it to me: “Your sister is not right in the head; she’s in a mental hospital.” I couldn’t believe he hadn’t figured out that I would have known this by then. Not wanting to make a scene I just pretended like I didn’t know. He explained the context, telling me that she couldn’t take our mother’s death. A tear started climbing down his cheeks, and then he asked me if there was anything else I wanted to talk about. There was no way I could bring up something as sensitive as my mother at this point so I told him that everything was fine, and then I left the room.

I realized on my way up to my room that my dad was fragile and very close to losing his mind in this problematic family business. I had no idea how I’d ever get the truth about my mother out of him. When I finally had landed on my bed in my room again, the image of my mom started crawling back to me. The grey scaled portrait of her in the hallway, was my mind playing tricks on me? I also had a slight feeling that I remembered it from somewhere. I mean it was my mom but that exact stare and look she had, not only did it frighten me but I swore I had seen it before. 

Night landed again, I hadn’t spoken to my father again that day. I was facing the same obstacle that I had the other night, I was too afraid to go downstairs because I thought I’d see my mother again. We all know you can imagine things in the dark, kids do it all the time. It’s as if your mind fills in the gaps, but that incident the other night was different. I got more scared the more I thought of it and figured that I’d open the door to the darn hallway, and turn on the lights in order to feel slightly safer. I’m not going to lie, I did open that door very slowly but as it turned out; there was no sign of my mother. I turned on the lights and went back into my room.

Still not wanting to go to bed, not only because it was spring break at this point but also because I was a bit scared I figured I’d listen through some of my older songs. I had loads of them; most of which weren’t very good however. I was still learning how to create music and I never really thought of myself as particularly good, especially not at writing my own songs. I guess I was decent at playing other people’s songs. I basically went through my songs in chronological order, it was interesting because was able to hear how much I had improved over the years. 
It took me a good three hours to get past most of my songs, and I was reaching the more recent creations of mine. I heard something in one of the songs that I never had paid any attention to before; it was a slight breeze of white noise in the middle of one of my guitar riffs. Knowing that this wasn’t an overworked track yet, it was made just days ago and I hadn’t gotten around to mastering it yet, I figured I wasn’t going to give it more of a thought. That was until the neurons fired, that track was made the day I couldn’t sleep, the day I saw my mother in the hallway. Being a bit gullible I figured that I’d give it a go using my acoustic headphones. I tried everything. I played the song backwards; I cut out bass, middle frequencies, high frequencies and even listened to individual recordings of the instruments and samples. I couldn’t hear anything suspicious, just that white noise. 

I was a bit disappointed, at the same time relieved. Although that white noise shouldn’t have been there, nothing in my room could have made a noise like that. I didn’t want to over-think the situation, so I ended up hitting the bed. Later that night, as I still had problems sleeping I was laying in bed listening to the same ambient soundtracks that I was using nights before, slowly dozing off to sleep. I hadn’t been asleep for much more than ten minutes when I started to ascend into that state of sleep when you’re in a dream at the same time as real life is somewhat happening to you. I could hear a thumping sound coming from somewhere. Before I knew it I got woken up by a loud bass noise, it sounded like some kind of a technical disorder. I continued lying in bed, trying to figure out if I just dreamt about the noise or if it actually occurred, this is when I heard a much dampened sound coming from the other side of my room. It sounded a lot like someone was trying to get some kind of sound device to work. It got quieter and quieter and when I thought it was about to disappear I could hear a voice; very distorted and unstable speaking in what I believe was Russian. 

It took me a couple of minutes but I finally realized what I thought the sound was coming from, I had left my old amplifier on from when I was playing guitar. I bounced out of bed in order to turn on the lights. I was overlooking the entire room as I hit the switch, for the blink of an eye, just next to the amplifier I saw my mom again; just as the light went on. The same stare, same face, still that black and white filtered look from before. I got so shocked I fell down on the floor, the noise coming from the amplifier stopped in the same instant. I wasn’t sure what to make of this, and I definitely didn’t want to tell my father about what I had seen, knowing he has already thrown one of his kin to a mental hospital. 

I had a lot of sleep to catch up on but unfortunately this wouldn’t let me sleep, I just couldn’t sleep at all. I never believed in ghosts or anything growing up, these two small incidents with my mom being my only experience in what could be categorized into the matter. I thought and assumed I was becoming what my sister had become. Whatever this all meant, and needless to say; I didn’t get any sleep that night either.

I met my father in the kitchen the next day, he was looking a lot better than the last time I had seen him. He kept going on and on about how much he was looking forward to playing golf with his work-crew later that afternoon. I was happy for him; he deserved some time out of the stress. After the conversation about an afternoon of longing for a spot in the shade and waiting for your turn on a grass field he added: “Have you been thinking of your mother lately?” As if he could read my mind. I told him that I was always missing my mother, and that I had indeed thought of her a lot lately. He stated that he thought I had. I had no clue why.  Short after that he left for playing golf.

I kept thinking of why my amplifier was acting up that night, I started recalling a clear memory of turning it off after I was done playing. In fact, I knew I did since the amplifier was connected to an electricity hub that I used to turn off a small lamp I had next to my bed, how could it have been on? I had no idea. 

Since my dad was out of the building I figured I could use this afternoon without his presence to get some answers. I stepped into his room to investigate what he had been doing sitting at that desk of his all those hours. I grabbed a bunch of paperwork and sat myself on the double bed next to his desk, it got me a slight reminder on how he hadn’t gotten rid of the bed he shared with my mother yet. The first paper I started examining looked like a letter of some sort, as if it was a letter inside a legal template of some company. I don’t know how I’d describe it better than that. After further examination I found out it was a letter from my sister sent to our address, I remember wondering why dad wouldn’t show me something like this: 

“Daddy, why didn’t you visit me last weekend. I thought you were coming back, I was waiting for you. I’m sorry if I made a scene, I thought something had happened to you! I ran to you because I wanted answers, no one has answers here. I’ve been getting visits lately, why can’t you come to me at the same time?”

I fixed some grammar and a whole lot of spelling errors for the sake of explaining this to you, my sister had the linguistic abilities of a five year-old in this state. On after-thought I guessed my dad didn’t tell me about letters from my sister since they would inevitably prove that she wasn’t in a special school for people who were after tougher challenges. Although thinking about it, that doesn’t sound ridiculously different than a mental hospital.

The rest of the papers seemed to be a real mixture of work-related things and records of local police-investigations. Why would my father be looking into cases of murder, pedophilia, rape and almost anything you can think of? It wasn’t really my business what he did with his spare time but this was just outright messed up. I knew he had a friend in the police force, that was either the reason he had these or just the tool he used to get them. I didn’t even want to know at the time, I had enough stuff on my mind already and I hadn’t slept in far too long.
I apologize to whoever reading this if it seems that I’m dragging it out with details a bit too much here and there, I’m only taking precautions to make sure that I’m telling it right. If I’m finally going to tell my story I want it to sound right. 

My father never came home after golfing so I assumed he went directly to work, which made complete sense. It was starting to get late into the evening and I had absolutely nothing better to do than to once again sit in my room, I was trying to figure out ideas for new songs on my guitar. This time I wasn’t using the amplifier since I was legitimately scared of the noises occurring again. My amplifier has been known to pick up foreign radio broadcasts before, something that explains the distorted Russian speech last time, I wasn’t worrying about that. I was thinking about my mother showing herself again. Not that I was sure that it had anything to do with the amplifier itself.

Not too long into that night I started feeling sick of being in-doors for so long, and I felt like I could use some kind of fresh air as a vacation from all this unexplained mystery I had been experiencing. I remember being on the sane side of the fence, thinking critically and trying to find solutions, not marking everything as if it was a conspiracy from hell. I figured I’d take my bike down to a local gas station, not more than ten minutes from my house; I wanted some chips, candy and maybe a couple cans of soda. 

I scrambled together some change I found in my room and took off; I got there faster than I thought I would. It wasn’t cold outside either; it was a pretty smooth night. After grabbing some generic brand of chips, Skittles and a couple cans of coke I paid for it and left. I didn’t spend much time in the store, but apparently enough time to get my bike stolen. With no bike, feeling like a stupid idiot for not locking it I had to walk home. 

Something out of the ordinary happened after this, and I wasn’t even sure if I was seeing things at first. I was walking on this huge open road; I guess you could say it was somewhat of a country road. It was tied together with the forest behind our house. It was the type of road that didn’t have any traffic other than truck drivers, passing once every couple of hours at night. I didn’t want to believe my eyes at this point but I saw my sister standing alone wearing what you’d imagine someone coming from a mental hospital would wear. I assumed she was looking for me; she was definitely staring at me. 

I continued walking, not necessarily fearing my sister. It somehow still felt as if I had a bond with her, that she would never have done anything to hurt me. As I approached her she didn’t give me any response what so ever, she was just staring at me in a light-blue scrub-coat, looking lifeless. I had reached talking-distance; I couldn’t believe this was happening. It felt surreal, like one of those scenarios you can’t be prepared for in real life. She had started to shake a bit, I couldn’t tell if she was freezing or if she was nervous. I asked her if she was looking for me out there, and if she had escaped the hospital. She didn’t respond. I got the notion that she was slightly scared of me, as if I was a threat to her. 

After a short gap of silence I noticed that she was holding something behind her back. I got a bit worried that she had some kind of a weapon, or a blunt object to swing at me so I stepped back when I spotted it. She started to slowly bring it forth, it was a plastic bag. From the way she was holding it I could tell it wasn’t heavy, or dangerous for that matter. I withdrew the step back I took earlier and tried to peer down into the bag, then she started to stretch it out to me: “I took this from your house the other day, I’m sorry. I think this belongs to you. Jonathan.” 

I do realize that I never told you my name, it is indeed Jonathan. I was slightly astonished that she had remembered my name even; she seemed to be so out of it. I remember grabbing the plastic bag, she wouldn’t let go of it too lightly either, it was as if she still wanted it. After I had gotten whatever was in the bag we shared another brief moment of silence, she wouldn’t stop staring into my eyes during these. Then she told me to never mention any of this to our dad. Shortly after she started walking towards the forest; as if she knew where she was heading. 

I saw the headlights of a car coming straight at me and my sister, whoever was in this car was driving way ahead of the speed limit. I noticed when it started to get closer to us that it was my dad’s car, acting on impulse I threw myself into a nearby ditch, as I got to witness my dad chasing after my sister. I didn’t even know if I wanted him to catch her or not, she was purposely running away from him. He dragged her into his car and they both drove away, heading the direction he was originally going. This was the second time she had successfully escaped this mental hospital, and how the hell did my sister make it so far both times? Something wasn’t right, I knew from when I was younger that the hospital wasn’t anywhere close to where we lived since my dad sometimes was gone for ten hours upon visiting her. Of course at the time it was supposedly a special school, but that doesn’t change the logic of it. He never brought me with him whenever he visited my sister, since he kept me in the dark about the whole hospital thing.

I ran the rest of the way home, trying not to drop anything; I still had all the items I bought at the gas station. I wanted to make sure that I could get home before my dad did; I had no clue whenever he would get back, and not wanting him to find out whatever was in the bag my sister gave me. I couldn’t spot my dad’s car in the driveway so I felt relieved as I stepped into the house. I didn’t bother putting my drinks in the fridge or anything, I made my way back to my room as fast as I could. I don’t really know why but I locked the door after me, as if there was something to fear. I sat myself on the bed with all the lights in the entire room switched on. I made sure to put all the bags with snacks in them aside; as I was getting ready to dig into whatever my sister ran into the night to give me. 

I never really thought of something until now, and that is how my sister could have found me. It must have been a coincidence, or she had been following me for a while; knowing she couldn’t approach me in the store. I don’t know.

I looked into the bag, it seemed to be random belongings from the drawers in our living room, and maybe some stuff from one of the cupboards we had in the kitchen. After sorting out stuff that had no relevance what so ever, for example there was a roll of tape in there. I planned to spend more time on the more interesting items. The first thing I picked up was a small collection of family photos, most being after mom died. The next thing I could grab was a couple of rocks; they weren’t even dry, I guessed she must have gotten those just before she passed me the bag. There was only one thing left in the bag, an usb-stick. 

I took the stick out and threw away the bag. Then I started looking at the photos as I was trying to reason why she would have taken any of these from our house. The only thing that somewhat made sense is that a couple of them were from when she wasn’t sent to the hospital yet, but it was pretty much pending already. In fact, most of these photos took place a couple of weeks after our mother passed away. On one of them it’s my sister showing off her prom dress she was planning on wearing, she actually wasn’t acting too badly the first couple of weeks. I guess she didn’t process our mother’s death until later or something. Another photo is of dad’s old car, he had to sell it in order to compensate for our family’s financial depression from when we lost the main income our family had, my mother’s candle business. He loved that damn car with his entire heart; we even used to joke about how mom was jealous of the car. 

There were more photos but I stopped going through them when I realized a couple of them had a handwritten marking of the letter “x” behind them. It noticed this when I was flipping them as I was trying to get them all to be facing me. I sorted the photos with no marking away and started to focus more on the ones with the marking. I figured my sister must have had done this, for what reason I was about to find out. I kept staring at the first picture; it was the one I told you about earlier, the one of my father’s old car. It was a Pontiac from the early 80’s and it must have cost him a fortune. I never had any particular memories of the car; I remember it spending most of its time in our garage.

I kept looking at the photograph and the more I stared at it the more I started to wonder why my dad hadn’t use the car more, he obviously loved it. The photo was taken for an ad in the newspaper, for selling it of course. I was just about to put the sad photo away when I caught a glimpse of my mother sitting in the backseat. It wasn’t very clear and she seemed somewhat transparent. She had the same drained-out appearance and blank stare that she had from when I saw her in the hallway outside my room, and this was taken after her death. I couldn’t believe what I was looking at. I remember dropping the photo out of shock; so many thoughts started circling inside of my head.

dinofinger,0,,1,1rie11,,1,"    17^th May 2007.
I followed my dad went to Grandma's house. My cousin who lives with grandma, had a suspicion that something had happen to Aunt L &gt; *Her initial would be appropriate here* &lt; Aunt L was never in her sound mind but she prefer to live alone which is the best option avoiding the troubles she would cause to others. Grandma has a problem of [nagging](https://www.google.com/search?q=nagging&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a) disease which makes more Aunt L better suit live far from her lectures. 

Back again to my cousin, who received a call from Aunt L's neighbour. Her respond was *there was a sudden silent for the past four days*. Aunt L was never a social person who goes anywhere she wants and always out. She prefered to live in her tiny apartment secluded only her herself and herself she enjoys being with. But her neighbour help us to watch for her just in case for anything. So we respond to go and visit her house. My father, my cousin and I, the three of us went together with nothing held us back. 

As we arrive by the door, we knock and knock. From the window we can see noise screen from her small tv at the corner. But there was no sign of her. Somehow her grill lock and the door were changed, the key my cousin brought didn't fit at all. Maybe she doesn't want us to barge in anytime we want. My dad took the liberty to call the locksmith while giving positive thoughts to my cousin that everything was fine. 

30 minutes pass. The locksmith do his magic and opened the door. Such stench came out in full loaded right to our faces. Right in front of the door we can see Aunt L laid still in the toilet facing the floor. A 15 year old me shocked and I just watched her body in strip condition only a towel covered her other half and her faeces was right below her and all over behind her. Yet she is still alive, blinking and gasping.

My dad pull me back allowing my cousin to go in. I can still feel my father clenches my arms so tightly when he saw his sister. He said ""*[I better call the ambulance](http://www.wikihow.com/Call-an-Ambulance)*"", so he did and left. My cousin call me out to help pick her up. But she was too heavy, we can't even push her to the side. So my cousin rinse her with water to clean her off. I was told to took a towel and wipe her face. I could say her face was in a total blankness. 

25 minutes later the ambulance arrive. They took her with a stretcher. Both of us went down to send her off. I can remember certain vision of some neighbours pry on their window looking out what was happening. My dad went together with Aunt L, so left me and my cousin. Soon my mom and sister arrive bringing cleaning equipment. We spent whole 3 hours cleaning her house. Based on what I heard my cousin said ""*The man who always deliver her food got no respond from her for three days. That's when he ask the neighbour if she had gone somewhere. I bet if we were too late, she might have gone by any minute unconscious on the floor*""


    18^th May, 2013
We had her funeral in the day after the day we thought she would died 6 years ago. Funny the coincidence of the date just *one day after* we laughed. My cousin gave a speech said she was a fighter. Indeed she was. I think her life is better after that 17^th May living in the retirement home. She was more happier than before she was a shut-in.

As I was doing this, the big rocking chair next to his litter box was swaying, and I gave him a quick glance. I felt him sniff at my ear. He then jumped off the chair and walked into the kitchen. I thought nothing of it for a few seconds, then froze. ""Oliver!"", I called. I then walked to the door and looked outside, he was napping on the steps.

echoes007,4,,2,1rhee9,,2,"I’ve always been a non-religious person. I was brought up by parents who told me to question everything. To not believe the crap that is forced down our throats daily. But I’ve always felt a whole in my life when it came to that stuff. I went as far as trying LSD and DMT to achieve this “religious experience” we all want, but I never got it. So, after a while, I just gave up and moved on and accepted there is no God, or spiritual experience, or anything that’s real, that will make me see life in a whole new perspective. Naturally, this got me down and depressed a bit. It was then when I started seeing 11:11 everywhere. It started one night when I was doing some heavy drinking and decided to do some coke lines. I remember vividly, my heart stopped, and I remember a sound, like a blender going off in my head. When I forced myself to snap out of what had happened to me, I remember the first thing I looked at was the clock on the cable box. It read 11:11. This stuck with me for a long long time. I felt like some force or spirit was forcing me to look at the clock when it was 11:11 in the morning and 11:11 at night. As if reminding me that it saved my life. This was going on for a while, when I went as far as Googling what it was. Unfortunately, the 11:11 thing was associated to some spiritual stuff, things I thought were bullshit to begin with. But still, 11:11 was always there. Slowly I stopped thinking about it, and my 11:11 experiences were less and less. It wasn’t until last week when I was driving home (I was butt sober) from an event when it started raining. My tires and brakes were messed up and I didn’t get a chance to change them, and besides, it hardly ever rains in this town, so this came as a surprise to me. As I was driving up a hill, I lost control of my car completely on the wet road, and was literally fighting my steering wheel and slamming on my brakes to stop the car, but I couldn’t. This went on for about five seconds until I finally stopped the car in the middle of the road. Again, when I snapped out of my panic mode, the first thing I looked at was the time, and it said 11:11. I’m not one who believes in coincidences, but this has me thinking I have some angel or spiritual entity looking after me. Even though I don’t believe this stuff, there is NO way that could happen. Has anyone else experienced 11:11, or has randomly been “forced” to look at a clock when it’s 11:11? Or is it my brain playing tricks on me because of the LSD/DMT I took? ",11:11,4,nosleep

Who killed his wife and children while he asphyxiates

His doctors with the bloody spinal cord

Of his fat nurse, who cares if she was old

When the guards rushed in, it was no problem at all

bashing their brutish faces straight into the wall

Bursting through the heavy front doors

He killed everyone on the first floor

No one would stop him, no, not this time

5 years of waiting, no stopping on a dime

He had to get out on this night

To meet his lover, one at first sight

Taking his science class, year after year

Convinced that she loved him, held him dear

Called her ""favorite student"" and all

Had her parents give him a call

To invite him to dinner, on a cold winter's night

Slaughtered her family, their faces were a sight

In the judge's court, he mercilessly pleaded insanity

When, in reality, it was egotistical vanity

If he couldn't have her, no one can

To kill her new parents was the plan

Standing outside of the house that was soon to be theirs,

Looking to seek justice, to seek what's fair

So as he broke in and brandished the knife

She knew he was back to take a life

So quickly she fled into the night

Leaving behind more victims, as she took flight

She ran two miles straight to the highway

Waving for anyone to stop, to go her way

As hand grabbed her from behind the bushes

His knife drives deeper and deeper as it pushes

All flashbacks of her life seemed to fall apart

As he whispers ""This...feels so right""

Her mind tries to escape into the night

The fires of his greed are not yet doused

As he tries to get back to the house

He plans to take another life

InsanityInABottle,0,,1,1rgw03,,2,"“Extra, Extra! The Piggy killer is at it again!” Yelled the paperboy, holding a darkened paper above his head, screaming the same phrase over again, as if it was no big deal. I walked towards him and asked him “How much?”
“Only ten cents sir.”
“Ha. Must be a pretty good story then.” I said, as I fumbled for a large dime. I handed it into the boy’s hand, it’s gleam bouncing the light of the sun, veiled through the mist of rain into my eyes. I blinked quickly and grabbed the paper, quickly turning from the boy, hearing “How about a tip sir?”
“How about you wipe your ass with the metal I’ve already given you.” I said back to the boy, who furrowed his brow and continued screaming for new customers. As I walked along Hero’s Avenue, I kept the paper open, reading it over again. In large font, shouted “Piggy killer’s new victim!” with a picture of a woman, apparently known by the name of “Jessica Turrow.” She wore a large smile on her face, as she raised a glass of champagne above her head for a toast, I presumed.
	The article read “The psychopath, depicted as a man with a pig’s head on worn over his own face, has struck again. Witnesses described him as large, while wearing a reddened trench coat, then finally, a bib, which read the term KISS THE COOK, slathered neatly against his chest in gore. He had organs and even a human spinal cord attached to his coat and as usual, was found was mist was floating through the air and at dawn. We had identified the victim, through a ring found on the hand of the woman, who had been chopped to pieces and nailed against the side of the church. If you are to spot anyone fitting under the description, contact the police immediately, or you may be his next victim.”
	I laughed as I watched terror shrouding the faces of everybody who grasped a paper in their hands, all walking along the street as automobiles drove recklessly between one another, threading the needle on the two way street, not large enough for two cars to fit on.
	I walked towards the police station, which was cleverly located across the street from a coffee shop, a brothel and a printing office. A police car drove by; it’s loud horn sounding, flashing red and white, reflecting the light from the rain directly into my eyes. I walked into the station, the smell of fresh cigars flooding into my nose. A man screamed from across a large waiting room, looking down at the paper, then looked up and said “Oh. It’s the wonderful Flynn. Of course my dear, come, come.” I walked past him, glaring at his smug face, and then opening the door into my office.
	A man sitting on a chair for those waiting to enter my office abruptly greeted me. He smiled and said, “Well hello sir, I am Dean Osterrietch and believe I have a lead on the notorious killer”
“The pig one?”
“Y- wait, there are more?”
“I believe there are, just they might not like attention as much as our friend here.”
“Well… thanks for informing me of that rather morbid concept, but I have gotten hundreds of pictures of the killer, coming out of his lair.”
	The man pulled out a large portfolio of pictures and dumped them onto my desk, arranging them appropriately. “So, if you look at these pictures, it was for when he first got into the business, holding small weapons, all identifiable, all related to the cutting of meat. Then as you look to the left, these are the later pictures, which are of him coming out, holding bodies on his shoulders, sitting in the back of his eatery and chopping them up, putting them into boxes and looking pleased with himself, all the while in his pig mask. But, he seems to be getting careless. He cam outside, barely slipping on his mask in time for my camera to flash a photo, his face seemed veiled in… something. Something sticky, something gruesome. But if you look closer, you can quite easily see the silhouette of his face. Large, hooked nose, eyes, clouded in blue, teeth, sharpened to perfection and a dripping mouth.”
“Ha. So you’re basically implying that you’ve seen a notorious killer walk in and out of a location multiple times and not even dared to act on it? I beginning to suspect you’re the killer!”
“But that would be silly. Why would a crazy give himself away?”
“I don’t know, why don’t you tell me?”
“I believe this conversation is getting a bit heated. I saw the ad in the paper that I should contact the police and thought I’d tell you where I’ve seen such events. Have you ever seen the abandoned butchery on 1800 Bellcove Street? Well there’s your place. Sir!” said the man as he gathered his pictures and threw them into his bag, which smelled of defecation and nickels. I watched as he slammed the door, then sighed and sat down on my desk, rapidly pressing the keys of my typewriter, updating the information I’ve received from the man.
“Mysterious man visits police station, says he has a lead on the piggy killer. As you all know, the notorious killer has crossed the line now. Enough to even be called a serial killer! What a sick bastard he is.” I continued being as pessimistic as possible, updating the paper, then grabbing my camera as I finished the article. Typing in my name, finishing with my name, saying “Written by: Flynn Covetail.”
	Darkness was beginning to shroud the air, perfect night for the killer to strike in his typical environment. Light rain was spattering against my window, racing down to the bottom of the screening, only to fall against an umbrella below. As I left my office, throwing on my coat, I screamed to the man in the front desk, “Going out to…oh, let’s see...1800 Bellcove Street? If I don’t come back, Phone someone.” I said with a laugh, while walking outside.
	Instantly my boots splashed against the small walkway paved on “Western Lagoon highway” as the frivolously worthless people would say. I walked down towards the street, which was naught but four blocks from here. I passed by Dontell’s Donuts, Redgar’s Rotisserie and Salam’s Spices, all involved in the fattening of desperate cops, as only fattening diners were located near the station, so I developed a theory that every restaurant owner is against us.
	I reached the butcher’s place, which had been looted to hell by the anarchists, who were just a group of thugs that didn’t do shit to overthrow the government. The door had been pried off it’s hinges, yet now it was replaced by a veil of chains, hanging off of rusted hooks attached to the doorframe. Within the butchery, the first thing I noticed was a bed, a homeless man sleeping on it.
	I simply ignored the bum and walked around, searching for anything considered suspicious. I walked through the door, smelling the bum’s shit in the corner and closing my nostrils as well as I could. I looked through the shop, behind the counter I found several rusted knifes, which were corroded to the counter, which was a wooden rotten thing, with three cutting boards lining it, all of which nobody needed. The front of the shop seemed completely normal, but I listened to the bum waking, instantly screaming, “Who’s there! I will kill you if you’re trespassing on my property!” I laughed and screamed to him “I suggest you run out of here, or I may just have to turn you in as a key suspect for the crimes.” I heard the scuffing of his shoes against the floor, running towards me.
	I quickly turned, backing up against the wall, my sidearm pointed at the bum and screamed “GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!” I shot to the side of the man, who quickly bolted for the door, a rat following closely behind him. I sat for a minute, catching my breath, while my vocal chords seemed to scratch against one another in a uncomfortable clunky fashion. As I stood, I felt the hard callused flesh of an arm pressing against the front of my throat and the sudden feeling of something hard hitting the back of my head.








	Ha. Damn fool didn’t even know what he had coming. Shouldn’t have fucked with my grandpa… shouldn’t have yelled. My ears hurt. Are they ringing? Why the FUCK am I here? I thought a conversation to myself as I raised the man into the air, the familiar heaviness of my mask pressing against my face, the pig’s blood leaking down my neck, warming me, keeping the cold away. I looked at my setup, which was simply the back room of a butcher’s shop, a heavy steel door muffling sounds on both sides of the fifty wood wide hallway of a room.
	Blood dripped into wooden bowls I’d gotten from the shop, the bodies of fresh meat hanging from the ceiling. Pigs, cows, chickens, even a few deer, but the most stubborn of prey, the pigs. The sticky cunts hung from the ceiling, their wrists cut, their feet missing, their hands stuffed into their fucking loud mouths. The damned pigs that walked the streets, reading their stories about who? About me! The beautiful man, who is dealing righteousness to the crazies, to the rich. Though they think that they’re so safe in their leather homes, they should be the ones making chairs; their dried hides need to be a part of furniture!
	Oh, what an inventor I will be! But the best part is, nobody looks twice at the photographer. Nobody looks at who’s behind the camera; they only care about the picture! And I am finally the one in the picture! Flynn, the little anus that believed he owned the whole world, because the police were backing him up. NO, NO, NO! YOU ARE MY FUCKING BITCH!
	I whistled a tune of sorrow and greed that humans so openly express. I raise him in the air, catch a hook to his leg and strip him down to his bare neck. This self-conceited asshole needs one thing. A hook curving through the cheek, wrenched from his cheek. He thought I was the killer? NO! THAT IS NOT THE FUCKING WORD!
	Oh! My friend is waking up! Finally a new toy to play with. Oh, what a joy he will be! Oh no! What will I say to him? I guess I’ll just wing it. I guess I’ll just talk to him.  Where will I display this beauty? Ooh! The police station! Mmm, how delectable would that be? To show the pigs that even their weapons can’t defend them from me. THEY ARE GOING TO LOVE ME! I am a hero. I love being a hero and don’t try to talk me out of my heroism! I AM AMAING!








	My eyes slowly opened, to find a man in a pig mask, the rotting dreaded animal seemed to have a grin on it’s face. I was hanging upside down and fuck my leg hurts! Why does my leg hurt? Where the hell am I? “Oh… you’ve awakened!” spouted the pig; it’s squeaky voice ringing through my ears. I screamed, “Help me! Help! HE’S GOING TO KILL ME!” 
“Now that’s not how you treat a guest, is it?”
“Fuck you.”
“Oh… language, language my dear friend. If you even try saying something like that, I will cut off your cock and feed it to my friend Mr.Squeaks over here!”
	I looked to where he was pointing, which was a large column in the room, a decomposing rat nailed to the pole. “Somebody is going to catch you. They know where I am!”
“Oh, I believe they do, if only your little desk friend was there to hear what you had to say!” said the phsyco with a smile. He pointed at the ceiling, which had two hooks on it, chains hanging from them and a headless man, blood dripping in a steady stream of thickness, into a wooden bowl. “Why are you doing this to these people?”
“Okay, okay, story time. Oh yay, stories! FUCK OFF GREG, THIS IS MY TIME TO SHINE!”
	I looked at the pig with doubt, pain shooting up my leg, throbbing slowly into my brain. “SO, let me tell you why I love my job, okay? Okay. So, when I was twelve, I thought, I’m going to take pictures of weddings! I’m going to take pictures of people in love, because everyone else’s happiness, is mine.” He said this, while pinning his right hand against his heart, which contained an extra few layers of flesh, sewed against his own, along with a tattoo, stolen from his victim.
	“Okay, so anyways! What do ya know! I’m doing that now! I am a photographer! I love people being happy. SO, I one day, was at this one glorious wedding, full of lovely people. I had started talking to a woman and a little, oh what is it called? Fetish of mine was developed. As we were in bed, I took out my camera and took shots of my experience and little did I know, I have a few other… kinks. I wrung my hands around her delicate throat, stuck my finger down her throat and felt the vomit shoot from her mouth! I felt the rush as eventually, she started to fuckin’ bleed! WHAT A WHORE! She began to cough up blood, she began to wheeze and it is as these coughs echoed from her throat, landing inside of my mouth as our lips touched, did I realize how wonderful blood tastes. Rich, creamy, delicious, blood, coursing from the fountains of our decapitated stumps. I invented ways of sucking people dry, licking them dry! Well, at first I was only an amateur, but, as I got better! Oh BOY did I start to love my job! Every wedding became a slaughter, every wedding gave me a new friend, because after all, nobody cares about who’s behind the camera! NOBODY GIVES TWO FUCKING SHITS!
	So, pretty boy, I believe it’s time; you… started looking into my eyes, whenever I snap a photo of your beautiful body.” He said this as his hand slid down from my chest, slowly down to my cock, grinning, spittle flying out of his mouth as he coughed, slid a blade against it as chopped it off. I screamed out loud, blood spurting from me and all the smile he smiled, then I fell asleep, never to wake again.

ReiKoroshiya,0,,0,1rgsca,,2,"Here I am and im going to write about some of the things that go on in my life. Sorry for bombarding you with some trivial things and please just hear me out.
how about I start at the beginning that seems easier. Well back in elementary, I was that kid the kid that really no one liked. I had a friend here and there but that's about it. I was basically a social outcast, 
I never really got my work done, I still don't. Note that I was a very, very angry child and no I was not spoiled if that's what your thinking, im the oldest of 3 kids who had been and are growing up in poverty, but my father is very good at managing money which means he is very cheap.
I had shared a room with my younger brother and for some reason I never grew out of the stage where you sleep with your blankets over your head. I had always liked horror even though none of it really scared me even in elementary in the 3rd grade I found an author by the
name of R.L.Stine and I had read tons of his books which remotely captured my interests.
A few of the simple things had scared me, and I most likely have experiences that I have blocked out of my mind, I don't remember much about my childhood at all.
I don't know why I can't but that's just how it is. I do remember bits and pieces though, not anything like birthdays, mind you. Here Ile give some examples, I remember
when I thought my stuffed animal had red eyes, I freaked out a little bit called my parents and my father calmed me down and took it away. Years later I went back and found it, and of course it wasn't scary anymore. Another example
would be when I saw a ""witch"" in my closet, but again my father came in and turned the light on to show me that there was nothing there, I had clearly saw something but it was gone as soon as the light turned back on.
Once he had left and turned the light back of the figure was back again. I remember when my body shot up in bed and I let out a blood curtling scream and my parents rushed into the room
and they had tried to comfort me and to calm me down I was bawling my eyes out while hugging my father he had asked me what had happened and I was just mumbling incoherently 
about it. I can't remember what it was that had freaked me out so badly. Something else that just pokes out at me was when I was lying in bed and I hear talking so I sit up strait in bed and I see my parents right there talking to each other I couldn't understand what they were saying because they were mumbling and I said hey and they say love you simultaneously and I said aww I love you too you guys, I reached out to hug them and they both just vanished and I almost fell out of bed(I got top bunk). Then their are the things that I have learned from my family throughout the years, not much really
they don't seem to want to talk much about when I was younger. I got that I was a horrible child when they brought me to church, and that I would bite and snarl when anyone got within an arms reach of me.
keep in mind I don't remember that about going to church, as a matter of fact I don't remember going to church at all. hmmm.... well skip forward to middle school where I had
actually made friends. I did got in so much trouble in middle school its not even funny. I could barely even go a week without at least one detention. Saturday school and suspensions I had gotten a ton too, now
drugs are prevalent where I live and when I say that drugs were prevalent I truly mean that, but honestly the thought of drugs never really appealed to me well I mean
certain ones that is, the only mind altering substance that I would actually want to do, smoke, drink, etc would be alcohol cause it seems fun and really any hallucinogenic drug and there
is no way I could get ahold of hallucinogenic drugs without paying a ton of money and with my broke ass I can't afford it and because of that im drug free. Not to much
happened in middle school, only a few things I started to get hellish demonic dreams (oh and speaking of dreams I have always been able to feel pain in my dreams so if
say I was to get ran through with a spear or had my flesh pealed off in a dream I would wake up and still feel it, I also talk in my sleep) which sucks ass, The vast 
majority of my dreams became violent and with me being an avid gamer there was usually a sword nearby in my dreams and usually I could and would fight back and be home
free. I enjoyed those violent dreams where I won, even though I would battle hellish creatures and people I wouldn't consider it a nightmare. I got my own room in the basement which was nice, and well my brother he was, how do you put it? 
Gassy so yeah hot air rises and all that. Electronic malfunctions had started occurring, like waking up to my radio playing static, my alarm clock started to malfunction, etc. I remember waking up minutes before my alarm clock 
went off I awoke with a shot of electricity to my left ear. Skip forward to highschool in the 9th grade I found out what creepypasta and scp were it was amazing to find real horror for a change.
I read the hell out of creepypasta's and found some really cool narrators for them, listening to those was very enjoyable I didn't read scps often and I found a very long series called the holders.
Near the end of the year I started to feel a presence in my room which was interesting because it didn't have a bad feeling to it, the only word that comes to mind to describe it would be light if that makes any sense.
Jump forward one more year, I had flunked my freshman year because I don't do my work. On those professional tests that they make you take S.A.T's or some shit I did 
insanely good on those like I should be an A- student overall. Now i reside in alternative ed. Im 15 right now. I declared to my parents that im agnostic instead of
Baptist a few months ago. Anyway that presence in my room i hardly feel it anymore and now there is something more sinister and not just in my room anymore.
That thing I actually saw it, I fucking saw it, it was short like about a foot and a half tall. I went to bed last night and you know how earlier I had said I sleep
with my blankets over my head. Well I was moving around under the covers and I glanced out underneath the covers and there it was just staring at me a few inches away 
from my face I had to resist not to punch it because half of me was saying its just my imagination and the other half says that if its real  then im going to freak the fuck out and well I never did hit it and its creepy as fuck that its been watching me. I tried to calm my breathing as to not alert it to the fact that I have seen it I
think it knows I saw it because I have been getting glances of it all day. It might have seen me and it might be watching me type this.
It is very short and I can never manage to see any features on its face it just looks dark like a shadow its really, really dark, everything distorts when I look at it like my depth perception gets thrown off and space distorts around it.

highchairchildren,3,,1,1rgqmu,,2,"I'm looking for any input. If anyone has had experiences like this, is there a way to stop it?

So this started about two years ago. In the beginning it was just a perpetual bad feeling, like something bad was going to happen all the time.  I was anxious, always alert and never at rest. I hardly slept, primarily keeping myself awake in order to feel safer. 

Then, I started seeing things.

When I say seeings things I don't mean like hallucinations, well not really. I'm not crazy. There were never any voices and there never have been. It was more like a blackout moment in which the worst possible scenario for my environment would play out seemingly right before my eyes. 

Mostly accidents.  It happened once while I was sledding.  The hill was a steep drop and then inclined back up about 20 ft. or so where it met a busy road. Usually people lost momentum and slid back down the hill and came to a rest in the valley but sometimes, people would make it all the way up and hit the metal road block that was put up along the hill. A watched as a kid went down the hill and then it happened. I continued to watch as he went all the way back up the hill and under the metal road block right into the speeding car that was passing by. There was blood everywhere. I snapped back to reality and looked around. Everything was fine. There was no blood, nobody was hurt, just kids sledding around having fun. 

I continued to have random ""visions"" for the entire year. They varied in severity. The worst one left me shaken for a few days afterwards.  I was home babysitting my younger sisters and boiling pot of spaghetti for dinner.  I moved to the sink to strain the pasta and then went back to turn off the electric stove.  My little sister approached me to ask a question and then I had my flash.  As I was seeing it, I grabbed her by her hair and pressed her face into the stove. In that moments I watched as her eyes rolled around in her head and she screamed, begging me to stop.  I snapped back and couldn't speak. I teared up and thought I was going to puke.  I ran to the bathroom, washed my face, sat down on the ground and cried. I had never felt such a mixture of fear and remorse in my life. I got up and reentered the kitchen, finished dinner and continued the night as if nothing happened.  She asked me what was wrong and I played it off as a bout of sickness.  I sat awake for hours that night and I still couldn't come up with a reason for why this kept happening to me.  I asked my mom to see a psychiatrist but unfortunately it was a luxury we simply couldn't afford. 

Then it stopped. As quickly as it came in it left and I had no more of an idea about what it was than I'd had before.  It stayed away for a while. I mean really a long time.  I was vision free for an entire year.

I was prompted to write this because I had another one the other.  The first in over a year but I am scared. I don't want it to start again.  The most recent one was more subtle.  I was shaving in the shower went as I brought the razor up my leg, somehow or another I cut myself and there was blood everywhere.  The tub was washed red with it and there was nothing I could do but stand and watch as it oozed out of my leg and swirled around in the water before going down the drain.  Then I flashed back and it wasn't there. I hadn't even cut myself.

I know this must sound crazy, like some Final Destination bullshit.  I swear to you I wouldn't have posted it if I didn't have hopes that someone could help.  Any input is welcomed.",Can anyone help?,3,nosleep

You might remember my journal entries from last month. Last month, I can't believe it's been that long. Days and weeks run now in an endless loop. Where I am now time doesn't matter. It's a nuisance, it's a hinderance. 

A lot has happened. I just wanted to let those who cared, who reached out to me, know that I am alive. Very much so. And I have met some friends. Real human beings. There is so much I want to tell you. So much I want to explain. But I can't. Not now. 

Just know that the monster under your bed is real. That shadow in the closet exists. And those voices, the voices you hear in the dead of the night are not your imagination. All your life you have been told horror stories. And now you seek them out, on this subreddit. To be entertained, to be thrilled. But these stories exist for a reason. Every story has a truth. A small bit of reality wrapped around trigger words and exaggeration. 

That truth is what lurks in the shadows of your house, just at the corner of your eye. The truth is what is waiting for you when you close your eyes to sleep, hoping for a peaceful night's rest. But nothing is peaceful in the dark. Where the light is eclipsed by the slithering, rotting presence that knows you oh so well. One day you'll know. You will wake up and know. All those stories. All those scary tales. All those fears.

Are real.

bass_slapper,0,,2,1rh8lh,,0,"*You think me cruel. No. I’ve only learned to act on what I’ve been given. I’ve learned to deal with my problems in my own way. No one understands this but me it seems. This is for ME, I don’t do it for them. But they can’t understand my need. He can’t either. I must make me. Make him understand. How did he get here? I wish I came back. I want him back. WHY WON’T I COME BACK WHY IS HE HERE ARE YOU SORRY ARE YOU SORRY ARE YOU SOR-*

Past this the note is unreadable, spewed with a fluid I can only assume is meant to go on the inside of people. Not that I’d really want to read much more anyways. I already know what happens. Well, not really “know”, but I can feel it. Who wrote it? I can only assume it was my dear Uncle Drewson, if he’s even my uncle. What is this? No clue. A note, obviously, but beyond that speculation reigns. Where did I find this? My new house, in a drawer. Nothing is inherently terrifying about that – Oh, except that it was under the clothing I had already packed there. I just missed it before, I keep telling myself. I half believe it. A few pills later and I’m not worrying about it anymore.

Before this, I didn’t even know I had an Uncle Drewson, let alone that I was to inherit his estate in the event of his untimely, but now enacted, demise. With a heavily estranged family, growing up in between various friends or close relatives passed around by uncaring parents looking to shirk responsibility, one loses track of aunts and uncles. It was in a familiar neighborhood, a spacious three bedroom, so I was in no way eager to turn it down. As a poor, regularly unemployed person I’d been accustomed to sleeping on generous friends floors in the all too often occurrence I couldn’t afford anywhere else. I thought, it’ll all be worth it one day, the day I make it in the world. I can pay all these people back tenfold. “The day I make it”, yeah right. A consistent – and more pressingly, free – living space was a welcome antonym to my recent fortunes. So I was moved in within a couple weeks. Absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened. Till that note seemed to start some kind of vicious domino effect on my life, I was content.

You know when you think back to something embarrassing, stupid, or otherwise shameful act you may have done in your younger, brasher days? Once you recall it, it starts eating away, regret seeping in to every corner of your thoughts, till you would give the world to go back and change it, or at least erase the memory. Imagine that, only you can’t remember what it was you’ve done. It’s simply gone from you. The more you try, the less you realize. The less you realize, the more you regret. The more you regret, the more you try. That’s what’s happening to me, ever since I moved here. But it even goes past that. It’s the sudden feeling you’re being watched from barely out of sight. And at the same time, a crushing loneliness in that feeling. I pop a few more pills. Of course, I’m not being watched. There’s no one else here. If you think you’re being rather clever, figuring this out, oh-no-someone’s-been-in-the-house-with-you-all-along, I was most certainly the only one here. Anyway, this was about the time I found the note. If it was this Drewson, what is he talking about? Who does he want back? What is his need? Do I even want to know the answer to any of these? Insatiable curiosity will ensure I do, personal preference notwithstanding. Putting it all to the back of my mind, I chop up steak for dinner. I like to think of myself as a fairly accomplished chef, particularly where matters of slicing and/or dicing are concerned. I once worked a sushi bar, as a side job to pay the bills, and was quite proud of my ability to launch various morsels into the air and sever them in two with one fell swipe, like you see in commercials. Until the day my knife slipped and nearly skewered a customer’s eyeball. Maybe I’m not quite as proficient as I thought… I grab the bottle of pills and take a few. I don’t really like thinking about that time in my life.

I’m digging through my drawer later, that same drawer, when I stumble upon another discovery. Instead of a clue, it only deepens my mystery. A USB stick is secured to the very back of the board. I carefully remove it, and spend a few minutes simply gawking at my find, my inner curiosity again sparring with my better senses. I think, this will perhaps answer some questions about the note, and hopefully clear up my imaginations conjuring brought on by its conclusion’s implications. As per your previous assumptions, I couldn’t be farther from the truth. I secure the stick in its dock. View files. Two folders: “Reminders” and “Media”. Reminders is empty, media contains one subfolder: “Vids”. I open the folder. Two more: “memories” and “triggers”. Memories is empty. I open triggers. I’m confronted with one video file: shotinthedark.wmv. It’s 0:40 long. I press play.

Before I continue, if you’ll permit me one aside to validate the severity of this. I’m a massive horror movie fan, and I like them brutal. The more blood and guts, the better. I like truly graphic, heart wrenching stuff, and I very rarely squirm at it. Three seconds into shotinthedark.wmv and I rushed over the trash can to puke what felt like my very soul out. The scene I’m immediately confronted with was a man on a chair wearing nothing but an undershirt and briefs. There is a single light source on the chair, but I can faintly make out a figure in the background. Then, without a word, the man’s brains are ejected out his face, accompanied with a thunderous bang. Bone and cartilage spew forth in the foreground. Nearly black red sludge runs down his white undershirt, accompanied with brain matter that had just been crackling with life, likely flooded by fear, but life. I don’t have too much time to process anymore; I’m preoccupied with regurgitating my expertly made steak into the wastebasket. I think, it must be fake, but I know it’s not. I’ve got to tell someone about this, I think, the police, someone. Yeah, I’ll talk to the cops. Then, over my subsiding retching, I hear a familiar voice utter “Are you sorry now?” in the tone of a disappointed parent talking to their disobedient toddler. Something in that voice is chilling. Something… I return my gaze to the computer screen, where the barely visible figure now stands in full view, smiling.

I recognize the smile too.

It’s me, smiling back at myself, gripping a smoking sawed off.

The computer screen goes black. My head spins. I lie down.

He was caught with drugs and his school wanted nothing to do with it. He moved, now resides in york, Pennsylvania and now goes to William Penn High. He moved to a house which was quite old and just had some renovations a while back. The rent was quite cheap so his mother said ""why not?"". I was one of Jordan's first friends, since moving to york he told me things about that house really strange things. He soon moved away a little after I moved away so I have no idea where he is now. If any of you happen to live in york I'm talking about the old burned down house on market street across the street from the kindergarten/daycare. This story takes place about 2 years before the house burned down. 

A month since school started and about two weeks since I started talking to Jordan he invited me over to his house. Jordan said ""cmon dude come and stay the night my moms gone and im pretty sure wont give a shit"". So I thought why not I haven't spent the night at a friends house in a while ""yea sure ill spend the night man"". We went around town skated for a while, went to McDonald's with a few other friends then it came around 10 or maybe 11 everyone was ready to go home and i was ready to just go to a place and chill, play video games, and maybe eat some more. We got to his place, sat down in the living room, and lit up a blunt. Playing grand auto 3, high off our asses, we ordered some pizza. We ate and everything was fine till I felt like heading over to the bathroom. As soon as I opened the door I notice under the sink there was like a small cabinet and the doors slammed shut. I was high so I didn't really questioned it much. I used the bathroom and then as I exit I suddenly hear a giggle coming from under the sink. A child's giggle, as if there was a kid under the sink playing hide'n'seek or something. Again I did not question it because I was high and didn't really wanna bother finding out what made the noise. Jordan passed out on the couch, I went to his room and tried to sleep on his bed. I remember waking up around four in the morning hearing footsteps and a child giggling I'm pretty sure it was a little boy. I couldn't really tell his age but he was young; I would guess around six or seven. He was running around the house and he stopped at the door I did not see him, I only ever got to see his outline. He said "" I'm really happy I got more friends to play with now"". Suddenly after that he vanished faster than I could blink. I didn't sleep for the rest of the night. I had goosebumps for a good 30 to 45 minutes. Eventually I  calmed myself down by eating pizza and watching TV.",Hide 'N' seek,6,nosleep

We were watching Toy Story 3 in my downstairs, and we have 2 pillars downstairs to support our house and the framing on a the one behind the couch is loose, so sometimes it snags on clothes and makes a loud noise when it hits the pillar. So, we were close to the end of the movie, and we heard the loose framing hit it like someone pulled it away from the pillar. We all automatically stopped and looked at each other for about a minute, then we got up and ran to my room. We had to go past the pillar to get to my room so it snagged on my blanket and made the snapping noise again, which made everyone go faster.

So I was just searching for Wally at night like I usually do, and I heard a noise.
It was sort of a scratching noise, scratching with a walking cane maybe.
I went to investigate. I went out of my room and...
Nothing.
Maybe it was just me. I went back to my bedroom door. I saw something written on really drippy red paint.
It said ""Find me if you can"". I thought it was just my little brother Mike painting on the walls again. ""Where was Mike anyway?"", I thought. Then I remembered he was outside playing with our pet dog Molly. ( Don't ask me why he was playing in the dark, because I have no idea).
I went inside my room. That's when I saw it. The book was lying on the ground open. I picked it up. This is what the title said:
""yllaW s'erehW"" Now THIS was weird. I also saw the same Wally picture except his eyes were gone and blood was dripping from them.
It was possessed, I thought. I ran outside to bury it, and I stepped on something. It sounded like it was glass because I heard it shatter.
I looked down.
A pair of broken, black rimmed glasses. I ignored it and ran even faster than before.
I ran to my dog Molly's kennel. I always feel safe when she's with me.
She was whining in the corner. That was typical, though. But wasn't she playing with Mike? I shouted out, ""Mike! Mike! Can you hear me?""
No replies.
I ran to the middle of the yard to bury the book.
I stepped in another thing. It was squishy, and slimy.
I looked down.

And Mike.

I wanted to cry, but then I saw a little Post-It note on the cane.
A poem.
This is what it said:
""I can run, and I can hide.
Tear you apart from the inside.
Waiting in the darkness, with my cane.
Used to be for children, now insane.
Red and white, in the grey fog.
Running around with my little pet dog.
With my girlfriend Wenda, with her camera,
And an old man with a white beard.
The prisoner who escaped from jail, murdering people with no fail.
That's my gang, with no doubt.
When you're in with me, there's no way out.""
This was way too bad to just BURY. We had to set it on FIRE. Or RIP IT APART. Just destroy it in whatever way I could.
So now in my backyard, a grave for Mike, some burnt and ripped pages, shattered glasses, and a walking cane.
And to this day, I never read another Where's Wally book again.
And every night, I still hear the sound of a scratching walking cane against my bedroom door.
THE END.

kimmiekissies,13,,29,1rgt5c,,122,"I never even met him, I didn't know his name or face. I was, blissfully unaware, of his very existence.

 I will never know why, or when it started. I'm glad for that I guess. I moved into my very small apartment in February last year. My landlord, Olivia, was a sweet older woman who would cook to much and bring me much appreciated leftovers. She was great to me, even after telling her my problem. I'm antisocial, but she didn't mind renting to a reclusive young girl who reminded her of her daughter.

 Every few weeks she would knock on my door then leave, letting me know she was leaving something for me. I loved that. Not even my family would cook so well. The next morning I wash and leave her empty containers outside my door and by an hour or so she would take them back again. My other neighbors seemed fine, but I never talked or visited with them.

 I work from home so anytime I ever was forced to go out I rushed out and into my apartment avoiding an, uncomfortable situation. I loved living alone, it was everything I hoped for. I could just, breathe. By April though, I started noticing things were not right. They were moving, or plain disappearing. I was convinced it was just anxiety caused by my new medication and the move, another side affect was it would make me so drowsy. Since I hated seeing the doctor I just dealt.

 I took naps during the day now and eventually stopped caring. Until one incident doubled my paranoia, Olivia brought me some sort of greek tossed salad and dressing for lunch one day and I enjoyed it with my friend netflix. I fell asleep in the middle of Portlandia, and woke up that evening at 5pm. Per usual, what was not usual was my bedding on the opposite side of me was disturbed. I only sleep on the right side. Always. Even more it felt.. *warm.* My first thought was I must have rolled around a lot, but I knew it was to odd to dismiss. 

I got up and searched my apartment gripping my phone with 911 typed in. Nothing else was disturbed, everything was exactly like it should be. I let it go, for the next few weeks everything was normal pardon the occasional misplaced shoe or drawn back shower curtain. I thought about telling someone, my parents, maybe Olivia, but if it's not life or death I am not reaching out to anyone. 

I wasn't scared, I was nervous, maybe a little stubborn.. But I stayed. I am not letting some stupid anxiety ruin my lovely lonely world.
 May came and It was getting worse. My panties, toothbrush, hell even my food was being misplaced. Every time I woke up there was this strange odor in the air. I finally realized this won't go away by ignoring it. I called my mom and begged to come stay a few days, when I got home I told them everything. Saying it out loud solidified any creepy suspicions. 

That weekend my dad went to my apartment and what was found was true horror. Written all over that walls: ""COME BACK"" ""BABY PLEASE"" He ran out and called the police. There was no one living in my apartment but someone definitely had access besides me. 
The investigation revealed a man, Henry, the son of my landlord Olivia, was in a projected relationship with me.

 They showed me his confession on tape. He admitted coming into my apartment every night and everyday with his mother's extra key. He claims we were in love and he had my permission. He drugged his mother's food she left out for me causing my drowsiness and falling asleep so he could come in and watch me sleep, touch my hair, kiss my shoulder. The leftovers I had in the fridge were tested and confirmed.
 I was absolutely, horrified and disgusted. A man, I never knew existed, collected my drain hair, clothes, and trash and practically lived in my apartment for *four months.*

Thanks to everyone for your responses, I have taken a lot of your advice.
I'll just give you all a quick update on what happened after I posted yesterday. She ended up having a nap after sitting in front of the TV for a few hours. I was going to walk our dog, Zeus, but I decided to wait until she woke up just in case she woke up and was confused.


She woke up after a couple of hours and was.....well. Happy. Really, really happy. Almost manic. She woke up full of beans, and smiling like a maniac. I was initially relieved. I asked would she like to come for a walk with Zeus and I and she happily agreed. We set off for our normal walk, and she was extremely energetic, bounding off in front of Zeus and I. Zeus is a Labrador, and although he is a big boy, he's still a pup. We usually just meander along on these walks while he sniffs at everything along the way. But she set a cracking pace and Zeus and I struggled to keep up. 


We got up to this park where we usually let him off his lead for a while as we're trying to train him to not run off on us and to be sociable. It's always been a real task getting him back on the leash though, he never ever comes when he's called. Anyway, we let him off, and he's running around and smelling everything and peeing on anything that stands still long enough. My wife, she's picking flowers and sniffing them, and singing. She gets on the swings at the park and I push her for a bit, as she sings under her breath. I was feeling quite content at this point. Figured she must have just been over tired.


She's swinging vigourously when all of a sudden she comes to a dead halt. She yells, in an almost unfamiliar, masculine voice, ""Zeus! Here!"" and points in front of her feet.


I stood in disbelief as I watched Zeus, the most disobedient rascal of a dog I know, solemnly trot over to where she's pointing, sit in front of her, and stare up into her face. They both sat there for a split second, very still, looking at each other. I picked my jaw up off the floor and asked her ""Um..what the hell! How did you manage that!"" and that seemed to break both their concentration and Zeus shot off like a bat out of hell again, and she started swinging again - ""Oh"" she said, ""I used my mind to call out to him...it's something new I learned..""
She seemed kind of sheepish about it to be honest. I pressed her for more details, but the more questions I asked the more defensive she got. She knows I don't believe that for a second. I'm just happy that Zeus is finally starting to be trained. That's really the only explanation. I asked her to do it again but she refused, so I think we both know it was a fluke.


The rest of the afternoon was....nice. Kind of odd. It's like there's something that's amiss. Like when you walk into your messy bedroom and you can tell that *something* is not how it should be but you can't pin point what.


We talked a bit about the seminar. She said that it was very intense. The days were very long. She said that the premise of the seminar is to get to the root of any emotional upset, to explore the root causes for what's going on in your life. I asked if any hypnosis was used, as suggested by you guys, and she said no. They talked a lot, and were assigned to small groups, and encouraged to open up and explore their ""inner beings"". She said she felt a lot better since attending.
Still, something was not quite right. For instance, we were talking about my sister who lives in another state, and how she had recently got a new job. A few minutes later, my phone rang and it was her. I picked it up and said ""Emma! Speak of the devil..."" and my wife smashed me up the side of the head, causing me to drop the phone and shouted ""Emma is NOT the devil!! How could you say that!!! Emma is NOT THE DEVIL!!"" I told Emma I would call her back and tried to get my wife to calm down. She was very upset at what I had said. She sort of went silent again, and was very still. She seemed rather annoyed at me, but by this point, I was nearing exhaustion myself, so I let her be.

She fell asleep early, about 8pm, on the couch. I covered her with a blanket, and noticed that her eyes are kind of half opened..... I used to have a friend who slept like that at school and I've never noticed it before, I think that in my state of hyper vigilance, I am being overly perceptive of small details.
 
I read more of my original post, and all your comments, and decided to step outside and call our therapist, just to find out more about the seminar, as I knew she was there assisting.

I walked out onto our back porch and lit a cigarette and rang her. She answered on my first ring. What she said has really weirded me out. Only because although she gave me a lot of information, she has raised many more questions, as well as answered them.
 
She said these seminars are more like interactive workshops run by a man named Brian and his wife Linda, who are both self-appointed ""psychotherapists"". She said that there are psychologists such as herself on stand by to assist because sometimes when people are in such a vulnerable state, they may need assistance. She said she has referred a lot of her client's to attend these workshops and has found them to be helpful in most cases.
 
Basically, the course is about discovering your inner self, and using different methods to connect to your inner voice, to find out what the cause of your worries are. She said that it is incredibly demanding and intense. Each session goes for 14 hours with only an hour break. During these sessions, many different activities and topics are explored, including, regression. Apparently Brian does this 3 hour session on the second last day, where he gets everyone to meditate, and be still, and he regresses them back to childhood, or even, in some extreme cases, past lives. Our therapist said, it was so intense that she had to fight from being regressed herself. She did make comment that she had been concerned initially about how my wife would handle that, but that she seemed ""brighter, had a clarity about her"" after this experience. They discussed what my wife had gone back to, in her mind, and the therapist was happy that it hadn't caused her any great distress, but reminded me she couldn't discuss the specifics. She said when she wakes tomorrow I could gently try and open the lines of communication with her and she may explain her ""experience"".
 
I told her about my wife's strange behaviour. She said it is normal to be a little out of sorts after one of these sessions, but nothing major. I don't know if it's just me, but I could sense a tiny bit of alarm in her voice.... I don't know, maybe I imagined it. She said to call her if there's any further problems.
 
I hung up, and as I was putting out my cigarette, I turned to go inside and my wife's standing there staring at me. I jump and say ""Jesus Christ honey you scared me!"" and she replied ""Not as fucking much as I'm going to scare you.""
 
Ummm ok. I had to physically turn her and direct her into the house. In the moonlight she almost looked like a stranger to me. Her long blonde hair was hanging in her face, and her face was fixed in this awful scowl. I figured she must still be pissed at me from before. I put her to bed and she goes back to sleep.
 
And, well, that's where she is now.... she was supposed to be off work today too, but I was meant to go back to my job. But when my alarm went off, I just had this weird feeling that I should stick around and make sure she was ok. I rang in sick for work, and I'm just doing some household jobs, waiting to see if she's better when she wakes up, and googling what regression means, and what these intense emotional exercises can do to someone. Still nothing that convincing though. I dont know. Maybe I'm *too* skeptical. I just don't believe this crap.

The whole thing sounds a bit stupid to me, if I'm honest. But I have to say, it has caused some kind of change in my wife. She is very extreme in her emotions at the moment, and I'm worried, because we both have to go back to work tomorrow, and her work environment is very proper. She is always a perfect employee, and very dedicated to her work. I can't help but feel concerned that she might wake up tomorrow and still be in this....mood. Do you guys know anything about this ""regression""....is it the same as hypnosis? She was adamant she wasn't hypnotised, but it sounds like it to me!!



EDIT: Ok now I'm getting really freaked out. I went to check on her and she was talking and singing her sleep. I can't quit work out what song she's singing I've never heard it before. But she's saying something about being someone called Azara or something??? It's really fucking unnerving it doesn't even sound like her. Ill try and get a recording and see if you guys can shed some light. 


EDIT TWO: Ok I managed to record a bit of it...she's singing but I don't know what, has anyone heard this before????????? Ignore the TV in the background I was watching it in the lounge room to drown her out, and it was really unnerving when I turned it off and all I could hear was her. I'm kind freaked out now, I'll admit it. [Here it is](http://soundcloud.com/user165636719/a0ynmqy5tete/s-jECMW)",UPDATE!!! Need some advice.

floydnimrod,21,,25,1rhxtb,,113,"I'd just come from church for some reason. I'm not sure why I'd gone into the church, but it was the weirdest service I'd ever been too. Everybody was there. It was a packed house. Rich people, poor people, criminals, middle class folk. It was all people who didn't normally go to church. I looked into the coat room as I walked in, and some guy was snorting cocaine on this little counter top. Right in a church. I was like, what the hell? I've never see that.

I sat in a pew, and looked up. There was no minister. They were just playing a movie of an old church service on the screen. Some little old lady was playing a hymn on an organ, and the minister was applauding her. She seemed happy. But the audience was restless, not really paying attention, not sitting down, just kind of wandering around, talking to everybody. 

And then I saw a woman I used to know, someone I worked with years ago. I went to sit down next to her, and she sort of jumped on my lap and hugged me, saying she was so glad to see me. I wasn't sure if she was sad, or drunk, or terrified, or just lonely, but she whispered in my ear, offering me sex, saying she's always wanted me, ever since she'd known me. I sort of pushed her off my lap, thinking this was hardly the place for that kind of cheap pick-up. And then I got up and walked out. There wasn't really a church service going on anyway, I don't even think it was Sunday.

And then for some reason, I was in a car with this old lady. I don't even know who it was, or why I was with her. She was old like my grandma Freddie, but it wasn't her. We were driving down the street. She was driving too slow because she was kind of lost. I don't think I was in Winnipeg I was on a large street, almost the size of Portage with several lanes. But they all seemed to be deserted, like very early on a Sunday morning. I'm not sure if it was early in the morning or near sunset, but the sun was low in the sky. I think it was late in the day. The streets were mostly clear though.

The lady pulled over and for some reason she got out of the car. I think she was going to ask somebody for directions. I looked at the GPS thing she had on her dashboard, and suddenly the direction went all fuzzy and scrambled, like the satellite was confused, or just no longer there. And then the whole sky got this weird greenish tint to it for about ten seconds. It basically turned green instead of blue, but only for a moment, and then it was back to normal. Everybody stopped and looked up.

I was still in the car, but I leaned forward and looked out the window. The sun was over in the west, low in the sky. And I saw what looked like a second moon fly over the sky in a direction that was diagonal to the sun's normal path. It was huge. And my stomach got queasy for a moment. It made your stomach sick because it was so big, it actually pulled on you with its own gravity, like the moon pulls on the tides, but much bigger, and everything inside you just got tugged around.

But it went straight across the sky, without hitting. When I realized how close it was, though, I knew it was gonna hit somewhere, probably on the other side of the world. The gravity of the earth pulled it in, and it sling-shotted around to the other side somewhere. I jumped out of the car and grabbed the old lady's arm.

""Come on! We have to find shelter! It's gonna hit!"" 

We just abandoned the car in the street, and I dragged her toward a nearby fire station, or hydro office, or whatever it was. I'm not sure which it was, but there were large utility trucks, with lifts on them. It was also deserted for some reason, except for two guys loading one of the trucks. We banged on the doors, but it was locked up. We ran from door to door trying to get in, but everything was locked. 

And then I felt a great rumble under my feet. It nearly knocked me down. I've never been in an earthquake, so I don't know what it's like, but it felt like the entire planet shivered. Car alarms started going off in every direction and I heard a weird sound like gravel tumbling down a hillside, except there were no hills. I think it was pieces falling off houses in all directions. We were able to stay on our feet though. 

A few moments later, the sky in the north went dark. If I assume the sun was setting in the west, and the meteor or asteroid or whatever flew over the sky in a north-west to south-east direction, then it was north the black came from. And I mean the entire sky. Like a wall of blackness, smoke and ash suddenly filling the view from the ground to the upper atmosphere, from west to east as far as you could see, in one huge wall of black cloud. And it was coming toward us. Well, sort of going towards everyone, everywhere, I guess. It came over the horizon like an charging army, fast and steady, advancing.

""It hit on the other side of the world somewhere! Come on! we have to get indoors! We won't be able to breathe!""

The air started turning yellow. Ash started raining down, and bits of rock and debris from the blast, where ever it hit. I took a deep breath and held it as I was running. I could already smell a weird burning rock smell, like sulphur, like burnt matches, but more metallic. 

Me and the lady finally got into some doors, but it was just a little foyer. We ran in and shut the doors behind us. The inside doors were locked. But it was somewhere to hide. There was a fire alarm. I pulled it, not really knowing why I was bothering. But I was sort of in a panic and not thinking straight. The sign said, In Case of Emergency, so I pulled it. The alarm went off, and we looked out the window. The yellow air turned brown, and then dark red. Then everything went black. The black cloud fell over the whole sky with a clattering rumble that sounded like it was raining gravel instead of water. And all light went out of the world.

The world as we knew it was over. Even if we survived, life as we know it would never be the same. We'd be set back 10,000 years, reduced to hunter gatherers again, living out of caves. If we survived the impact that is. I honestly don't think anybody would have survived the shockwave. Something with that much gravity hitting the earth would pretty much end the story for everybody.

Of course, that's when I woke up.",I just dreamed of the apocalypse. I probably won't sleep for a few days now.,138,nosleep
Charlies_friend,20,,9,1rhapg,,79,"A friend of mine posted a story here not too long ago, and he was pretty well received by your wonderful community, so I decided to create an account to share mine.


When I was a little girl, about nine years old, my family purchased a small ranch in western Kansas. My father had just gotten out of the Army, and I suppose after seven years of trotting around the world, and spending two of those years in active combat zones, my dad just wanted to go somewhere the world would leave him alone. He couldn't have found a better location for this purpose; anyone who's ever followed Interstate 70 westward through that area knows, there isn't much between Topeka and Denver.

I still remember the day we (my mom, dad, older sister and I) moved into that old ranch house. It had been built in the early 1900's, and being something of a history buff, I was pretty excited to live in a house that had stood through prohibition, the depression, both world wars, and everything since. The house itself sat at the bottom of a small incline from the main road, backed literally into a hill. This setup meant the back half of the home sat underground, buried in the hillside. Outside the house was a little grassy yard area, and across this yard was an old barn. We didn't have any horses, but my dad held a particular love for classic cars, and he turned that barn into an amateur autoshop where he worked refurbishing old cars from the junk yard in his spare time.

My sister and I were given seperate but adjoining rooms upstairs, while my parents took the master bedroom (oddly) on the first floor. My sister and I's rooms opened onto a sort of landing that looked out over the living room and kitchen, and the stairs led down from there.

It was only our second or third night in the house, that I began to notice some strange things occurring. I was unable to sleep one night, and I laid awake in bed long after I heard my parents and sister go to bed. The house was incredibly quiet, both from being in the middle of a very isolated area, and by virtue of being half buried. Just as I was reaching the half-sleep state...........SLAM! I heard a door downstairs slam shut. At first I tried convincing myself I had just dreamed it, but I couldn't make myself believe that. And the next thing I heard chilled me to my core. I heard footsteps coming up the stairway. I could tell from the sound that the individual must be wearing shoes, so it probably wasn't my parents coming up to check on me. I heard the steps reach the top of the stairs, and then begin down the landing. I was frozen with fear when I heard them arrive outside my door, pause for a moment, and then continue on. When the stranger was apparently in front of my sisters room, he paused again, and again he continued. He reached the far end of the landing, and then turned around and came back the way he came. He continued for what seemed like an eternity, pacing around outside my sister and I's rooms. I finally worked up some nine-year-old courage and crawled to the door. I could still hear footsteps coming from just outside. I waited until he was moving away from me, and I was between him and the stairs, planning on making a mad dash for my parents room when his back was turned. I barely cracked open the door and looked out, and saw....nothing. The footsteps had stopped, and the whole house was empty, and still. I was confused, and afraid, but even then I knew if I ran to my parents they would think I was nuts. So I slid a chair in front of my door and crept into bed. A minute later the footsteps started again, back and forth, all along the landing. Eventually, they lulled me to sleep. 

I didn't mention the noises that night to anyone, fearful of my parents thinking I was a whacko, and of being made fun of by my sister. But, over the next few weeks, everyone in my family began to notice strange happenings on our ranch. Objects moved on their own. Small things would disappear for days, only to be returned exactly where they'd gone missing from. It was what I guess you'd call typical poltergeist activity; nothing harmful or malevolent, just noises here and there and odds and ends moving around. And practically every night I heard those footsteps outside my room. 

My family eventually began referring to this entity as ""Charlie"". He seemed to be a harmless ghost, and sometimes downright helpful. Occasionally my parents would wake early in the morning for work, only to find a freshly brewed pot of coffee waiting in the kitchen. The coffee maker had no automatic timer. Sometimes when one of us had misplaced something, like car keys or the like, we'd search the house frantically only to turn around and find what we'd been searching for laying on the ground behind us. And sometimes Charlie would slam a door, or walk around loudly, or turn a sink on, seemingly just to let us know he was there. And always, those footsteps at night.

Charlie always seemed particularly active in my dad's auto shop. My dad would occasionally find car parts he'd been working on had been tinkered with, despite the fact that he was the only one who ever went in there. Sometimes tools would go missing, only to be returned a short time later. Once my dad came in from his shop one evening as white as a sheet. When we asked what was wrong he just said ""Charlie was walking around out there........Jesus, I thought you all were just hearing things!"". I wasn't sure why Charlie loved that shop so much, but incidentally, that was where I caught my first sight of him. It was a Saturday, and my Dad was hard at work putting together an old Chevy Fleetline. My mom mad him a sandwich as a working lunch, and asked me to take it to him. I eased open the barn door, and saw my dad seated at his work bench, his back to me. And I saw another man, next to the car, also out of my dad's field of vision. He was about 5'8"", with dark hair and eyes. He was dressed in what looked like typical 1930's clothing; black slacks, a pinstripe vest over a grey work shirt, and topped off by a brown ""paper boy"" hat, cocked to one side. He looked right at me for a second, a big, mischievous grin on his face, and then he simply disappeared. I didn't even realized I was still holding my dad's sandwich and continued to stare at the spot Charlie had stood until my dad snapped me back to reality.

So passed the next few months. My family was happy on our little haunted ranch, Charlie seemed happy enough to share the space with us, and life was good. And his nightly vigil outside my room began to seem almost comforting. One night in late November, however, I learned just how utterly terrifying Charlie could be.

My dad had some kind of dinner event for work in Topeka, almost two hours away, and since my Sister was almost 16 by then, and there was virtually no crime in our rural area, my parents figured we would do fine by ourselves until they returned the next morning. Of course, to my sister and I, it meant we could stay up as late as we wanted, watch scary movies, all the kid stuff you can't do with your parents around. At around midnight, I was in my Sister's room with her watching some movie on her TV, when we heard a loud CRASH from the living room. My first thought was that it was Charlie, playing another prank, by this felt different somehow. Charlie's noises were simply little bumps to remind you he was home. But this noise sounded violent, and angry. Before I could really react, we heard another loud crash, and another. My sister cautiously peeked out of her door, and down into the living room. I swear I saw her go white. She began trembling, and her hand covered her mouth. I peeked around her to see what she saw, and felt y blood run cold. We could just barely see two men, outside our from door. One of them was kicking it in. As we watched, a final smash from this man caused the door jam to give out, and they both entered our home, shining long flashlights all over. My sister and I crawled under her bed, and held each other tight. This was easily the most terrified I have ever felt. 

But as the two men began to go through the living room, another loud crash came from the kitchen. One of the cabinets had opened and slammed shut; a favorite trick of Charlie's. The man who seemed to be leading the show shined his flashlight into the kitchen and shouted ""Is there anyone in here?!?? If you are, you better come out now!! We will find you, and we will FUCK you up!!!!"". My sister and I had to cover our mouths to keep from screaming out loud. At the man's words though, Charlie apparently got angry. We heard another loud crash and a skittering of metal on the floor, as one of our silverware drawers apparently threw itself across the room. I heard one of the men say ""What.......the FUCK?!?!"". And then Charlie decided he was do e fucking around. All at once, every door, window, and cabinet in our home began opening and closing violently, and loudly. Small objects all over the house began to fling themselves into walls, across the floor, even at the intruders. At this point, the one in charge just yelled ""FUCK this"" and turned and ran out, his buddy close behind.

As soon as the men were out of the door, everything stopped, and the house was again silent. It was a long, long time before either my sister or myself finally worked up the courage to move. She had left her cell phone downstairs, and and she needed it to call the police and our parents. She began slowly creeping downstairs to get it, and since there was no way in hell I was being left alone, I followed. As we got to the bottom, I looked into the kitchen, and for just a moment, Charlie was standing there, exactly as I saw him before, with the same grin on his face. A moment later, he was gone.

The police arrived shortly, and my parents not far behind. The cops determined that the disorder in the home was caused by the robbers ransacking the place for valuables, and they must have been scared off by a passing car. Lucky for us. My sister and I didn't even try to tell them what really happened, and within thirty minutes, both men were caught, still fleeing. 

After that night, hearing Charlie's walk around my floor gave me a serene sense of security every night. When he played his little pranks, I would always look for him. And every now and then I would catch just a glimpse of him and smile.

Several years later, when I was a junior in high school, I was working on a school report at the local library. The topic was the history of our town, and I wanted to see if the library had any old news clippings that mentioned my family's ranch. I typed our address on the search bar, and the first result stopped me dead in my tracks. The date of the old article was July 17, 1936, and at the top was a picture of a man, about 5'8"", with dark hair and eyes. It was, unmistakably, Charlie. The title of the article read ""Local Man Murdered While Defending Daughter"". It seems the man we called Charlie was actually named Brian Davis. He had lived alone in the ranch with his only child, a daughter, after losing his wife to a bad case of the Flu. On the night of July 15, the article said, Mr. Davis was returning home from his job as an auto mechanic in town. When he pulled up to the house, he found the door had been forced open. He ran inside, and found a man on top of his daughter. The girl was sobbing, her dress had been ripped open, and the attacker held a knife to her throat. In a moment of sheer instinct, Mr. Davis threw himself at the intruder, tackling him of his daughter, and as he held the attacker, Mr. Davis yelled for the girl to run to the neighbors and call the police. The girl made it the mile and a half to the closest neighbor, who promptly called the sheriff. When deputies arrived, they were able to apprehend the attacker, who had been beaten half to death. Unfortunately, he had stabbed Mr. Davis three times in the chest. Brian Davis died right on our kitchen floor.",Charlie,88,nosleep

childrenofsamhain,9,,5,1rhdoj,,36,"My friend Jaime purchased a new home about six years ago when his wife was pregnant with their first child. Until recently, he lived there with his wife Claire and their two daughters, Sarah and Emily. Sarah is now five years old and Emily is three. Within the first two years living in the house, Jaime said that he never experienced anything out of the ordinary. It wasn't until his daughter Sarah was around two years old, that he started to notice she talked to herself. Jamie thought nothing of it, she was just learning to talk and he figured she was just entertaining herself. 

One afternoon when Claire was out at the grocery store, Jaime overheard his daughter in the upstairs hallway, whispering and giggling. Curious, he asked, ""Sweetie, who are you talking to?"" Sarah replied, 

""The woman standing in the hallway"".

""Is she your imaginary friend?""

""I guess."" 

Amused, he went upstairs to find her staring blankly at a wall, whispering quietly. ""What's your friends name?"" he asked her. 

""Her name is Helen Mary"", she said. 

""And what are you two whispering about?"" 

Sarah looked at him and paused before she piped ""I'm not supposed to tell you."" 

Suddenly the front door opened downstairs, and they heard Claire come through the door. Sarah rushed down the stairs to greet her. Jaime didn't think about that again for a few weeks. 

Over time, the two noticed that Sarah's interactions with ""Helen Mary"" became more frequent, but they attributed this to the fact that they had just given her the news that she was going to be a big sister. 

About two weeks before Claire gave birth to Emily, Jaime was at home alone with Sarah. He heard her playing upstairs, chatting away with her imaginary friend, when suddenly he heard glass breaking. He ran upstairs as quickly as possible to find his daughter standing in the hallway, holding a hammer. She was staring up at the wall of family pictures that were now smashed to pieces. There was glass everywhere. Jaime picked his daughter up and carried her down the stairs. He told her to stay put as he returned to the upstairs hallway to clean up the shattered fragments of their family portraits. When he returned to the living room, he asked her directly, ""Sweetie, why would you smash all of our family pictures?"" 

She looked at him, ""Helen Mary told me to do it.""

When Claire returned home that evening from her girls night with friends, Jaime told her about the incident. The crept up the stairs so as not to wake their daughter, so Claire could view the damage with her own eyes. She gasped silently at the sight. 

When they returned downstairs to the kitchen, they started to discuss possible explanations for her behavior. Suddenly, the color ran out of Claire's face and she looked at Jaime. ""There's no way she could have done that alone.""

""What?""

""There is no way she could have smashed all of those pictures by herself.""

Jaime was confused, ""I told you, I caught her with the hammer. She told me that she did it.""

But it wasn't until his wife said it aloud that it dawned on him, ""But… some of those pictures are almost five feet off the ground. How could she have reached those?""

His mind was racing, ""She must have moved a chair or something.""

She was adamant, ""There are no chairs upstairs that she is strong enough to move without you hearing it, and you would have seen her carry one upstairs, right?""

Jaime was silent. He didn't have an answer. 

They went to bed that night without any answers. The following morning their daughter had little recollection of smashing the pictures and Jamie wrote it off as sleepwalking. Though he didn't have much time to think about it, as two weeks later his second little girl was born.

Emily was two years old in the summer of 2012, and one afternoon, when Claire was at home alone with the girls, she heard Emily alone upstairs, whispering. She called up to her, ""Who you talking to, kiddo?""

""The woman standing in the hallway.""

Claire thought that her Sarah must have told her about her imaginary friend, and that she was simply trying to emulate her big sister. Then she spoke again.

""She doesn't like you, Mommy""

""Why doesn't she like me?"" Claire responded, surprised. 

""I don't know."" 

Suddenly her daughter came bounding down the stairs as if nothing had happened. Even though both Jaime and Claire both found this slightly creepy, nothing about the situation ever felt threatening or malevolent. Until one night last month.

Jaime had put the kids to sleep around eight o'clock in the evening and he and Claire had got into bed soon after. Exhausted, Jaime and his wife fell asleep extremely quickly. Jaime was awoken by the sound of screaming. He was disoriented and had no idea what time it was, but he could tell that it was his wife screaming right next to him. He turned to see what was wrong and saw it. His 3 year old daughter Emily, standing beside the bed, with a hammer in her hand. Blood poured from Claire's forehead. Jamie jumped out of bed and grabbed the hammer out of his daughters hand. He turned to his wife. She had stopped screaming now, and Jaime grabbed a towel from the bathroom and wiped the blood away from her face. She was going to be alright, but she did have a deep cut to her forehead. 

Jaime picked up his daughter and carried her out of the room. He went and checked on Sarah, who had awoken to the screaming but was clearly unharmed. He told her that everything was alright and closed her door. He was standing alone with his daughter in the upstairs hallway, and he finally asked her, ""Emily, why would you hurt Mommy?""

""She told me to, Daddy.""

""Who told you to?"" 

""The woman standing right behind you. She told me to hurt Mommy"" And then Jaime felt a chill run up his spine when his daughter leaned into his ear and whispered, ""And she told me to hurt you too, Daddy.""

darkened-thoughts,1,,5,1rg1d9,,21,"I want to turn around. It's three in the morning, the lights are off, and I'm bathed in the luminescent glow of this old monitor. I just kept clicking through - that was my greatest vice. I could have let it rest. But with every story, my blood pumped faster, my breath came quicker.

There's nothing like a good scare. Every rush of adrenaline left me wanting more. That next fix got harder to find, took longer. I grew discerning, opinionated, a veteran of the genre. Soon I was writing for myself; days spent clacking the keys and nights spent in marathon research sessions. I was a crow picking through the maggots and gore for that next juicy nibble. I was a man consumed, and like a junkie messiah I wanted to share my high with others.

Everything has a basis in reality. Think about it. Why do the holy men think your soul needs saving? Why do children fear the dark? What's there in the unknown deep, what is it that averts our gaze?

That's why I'm here now. That's why I'm writing to you. I come bringing the ultimate high. All you have to do is believe. Believe in me, in the hellish nightmares that chase after you in your sleep, in the stories you read and the movies you watch. When you believe, the hunt is on.

My stomach is in knots, every heartbeat a hammer blow against my sternum. My hands are shaking. My breath comes in stecatto bursts. I can't hold on much longer. The anticipation is mounting, building to orgasmic frenzy. I found it, the ultimate high. Or rather, it found me. All I had to do was believe. All I have to do is turn around.

My faith is sure, and I know it with every fiber in my being:

It's here. And it hates me.",I couldn't stop.,26,nosleep
lamented_dreams,4,,9,1rgqu8,,13,"I love the dark. I really do.

I don't mean going gothic and pagan and all that, but I do like the dark. I like to sit in my room for hours on end into the night watching videos, researching diseases and the supernatural, and writing stories.

Anyways, I've recently come across a quote from a game called 'Knock Knock'. And let me say, it's utterly terrifying for not just the player, but the watcher too. There's nothing but this overwhelming sense of dread throughout all of the game.

""You thought about it, and now, it is inside."" —Knock Knock

That quote has seemed to have seeped into my brain. Multiple broken theories have been written down in my notebooks and journals and I've seemed to have come to a conclusion.

The mind isn't wrong. Reality is. And, with that, imagination often holds more truth than what we accept.

Think about it. When you were a small child, things like fairytales and horror stories were much more real to your innocent mind. In fact, there is a theory that children have a sixth sense that they gradually lose as they progress into adulthood. Also when you were a child, you thought of monsters and what they would do to you as well as how terrifying they looked.

And when you thought about these things, you didn't want to turn around. Why? Because what if for the slightest moment, you were right? All those lone yellow eyes in the darkness, the sinking feeling of being watched, out of all those times, what if this was the moment you were right? Or moreover what if you were always right and they just didn't want you to know... until now.

Because honestly, we used to think the Earth was flat. Then that it had the sun revolving around us. So what makes us so absolutely sure that we are the only ones out there now?

This is my theory.

I shared with one of my colleagues about two weeks ago and five days later she called me screaming about how there was something in her house. The police showed up and they took her to the hospital. She had three slash marks down her back, resembling that of almost a wolf. She also had multiple bruises on her neck. They said there was no signs of break in and the wrecking of the house was most likely the result of her having a psychotic episode.

This could be true, but I don't like how unsettlingly close it is to when I told her about my theory.

""You thought about it, and now, it is inside.""

This is the phrase that keeps me from imagining creatures. When I went to the hospital to visit her she was curled up in the bed, shaking with her knees up as close to her chest as possible. When I asked her what happened she wouldn't tell me who, only that 'it' got inside. She just had this empty look in her eyes, something very uncommon since she was always so hyper and nice. When I asked how she just said, ""I thought about it, and it came in.""

Keep in mind I never told her about the quote at all. Those were her own words. So this is more than unsettling for me. It may be possible that this 'theory' spooked her enough for all of this to happen, but I don't like the coincidences.

angelcot,3,,2,1rh91p,,11,"Hi /r/nosleep. This is kind of embarrassing to post, but here's a few stories of things that happened to me as a kid. I was a pretty anxious kid, and a lot of weird stuff happened to me. Nothing paranormal, though There's more than just these stories, but I thought I'd at least start with this.

Ever since I was a kid, I've been afraid of windows. That's not saying much, though. I was afraid of just about everything else, too. But growing up, my house was full of big windows. Floor-to-ceiling windows in the family room, two sliding glass doors in the dining room, a huge window that looked out from our kitchen into the front yard. My mom never bought curtains or blinds for any of the windows other than the ones in our bedrooms because she'd get depressed if it were too dark in our house. 

I had light blue curtains in my bedroom that my grandmother sewed for me since my windows were an irregular size. Every night I would pull them closed, then pin them down to the walls with a pushpin so that I wasn't able to see even a sliver of the outside out of the corner of my eye. My bedroom window looked out on the backyard. I remember being so irritated whenever someone would accidentally leave the back porch light on. The light would shine through my light blue curtains and play shadows on my wall. I'd cover my head with my pillow so that I could fall asleep without worrying if I would be able to make out the silhouette of someone trying to peer through my curtains, still pinned to the wall. 

From a young age, I had problems with insomnia. My mom struggled with it, too. I remember my dad telling me stories of when my parents were still married, when my mom would wake him up just to talk because she still wasn't asleep at 4, 5, 6 in the morning. I remembered feeling envious that I didn't have someone to do that to. I listened to books on tape at bedtime to fill the silence. Sometimes I would sneak into my brothers' room and lay on their floor, hoping for sleep to come. Being uncomfortably aware of how their curtains weren't drawn completely closed. 

When I was 10, I moved from my room- which overlooked the backyard- to my brothers' room, and my brothers separated and took over my room, and the office. My new room was at the front of the house. If my curtains were open, someone could easily look in as they walked up the path to our front door. During the day, I didn't mind it. I could watch for my friends or packages from the postman. At night, it made me so anxious I began to develop a habit of vomiting nightly. My mom was sympathetic, but didn't know what to do about it. A year later, I was moved back into my old room, and my older brother moved back into his. I stopped vomiting every night. 

I feel like I had a reason for being so afraid of windows. One night- I must have been about 6 or 7- I was up late, as usual, listening to *Ralph S. Mouse* on tape for the billionth time. I had emptied the glass of water that my mom had gotten for me, so I got up to refill it. I was already wary of windows, so I kept my head down on my way to the kitchen. I'd often see things out of the corner of my eye; something moving, or something that *could* have been the shadow of a human, but would later try to convince myself it was nothing.

Even with my head down, something outside caught my attention. A car, parked in front of my house. I lived at the very bottom of a cul-de-sac, so we didn't have a lot of people drive down our street at night and stop to reorient themselves. The car had its headlights on, and I could tell there was someone sitting in the car. Looking at my house. I don't know if they were looking at me, but my paranoia told me they were. I stood there for a long time, forgetting about my glass of water. I didn't look away. Paralyzed, until my mom came in the kitchen. She'd seen my door was open and wondered what I was doing up. When she noticed the car in front of our house, she quieted and gently pushed me out of the kitchen and back to my bedroom. I noticed the car started to drive away as I was ushered away from the window. 

This staring contest with the person in the car in front of my house happened twice more, although over the course of a few months. Once, they switched their headlights off, and stayed for what might have been 45 minutes. Although my memory might be exaggerating. I still don't understand why I was so afraid of seeing someone in my bedroom window, but how I could fearlessly stare out of the kitchen window at the person in the parked car. Maybe I felt less vulnerable in the kitchen. Maybe I was comforted by the fact that they were so far away. Even though the walk from where they parked was just a few seconds from my front door and the window I was looking out. 

The third and final time I saw the car, the person got out of their car. They were tall, and I could see them standing on the other side of their car but I still wasn't able to make out their face. When they started to walk around their car and- I assume- towards my front door, I scurried back to my bed. 

I never liked sleepovers as a kid. Staying over at a friends house meant laying awake on their floor for hours with nothing to listen to but the sound of their calm breathing. Nothing to look at except for the sliver of their window I could see from behind their curtains. Having friends at my house was just as stressful. Usually we'd sleep in the family room, because it had a TV in it. It also had the floor-to-ceiling windows. Usually I would sneak off to my own room after my friends had fallen asleep, so that I could sleep peacefully away from those big windows. 

When I was about 8 years old, I was having a sleepover with a few of my friends. It was after 10, so my friends were starting to fall asleep. I knew I still had *at least* two or three more hours of being wide awake. I was laying on the couch, swaddled in my blanket. The TV was still on, but I'd turned the volume down for my sleeping friends to something barely audible. Usually, I tried to keep my eyes away from the windows. But that night my cat caught my attention, meowing and hissing at something outside. I cautiously looked out the window, worried about what my cat might have seen out there. Just another cat, skittering in front of the window. Relieved, I looked out at my dark backyard. Was that it? 

There was a man in my backyard, walking around. Even with the distance, I distinctly remember he was frowning. He had his hands in his pockets. I did not know this man. 

I woke up one of my friends, whispering in her ear and telling her there was somebody in the backyard. She stirred quickly, obviously alarmed, and looked outside. She saw him too. I'm not sure if he felt our little eyes on him or what, but he turned to face us. Neither of us made a move; not to lay back down and pretend we were asleep, not even to look at each other, or look away. 

There were a pair of french doors that lead to the back patio in my family room, right in the middle of the wall of windows. The man walked up to the doors and tapped on one of the small window panes. The handle of what looked to be a heavy flashlight hung out of the pocket of his sweatshirt. He smiled at us. Not a deranged smile, not a smile that looked too wide for his face. Just a calm, warm smile. He mouthed something and pointed at the doorknob. I was never very good at reading lips. I stared straight ahead, unblinking, not responding. I could hear my friends' breath, heavy and shaking. 

He spoke, the sound of his voice muffled through the glass, ""Open the door."" A pause, he knit his eyebrows together like he was concerned. ""I'm visiting your parent. Let me in."" 

My heart was beating out of my chest. I was a paranoid enough little kid to not fall for this line. I mustered up every ounce of courage I had in my little, anxious, 8-year-old body, and got up off the couch. For a moment, they man at the door looked relieved. I ran out of the room, screaming for my mom. I could hear my friend call out at me that he was leaving, and the rest of my friends starting to stir. I told my mom what had happened. She turned on all the outside lights and called the police while my step-dad looked out every window for any signs of the man. All of the girls at my sleepover had their moms come over and pick them up. I cried, and stayed the night in my parents bed, although I'm pretty sure I didn't sleep.

In my mom's bathroom, there was a big window that looked out at the sideyard. The glass was distorted, though, so my mom never bothered putting a curtain over it. You couldn't see into the bathroom if you were just passing by the window. If you stopped to press your face against the glass, you could see in or out, but everyone in the house knew not to do that when they were in the sideyard. I remember my mom shrieking one night, running out of the bathroom, saying she'd seen something through the glass. A rat, climbing up the windowsill and staring into the bathroom.

I always liked my mom's shower more than the one in my bathroom. My bathroom didn't have a fan in it, so the whole bathroom would get uncomfortably humid. The shower curtain in my bathroom reminded me too much of that scene from *Psycho*, too, and I'd always shower with the shower curtain pulled open, and I'd get water all over the floor. My mom's shower had a glass door that I liked much more, even if there was that big window I could see clearly from the shower. 

Once when I was 12, I was showering in my mom's bathroom because my parents were out of town. My brothers were home, but were playing video games in the family room. I would keep my head down when I showered in my mom's bathroom. Even if the window's glass was hard to see through, it was still a window, and the shower was the most vulnerable place I could think of being looked at. Every once and a while, I would glance up to quell my growing anxiety. To tell myself *nothing was out there*. 

Cautiously, I looked up to satisfy my anxiety. *Nothing was out there*, I told myself. My gaze met the window. There was a dark figure pressed up against the glass. Through the foggy, wet shower door, I couldn't see anything. All I know was that it was *somebody*. I screamed, and ducked down past the tiles so that whoever was out there, they couldn't see me. A few moments later, I heard my brothers knocking at the door, both of them calling my name and asking if I was ok. I pulled a towel from outside the shower and wrapped myself up before I stood up. Whoever was out there was gone. 

A few weeks later, my friends and I were playing in the side yard. There was a huge tree out there that we liked to climb in, and pretend we were characters from X-Men or Sonic. My friend called my attention to something in the grass, over by the window of my mom's bathroom. A polaroid picture of the distorted glass of the window it lay in front of.  ",Windows.,13,nosleep
Spudz_OCD,6,,6,1rgcw5,,9,"Hey redditors, im new at this so excuse my writing skills

All through my life ive had things happen that i just couldn't explain, i've told a couple of friends but even they don't know what to say.

My story begins when i was a kid about the age of six or seven, we lived in a poor neighbourhood in southern Ireland and had a shithole of a house, i lived in a room with my two brothers (kyle[8-9  at the time], and Dylan[3-4]) and had been for a couple of years so i was used to sharing a room. The first incident occurred after about a year in the house (our street was built on a graveyard) and happenned in our room. it was an ordinary day before it happenned, woke up, ate breakfast, went to school, nothing out of the ordinary. however when i came home from school that day, there was something odd about the house, I couldn't quite tell what it was but it just felt wrong. But being a kid at the time, i thought nothing of it and carried on with my daily routine. after dinner and a shower my mom put us to bed. After my mom turned out the lights and left the room, i began to drift off to sleep. after about an hour and a half of hazy dreams, i was suddenly awoken by a loud crashing sound, kind of like if you dropped a frying pan, i quiclky jumped up my pillow and sat upright in bed. I looked over to Dylan's bed at the other side of the room, he ws still asleep. I began to question if i had actually heard it at all. feeling curious i checked if kyle was awake (we had a bunk-bed, Kyle was on top) as i was climbing the four step ladder, i felt a burst of cold air rush from kyles bed and immediately dropped to the ground, waking up Kyle.
""what are you doing"", he said.
""i heard a noise so i wanted to see if--""
""--sshh"", he stopped me mid sentance, and focused his gaze to the back of the room; The look on his face will be forever imprinted into my mind. I turned around gingerly and what i saw was scary enough to make me cringe even today. I saw a scrawny black figure hunched over Dylan, who was still asleep. But this figure was definately not human; It was at least 7 feet tall, it's head was overpoweringly large compared to it's beyond anorexic body. It's fingers were 6-7 inches long minimum. From what i saw it wore nothing, but it very well could have, as it was late at night and i was still half asleep. Then the image that will haunt me forever; It, whatever it was, turned towards me and Kyle. It just stood there, staring at us for what felt like forever, it then jumped towards us and simply vanished into thin air right before it hit me. I was left lying on the floor and Kyle was wondering if what we had just seen was actually real. I looked at him and back to Dylan's bed, whatever it as, when it jumped it jumped with enough force to push the blanket off the end of Dylan's bed. I looked back towards Kyle, who was already asleep again, and decided to go back to sleep myself, not knowing if what we'd seen that night was just a figment of our imagination or not.
When i woke up the following morning i hesitantly asked my mom and sister if they'd seen or heard anything last night..they didn't. So i questioned kyle about it and he said that he had no idea what i was on about, he had no memory of seeing or hearing anything, he didnt even remember me falling off the bunk ladder.
To this day i still cant quite figure out what happened that night.

My second experience was only four or five years ago, a couple of months after moving to Australia. We were living in a pretty old house at the time so it was a bit creaky and what not. it was a pretty average day when it happenned;I was 14 and I was once again in bed at the time. I was sharing a room with Dylan (10) at the time. Kyle (16) was in a room across the hallway, Jenny (12) was the next door down and my parent's room was at the end of the hallway. It was about 11-12 at night, and we were all just about asleep. My mom and step-father at the time were out exploring the wild clubs of Surfers Paradise, so it ws just us kids. I was almost asleep when i heard slight footsteps coming from the kithcen area. I wondered who it was considering we were all in bed, so i opened the door to check. I headed towards the kitchen, once i reached the living room (about half-way to kitchen from my room) i could see into the kitchen, i slowly emerged from the wall; no one there..weird, i thought, so i headed back to my room, but as soon as i turned around Kyle was standing right in front of me with a knife. I jumped quicker than i'd ever jumped before. Kyle then laughed his head off and went back to bed. I did the same without the laughing.. I was back in my room, now lying in bed realising im too awake to go back to sleep. i just lay there for about five minutes staring at the ceiling untill i heard more footsteps in the kitchen. I called out
""Kyle, go to bed, idiot""
""i am you fuckwit"", he said as he emerged from his room half asleep
""well then who's upstairs?"" i asked
""It's probably just a possum in the attic or something don't worry""
I regretfully closed the door and went back to bed. But as soon as i did, loud heavy footsteps started making their way down the hallway, along with heavy thumping on the walls, they were getting closer and a hell of a lot louder, It sounded like someone was trying to stomp and bash rats out of the walls and floor. It kept coming closer and increasing in volume until it was at the point where it was like gunshots right outside my room. It then stomped right outside my door and my door swung open with extreme noise and force and standing at the door was, i shit you not, the same tall, black scrawny fucked up figure that i saw years ago. I practically shat myself. It stood there for a couple of seconds, but if felts like hours, then started stomping and sprinted towards my moms room. I don't know why but i instantly got up and ran towards the door and looked towards my moms room; nothing there, it vanished again. I dropped to the ground in shock, just as Kyle open his door and screamed ""WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT"" 
""It's back"" ,i said
""What's back?""
""the thing i saw hunched over Dylan""
I stayed up all night that night not wanting to sleep knowing that thing followed us to Australia

My most recent encounter with our old friend was last year. We'd moved into an old complex of houses that had a bit of a history in the crime side of things. We'd been living there for about 6 months and my friend from primary school, Jordan, was now living in the complex too. It was around 5PM and it was just Jordan Kyle and I in the house. I was playing my i-pod at the time, Kyle was in the kitchen and Jordan was behind me. Kyle decided to pick up a coin and throw it at an unsuspecting Jordan, who surprisingly, caught it, and returned fire. but then Jordan moved a little backwards and Kyle threw it further and harder. The coin flew through the air right past my head and stopped rigth in front of Jordans face, IT LITERALLY STOPPED IN MID AIR, it stood still in front of his face for less than a second and then was propelled back towards Kyle with nearly twice the force. We all just stood there speechless, not knowing if that had really just happened. Later that day we were showing a friend what had happened  and were back in the Kitchen messing around with coins to see if it would happen again. When suddenly a ball flew through the air at Kyle, like it had been thrown with force from the stairs leading upstairs. For the second time that day we were utterly speechless and had no idea what to do.
That night after Jordan had left and Kyle went to bed, i was making a late night snack. Dylan was in the living room watching TV and there was nobody else in the house. I finished making the snack and was about to head into the living room when in the corner of my eye, I saw the figure that i had seen twice before glide upstairs; same height, same scrawniness, same long fingers only this time it was a little misty, like a shadow, and it looked right into my eyes as it vanished upstairs.
I am still wondering what the actual fuck that figure is, all i know is that my mother has become a claire-voyant.I know for a fact that there is definately going to be a lot more of this thing which i have nicknamed ""the figure"".

For the time being i will keep an eye out for my little follower and if i see him/her again i will not hesitate to report the time, date, and details of the situation and of course reddit the fuck out of it.
for now redditors, i bid you farewell

the_dark_half,5,,1,1rhyj5,,7,"You know that feeling when you’re all alone and hear your name whispered? Maybe you’ve walked into a room only to suddenly feel a sudden temperature drop? Had things go missing only to re-appear in odd places? Maybe you’re like me and you lie in bed at night, only to feel like someone stroking your hair but when you become fully conscious and turn around, nothing. 
Think you walk through a cobweb or hair falls on your arms or neck and brushes against your skin delicately, tickling you? You check and nothing was there? I’m sure your parents tell you it’s nothing from a young age; perhaps because they themselves are deluded enough to believe that it is their imagination. They probably deep down fear it’s a ghost or apparition. Even they couldn’t know how much worse it really is.  Stop deluding yourself. It’s not a cobweb. It’s not the wind. It’s not nothing. It’s something far more sinister, an insidious force which slowly grows stronger the more you feed it your fear and attention. 

Some of you, I’m sure, will be fortunate enough only to feel cold spots and occasionally hear creaks and footsteps in your house. It’s such a common occurrence that people barely notice it and if they do, it’s the spookiest part of a generic horror movie, because those suits in Hollywood haven’t seen what these creatures are really capable of. If you believe in the paranormal you may experience the whispers of what I can only loosely refer to as their ‘voices’. I’m sure not many of you have had the misfortune to awaken to them standing over your bed, taking the forms of whatever creatures or person your subconscious fears most because it’s real form is so terrifying you’d probably die instantly or become paralysed with fear, a zombie-esque state you’ll never awaken from-and that would ruin their fun too early. If you don’t die instantly, seeing their faces will make your eyes bleed; hearing their voices unrestrained will shatter your ear drums and I’ve heard of cases where insides have been liquefied, skin melting and bleeding seeping out of every pore.

The first time I awoke to one in my room with me, it was after I’d given the footsteps and banging on the walls attention. I had thought it was cool, I even bought a stupid Ouija board and told them it was okay for them to try and talk to me. I had been lying in bed after a night of drinking so I passed off the initial taunts and laughs as nothing more than my intoxicated imagination, until my door slowly opened and in came one large hairy leg, followed by more spindly legs, followed by many eyes and two huge fucking fangs. Yep, a giant spider, bigger than a horse came into my room. I tried to scream, but that just resulted with me hyperventilating, then vomiting all over the floor. It strode in, all beady eyes on me and as it slinked atop my bed I tried to pathetically crawl away, but it held me down with its two front legs, piercing into the flesh of my shoulders as I whimpered like a small animal about to be devoured-which I was.  I felt the sharp pain of its fangs tear through my skin and inject me with poison that made my blood burn. I lay in bed, delirious, desperate, muttering for help. My ears were greeted with a cacophony of voices, screaming horrible things that were so foul that before that night had been unimaginable to me. I passed out shortly after, from fear, blood loss or the venom and awoke a few days later, believing to have all been a dream. I clung to that hope until I stepped outside my bedroom door and found dozens of small animals, birds mostly, wrapped up in what appeared to be spider’s webs, discoloured, drained of their blood and insides. All dead. I ran to the bathroom to throw up and caught sight of myself, dried blood caked on my body and face, puncture wounds all over me and strands of silky web still wrapped around my breasts, my stomach, my legs and in my hair. 

The second night I encountered one of them, they took the form of my uncle. I lived with my uncle for nearly 5 years while my father was travelling almost every week for business. I know my father loved me and desperately needed the money that he had to work from dawn until way after the sun set and had to leave me for long periods. He didn’t know what his brother did to me. That night as I became increasingly aware of the noises in my apartment and the feelings of someone touching me and whispering in my ear, I rolled over to see my uncle grinning at me. He crawled onto the bed and tied me down. I struggled, but when I did he beat me with his belt, like he had started doing when I was eight years old. I fought as hard as I could, tears burning my eyes and sobbing uncontrollably, but he kept cutting away at my clothes with a pocket knife and telling me to be a good girl. The torture that night lasted for many hours, possibly days. I try not to remember it. I thought I had moved on from those childhood years and buried them a few years ago, when my uncle died. This was not the last time the monsters took on forms like this to break me. They’ve only grown stronger with every drop of blood, with every scream and with every hopeless sob I’ve given them.

Their true form will only appear to you in dreams at first because they get to torment you in ways that won’t instantaneously butcher you or drive you insane, yet; they like to take their time with their toys. The dreams for me started after those incidents. I have seen what those beings really look like and…just thinking about it is enough for me to start violently shaking, unable to stop retching. The other day I wasn’t careful and thought about one of them and a stranger had to hold me back as I unconsciously started walking in front of a train. In my dreams, it is pure hell as they have my undivided attention for hours and can do whatever they want to me without my body breaking and bending the way it would in the waking world, but it all feels real. 
Part of me stares at length of rope on my coffee table and considers leaving this torment…but what if when I die, I get sent to their realm, to be their plaything forever? 

It’s not just the occasional brush against my skin, the odd floor creak and the rare moment of ‘is someone calling my name?’ Now I feel them on me at all times, their rough, sharp skin cutting mine, scratching me, violating every single part of my body. Their voices scream and howl at me, maniacally taunting and laughing at my never-ending misery. Even when I shut my eyes, I still see them, their hideous beings beyond any words the human language has to describe them to you. 

Most of you think of those household noises and strange occurrences as the work of ghosts, of spirits. Yes, it is so comforting for humans to believe these presences are the souls of dead people who are just sad and wandering, isn’t it? You want to be able to talk to someone no longer alive; you open your mind and let them in. Don’t. What’s out there isn’t human, it isn’t some person with unfinished business, what’s out there wants you to think that, to get comfortable with inviting it in and letting yourself become aware of it. 

Did you just hear that faint noise outside your window, like a soft breeze carrying a faint whisper? That creak outside your room? That faint sensation on your flesh? I hope not, because now you know what’s really there and they’ve always known about you.",Don't give them attention.,8,nosleep
Rhapsodeyus,1,,0,1rgtyq,,8,"Some may recall a story I posted a few months back, about shadow-like figures who visited me on a mission for knowledge, and afterwards, disappeared like ghosts. For those who do not recall, the story is [Curious Visitors](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l4dv2/curious_visitors/).

If you have not read that, well, you probably haven't missed much, but it will help with the backstory for this one if you do read it.

Done reading? Good, let's continue.

This happened last night, Sunday, November 24th, 2013. I woke up at precisely 4:27 AM, and I know this because I watched my small digital alarm clock on my bedside table flip to 4:27 AM as my eyes opened. I also noticed that my lamp was off (I sleep with the light on for safety reasons, since living with cats can be hazardous). However, I could see my plain, black clock in a pale blueish light.

My brain clicked. ""My laptop is on. I must have left it on and the power went out, so it's running on battery."" Then I remembered, quite clearly, turning it off and closing it before going to bed. That's when I felt a weight at the end of my bed, sitting in front of my laptop.

I sat up, looked, and spotted a shadowy figure sitting in front of my laptop. The NoSleep submission form was up. I coughed, and said quietly, ""You could have asked."" Instead of, say, a sudden spin and a glare from Brarger, as I expected, my visitor vanished instantly.

I didn't expect that, and it startled me thoroughly. My previous visitors would never have been so rude, and certainly would have asked my permission to access my personal computer. I shifted, tossed the covers aside, and moved to the end of the bed, to read what it had written.

I now wish I hadn't.

The message ends there. I suppose I interrupted the agent and he fled.

Whether this is genuine or not, I cannot know. If it is a fake by a rogue agent, then its purpose is unclear, but it is certainly unsettling. If this is a prank, then it's impressively elaborate, yet in poor taste.

JUVIE_MAKER,2,,1,1rhq9j,,8,"I have a nose for things. No seriously, all my life I’ve had a very strong sense of smell and I don’t mean for the average person. I have an abnormally, freakishly, ridiculously, absurd sense of smell. It’s been that way since I was a kid. Here’s a prime example, when I was about four or five I used to visit my grandmother (god rest her soul) every month in Daytona Beach for the summer. My grandmother was notorious for making the best homemade cakes in the neighborhood. I would always leave my Gran’s house at least ten pounds heavier each summer after gorging myself on her delicious treats. One Saturday, after a day of playing outside (when kids used to play outside!) I instantly smelled the aroma of cake wafting through the air, but something was…..off. There was another smell lingering behind the cake scent. It was kinda tangy, bitter, sorta nutty …just all around unpleasant. Being so young, I couldn’t quite put my finger on what the smell was but I knew I didn’t like it. Then out comes my Gran from the kitchen with a big slice of her freshly made cake on a china plate. She passes the dining room table and spots me standing there with my nose crinkled up in disgust.

Gran:  What’s the matter baby? Come sit at the table and have a slice of cake.

Five year old me: I aint eating that cake, it smells funny!

(Let me just interject for a second.  Now if your family is old school like mine, you know that a child is to NEVER disrespect an elder’s cooking! Especially if that elder is a family member, you just don’t do it! That is unless you want a black eye, ribs broken, missing teeth… you get the picture.)

Gran: Girl, get your hind parts over here and eat this cake before I slap the hell out of you!!

Oh geez…there’s that tone. You know it, you know it well. That angry deep tone that resonates from parents when their truly pissed off. You know… that voice that scares the living shit out of you and gives you’re delicate child-like mind nightmares for a month (or your whole life). Yeah that’s what I was hearing right about then. But still I was adamant. I would not eat that damn cake. That smell! It was just too potent. Now, you might be thinking, what’s the big deal? Surely you’ve smelled worse things than that cake before, which is very true. At that point in my life I’d smelled worse things before (WAY WORSE) but I’d never been subjected to eat those things either. Also, the stench of that pastry….it was just… so very not right. I was only a child but I was still old enough to know right from wrong, and that cake was definitely wrong! Even at that very moment I could taste its bitterness in the back of my mouth. With every inhale it burned and tingled down my throat.

Gran: Come over here and take this plate now!

Okay at this point I knew I was in REAL trouble. Even if my grandmother didn’t kill me, I was pretty sure I was in for the ass whooping of my life! I slowly started to back away from Gran as she moved closer to me with that dreaded cake. Even as she inched towards me that smell seem too magnify. With every step she took it grew more and more intense! “Girl, you better take this cake!” she yelled holding the plate out in front of her. I turned to run but she quickly snatched up my arm before I could get away. “No!” I shouted feverishly trying to pull away from her grip, “I don’t want the cake, granny!!” but my pleas of desperation came to no avail. My grandmother started to tug me towards the kitchen table, her fingers angrily wrapped around my tiny forearm. Suddenly, she yanked me forward making my body jump about two feet in her direction, tilting my face towards hers. She looked down at me with an awful glare. Dark hollow eyes glowered down from Gran’s wrinkled sockets. Her once loving face was now rigid and stiff with a sadistic expression that I had by no means seen before. “You will eat this cake!” She shouted through gritted teeth. “Even if I have to shove it down your throat piece by piece!” 

I had never seen this side to my Gran before. My once sweet, devoted granny had turned into this vicious monster plucked straight out of my worst nightmares. My small frame quaked in fear and tears began to seep from my eyes. I had never known terror like this. My insides loosened and squirmed like jelly making the contents of my bladder empty and leak down my legs. To say I was afraid would be the understatement of the freakin decade! But you know what? There was something else I was more fearful of. Even as I pissed myself in sheer horror from the presence of my devil-like grandmother, there was still something more bloodcurdling, more utterly terrifying than her…that fucking cake! 

“NO!!!!!!!” echoed from my lips in a banshee scream and with all the strength I possessed I juggernauted into my grandmother. My body throttled into her torso head first making a loud solid grunt bellow from the old woman. Her arms flew in the air (letting me go in the same instance) and her vast body collapsed backwards before suddenly….CRACK!
The sound of my grandmother’s head crashing along the rim of her kitchen table splintered throughout the house. Gran thudded to the ground like a sack of potatoes and the plate with the cake she so firmly held onto shattered on the floor. I stared at her lifeless body as blood began to seep through her head and flow on the linoleum. I was still too little to know the true meaning of life and death but I did know for sure that red liquid was not suppose to be running out of her head like that. I bent down and looked into Gran’s half opened eyes. They weren’t black any more. They’d gone back to their normal brown again. Not really knowing what to do I just stared down at the gruesomeness of it all, watching the chunks of yellow cake absorb the blood until each piece was just as red. 

To make a long story short the police were eventually called. My Gran’s weekly bridge game was on that day and a couple of her elder counterparts found her body, and me sitting in a pool of piss and blood staring at it. Needless to say there were lots of screams. Oh, and you’re probably wondering what that smell was, right? I actually didn’t find out until I was well into my teens what exactly it was. I was pouring it into my foster parent’s coffee one morning when it finally hit me…Cyanide. From the smell of it, Gran probably couldn’t have used too much either. Maybe half a teaspoon, give or take; totally undetectable to the average person’s nose…but not to mine. “So that’s what that was, go figure”.  I remember thinking that to myself as I stirred the cyanide into two mugs. My foster parents passed away later on that day, I wish I could say I feel sadness over it but I really don’t.  I was more consumed with thoughts on why my grandmother was trying to kill me? Was it because of what I’d done to Oscar, her cute little Maltese? I mean, if I’d known the oven wasn’t a suitable place to put a dog I might have done things differently. I was only two at the time. Or perhaps it had something to do with what happened with Mommy…that really was unfortunate. I didn’t want to hurt her, but she was an obstacle that just had to be removed. 

But anyways, that’s neither here nor there. I’m an adult now and those days are long behind me. I’m actually on my way to my boyfriend’s…excuse me….ex-boyfriend’s apartment right now. I’m visiting him and that slut he cheated on me with. And guess what? They just had a baby, isn’t that the sweetest thing.  ",A nose for things...,9,nosleep
1234FUCK,7,,4,1rhjmk,,6,"So my uncle has always been into the paranormal and he got me into paranormal investigation, Or ghost hunting to simplify it a few years back. Well I go with him on a lot of them and we do it for free for people who think something paranormal is going on in their houses. I always saw it as a nice little hobby to do on the weekends to blow of some time and I always liked being scared. I mean that’s how I even know about this sub-reddit because I like reading it. And that’s one of the only reasons I knew about what had happened on my last investigation. 


	We got a call from a family out in the middle of the country saying they had begun hearing weird voices when they were each alone but the 16 year old son was the one who had it happen the most. I went through every scenario I could think on the way there, Something was legitimately going on that was paranormal, one of the kids was lying and was fucking with the rest of the family and other such things. Well when we got there we talked with the family and everyone seemed happy except the two children. The son was as I said earlier 16 and the girl was 14, they seemed uneasy looking off into corners and such. I took a note about it but didn’t dwell on it that much. We went around the house marking places we would put cameras and getting the lay out of the house. Once we finished that we went back to our van and started getting ready. After we set up all of our equipment we each got our POV (Point of view) cameras strapped on and started our investigation. My Uncle took the upstairs, our colleague took the first floor, And I went into the basement to do a little investigating of my own. 


I made my way downstairs and grabbed my Walky-talky and radioed my uncle asking if everyone was ready for me to hit the main light breaker. He gave me the go ahead and I flipped the little switch plunging the whole house into darkness I held up the other camera I had with me so I could have a camera move around freely ( plus it had a night vision setting so I could see where I was going.) Well I turned it on and walked slowly to the chair I had placed in the room so I could sit comfortably waiting for something to happen. And after an hour or so of me questioning the darkness.. It answered back.
My instincts kicked in and I put a call in on the radio for everyone to tell me where they were. And everyone was exactly where they said they were supposed to be. My heart froze in my throat from fear but excitement so I stood and asked who I was talking to and I heard a small wispy chuckle before it said softly “You know who I am.” I swallowed hard before continuing to walk around the room and asking questions. It stayed silent for a few questions before I asked why it was here. It chuckled again before I heard a small sound. Like a door knob jiggling and I turned towards it. My camera landed on a door knob sticking out from a sheet that I guess had covered it before. I walked towards it slowly pulling the sheet off to reveal a shabby door about waist height with peeling paint and scratch marks.  I put in a call on the radio telling my uncle and the others I had found something and for them to meet me in the basement. I got no answer back but I assumed they had gotten the message. My uncle did that a lot; he tended to get over excited with these things so I figured he was just trying to get here as fast as possible.  But the paranormal curiosity ran in the family so I reached down and grabbed the knob, it was warm as if someone had been holding it for a longtime. I steadied myself before twisting it and pushing it open. 


I looked through my camera screen as I walked into the door. The atmosphere around me seemed to change instantly, even though all the lights in the house was off it just seemed to be darker and colder in here the basement itself.  I looked around in the room through the screen until I saw a lone chair in the center of the room. I walked forward until I was right next to it and then began looking around more. I jumped a bit at the bright light on my screen until I noticed it was a mirror. It was bolted onto a beam  next to the chair and when I looked to the left I noticed the same thing. I thought it was really strange so I walked around the front of the chair and accidentally kicked something over.  It was loud and then I heard a sound of rushing water. My heart leapt into my throat as I looked down and around looking for the source until my camera came upon a metal bucket slightly rolling with water coming out. I also saw a candle and a small match book and that’s when it hit me. My whole body filled with fear as the realization flooded my head…. This was a “three kings” set up.


 I turned towards the door pointing the camera as I looked through it I saw the door slam and I stopped. My whole body froze from pure terror and it took me a few seconds before I let out a scream for help. After I stopped I heard the soft chuckle come from behind me in the darkness and I just stood there with my eyes closed shaking as I felt a soft breath on the back of my neck I heard a voice.. My voice whisper right into my ear. “ Do you know who I am now?” I stood there for a second before screaming again and then I heard the door bust open and I saw flash lights on me and my uncle asking what was wrong. I just ran from the room to the breaker box and flipped on all the lights. I then sank to the floor looking at him as he sat next to me and asked all that happened. I just held out my camera to him and he took it. Before he watched it he asked me why I didn’t call for back up and I looked at him before telling him that I did. He looked at our colleague before watching the recording.


 After that he asked me if we all went in together would I go back in. I nodded as long as we kept the lights on and we went in. and it was as I thought. It was a set up for “ The three kings.” I shuddered as I turned to my uncle asking if he knew what it was. He didn’t so I explained it to him and I pointed to the bucket “ and it has been used recently. The bucket was full of water. “ My uncle nodded to me and put a wrap on the investigation. We went back home and I have decided to type this up. Tomorrow we will be going and talking to the family about what happened and who had done the three kings in the house.  


I think the three kings set up has something to do with what has been happening at the house. I will update you all on what happens after we talk to them.

OsamaBinHiding,3,,1,1rhxdo,,6,"Last night was like every other night for me. Have dinner on my own in my small, yet cost flat and watch a little bit of TV. Around 9 or 10 o'clock, I start to crack on with some work as I had a university deadline in a couple days time. The minutes started going faster and before I knew it it was 12 o""clock. 

""Where did the time go?"" I thought. It had only felt like a few minutes. However, this was a normal occurrence for me. The world kind of, disappears when I get lost in a train of thought and for the life of me, I can't break out of it.

I had just remembered that I had a seminar early in the morning and suddenly thought ""Fuck, I better try and get some sleep"" 

See, I live in an old building that has been converted into flats in the suburbs of a major city. So it isn't uncommon to hear floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and all the walls are very thin so noises in the middle of the night just tend to go over my head. I wouldn't consider myself someone who doesn't get scared easily but when you're familiar with floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and branches tapping your window - you tend to grow some thick skin.

Last night wasn't like any other night in my flat though. 

As I mentioned earlier, I was alone. My flatmate - let's call him, Evan for the sake of the story, was away celebrating thanksgiving with his family but he's away a lot so I'm used to spending a long period of time on my own. My usual night routine of showering, brushing my teeth and cleaning the kitchen was over and I went into my room to finally rest my head for the night and that was when I first noticed something. My drawers were all pulled open. 

To most people, this is probably nothing - but for me it wasn't normal. I suffer from borderline OCD and everything, especially in my room needs to be in order and I remember waking up and everything was in order. I hadn't left my flat today either. 

""I'm too tired for this shit"" I thought and went to bed. 

It's weird though isn't it? That something like a mattress and a duvet can make you feel so safe, like nothing can hurt you. I remember being a child and I made sure none of my limbs were outside of my bed incase something grabbed me in the middle of the night. Such a feeble piece of furniture can make you feel so safe.

Well, not anymore for me. Last night I heard the usual creaking of the floorboards - no biggy, right? However, as I drew closer to conscientious, I realised that these creaking sounds weren't coming from the surrounding walls and neighbouring flats but they were coming from under my bed.

And that's when I felt the unmistakable sensation of a cold, coarse finger stroking mine over the side of my bed.

TaylorBonaseraSr,0,,2,1rhb2e,,5,"I can explain why I'm so afraid of mirrors, or anything that could reflect light, even a glass door. It's so difficult for me to talk about it sometimes, but other times I feel her pressing me on to tell as many people about her as possible. She broke my mirror the first time, just crashed right through the glass and shattered the glass into a literal hundred pieces. It was such a pain to have to clean all that up. I got at least five cuts. But she didn't care. At the very least she didn't laugh at me or yell at me to clean faster. At least she was nice enough to check herself for that. Anyway, I got my mirror replaced. She didn't break the bathroom mirror again, but she broke the great mirror in the hallway while she was running through it. I don't understand how she did it, it's pressed up right against the wall. She'd have to ram her body sideways. She didn't even have any visible cuts. She told me she was sorry, and that she would try not to do it again. I believed her, and she was true to her word. But soon enough, I hear the crashing again. But this time it's my door. The majority of my glass door has been smashed through, but the weird thing is that the hole is shaped like Quasimodo. No one lives here that has a body shaped like that. The other times I checked her she didn't have any cuts on her, but this time she was bleeding so much from every part of her body that she had to go to the hospital. I had to sit there and watch her, but she couldn't explain what had happened. When the doctor asked, neither could I, because I hadn't been there. It's strange how selective she is; she won't smash into anything except mirrors or glass-looking things. Anywhere there isn't this kind of stuff, nothing bad happens. She tells me that she feels so cold whenever she walks by something like that, and she gets an uncontrollable urge to destroy it. She talks to me about it so often I feel like I'm beginning to share the feeling.

It's starting to unnerve me, and I don't want to live with her anymore. But I can't break the joint liability contract. She told me to cover all the things in the house that could possibly create a reflection, so I did. But I find her desperately tearing off the covers when she thinks I'm not looking.

One day I'd had enough so I decided to take off one of the covers in my room. It couldn't hurt, just for a little while when she couldn't see. She wouldn't notice. But after a minute of reveling in my refreshed reflection, I saw her standing there. So close. She was so ugly. She copied my expression and mocked my horrified face. She followed me here, to my own room. I couldn't turn around. There was no point. I felt a pressure from her on my shoulders so great I couldn't keep a straight posture. She was laughing at me.

But I'd heard that laugh somewhere before. And I'd seen that face before too. It looked so much like my own. She must have heard my thoughts, because she said she told me to never look at her by means of a reflection. I couldn't stand the sight of her face anymore, it was so scary. It'd been such a long time since I'd spent so many minutes just staring at her. I had to take control. So I bashed the bedroom mirror in, balling my bare hands into fists and repeatedly thrashing until I could feel the glass cutting into my skin.

It'd been so long since I'd last done that. Now every time I look, I can see her, feel her, I see her staring at her...our...reflection, through my eyes.",My Blank Mirror,7,nosleep
SeaDweller7,2,,2,1rhilw,,4,"I go to a regular school, its kindergarten to year twelve, so its pretty big. But, my school is an old public school, and the principle is ancient. Me? I am in year twelve, and I’m graduating next year, and my friends said I should share this story with you guys. 

Ok, where to start? Well, at my school we have a pretty serious problem with bullies, and when I say serious I mean it. One year our school was even on the news, but it was pretty traumatic. When I was in year nine, there was this little girl in fifth grade, called Melody. Her and me sort of talked sometimes, as she was a new girl and I was her school buddy (to show her around and stuff) She was a sort of short, curly brown haired, blue eyed and geeky girl. Glasses and all of that stuff, so your stereotypical nerd. Which pretty much was what she was.

After I moved up in to Tenth grade it was pretty clear that she was being bullied. Instead of gossiping or playing with the other girls, she just sort of walked around the school... bouncing a tennis ball and wandering around the grounds of the school. 

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

Then, half way through the year, school was stopped. During lunch they lined us up and called our parents. Sent us home. They just said there was an accident. My mother and father lived in Melbourne and I lived with my uncle and aunty, and they’re pretty laid back and all ‘come home when you feel’ so I stayed at school.

I saw five year six girls with that sort of ‘we know nothing it wasn’t us we didn’t do anything’ look on their face before I saw an ambulance and a white body bag. Out of the end of the body bag stuck out locks of curly brown hair, and the always-screeching birds seemed to sing a sweet tune. A melody.

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

Last week we had a substitute teacher who started screaming at a girl who was outside bouncing her ball after the end of lunch bell had rung. She didn’t realise Melody wouldn’t listen. 

No one knew why the back stairs from German were out of bounds for two months, and why the German teacher quit. No one asked why those five girls we’re stared at my Melody’s sort of... ghost.

I pieced it together. A simple push, a simple tumble. A simple death.

No one cares, all the kids just skip past her, all the laughter swallows up her silence. 

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

It has been a little over a year since I last wrote - just over a year since the last nightmare.  I was foolish to think I was somehow cured, that, as Dr. Lough suggested, getting it out of my head and into a journal would help.

I read back over my last and only journal entry, as I tried to describe the nightmare.  It is so chaotic and scattered, yet I'm unable to find any other way to convey the details.  That is the terror of the dream at its core - utterly chaotic.  Jerking from one sensation to the next, the hesitant probing of my fingers as they cover the smooth flesh where my eyes should be, to the damp defeat in realizing those fingers have torn away the protective lids in confusion.  All of this, in layers of sleep - waking to the comfort of my mother's figure, only to then know it is just another stage of the dream playing out, with her eerie voice echoing through my body:

""You're connected now.""

Even now, in understanding that my last entry seemed to bleed out through the pages, I'm struggling to form coherent thoughts onto this paper.  Each detail seems to tie into the next, only to fall apart when I try to see the whole.  I wonder what type of clinical association Dr. Lough could make?  Is this what schizophrenia feels like?  I have no way to explain it.  It is as though there is a novelist's grand plot line swirling around my body in paper shreds and each time I reach out I can snatch only a sliver of a scene, unable to ever piece the parts into an understanding.  I'm fairly certain this entry, and perhaps any subsequent entries, will be just as erratic.  I just cannot force these thoughts together.

So much has changed in the last year, it is so hard to recall my state of mind the last time the nightmare came to me.  I have a son now, nearly 6 months old.  We must have just found out Rachel was pregnant around the time I last wrote.  Could that have been a factor in the nightmare returning after years of peace?  Was my mind so overwhelmed with the thought of being a father, the changes to my life, the responsibility, it somehow dredged that old horror back from my subconscious?  I can't help but think it must have played a role.  It has been a blur, so many other things seem to have fallen into place.  Though they are exciting, it seems predetermined, somehow rushed.

Over the last decade I have had a slight obsession with the home I grew up in.  I knew I would live there once again - returning it to ownership in my family - though I never anticipated it would happen so quickly.  Rachel's grandmother died, leaving her an inheritance that allowed us to leap forward several years in our plans together.  It was Christmas Day, the day she died - I guess her last gift to us.  Three months after my son was born, we were moving back into the mountains, back to the walls I had called home as a boy.  

One thing I feel for certain, this home is the source.  The nightmare started here, always took place here, was always fueled here.  I'm beginning to remember things, or have recurrent thoughts I have not had for nearly two decades.  It is as though these things are unlocked from muscle memory as I walk this house.

As a child I would reach the top of the second floor staircase, which opened onto a hallway, always with my head down staring at my feet.  Left, at the end of a long hallway was a guest room.  Large floor to ceiling windows would reflect back a warped view of the person looking down to them.  Right, across a short landing was my bedroom.  I had trained myself to never look left at night - as the small nightlight by my bedroom door would throw twisted shadows onto my reflection in the long guest room windows.  If I would look up, I would become stuck in fear with the reflection.  The windows seemed to pulse with my heartbeat, flexing my body larger then smaller in the glass.  My feet became rooted in place, the black of the windows and the emptiness behind them tunneling out for me.  The nightlight would flicker in then out, each time causing my shape to jump forward, as though I were being pulled down the hallway towards the darkness.  I never remembered breaking loose, turning and walking back to my bedroom and going to sleep.  I would wake up in my bed hours later, staring at my hands, inspecting for blood and knowing I just had the nightmare. 

I learned, I kept my head down and did not look to the left.

Our first night in the home, that muscle memory followed suit.  After turning off the main floor lights, I climbed the staircase.  My son was sleeping against my chest, his arms wrapped around my neck and shoulder.  My head was down as I crested the top step, turning to the right, towards my room which was now his.  As I neared the bedroom door, his forehead left my shoulder.  His back straightened and his arm peeled away from my neck.  I felt his arm extend straight back behind my head.  I didn't need to look at his eyes, I knew.  Those eyes followed his arm to his hand, reaching down the hallway to the windows.  The nightlight flickered as he let out a giggle.  I took the last step into his bedroom and shut the door.

Sunny day in Nevada. Families having lunch outside, fathers teaching their sons how to grill steak, playgrounds
filled with kids. Every year I plan a trip with my son. Nevada has really nice caves in it. When I was little,
my father always took me there and so did his father. I didn't want to break this chain. I told Jake, my son, about that
cave that I used to visit but I did not have enough time to take him there until now. He was still sleeping when
I stepped in his room.
""Honey wake up!"" Jake opened his little eyes and whispered:
""What?""

""We are going to see the cave I told you about!"" he instantly jumped out of his bed and become so excited that
I can't even tell about it. He got dressed and ran to have something to eat. About five minutes later he was screaming
from the garage door.
""Hurry up mom!""

One hour car ride. Not the longest one he ever had. He kept asking me about the place. I just smiled and told him to
be patient. As soon as I parked the car, he blasted out the door and ran to the back of the car to grab two flashlights. 
""You ready?"" I asked him. He obviously was so we started walking towards our destination.
It was dark in there. Darker than anywhere else. Flashlights on.  He just kept pushing forward. Sometimes I couldn't 
even catch up with that little kid. After a sharp left turn I saw him standing there. He found it. The biggest hall 
in the cave. Every wall was shining when the light of our flashlights reached them.
""Beautiful isn't it?""

""It is indeed!"" he answered. He turned his head towards me but it was only q light at a corner 
that he could see. He totally crapped himself. ""Mommy wait for me!"" He started running towards the light 
that he could see. It is a maze down there. - MOM! - he screamed.
""I'm here honey!"" He caught up with me. He just gasped there and started to be a bit relieved as he realized 
that he was not alone in that dark cave again.
""Hey calm down little boy! I'm not leaving you here!"" went closer to him and whispered:  ""Or am I ?

jonssijonssi,0,,0,1rilff,,2,"Hey guys, I just wanted to tell you about my dream which kind of freaked me out. I've been having a lot of bad dreams for the past 3 weeks, but i think this one tops all of them. Anyhow, I dreamt that I lived with my boyfriend in a big house, it was night and we both were sleeping. Suddely i wake up, and I sit up in our bed. I'm fully aware that I'm sleepwalking but I can't stop myself, lay down again or do anything about my actions. I start walking out in a big hallway (this is where the main door is located), then I enter a smaller, much more narrow and dark hallway, and in the end is a small wardrobe-like room which is truly pitch black. This scared me a bit since I am afraid of the dark but I just keep walking, I don't even consider NOT to walk in to the wardrobe. So I find myself inside this pitch black tiny room and I close the door and I lock it. Once I have locked the door i just panic, I'm not afraid but I simply can't stop screaming, I remember the scream so well, it was a true scream of despair, I screamed at the top of my lungs but I still was not scared. I started to bang the door, the walls, everything while screaming and crying as hard as I could. Finally my boyfriend comes to the rescue and the door was open now, he just grabs me and tells me I was sleepwalking and I just said ""I know"" in the sternest voice. He's scared out of his life and crying and I just looks at him like he's crazy and then i just go back to bed like nothing happened. 
",The sleepwalking dream,2,nosleep
ephique,0,,0,1rikrx,,4,"I grew up in a small town in Ohio with my mom, dad and big sister. We were a normal family, neither happy nor sad, somewhere in between. I was always interested in music as a kid so I spent most of my time playing piano, practicing guitar or trying my best to write my own songs. It was also some sort of medicine for me; it helped me drift away into my own world when my sister and my mom had disputes. You see, my sister was one of those rebellious teenagers at the time that had to have their own way or the rest of the world had to suffer their unfair ranting. I hated it; I hated hearing her yell at my poor mother.

During a lonesome walk home from school one day I got a call from my dad, making sure that I didn’t have any plans and telling me that I had to come home as fast as possible. My dad never called my cell phone unless he really wanted something so I knew right away something was up. I remember jogging most of the route home, since my dad sounded so serious. It gave me the creeps to say the least.

I jumped over the fence surrounding our villa and paced myself into our house. The kitchen was the first room you’d see upon entering and it was empty so I assumed they were in the living room upstairs. As I was making my way up the stairs I could hear my sister sobbing uncontrollably, something had definitely happened. My dad was standing up as my sister was sitting on the couch, he told me to sit down as well.

I was scared and curious at the same time. Dad and my sister never really spoke or had any arguments since my father didn’t bother caring too much about any of my sisters business, so I could figure out that this wasn’t about my sister. I remember sitting there in dead silence with the exception of my sister shedding tears and trying to keep her crying as quiet as possible. My dad was looking like he had no idea what to do or say, as if he didn’t know how to explain something to me.

Finally, after a long pause my dad made an introduction to whatever I thought this was about at the time. He said: “Your mother…” and then he needed to grasp some air, and he continued: “Your mother has passed away.”

I was eight years old and I couldn’t grasp that concept. I didn’t understand death, or that my mom was eternally gone. I just sat there as I was developing an irrational anger towards god-knows-what, I remember thinking how unfair this was. I do however forgive my dad for telling me so bluntly, he didn’t know what to do and he was in shock at the time.

My sister continued crying, she asked dad how mom died although it was obvious she didn’t actually care to know at that precise moment. She was just being desperate and no one could blame her. I thought it was my sisters fault when I was there, I thought that was why she was crying so much. I didn’t shed a single tear; I kept it all inside. Of course that didn’t mean this incident didn’t haunt me for years, I never stopped thinking about my mother. 

The aftermath of my mother’s death is what has been shaping my life the recent years. My sister was very weak emotionally and it basically drove her insane. My dad had to take her to an actual mental hospital. Something I didn’t even think existed when I was eight. This resulted in that I didn’t get to meet my sister very often, my dad kept telling me she was in a special school for students that wanted a challenge; but I overheard enough conversations to know where she really was. I guess my dad was trying to keep me out of it, and I didn’t blame him. 

I was guessing that my sister wasn’t doing very well at the hospital since we got to see her less and less as years went by, something that troubled me; I hated living in this big villa of ours with just my dad. It felt so dead, and my dad had been more kept to himself after mom died. We didn’t do anything, I literally spent all time at home in my room, making or playing music. Me and my dad didn’t even greet sometimes when I came home from school, it was depressing. My theory for his change in behavior has always been that he blamed himself for my mother’s death, something that I’m about to get into.

You are probably wondering how she died by now, and it’s a legit question to be asking. The best answer I could give you is that I don’t know. My dad has always told me she died of liver-failure but for some reason that has always sounded like a lie to me. It didn’t add up, my mom never had any problems with her liver before and she didn’t drink. I think it was something he made up when I was younger because he assumed I wasn’t mature enough to hear the truth. In addition to this, whenever I asked my dad about this matter he’d get heavily upset. Nowadays I never ask about my mom’s death, nor do I even bring up mom as a topic.

Years went by and I ended up being fourteen. It kept going like I just described, I spent most times in my room playing music as my dad did whatever he was doing on his own in the house. My dad did work, he had the night-time shift at a local bottle factory, I’m not joking, he actually made glass bottles for a living. He had higher ambitions but most of them got crushed when he and my mother got my sister, they had to move and dad basically had no other financial option than to quit the university he was attending at the time and get a quick and close job. You guessed it, the bottle factory.

I was riding my bike home late at night after spending the evening in the school library at one point when I was fourteen. My school was the type that had an after-school library that didn’t close till 11 pm. I didn’t need any of the books or supplies that the library offered; I just studied there sometimes since it felt less depressing than my father and our lonely villa. Either way, I hadn’t seen my sister for two years that night and I was starting to get the idea that I wouldn’t see her again for another two. 

When I arrived at the house the front door was open, “This is odd?” I thought. Upon closer examination I realized that someone had taken the spare key from its hidden spot underneath one of my mother’s old jars. It’s never smart to have a spare key hidden right next to the door, number one mistake people do when it comes to spare keys. It did look like whoever had taken it did suffer a struggle before finding it. The rug outside the door was all muffled up and there were scratches on the door, around the lock. I suspected we had been robbed so I pulled out my cell phone, ready to call the police. 

This is when I heard something coming from inside the house. I was dead scared to say the least, this could have been armed robbers or maybe something worse, I didn’t know. It sounded like someone was grinding furniture against the floor, trying to move it. It was so dark as well, I remember not seeing more than pitch black looking into the open door, technically if someone was in there they would have seen me because of the street lights. I started to slowly pace into the house, walking towards the noise. This is where I had to make a decision, was I going to suddenly turn on the lights in order to reveal whatever was in there or was I going to approach it in the dark? I picked the former. I was just going to switch the lights on when I could see someone strafe into the light coming in through the kitchen window. It was my sister, naked. My entire mindset had to change into a totally different way of dealing with the situation; it took me a good couple of seconds to assume she escaped the hospital. 

I switched on the lights in an instant. She had redecorated the entire kitchen, in the dark. Of course it all looked hideous and random; she didn’t know what the hell she was doing. I remember being in a slight discomfort, I had never seen my sister naked in my entire life. I also hadn’t seen her for a good couple of years at all. She didn’t look very comfortable either, she looked like she didn’t know who I was and was wondering what I was doing there.

I uttered “Linda?” out loud, that was her name. She didn’t respond, she just continued standing there looking at me. “Don’t you remember me, I’m your brother.” I still couldn’t get any feedback out of her; it was as if the wheel wasn’t spinning at all. I wasn’t sure what the protocol here was, not knowing the number to the mental institution or anything I figured I’d try to call dad, before I got to press the call button on my cell phone she uttered: “Don’t call dad.” This is when I realized she couldn’t be completely empty inside after all.

“You don’t want to call dad.” She continued.  I had no idea what to do, I assumed this was part of the reason she was in the mental hospital in the first place. Luckily my dad got home at that point, not coming from a finished shift at work. He had a good five hours at least left, I assumed the hospital had phoned him and told him about the situation. My father ran into the house as fast as he could.

This is when something I didn’t expect happened, he told me to leave. He pointed at the door as if I had no idea how to find my way out of my own house. I asked him where I was supposed to go, he told me to wait in his car. Judging from how serious my dad seemed I didn’t think twice about it, I ran out to the car. As I was sitting in the car I could see my sister walk past the kitchen window a couple of times, I remember how she made no effort to cover her breasts. I had no clue what the two of them were discussing, although I never saw my sister move her lips so I’m guessing my dad did most of the talking. 

After a couple of minutes my dad started to walk to the car, he joined me inside. I remember asking why he didn’t bring Linda with him, “Don’t call her that name!” he shouted in response. I was so confused at this point. Dad started the car and drove me to my only friend’s house; I didn’t see him very often though. I was a lone wolf growing up and I still was at this point, I didn’t really create any friendships. I remember sitting in the car as he ran up the steps to ring my friend’s doorbell, his mother opened in her night dress and looked confused. I assumed my dad made up some emergency story to cover what was going on in order to get me a place to stay overnight. I didn’t even know what was going on to be fair.

Whatever he told them worked, I got to spend the night at my friend’s place. Tim’s place, to be exact. It was pretty awkward I remember, I only saw Tim a couple of times a week and that was when we shared classes in Spanish. We got to be desk-mates because the teacher made up whom to sit next to each semester, so we weren’t very close. 

It was a Friday so there was no school the morning after; I guessed that made it easier for my dad, leaving him the freedom to pick me up whenever he wanted to. He did, but not before giving me enough time to fully experience the awkward breakfast conversations with Tim’s parents, both trying to justify me as Tim’s best friend. I don’t know. Tim didn’t have many friends I guess.

On the way home I asked my dad what was going on the night before and he basically stopped the car and stared at me, as if I was mocking him. I remember how desperate he looked, as if he had no fire left in his heart. He uttered the words: “Do you think I wanted any of this?” as he grabbed his hair in regret. “All I wanted was a normal family with no circumstances, and I’m not blaming you when I’m saying this because frankly you are the only sane member left in this livelihood of ours.” Is what came out of his mouth next. I tried to comfort him, telling him that he had done a good job raising me and what not; I really didn’t have a lot of cards in my deck at this point. I mean my dad was basically losing it.

When we got home he told me that he was sorry, and that I should go up to my room. I did go up to my room but I got to tell you; I was starting to get very anxious about my dad. I really wanted to know what the hell was going on. I spent that night recording some guitar sessions for a song and reading books while listening to some ambient records I had found online, I couldn’t sleep so pulling an all-nighter was my only real option. I was reading “A Brief History of Time” for a science project in school, I was somewhere in the middle section of the book and started to get dry eyes. I figured I’d go downstairs into the kitchen to get myself something to drink when I got shocked upon opening the door to the hallway. I saw my mother standing just outside, looking right at me for a fraction of a second. Had all this hassle from the last couple of days driven me insane? It freaked me out so much that I ended up never getting a drink. 

The image of my mother outside my door haunted me that entire night, I kept thinking about it as I couldn’t sleep. She looked deranged, scared and raw. The shortage of light sources in the hallway made her look like she was from a black and white 50’s movie. I kept begging for the sun to rise up, I even did that thing when you close your eyes and try not to open them because you never know what you’ll see. I might have been fourteen, but I can openly admit that I was dead scared.

It finally came to be morning and I ran downstairs, still not fully opening my eyes while passing the hallway. I remember greeting my dad who was sitting in the kitchen drinking orange juice. I was just about to pour myself a glass when he said: “I think I need help.” While holding the glass of juice as if he wasn’t sure he was going to drink the rest of it. I asked him what he meant and he said that he wasn’t sure, that he had felt very uncomfortable and unstable lately. He also mentioned that he was thinking of joining some people from his work in playing golf, he thought that could give him some relief. I told him that sounded like a pretty good idea, jokingly adding that it’s better than hanging around the house doing nothing. He looked offended when I said that, something I didn’t really understand since he obviously worked all night, so that would justify him sleeping through the days.

I understand that some of you reading this are wondering how the hell I could have been fourteen and still not know how my mother died. Well, it’s hard to explain how uncomfortable of a character my dad was at times, and it felt a bit like I was offending him whenever I had to ask because part of me did actually believe she died of liver-failure. I mean it was possible. Imagine if it was true, and I kept asking my dad as if he lied to me. That’s the type of thoughts I had in my head about the whole thing.

Having that explanation out of the way, I did summon the courage to confront my dad one last time. It was a couple of days after the conversation about my dad picking up golf; I just walked into his room unexpected. A part of me had wanted to do this for a long time because I really never knew what he did in his room; it looked similar to an office which is nothing he’d ever need since he was a labor worker in a bottle factory. He was actually sitting at his desk. Not only that, but the desk was flooded with paper-work of some sort, maybe he had picked up an accounting job for the factory during the day, something he could manage from home. I didn’t ask; I had a big enough question for him as it were.

I dragged out a small chair he had behind the door and figured I’d sit on it. It was somewhat squeaky and not very comfortable, better than standing up anyway. Then I leaned forward and I was just about to ask when he interrupted my train of thought by saying: “You want to know about your sister, and what happened the other night. Don’t you?” This is where I started to play along because he was already looking emotionally hurt, bringing up mom here would have been a car-crash. I told him that I was indeed there to ask about my sister. He took a good pause before he bluntly exclaimed it to me: “Your sister is not right in the head; she’s in a mental hospital.” I couldn’t believe he hadn’t figured out that I would have known this by then. Not wanting to make a scene I just pretended like I didn’t know. He explained the context, telling me that she couldn’t take our mother’s death. A tear started climbing down his cheeks, and then he asked me if there was anything else I wanted to talk about. There was no way I could bring up something as sensitive as my mother at this point so I told him that everything was fine, and then I left the room.

I realized on my way up to my room that my dad was fragile and very close to losing his mind in this problematic family business. I had no idea how I’d ever get the truth about my mother out of him. When I finally had landed on my bed in my room again, the image of my mom started crawling back to me. The grey scaled portrait of her in the hallway, was my mind playing tricks on me? I also had a slight feeling that I remembered it from somewhere. I mean it was my mom but that exact stare and look she had, not only did it frighten me but I swore I had seen it before. 

Night landed again, I hadn’t spoken to my father again that day. I was facing the same obstacle that I had the other night, I was too afraid to go downstairs because I thought I’d see my mother again. We all know you can imagine things in the dark, kids do it all the time. It’s as if your mind fills in the gaps, but that incident the other night was different. I got more scared the more I thought of it and figured that I’d open the door to the darn hallway, and turn on the lights in order to feel slightly safer. I’m not going to lie, I did open that door very slowly but as it turned out; there was no sign of my mother. I turned on the lights and went back into my room.

Still not wanting to go to bed, not only because it was spring break at this point but also because I was a bit scared I figured I’d listen through some of my older songs. I had loads of them; most of which weren’t very good however. I was still learning how to create music and I never really thought of myself as particularly good, especially not at writing my own songs. I guess I was decent at playing other people’s songs. I basically went through my songs in chronological order, it was interesting because was able to hear how much I had improved over the years. 
It took me a good three hours to get past most of my songs, and I was reaching the more recent creations of mine. I heard something in one of the songs that I never had paid any attention to before; it was a slight breeze of white noise in the middle of one of my guitar riffs. Knowing that this wasn’t an overworked track yet, it was made just days ago and I hadn’t gotten around to mastering it yet, I figured I wasn’t going to give it more of a thought. That was until the neurons fired, that track was made the day I couldn’t sleep, the day I saw my mother in the hallway. Being a bit gullible I figured that I’d give it a go using my acoustic headphones. I tried everything. I played the song backwards; I cut out bass, middle frequencies, high frequencies and even listened to individual recordings of the instruments and samples. I couldn’t hear anything suspicious, just that white noise. 

I was a bit disappointed, at the same time relieved. Although that white noise shouldn’t have been there, nothing in my room could have made a noise like that. I didn’t want to over-think the situation, so I ended up hitting the bed. Later that night, as I still had problems sleeping I was laying in bed listening to the same ambient soundtracks that I was using nights before, slowly dozing off to sleep. I hadn’t been asleep for much more than ten minutes when I started to ascend into that state of sleep when you’re in a dream at the same time as real life is somewhat happening to you. I could hear a thumping sound coming from somewhere. Before I knew it I got woken up by a loud bass noise, it sounded like some kind of a technical disorder. I continued lying in bed, trying to figure out if I just dreamt about the noise or if it actually occurred, this is when I heard a much dampened sound coming from the other side of my room. It sounded a lot like someone was trying to get some kind of sound device to work. It got quieter and quieter and when I thought it was about to disappear I could hear a voice; very distorted and unstable speaking in what I believe was Russian. 

It took me a couple of minutes but I finally realized what I thought the sound was coming from, I had left my old amplifier on from when I was playing guitar. I bounced out of bed in order to turn on the lights. I was overlooking the entire room as I hit the switch, for the blink of an eye, just next to the amplifier I saw my mom again; just as the light went on. The same stare, same face, still that black and white filtered look from before. I got so shocked I fell down on the floor, the noise coming from the amplifier stopped in the same instant. I wasn’t sure what to make of this, and I definitely didn’t want to tell my father about what I had seen, knowing he has already thrown one of his kin to a mental hospital. 

I had a lot of sleep to catch up on but unfortunately this wouldn’t let me sleep, I just couldn’t sleep at all. I never believed in ghosts or anything growing up, these two small incidents with my mom being my only experience in what could be categorized into the matter. I thought and assumed I was becoming what my sister had become. Whatever this all meant, and needless to say; I didn’t get any sleep that night either.

I met my father in the kitchen the next day, he was looking a lot better than the last time I had seen him. He kept going on and on about how much he was looking forward to playing golf with his work-crew later that afternoon. I was happy for him; he deserved some time out of the stress. After the conversation about an afternoon of longing for a spot in the shade and waiting for your turn on a grass field he added: “Have you been thinking of your mother lately?” As if he could read my mind. I told him that I was always missing my mother, and that I had indeed thought of her a lot lately. He stated that he thought I had. I had no clue why.  Short after that he left for playing golf.

I kept thinking of why my amplifier was acting up that night, I started recalling a clear memory of turning it off after I was done playing. In fact, I knew I did since the amplifier was connected to an electricity hub that I used to turn off a small lamp I had next to my bed, how could it have been on? I had no idea. 

Since my dad was out of the building I figured I could use this afternoon without his presence to get some answers. I stepped into his room to investigate what he had been doing sitting at that desk of his all those hours. I grabbed a bunch of paperwork and sat myself on the double bed next to his desk, it got me a slight reminder on how he hadn’t gotten rid of the bed he shared with my mother yet. The first paper I started examining looked like a letter of some sort, as if it was a letter inside a legal template of some company. I don’t know how I’d describe it better than that. After further examination I found out it was a letter from my sister sent to our address, I remember wondering why dad wouldn’t show me something like this: 

“Daddy, why didn’t you visit me last weekend. I thought you were coming back, I was waiting for you. I’m sorry if I made a scene, I thought something had happened to you! I ran to you because I wanted answers, no one has answers here. I’ve been getting visits lately, why can’t you come to me at the same time?”

I fixed some grammar and a whole lot of spelling errors for the sake of explaining this to you, my sister had the linguistic abilities of a five year-old in this state. On after-thought I guessed my dad didn’t tell me about letters from my sister since they would inevitably prove that she wasn’t in a special school for people who were after tougher challenges. Although thinking about it, that doesn’t sound ridiculously different than a mental hospital.

The rest of the papers seemed to be a real mixture of work-related things and records of local police-investigations. Why would my father be looking into cases of murder, pedophilia, rape and almost anything you can think of? It wasn’t really my business what he did with his spare time but this was just outright messed up. I knew he had a friend in the police force, that was either the reason he had these or just the tool he used to get them. I didn’t even want to know at the time, I had enough stuff on my mind already and I hadn’t slept in far too long.
I apologize to whoever reading this if it seems that I’m dragging it out with details a bit too much here and there, I’m only taking precautions to make sure that I’m telling it right. If I’m finally going to tell my story I want it to sound right. 

My father never came home after golfing so I assumed he went directly to work, which made complete sense. It was starting to get late into the evening and I had absolutely nothing better to do than to once again sit in my room, I was trying to figure out ideas for new songs on my guitar. This time I wasn’t using the amplifier since I was legitimately scared of the noises occurring again. My amplifier has been known to pick up foreign radio broadcasts before, something that explains the distorted Russian speech last time, I wasn’t worrying about that. I was thinking about my mother showing herself again. Not that I was sure that it had anything to do with the amplifier itself.

Not too long into that night I started feeling sick of being in-doors for so long, and I felt like I could use some kind of fresh air as a vacation from all this unexplained mystery I had been experiencing. I remember being on the sane side of the fence, thinking critically and trying to find solutions, not marking everything as if it was a conspiracy from hell. I figured I’d take my bike down to a local gas station, not more than ten minutes from my house; I wanted some chips, candy and maybe a couple cans of soda. 

I scrambled together some change I found in my room and took off; I got there faster than I thought I would. It wasn’t cold outside either; it was a pretty smooth night. After grabbing some generic brand of chips, Skittles and a couple cans of coke I paid for it and left. I didn’t spend much time in the store, but apparently enough time to get my bike stolen. With no bike, feeling like a stupid idiot for not locking it I had to walk home. 

Something out of the ordinary happened after this, and I wasn’t even sure if I was seeing things at first. I was walking on this huge open road; I guess you could say it was somewhat of a country road. It was tied together with the forest behind our house. It was the type of road that didn’t have any traffic other than truck drivers, passing once every couple of hours at night. I didn’t want to believe my eyes at this point but I saw my sister standing alone wearing what you’d imagine someone coming from a mental hospital would wear. I assumed she was looking for me; she was definitely staring at me. 

I continued walking, not necessarily fearing my sister. It somehow still felt as if I had a bond with her, that she would never have done anything to hurt me. As I approached her she didn’t give me any response what so ever, she was just staring at me in a light-blue scrub-coat, looking lifeless. I had reached talking-distance; I couldn’t believe this was happening. It felt surreal, like one of those scenarios you can’t be prepared for in real life. She had started to shake a bit, I couldn’t tell if she was freezing or if she was nervous. I asked her if she was looking for me out there, and if she had escaped the hospital. She didn’t respond. I got the notion that she was slightly scared of me, as if I was a threat to her. 

After a short gap of silence I noticed that she was holding something behind her back. I got a bit worried that she had some kind of a weapon, or a blunt object to swing at me so I stepped back when I spotted it. She started to slowly bring it forth, it was a plastic bag. From the way she was holding it I could tell it wasn’t heavy, or dangerous for that matter. I withdrew the step back I took earlier and tried to peer down into the bag, then she started to stretch it out to me: “I took this from your house the other day, I’m sorry. I think this belongs to you. Jonathan.” 

I do realize that I never told you my name, it is indeed Jonathan. I was slightly astonished that she had remembered my name even; she seemed to be so out of it. I remember grabbing the plastic bag, she wouldn’t let go of it too lightly either, it was as if she still wanted it. After I had gotten whatever was in the bag we shared another brief moment of silence, she wouldn’t stop staring into my eyes during these. Then she told me to never mention any of this to our dad. Shortly after she started walking towards the forest; as if she knew where she was heading. 

I saw the headlights of a car coming straight at me and my sister, whoever was in this car was driving way ahead of the speed limit. I noticed when it started to get closer to us that it was my dad’s car, acting on impulse I threw myself into a nearby ditch, as I got to witness my dad chasing after my sister. I didn’t even know if I wanted him to catch her or not, she was purposely running away from him. He dragged her into his car and they both drove away, heading the direction he was originally going. This was the second time she had successfully escaped this mental hospital, and how the hell did my sister make it so far both times? Something wasn’t right, I knew from when I was younger that the hospital wasn’t anywhere close to where we lived since my dad sometimes was gone for ten hours upon visiting her. Of course at the time it was supposedly a special school, but that doesn’t change the logic of it. He never brought me with him whenever he visited my sister, since he kept me in the dark about the whole hospital thing.

I ran the rest of the way home, trying not to drop anything; I still had all the items I bought at the gas station. I wanted to make sure that I could get home before my dad did; I had no clue whenever he would get back, and not wanting him to find out whatever was in the bag my sister gave me. I couldn’t spot my dad’s car in the driveway so I felt relieved as I stepped into the house. I didn’t bother putting my drinks in the fridge or anything, I made my way back to my room as fast as I could. I don’t really know why but I locked the door after me, as if there was something to fear. I sat myself on the bed with all the lights in the entire room switched on. I made sure to put all the bags with snacks in them aside; as I was getting ready to dig into whatever my sister ran into the night to give me. 

I never really thought of something until now, and that is how my sister could have found me. It must have been a coincidence, or she had been following me for a while; knowing she couldn’t approach me in the store. I don’t know.

I looked into the bag, it seemed to be random belongings from the drawers in our living room, and maybe some stuff from one of the cupboards we had in the kitchen. After sorting out stuff that had no relevance what so ever, for example there was a roll of tape in there. I planned to spend more time on the more interesting items. The first thing I picked up was a small collection of family photos, most being after mom died. The next thing I could grab was a couple of rocks; they weren’t even dry, I guessed she must have gotten those just before she passed me the bag. There was only one thing left in the bag, an usb-stick. 

I took the stick out and threw away the bag. Then I started looking at the photos as I was trying to reason why she would have taken any of these from our house. The only thing that somewhat made sense is that a couple of them were from when she wasn’t sent to the hospital yet, but it was pretty much pending already. In fact, most of these photos took place a couple of weeks after our mother passed away. On one of them it’s my sister showing off her prom dress she was planning on wearing, she actually wasn’t acting too badly the first couple of weeks. I guess she didn’t process our mother’s death until later or something. Another photo is of dad’s old car, he had to sell it in order to compensate for our family’s financial depression from when we lost the main income our family had, my mother’s candle business. He loved that damn car with his entire heart; we even used to joke about how mom was jealous of the car. 

There were more photos but I stopped going through them when I realized a couple of them had a handwritten marking of the letter “x” behind them. It noticed this when I was flipping them as I was trying to get them all to be facing me. I sorted the photos with no marking away and started to focus more on the ones with the marking. I figured my sister must have had done this, for what reason I was about to find out. I kept staring at the first picture; it was the one I told you about earlier, the one of my father’s old car. It was a Pontiac from the early 80’s and it must have cost him a fortune. I never had any particular memories of the car; I remember it spending most of its time in our garage.

I kept looking at the photograph and the more I stared at it the more I started to wonder why my dad hadn’t use the car more, he obviously loved it. The photo was taken for an ad in the newspaper, for selling it of course. I was just about to put the sad photo away when I caught a glimpse of my mother sitting in the backseat. It wasn’t very clear and she seemed somewhat transparent. She had the same drained-out appearance and blank stare that she had from when I saw her in the hallway outside my room, and this was taken after her death. I couldn’t believe what I was looking at. I remember dropping the photo out of shock; so many thoughts started circling inside of my head.

dinofinger,0,,1,1rie11,,1,"    17^th May 2007.
I followed my dad went to Grandma's house. My cousin who lives with grandma, had a suspicion that something had happen to Aunt L &gt; *Her initial would be appropriate here* &lt; Aunt L was never in her sound mind but she prefer to live alone which is the best option avoiding the troubles she would cause to others. Grandma has a problem of [nagging](https://www.google.com/search?q=nagging&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a) disease which makes more Aunt L better suit live far from her lectures. 

Back again to my cousin, who received a call from Aunt L's neighbour. Her respond was *there was a sudden silent for the past four days*. Aunt L was never a social person who goes anywhere she wants and always out. She prefered to live in her tiny apartment secluded only her herself and herself she enjoys being with. But her neighbour help us to watch for her just in case for anything. So we respond to go and visit her house. My father, my cousin and I, the three of us went together with nothing held us back. 

As we arrive by the door, we knock and knock. From the window we can see noise screen from her small tv at the corner. But there was no sign of her. Somehow her grill lock and the door were changed, the key my cousin brought didn't fit at all. Maybe she doesn't want us to barge in anytime we want. My dad took the liberty to call the locksmith while giving positive thoughts to my cousin that everything was fine. 

30 minutes pass. The locksmith do his magic and opened the door. Such stench came out in full loaded right to our faces. Right in front of the door we can see Aunt L laid still in the toilet facing the floor. A 15 year old me shocked and I just watched her body in strip condition only a towel covered her other half and her faeces was right below her and all over behind her. Yet she is still alive, blinking and gasping.

My dad pull me back allowing my cousin to go in. I can still feel my father clenches my arms so tightly when he saw his sister. He said ""*[I better call the ambulance](http://www.wikihow.com/Call-an-Ambulance)*"", so he did and left. My cousin call me out to help pick her up. But she was too heavy, we can't even push her to the side. So my cousin rinse her with water to clean her off. I was told to took a towel and wipe her face. I could say her face was in a total blankness. 

25 minutes later the ambulance arrive. They took her with a stretcher. Both of us went down to send her off. I can remember certain vision of some neighbours pry on their window looking out what was happening. My dad went together with Aunt L, so left me and my cousin. Soon my mom and sister arrive bringing cleaning equipment. We spent whole 3 hours cleaning her house. Based on what I heard my cousin said ""*The man who always deliver her food got no respond from her for three days. That's when he ask the neighbour if she had gone somewhere. I bet if we were too late, she might have gone by any minute unconscious on the floor*""


    18^th May, 2013
We had her funeral in the day after the day we thought she would died 6 years ago. Funny the coincidence of the date just *one day after* we laughed. My cousin gave a speech said she was a fighter. Indeed she was. I think her life is better after that 17^th May living in the retirement home. She was more happier than before she was a shut-in. R.I.P Aunt L, our auntie we always concern hereafter. ",Brief moments,2,nosleep

As I was doing this, the big rocking chair next to his litter box was swaying, and I gave him a quick glance. I felt him sniff at my ear. He then jumped off the chair and walked into the kitchen. I thought nothing of it for a few seconds, then froze. ""Oliver!"", I called. I then walked to the door and looked outside, he was napping on the steps.

echoes007,4,,2,1rhee9,,2,"I’ve always been a non-religious person. I was brought up by parents who told me to question everything. To not believe the crap that is forced down our throats daily. But I’ve always felt a whole in my life when it came to that stuff. I went as far as trying LSD and DMT to achieve this “religious experience” we all want, but I never got it. So, after a while, I just gave up and moved on and accepted there is no God, or spiritual experience, or anything that’s real, that will make me see life in a whole new perspective. Naturally, this got me down and depressed a bit. It was then when I started seeing 11:11 everywhere. It started one night when I was doing some heavy drinking and decided to do some coke lines. I remember vividly, my heart stopped, and I remember a sound, like a blender going off in my head. When I forced myself to snap out of what had happened to me, I remember the first thing I looked at was the clock on the cable box. It read 11:11. This stuck with me for a long long time. I felt like some force or spirit was forcing me to look at the clock when it was 11:11 in the morning and 11:11 at night. As if reminding me that it saved my life. This was going on for a while, when I went as far as Googling what it was. Unfortunately, the 11:11 thing was associated to some spiritual stuff, things I thought were bullshit to begin with. But still, 11:11 was always there. Slowly I stopped thinking about it, and my 11:11 experiences were less and less. It wasn’t until last week when I was driving home (I was butt sober) from an event when it started raining. My tires and brakes were messed up and I didn’t get a chance to change them, and besides, it hardly ever rains in this town, so this came as a surprise to me. As I was driving up a hill, I lost control of my car completely on the wet road, and was literally fighting my steering wheel and slamming on my brakes to stop the car, but I couldn’t. This went on for about five seconds until I finally stopped the car in the middle of the road. Again, when I snapped out of my panic mode, the first thing I looked at was the time, and it said 11:11. I’m not one who believes in coincidences, but this has me thinking I have some angel or spiritual entity looking after me. Even though I don’t believe this stuff, there is NO way that could happen. Has anyone else experienced 11:11, or has randomly been “forced” to look at a clock when it’s 11:11? Or is it my brain playing tricks on me because of the LSD/DMT I took? ",11:11,4,nosleep
Jerbsybear,0,,0,1rh5g6,,2,"There are tales of a man committed to Central State

Who killed his wife and children while he asphyxiates

His doctors with the bloody spinal cord

Of his fat nurse, who cares if she was old

When the guards rushed in, it was no problem at all

bashing their brutish faces straight into the wall

Bursting through the heavy front doors

He killed everyone on the first floor

No one would stop him, no, not this time

5 years of waiting, no stopping on a dime

He had to get out on this night

To meet his lover, one at first sight

Taking his science class, year after year

Convinced that she loved him, held him dear

Called her ""favorite student"" and all

Had her parents give him a call

To invite him to dinner, on a cold winter's night

Slaughtered her family, their faces were a sight

In the judge's court, he mercilessly pleaded insanity

When, in reality, it was egotistical vanity

If he couldn't have her, no one can

To kill her new parents was the plan

Standing outside of the house that was soon to be theirs,

Looking to seek justice, to seek what's fair

So as he broke in and brandished the knife

She knew he was back to take a life

So quickly she fled into the night

Leaving behind more victims, as she took flight

She ran two miles straight to the highway

Waving for anyone to stop, to go her way

As hand grabbed her from behind the bushes

His knife drives deeper and deeper as it pushes

Past her vitals and deep into her heart

All flashbacks of her life seemed to fall apart

As he whispers ""This...feels so right""

Her mind tries to escape into the night

The fires of his greed are not yet doused

As he tries to get back to the house

He plans to take another life

While sharpening his serrated knife

""Am I next, is he coming,"" you cry with fear

InsanityInABottle,0,,1,1rgw03,,2,"“Extra, Extra! The Piggy killer is at it again!” Yelled the paperboy, holding a darkened paper above his head, screaming the same phrase over again, as if it was no big deal. I walked towards him and asked him “How much?”
“Only ten cents sir.”
“Ha. Must be a pretty good story then.” I said, as I fumbled for a large dime. I handed it into the boy’s hand, it’s gleam bouncing the light of the sun, veiled through the mist of rain into my eyes. I blinked quickly and grabbed the paper, quickly turning from the boy, hearing “How about a tip sir?”
“How about you wipe your ass with the metal I’ve already given you.” I said back to the boy, who furrowed his brow and continued screaming for new customers. As I walked along Hero’s Avenue, I kept the paper open, reading it over again. In large font, shouted “Piggy killer’s new victim!” with a picture of a woman, apparently known by the name of “Jessica Turrow.” She wore a large smile on her face, as she raised a glass of champagne above her head for a toast, I presumed.
	The article read “The psychopath, depicted as a man with a pig’s head on worn over his own face, has struck again. Witnesses described him as large, while wearing a reddened trench coat, then finally, a bib, which read the term KISS THE COOK, slathered neatly against his chest in gore. He had organs and even a human spinal cord attached to his coat and as usual, was found was mist was floating through the air and at dawn. We had identified the victim, through a ring found on the hand of the woman, who had been chopped to pieces and nailed against the side of the church. If you are to spot anyone fitting under the description, contact the police immediately, or you may be his next victim.”
	I laughed as I watched terror shrouding the faces of everybody who grasped a paper in their hands, all walking along the street as automobiles drove recklessly between one another, threading the needle on the two way street, not large enough for two cars to fit on.
	I walked towards the police station, which was cleverly located across the street from a coffee shop, a brothel and a printing office. A police car drove by; it’s loud horn sounding, flashing red and white, reflecting the light from the rain directly into my eyes. I walked into the station, the smell of fresh cigars flooding into my nose. A man screamed from across a large waiting room, looking down at the paper, then looked up and said “Oh. It’s the wonderful Flynn. Of course my dear, come, come.” I walked past him, glaring at his smug face, and then opening the door into my office.
	A man sitting on a chair for those waiting to enter my office abruptly greeted me. He smiled and said, “Well hello sir, I am Dean Osterrietch and believe I have a lead on the notorious killer”
“The pig one?”
“Y- wait, there are more?”
“I believe there are, just they might not like attention as much as our friend here.”
“Well… thanks for informing me of that rather morbid concept, but I have gotten hundreds of pictures of the killer, coming out of his lair.”
	The man pulled out a large portfolio of pictures and dumped them onto my desk, arranging them appropriately. “So, if you look at these pictures, it was for when he first got into the business, holding small weapons, all identifiable, all related to the cutting of meat. Then as you look to the left, these are the later pictures, which are of him coming out, holding bodies on his shoulders, sitting in the back of his eatery and chopping them up, putting them into boxes and looking pleased with himself, all the while in his pig mask. But, he seems to be getting careless. He cam outside, barely slipping on his mask in time for my camera to flash a photo, his face seemed veiled in… something. Something sticky, something gruesome. But if you look closer, you can quite easily see the silhouette of his face. Large, hooked nose, eyes, clouded in blue, teeth, sharpened to perfection and a dripping mouth.”
“Ha. So you’re basically implying that you’ve seen a notorious killer walk in and out of a location multiple times and not even dared to act on it? I beginning to suspect you’re the killer!”
“But that would be silly. Why would a crazy give himself away?”
“I don’t know, why don’t you tell me?”
“I believe this conversation is getting a bit heated. I saw the ad in the paper that I should contact the police and thought I’d tell you where I’ve seen such events. Have you ever seen the abandoned butchery on 1800 Bellcove Street? Well there’s your place. Sir!” said the man as he gathered his pictures and threw them into his bag, which smelled of defecation and nickels. I watched as he slammed the door, then sighed and sat down on my desk, rapidly pressing the keys of my typewriter, updating the information I’ve received from the man.
“Mysterious man visits police station, says he has a lead on the piggy killer. As you all know, the notorious killer has crossed the line now. Enough to even be called a serial killer! What a sick bastard he is.” I continued being as pessimistic as possible, updating the paper, then grabbing my camera as I finished the article. Typing in my name, finishing with my name, saying “Written by: Flynn Covetail.”
	Darkness was beginning to shroud the air, perfect night for the killer to strike in his typical environment. Light rain was spattering against my window, racing down to the bottom of the screening, only to fall against an umbrella below. As I left my office, throwing on my coat, I screamed to the man in the front desk, “Going out to…oh, let’s see...1800 Bellcove Street? If I don’t come back, Phone someone.” I said with a laugh, while walking outside.
	Instantly my boots splashed against the small walkway paved on “Western Lagoon highway” as the frivolously worthless people would say. I walked down towards the street, which was naught but four blocks from here. I passed by Dontell’s Donuts, Redgar’s Rotisserie and Salam’s Spices, all involved in the fattening of desperate cops, as only fattening diners were located near the station, so I developed a theory that every restaurant owner is against us.
	I reached the butcher’s place, which had been looted to hell by the anarchists, who were just a group of thugs that didn’t do shit to overthrow the government. The door had been pried off it’s hinges, yet now it was replaced by a veil of chains, hanging off of rusted hooks attached to the doorframe. Within the butchery, the first thing I noticed was a bed, a homeless man sleeping on it.
	I simply ignored the bum and walked around, searching for anything considered suspicious. I walked through the door, smelling the bum’s shit in the corner and closing my nostrils as well as I could. I looked through the shop, behind the counter I found several rusted knifes, which were corroded to the counter, which was a wooden rotten thing, with three cutting boards lining it, all of which nobody needed. The front of the shop seemed completely normal, but I listened to the bum waking, instantly screaming, “Who’s there! I will kill you if you’re trespassing on my property!” I laughed and screamed to him “I suggest you run out of here, or I may just have to turn you in as a key suspect for the crimes.” I heard the scuffing of his shoes against the floor, running towards me.
	I quickly turned, backing up against the wall, my sidearm pointed at the bum and screamed “GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!” I shot to the side of the man, who quickly bolted for the door, a rat following closely behind him. I sat for a minute, catching my breath, while my vocal chords seemed to scratch against one another in a uncomfortable clunky fashion. As I stood, I felt the hard callused flesh of an arm pressing against the front of my throat and the sudden feeling of something hard hitting the back of my head.








	Ha. Damn fool didn’t even know what he had coming. Shouldn’t have fucked with my grandpa… shouldn’t have yelled. My ears hurt. Are they ringing? Why the FUCK am I here? I thought a conversation to myself as I raised the man into the air, the familiar heaviness of my mask pressing against my face, the pig’s blood leaking down my neck, warming me, keeping the cold away. I looked at my setup, which was simply the back room of a butcher’s shop, a heavy steel door muffling sounds on both sides of the fifty wood wide hallway of a room.
	Blood dripped into wooden bowls I’d gotten from the shop, the bodies of fresh meat hanging from the ceiling. Pigs, cows, chickens, even a few deer, but the most stubborn of prey, the pigs. The sticky cunts hung from the ceiling, their wrists cut, their feet missing, their hands stuffed into their fucking loud mouths. The damned pigs that walked the streets, reading their stories about who? About me! The beautiful man, who is dealing righteousness to the crazies, to the rich. Though they think that they’re so safe in their leather homes, they should be the ones making chairs; their dried hides need to be a part of furniture!
	Oh, what an inventor I will be! But the best part is, nobody looks twice at the photographer. Nobody looks at who’s behind the camera; they only care about the picture! And I am finally the one in the picture! Flynn, the little anus that believed he owned the whole world, because the police were backing him up. NO, NO, NO! YOU ARE MY FUCKING BITCH!
	I whistled a tune of sorrow and greed that humans so openly express. I raise him in the air, catch a hook to his leg and strip him down to his bare neck. This self-conceited asshole needs one thing. A hook curving through the cheek, wrenched from his cheek. He thought I was the killer? NO! THAT IS NOT THE FUCKING WORD!
	Oh! My friend is waking up! Finally a new toy to play with. Oh, what a joy he will be! Oh no! What will I say to him? I guess I’ll just wing it. I guess I’ll just talk to him.  Where will I display this beauty? Ooh! The police station! Mmm, how delectable would that be? To show the pigs that even their weapons can’t defend them from me. THEY ARE GOING TO LOVE ME! I am a hero. I love being a hero and don’t try to talk me out of my heroism! I AM AMAING!








	My eyes slowly opened, to find a man in a pig mask, the rotting dreaded animal seemed to have a grin on it’s face. I was hanging upside down and fuck my leg hurts! Why does my leg hurt? Where the hell am I? “Oh… you’ve awakened!” spouted the pig; it’s squeaky voice ringing through my ears. I screamed, “Help me! Help! HE’S GOING TO KILL ME!” 
“Now that’s not how you treat a guest, is it?”
“Fuck you.”
“Oh… language, language my dear friend. If you even try saying something like that, I will cut off your cock and feed it to my friend Mr.Squeaks over here!”
	I looked to where he was pointing, which was a large column in the room, a decomposing rat nailed to the pole. “Somebody is going to catch you. They know where I am!”
“Oh, I believe they do, if only your little desk friend was there to hear what you had to say!” said the phsyco with a smile. He pointed at the ceiling, which had two hooks on it, chains hanging from them and a headless man, blood dripping in a steady stream of thickness, into a wooden bowl. “Why are you doing this to these people?”
“Okay, okay, story time. Oh yay, stories! FUCK OFF GREG, THIS IS MY TIME TO SHINE!”
	I looked at the pig with doubt, pain shooting up my leg, throbbing slowly into my brain. “SO, let me tell you why I love my job, okay? Okay. So, when I was twelve, I thought, I’m going to take pictures of weddings! I’m going to take pictures of people in love, because everyone else’s happiness, is mine.” He said this, while pinning his right hand against his heart, which contained an extra few layers of flesh, sewed against his own, along with a tattoo, stolen from his victim.
	“Okay, so anyways! What do ya know! I’m doing that now! I am a photographer! I love people being happy. SO, I one day, was at this one glorious wedding, full of lovely people. I had started talking to a woman and a little, oh what is it called? Fetish of mine was developed. As we were in bed, I took out my camera and took shots of my experience and little did I know, I have a few other… kinks. I wrung my hands around her delicate throat, stuck my finger down her throat and felt the vomit shoot from her mouth! I felt the rush as eventually, she started to fuckin’ bleed! WHAT A WHORE! She began to cough up blood, she began to wheeze and it is as these coughs echoed from her throat, landing inside of my mouth as our lips touched, did I realize how wonderful blood tastes. Rich, creamy, delicious, blood, coursing from the fountains of our decapitated stumps. I invented ways of sucking people dry, licking them dry! Well, at first I was only an amateur, but, as I got better! Oh BOY did I start to love my job! Every wedding became a slaughter, every wedding gave me a new friend, because after all, nobody cares about who’s behind the camera! NOBODY GIVES TWO FUCKING SHITS!
	So, pretty boy, I believe it’s time; you… started looking into my eyes, whenever I snap a photo of your beautiful body.” He said this as his hand slid down from my chest, slowly down to my cock, grinning, spittle flying out of his mouth as he coughed, slid a blade against it as chopped it off. I screamed out loud, blood spurting from me and all the smile he smiled, then I fell asleep, never to wake again.

ReiKoroshiya,0,,0,1rgsca,,2,"Here I am and im going to write about some of the things that go on in my life. Sorry for bombarding you with some trivial things and please just hear me out.
how about I start at the beginning that seems easier. Well back in elementary, I was that kid the kid that really no one liked. I had a friend here and there but that's about it. I was basically a social outcast, 
I never really got my work done, I still don't. Note that I was a very, very angry child and no I was not spoiled if that's what your thinking, im the oldest of 3 kids who had been and are growing up in poverty, but my father is very good at managing money which means he is very cheap.
I had shared a room with my younger brother and for some reason I never grew out of the stage where you sleep with your blankets over your head. I had always liked horror even though none of it really scared me even in elementary in the 3rd grade I found an author by the
name of R.L.Stine and I had read tons of his books which remotely captured my interests.
A few of the simple things had scared me, and I most likely have experiences that I have blocked out of my mind, I don't remember much about my childhood at all.
I don't know why I can't but that's just how it is. I do remember bits and pieces though, not anything like birthdays, mind you. Here Ile give some examples, I remember
when I thought my stuffed animal had red eyes, I freaked out a little bit called my parents and my father calmed me down and took it away. Years later I went back and found it, and of course it wasn't scary anymore. Another example
would be when I saw a ""witch"" in my closet, but again my father came in and turned the light on to show me that there was nothing there, I had clearly saw something but it was gone as soon as the light turned back on.
Once he had left and turned the light back of the figure was back again. I remember when my body shot up in bed and I let out a blood curtling scream and my parents rushed into the room
and they had tried to comfort me and to calm me down I was bawling my eyes out while hugging my father he had asked me what had happened and I was just mumbling incoherently 
about it. I can't remember what it was that had freaked me out so badly. Something else that just pokes out at me was when I was lying in bed and I hear talking so I sit up strait in bed and I see my parents right there talking to each other I couldn't understand what they were saying because they were mumbling and I said hey and they say love you simultaneously and I said aww I love you too you guys, I reached out to hug them and they both just vanished and I almost fell out of bed(I got top bunk). Then their are the things that I have learned from my family throughout the years, not much really
they don't seem to want to talk much about when I was younger. I got that I was a horrible child when they brought me to church, and that I would bite and snarl when anyone got within an arms reach of me.
keep in mind I don't remember that about going to church, as a matter of fact I don't remember going to church at all. hmmm.... well skip forward to middle school where I had
actually made friends. I did got in so much trouble in middle school its not even funny. I could barely even go a week without at least one detention. Saturday school and suspensions I had gotten a ton too, now
drugs are prevalent where I live and when I say that drugs were prevalent I truly mean that, but honestly the thought of drugs never really appealed to me well I mean
certain ones that is, the only mind altering substance that I would actually want to do, smoke, drink, etc would be alcohol cause it seems fun and really any hallucinogenic drug and there
is no way I could get ahold of hallucinogenic drugs without paying a ton of money and with my broke ass I can't afford it and because of that im drug free. Not to much
happened in middle school, only a few things I started to get hellish demonic dreams (oh and speaking of dreams I have always been able to feel pain in my dreams so if
say I was to get ran through with a spear or had my flesh pealed off in a dream I would wake up and still feel it, I also talk in my sleep) which sucks ass, The vast 
majority of my dreams became violent and with me being an avid gamer there was usually a sword nearby in my dreams and usually I could and would fight back and be home
free. I enjoyed those violent dreams where I won, even though I would battle hellish creatures and people I wouldn't consider it a nightmare. I got my own room in the basement which was nice, and well my brother he was, how do you put it? 
Gassy so yeah hot air rises and all that. Electronic malfunctions had started occurring, like waking up to my radio playing static, my alarm clock started to malfunction, etc. I remember waking up minutes before my alarm clock 
went off I awoke with a shot of electricity to my left ear. Skip forward to highschool in the 9th grade I found out what creepypasta and scp were it was amazing to find real horror for a change.
I read the hell out of creepypasta's and found some really cool narrators for them, listening to those was very enjoyable I didn't read scps often and I found a very long series called the holders.
Near the end of the year I started to feel a presence in my room which was interesting because it didn't have a bad feeling to it, the only word that comes to mind to describe it would be light if that makes any sense.
Jump forward one more year, I had flunked my freshman year because I don't do my work. On those professional tests that they make you take S.A.T's or some shit I did 
insanely good on those like I should be an A- student overall. Now i reside in alternative ed. Im 15 right now. I declared to my parents that im agnostic instead of
Baptist a few months ago. Anyway that presence in my room i hardly feel it anymore and now there is something more sinister and not just in my room anymore.
That thing I actually saw it, I fucking saw it, it was short like about a foot and a half tall. I went to bed last night and you know how earlier I had said I sleep
with my blankets over my head. Well I was moving around under the covers and I glanced out underneath the covers and there it was just staring at me a few inches away 
from my face I had to resist not to punch it because half of me was saying its just my imagination and the other half says that if its real  then im going to freak the fuck out and well I never did hit it and its creepy as fuck that its been watching me. I tried to calm my breathing as to not alert it to the fact that I have seen it I
think it knows I saw it because I have been getting glances of it all day. It might have seen me and it might be watching me type this.
It is very short and I can never manage to see any features on its face it just looks dark like a shadow its really, really dark, everything distorts when I look at it like my depth perception gets thrown off and space distorts around it.

highchairchildren,3,,1,1rgqmu,,2,"I'm looking for any input. If anyone has had experiences like this, is there a way to stop it?

So this started about two years ago. In the beginning it was just a perpetual bad feeling, like something bad was going to happen all the time.  I was anxious, always alert and never at rest. I hardly slept, primarily keeping myself awake in order to feel safer. 

Then, I started seeing things.

When I say seeings things I don't mean like hallucinations, well not really. I'm not crazy. There were never any voices and there never have been. It was more like a blackout moment in which the worst possible scenario for my environment would play out seemingly right before my eyes. 

Mostly accidents.  It happened once while I was sledding.  The hill was a steep drop and then inclined back up about 20 ft. or so where it met a busy road. Usually people lost momentum and slid back down the hill and came to a rest in the valley but sometimes, people would make it all the way up and hit the metal road block that was put up along the hill. A watched as a kid went down the hill and then it happened. I continued to watch as he went all the way back up the hill and under the metal road block right into the speeding car that was passing by. There was blood everywhere. I snapped back to reality and looked around. Everything was fine. There was no blood, nobody was hurt, just kids sledding around having fun. 

I continued to have random ""visions"" for the entire year. They varied in severity. The worst one left me shaken for a few days afterwards.  I was home babysitting my younger sisters and boiling pot of spaghetti for dinner.  I moved to the sink to strain the pasta and then went back to turn off the electric stove.  My little sister approached me to ask a question and then I had my flash.  As I was seeing it, I grabbed her by her hair and pressed her face into the stove. In that moments I watched as her eyes rolled around in her head and she screamed, begging me to stop.  I snapped back and couldn't speak. I teared up and thought I was going to puke.  I ran to the bathroom, washed my face, sat down on the ground and cried. I had never felt such a mixture of fear and remorse in my life. I got up and reentered the kitchen, finished dinner and continued the night as if nothing happened.  She asked me what was wrong and I played it off as a bout of sickness.  I sat awake for hours that night and I still couldn't come up with a reason for why this kept happening to me.  I asked my mom to see a psychiatrist but unfortunately it was a luxury we simply couldn't afford. 

Then it stopped. As quickly as it came in it left and I had no more of an idea about what it was than I'd had before.  It stayed away for a while. I mean really a long time.  I was vision free for an entire year.

I was prompted to write this because I had another one the other.  The first in over a year but I am scared. I don't want it to start again.  The most recent one was more subtle.  I was shaving in the shower went as I brought the razor up my leg, somehow or another I cut myself and there was blood everywhere.  The tub was washed red with it and there was nothing I could do but stand and watch as it oozed out of my leg and swirled around in the water before going down the drain.  Then I flashed back and it wasn't there. I hadn't even cut myself.

I know this must sound crazy, like some Final Destination bullshit.  I swear to you I wouldn't have posted it if I didn't have hopes that someone could help.  Any input is welcomed.",Can anyone help?,3,nosleep

You might remember my journal entries from last month. Last month, I can't believe it's been that long. Days and weeks run now in an endless loop. Where I am now time doesn't matter. It's a nuisance, it's a hinderance. 

A lot has happened. I just wanted to let those who cared, who reached out to me, know that I am alive. Very much so. And I have met some friends. Real human beings. There is so much I want to tell you. So much I want to explain. But I can't. Not now. 

Just know that the monster under your bed is real. That shadow in the closet exists. And those voices, the voices you hear in the dead of the night are not your imagination. All your life you have been told horror stories. And now you seek them out, on this subreddit. To be entertained, to be thrilled. But these stories exist for a reason. Every story has a truth. A small bit of reality wrapped around trigger words and exaggeration. 

That truth is what lurks in the shadows of your house, just at the corner of your eye. The truth is what is waiting for you when you close your eyes to sleep, hoping for a peaceful night's rest. But nothing is peaceful in the dark. Where the light is eclipsed by the slithering, rotting presence that knows you oh so well. One day you'll know. You will wake up and know. All those stories. All those scary tales. All those fears.

Are real.

bass_slapper,0,,2,1rh8lh,,0,"*You think me cruel. No. I’ve only learned to act on what I’ve been given. I’ve learned to deal with my problems in my own way. No one understands this but me it seems. This is for ME, I don’t do it for them. But they can’t understand my need. He can’t either. I must make me. Make him understand. How did he get here? I wish I came back. I want him back. WHY WON’T I COME BACK WHY IS HE HERE ARE YOU SORRY ARE YOU SORRY ARE YOU SOR-*

Past this the note is unreadable, spewed with a fluid I can only assume is meant to go on the inside of people. Not that I’d really want to read much more anyways. I already know what happens. Well, not really “know”, but I can feel it. Who wrote it? I can only assume it was my dear Uncle Drewson, if he’s even my uncle. What is this? No clue. A note, obviously, but beyond that speculation reigns. Where did I find this? My new house, in a drawer. Nothing is inherently terrifying about that – Oh, except that it was under the clothing I had already packed there. I just missed it before, I keep telling myself. I half believe it. A few pills later and I’m not worrying about it anymore.

Before this, I didn’t even know I had an Uncle Drewson, let alone that I was to inherit his estate in the event of his untimely, but now enacted, demise. With a heavily estranged family, growing up in between various friends or close relatives passed around by uncaring parents looking to shirk responsibility, one loses track of aunts and uncles. It was in a familiar neighborhood, a spacious three bedroom, so I was in no way eager to turn it down. As a poor, regularly unemployed person I’d been accustomed to sleeping on generous friends floors in the all too often occurrence I couldn’t afford anywhere else. I thought, it’ll all be worth it one day, the day I make it in the world. I can pay all these people back tenfold. “The day I make it”, yeah right. A consistent – and more pressingly, free – living space was a welcome antonym to my recent fortunes. So I was moved in within a couple weeks. Absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened. Till that note seemed to start some kind of vicious domino effect on my life, I was content.

You know when you think back to something embarrassing, stupid, or otherwise shameful act you may have done in your younger, brasher days? Once you recall it, it starts eating away, regret seeping in to every corner of your thoughts, till you would give the world to go back and change it, or at least erase the memory. Imagine that, only you can’t remember what it was you’ve done. It’s simply gone from you. The more you try, the less you realize. The less you realize, the more you regret. The more you regret, the more you try. That’s what’s happening to me, ever since I moved here. But it even goes past that. It’s the sudden feeling you’re being watched from barely out of sight. And at the same time, a crushing loneliness in that feeling. I pop a few more pills. Of course, I’m not being watched. There’s no one else here. If you think you’re being rather clever, figuring this out, oh-no-someone’s-been-in-the-house-with-you-all-along, I was most certainly the only one here. Anyway, this was about the time I found the note. If it was this Drewson, what is he talking about? Who does he want back? What is his need? Do I even want to know the answer to any of these? Insatiable curiosity will ensure I do, personal preference notwithstanding. Putting it all to the back of my mind, I chop up steak for dinner. I like to think of myself as a fairly accomplished chef, particularly where matters of slicing and/or dicing are concerned. I once worked a sushi bar, as a side job to pay the bills, and was quite proud of my ability to launch various morsels into the air and sever them in two with one fell swipe, like you see in commercials. Until the day my knife slipped and nearly skewered a customer’s eyeball. Maybe I’m not quite as proficient as I thought… I grab the bottle of pills and take a few. I don’t really like thinking about that time in my life.

I’m digging through my drawer later, that same drawer, when I stumble upon another discovery. Instead of a clue, it only deepens my mystery. A USB stick is secured to the very back of the board. I carefully remove it, and spend a few minutes simply gawking at my find, my inner curiosity again sparring with my better senses. I think, this will perhaps answer some questions about the note, and hopefully clear up my imaginations conjuring brought on by its conclusion’s implications. As per your previous assumptions, I couldn’t be farther from the truth. I secure the stick in its dock. View files. Two folders: “Reminders” and “Media”. Reminders is empty, media contains one subfolder: “Vids”. I open the folder. Two more: “memories” and “triggers”. Memories is empty. I open triggers. I’m confronted with one video file: shotinthedark.wmv. It’s 0:40 long. I press play.

Before I continue, if you’ll permit me one aside to validate the severity of this. I’m a massive horror movie fan, and I like them brutal. The more blood and guts, the better. I like truly graphic, heart wrenching stuff, and I very rarely squirm at it. Three seconds into shotinthedark.wmv and I rushed over the trash can to puke what felt like my very soul out. The scene I’m immediately confronted with was a man on a chair wearing nothing but an undershirt and briefs. There is a single light source on the chair, but I can faintly make out a figure in the background. Then, without a word, the man’s brains are ejected out his face, accompanied with a thunderous bang. Bone and cartilage spew forth in the foreground. Nearly black red sludge runs down his white undershirt, accompanied with brain matter that had just been crackling with life, likely flooded by fear, but life. I don’t have too much time to process anymore; I’m preoccupied with regurgitating my expertly made steak into the wastebasket. I think, it must be fake, but I know it’s not. I’ve got to tell someone about this, I think, the police, someone. Yeah, I’ll talk to the cops. Then, over my subsiding retching, I hear a familiar voice utter “Are you sorry now?” in the tone of a disappointed parent talking to their disobedient toddler. Something in that voice is chilling. Something… I return my gaze to the computer screen, where the barely visible figure now stands in full view, smiling.

I recognize the smile too.

It’s me, smiling back at myself, gripping a smoking sawed off.

The computer screen goes black. My head spins. I lie down.

youngsterjose42,1,,5,1rge20,,1,"He woke up in the morning like every other day. Yet this day was different; Jordan was going back to school after being expelled last year. He was caught with drugs and his school wanted nothing to do with it. He moved, now resides in york, Pennsylvania and now goes to William Penn High. He moved to a house which was quite old and just had some renovations a while back. The rent was quite cheap so his mother said ""why not?"". I was one of Jordan's first friends, since moving to york he told me things about that house really strange things. He soon moved away a little after I moved away so I have no idea where he is now. If any of you happen to live in york I'm talking about the old burned down house on market street across the street from the kindergarten/daycare. This story takes place about 2 years before the house burned down. 

A month since school started and about two weeks since I started talking to Jordan he invited me over to his house. Jordan said ""cmon dude come and stay the night my moms gone and im pretty sure wont give a shit"". So I thought why not I haven't spent the night at a friends house in a while ""yea sure ill spend the night man"". We went around town skated for a while, went to McDonald's with a few other friends then it came around 10 or maybe 11 everyone was ready to go home and i was ready to just go to a place and chill, play video games, and maybe eat some more. We got to his place, sat down in the living room, and lit up a blunt. Playing grand auto 3, high off our asses, we ordered some pizza. We ate and everything was fine till I felt like heading over to the bathroom. As soon as I opened the door I notice under the sink there was like a small cabinet and the doors slammed shut. I was high so I didn't really questioned it much. I used the bathroom and then as I exit I suddenly hear a giggle coming from under the sink. A child's giggle, as if there was a kid under the sink playing hide'n'seek or something. Again I did not question it because I was high and didn't really wanna bother finding out what made the noise. Jordan passed out on the couch, I went to his room and tried to sleep on his bed. I remember waking up around four in the morning hearing footsteps and a child giggling I'm pretty sure it was a little boy. I couldn't really tell his age but he was young; I would guess around six or seven. He was running around the house and he stopped at the door I did not see him, I only ever got to see his outline. He said "" I'm really happy I got more friends to play with now"". Suddenly after that he vanished faster than I could blink. I didn't sleep for the rest of the night. I had goosebumps for a good 30 to 45 minutes. Eventually I  calmed myself down by eating pizza and watching TV.",Hide 'N' seek,6,nosleep

Mindlesssavage,4,,8,1rhawv,,0,"I have a Where's Wally book. Well, had. Why? I'll tell you.
So I was just searching for Wally at night like I usually do, and I heard a noise.
It was sort of a scratching noise, scratching with a walking cane maybe.
I went to investigate. I went out of my room and...
Nothing.
Maybe it was just me. I went back to my bedroom door. I saw something written on really drippy red paint.
It said ""Find me if you can"". I thought it was just my little brother Mike painting on the walls again. ""Where was Mike anyway?"", I thought. Then I remembered he was outside playing with our pet dog Molly. ( Don't ask me why he was playing in the dark, because I have no idea).
I went inside my room. That's when I saw it. The book was lying on the ground open. I picked it up. This is what the title said:
""yllaW s'erehW"" Now THIS was weird. I also saw the same Wally picture except his eyes were gone and blood was dripping from them.
It was possessed, I thought. I ran outside to bury it, and I stepped on something. It sounded like it was glass because I heard it shatter.
I looked down.
A pair of broken, black rimmed glasses. I ignored it and ran even faster than before.
I ran to my dog Molly's kennel. I always feel safe when she's with me.
She was whining in the corner. That was typical, though. But wasn't she playing with Mike? I shouted out, ""Mike! Mike! Can you hear me?""
No replies.
I ran to the middle of the yard to bury the book.
I stepped in another thing. It was squishy, and slimy.
I looked down.
Blood. Blood and guts.
And Mike.
Lying on the ground.
Stomach open.
With a walking cane through his heart.
I wanted to cry, but then I saw a little Post-It note on the cane.
A poem.
This is what it said:
""I can run, and I can hide.
Tear you apart from the inside.
Waiting in the darkness, with my cane.
Used to be for children, now insane.
Red and white, in the grey fog.
Running around with my little pet dog.
With my girlfriend Wenda, with her camera,
And an old man with a white beard.
The prisoner who escaped from jail, murdering people with no fail.
That's my gang, with no doubt.
When you're in with me, there's no way out.""
This was way too bad to just BURY. We had to set it on FIRE. Or RIP IT APART. Just destroy it in whatever way I could.
So now in my backyard, a grave for Mike, some burnt and ripped pages, shattered glasses, and a walking cane.
And to this day, I never read another Where's Wally book again.
And every night, I still hear the sound of a scratching walking cane against my bedroom door.

kimmiekissies,13,,29,1rgt5c,,122,"I never even met him, I didn't know his name or face. I was, blissfully unaware, of his very existence.

 I will never know why, or when it started. I'm glad for that I guess. I moved into my very small apartment in February last year. My landlord, Olivia, was a sweet older woman who would cook to much and bring me much appreciated leftovers. She was great to me, even after telling her my problem. I'm antisocial, but she didn't mind renting to a reclusive young girl who reminded her of her daughter.

 Every few weeks she would knock on my door then leave, letting me know she was leaving something for me. I loved that. Not even my family would cook so well. The next morning I wash and leave her empty containers outside my door and by an hour or so she would take them back again. My other neighbors seemed fine, but I never talked or visited with them.

 I work from home so anytime I ever was forced to go out I rushed out and into my apartment avoiding an, uncomfortable situation. I loved living alone, it was everything I hoped for. I could just, breathe. By April though, I started noticing things were not right. They were moving, or plain disappearing. I was convinced it was just anxiety caused by my new medication and the move, another side affect was it would make me so drowsy. Since I hated seeing the doctor I just dealt.

 I took naps during the day now and eventually stopped caring. Until one incident doubled my paranoia, Olivia brought me some sort of greek tossed salad and dressing for lunch one day and I enjoyed it with my friend netflix. I fell asleep in the middle of Portlandia, and woke up that evening at 5pm. Per usual, what was not usual was my bedding on the opposite side of me was disturbed. I only sleep on the right side. Always. Even more it felt.. *warm.* My first thought was I must have rolled around a lot, but I knew it was to odd to dismiss. 

I got up and searched my apartment gripping my phone with 911 typed in. Nothing else was disturbed, everything was exactly like it should be. I let it go, for the next few weeks everything was normal pardon the occasional misplaced shoe or drawn back shower curtain. I thought about telling someone, my parents, maybe Olivia, but if it's not life or death I am not reaching out to anyone. 

I wasn't scared, I was nervous, maybe a little stubborn.. But I stayed. I am not letting some stupid anxiety ruin my lovely lonely world.
 May came and It was getting worse. My panties, toothbrush, hell even my food was being misplaced. Every time I woke up there was this strange odor in the air. I finally realized this won't go away by ignoring it. I called my mom and begged to come stay a few days, when I got home I told them everything. Saying it out loud solidified any creepy suspicions. 

That weekend my dad went to my apartment and what was found was true horror. Written all over that walls: ""COME BACK"" ""BABY PLEASE"" He ran out and called the police. There was no one living in my apartment but someone definitely had access besides me. 
The investigation revealed a man, Henry, the son of my landlord Olivia, was in a projected relationship with me.

 They showed me his confession on tape. He admitted coming into my apartment every night and everyday with his mother's extra key. He claims we were in love and he had my permission. He drugged his mother's food she left out for me causing my drowsiness and falling asleep so he could come in and watch me sleep, touch my hair, kiss my shoulder. The leftovers I had in the fridge were tested and confirmed.
 I was absolutely, horrified and disgusted. A man, I never knew existed, collected my drain hair, clothes, and trash and practically lived in my apartment for *four months.*

Thanks to everyone for your responses, I have taken a lot of your advice.
I'll just give you all a quick update on what happened after I posted yesterday. She ended up having a nap after sitting in front of the TV for a few hours. I was going to walk our dog, Zeus, but I decided to wait until she woke up just in case she woke up and was confused.


She woke up after a couple of hours and was.....well. Happy. Really, really happy. Almost manic. She woke up full of beans, and smiling like a maniac. I was initially relieved. I asked would she like to come for a walk with Zeus and I and she happily agreed. We set off for our normal walk, and she was extremely energetic, bounding off in front of Zeus and I. Zeus is a Labrador, and although he is a big boy, he's still a pup. We usually just meander along on these walks while he sniffs at everything along the way. But she set a cracking pace and Zeus and I struggled to keep up. 


We got up to this park where we usually let him off his lead for a while as we're trying to train him to not run off on us and to be sociable. It's always been a real task getting him back on the leash though, he never ever comes when he's called. Anyway, we let him off, and he's running around and smelling everything and peeing on anything that stands still long enough. My wife, she's picking flowers and sniffing them, and singing. She gets on the swings at the park and I push her for a bit, as she sings under her breath. I was feeling quite content at this point. Figured she must have just been over tired.


She's swinging vigourously when all of a sudden she comes to a dead halt. She yells, in an almost unfamiliar, masculine voice, ""Zeus! Here!"" and points in front of her feet.


I stood in disbelief as I watched Zeus, the most disobedient rascal of a dog I know, solemnly trot over to where she's pointing, sit in front of her, and stare up into her face. They both sat there for a split second, very still, looking at each other. I picked my jaw up off the floor and asked her ""Um..what the hell! How did you manage that!"" and that seemed to break both their concentration and Zeus shot off like a bat out of hell again, and she started swinging again - ""Oh"" she said, ""I used my mind to call out to him...it's something new I learned..""
She seemed kind of sheepish about it to be honest. I pressed her for more details, but the more questions I asked the more defensive she got. She knows I don't believe that for a second. I'm just happy that Zeus is finally starting to be trained. That's really the only explanation. I asked her to do it again but she refused, so I think we both know it was a fluke.


The rest of the afternoon was....nice. Kind of odd. It's like there's something that's amiss. Like when you walk into your messy bedroom and you can tell that *something* is not how it should be but you can't pin point what.


We talked a bit about the seminar. She said that it was very intense. The days were very long. She said that the premise of the seminar is to get to the root of any emotional upset, to explore the root causes for what's going on in your life. I asked if any hypnosis was used, as suggested by you guys, and she said no. They talked a lot, and were assigned to small groups, and encouraged to open up and explore their ""inner beings"". She said she felt a lot better since attending.
Still, something was not quite right. For instance, we were talking about my sister who lives in another state, and how she had recently got a new job. A few minutes later, my phone rang and it was her. I picked it up and said ""Emma! Speak of the devil..."" and my wife smashed me up the side of the head, causing me to drop the phone and shouted ""Emma is NOT the devil!! How could you say that!!! Emma is NOT THE DEVIL!!"" I told Emma I would call her back and tried to get my wife to calm down. She was very upset at what I had said. She sort of went silent again, and was very still. She seemed rather annoyed at me, but by this point, I was nearing exhaustion myself, so I let her be.

She fell asleep early, about 8pm, on the couch. I covered her with a blanket, and noticed that her eyes are kind of half opened..... I used to have a friend who slept like that at school and I've never noticed it before, I think that in my state of hyper vigilance, I am being overly perceptive of small details.
 
I read more of my original post, and all your comments, and decided to step outside and call our therapist, just to find out more about the seminar, as I knew she was there assisting.

I walked out onto our back porch and lit a cigarette and rang her. She answered on my first ring. What she said has really weirded me out. Only because although she gave me a lot of information, she has raised many more questions, as well as answered them.
 
She said these seminars are more like interactive workshops run by a man named Brian and his wife Linda, who are both self-appointed ""psychotherapists"". She said that there are psychologists such as herself on stand by to assist because sometimes when people are in such a vulnerable state, they may need assistance. She said she has referred a lot of her client's to attend these workshops and has found them to be helpful in most cases.
 
Basically, the course is about discovering your inner self, and using different methods to connect to your inner voice, to find out what the cause of your worries are. She said that it is incredibly demanding and intense. Each session goes for 14 hours with only an hour break. During these sessions, many different activities and topics are explored, including, regression. Apparently Brian does this 3 hour session on the second last day, where he gets everyone to meditate, and be still, and he regresses them back to childhood, or even, in some extreme cases, past lives. Our therapist said, it was so intense that she had to fight from being regressed herself. She did make comment that she had been concerned initially about how my wife would handle that, but that she seemed ""brighter, had a clarity about her"" after this experience. They discussed what my wife had gone back to, in her mind, and the therapist was happy that it hadn't caused her any great distress, but reminded me she couldn't discuss the specifics. She said when she wakes tomorrow I could gently try and open the lines of communication with her and she may explain her ""experience"".
 
I told her about my wife's strange behaviour. She said it is normal to be a little out of sorts after one of these sessions, but nothing major. I don't know if it's just me, but I could sense a tiny bit of alarm in her voice.... I don't know, maybe I imagined it. She said to call her if there's any further problems.
 
I hung up, and as I was putting out my cigarette, I turned to go inside and my wife's standing there staring at me. I jump and say ""Jesus Christ honey you scared me!"" and she replied ""Not as fucking much as I'm going to scare you.""
 
Ummm ok. I had to physically turn her and direct her into the house. In the moonlight she almost looked like a stranger to me. Her long blonde hair was hanging in her face, and her face was fixed in this awful scowl. I figured she must still be pissed at me from before. I put her to bed and she goes back to sleep.
 
And, well, that's where she is now.... she was supposed to be off work today too, but I was meant to go back to my job. But when my alarm went off, I just had this weird feeling that I should stick around and make sure she was ok. I rang in sick for work, and I'm just doing some household jobs, waiting to see if she's better when she wakes up, and googling what regression means, and what these intense emotional exercises can do to someone. Still nothing that convincing though. I dont know. Maybe I'm *too* skeptical. I just don't believe this crap.

The whole thing sounds a bit stupid to me, if I'm honest. But I have to say, it has caused some kind of change in my wife. She is very extreme in her emotions at the moment, and I'm worried, because we both have to go back to work tomorrow, and her work environment is very proper. She is always a perfect employee, and very dedicated to her work. I can't help but feel concerned that she might wake up tomorrow and still be in this....mood. Do you guys know anything about this ""regression""....is it the same as hypnosis? She was adamant she wasn't hypnotised, but it sounds like it to me!!



EDIT: Ok now I'm getting really freaked out. I went to check on her and she was talking and singing her sleep. I can't quit work out what song she's singing I've never heard it before. But she's saying something about being someone called Azara or something??? It's really fucking unnerving it doesn't even sound like her. Ill try and get a recording and see if you guys can shed some light. 


EDIT TWO: Ok I managed to record a bit of it...she's singing but I don't know what, has anyone heard this before????????? Ignore the TV in the background I was watching it in the lounge room to drown her out, and it was really unnerving when I turned it off and all I could hear was her. I'm kind freaked out now, I'll admit it. [Here it is](http://soundcloud.com/user165636719/a0ynmqy5tete/s-jECMW)",UPDATE!!! Need some advice.

floydnimrod,21,,25,1rhxtb,,113,"I'd just come from church for some reason. I'm not sure why I'd gone into the church, but it was the weirdest service I'd ever been too. Everybody was there. It was a packed house. Rich people, poor people, criminals, middle class folk. It was all people who didn't normally go to church. I looked into the coat room as I walked in, and some guy was snorting cocaine on this little counter top. Right in a church. I was like, what the hell? I've never see that.

I sat in a pew, and looked up. There was no minister. They were just playing a movie of an old church service on the screen. Some little old lady was playing a hymn on an organ, and the minister was applauding her. She seemed happy. But the audience was restless, not really paying attention, not sitting down, just kind of wandering around, talking to everybody. 

And then I saw a woman I used to know, someone I worked with years ago. I went to sit down next to her, and she sort of jumped on my lap and hugged me, saying she was so glad to see me. I wasn't sure if she was sad, or drunk, or terrified, or just lonely, but she whispered in my ear, offering me sex, saying she's always wanted me, ever since she'd known me. I sort of pushed her off my lap, thinking this was hardly the place for that kind of cheap pick-up. And then I got up and walked out. There wasn't really a church service going on anyway, I don't even think it was Sunday.

And then for some reason, I was in a car with this old lady. I don't even know who it was, or why I was with her. She was old like my grandma Freddie, but it wasn't her. We were driving down the street. She was driving too slow because she was kind of lost. I don't think I was in Winnipeg I was on a large street, almost the size of Portage with several lanes. But they all seemed to be deserted, like very early on a Sunday morning. I'm not sure if it was early in the morning or near sunset, but the sun was low in the sky. I think it was late in the day. The streets were mostly clear though.

The lady pulled over and for some reason she got out of the car. I think she was going to ask somebody for directions. I looked at the GPS thing she had on her dashboard, and suddenly the direction went all fuzzy and scrambled, like the satellite was confused, or just no longer there. And then the whole sky got this weird greenish tint to it for about ten seconds. It basically turned green instead of blue, but only for a moment, and then it was back to normal. Everybody stopped and looked up.

I was still in the car, but I leaned forward and looked out the window. The sun was over in the west, low in the sky. And I saw what looked like a second moon fly over the sky in a direction that was diagonal to the sun's normal path. It was huge. And my stomach got queasy for a moment. It made your stomach sick because it was so big, it actually pulled on you with its own gravity, like the moon pulls on the tides, but much bigger, and everything inside you just got tugged around.

But it went straight across the sky, without hitting. When I realized how close it was, though, I knew it was gonna hit somewhere, probably on the other side of the world. The gravity of the earth pulled it in, and it sling-shotted around to the other side somewhere. I jumped out of the car and grabbed the old lady's arm.

""Come on! We have to find shelter! It's gonna hit!"" 

We just abandoned the car in the street, and I dragged her toward a nearby fire station, or hydro office, or whatever it was. I'm not sure which it was, but there were large utility trucks, with lifts on them. It was also deserted for some reason, except for two guys loading one of the trucks. We banged on the doors, but it was locked up. We ran from door to door trying to get in, but everything was locked. 

And then I felt a great rumble under my feet. It nearly knocked me down. I've never been in an earthquake, so I don't know what it's like, but it felt like the entire planet shivered. Car alarms started going off in every direction and I heard a weird sound like gravel tumbling down a hillside, except there were no hills. I think it was pieces falling off houses in all directions. We were able to stay on our feet though. 

A few moments later, the sky in the north went dark. If I assume the sun was setting in the west, and the meteor or asteroid or whatever flew over the sky in a north-west to south-east direction, then it was north the black came from. And I mean the entire sky. Like a wall of blackness, smoke and ash suddenly filling the view from the ground to the upper atmosphere, from west to east as far as you could see, in one huge wall of black cloud. And it was coming toward us. Well, sort of going towards everyone, everywhere, I guess. It came over the horizon like an charging army, fast and steady, advancing.

""It hit on the other side of the world somewhere! Come on! we have to get indoors! We won't be able to breathe!""

The air started turning yellow. Ash started raining down, and bits of rock and debris from the blast, where ever it hit. I took a deep breath and held it as I was running. I could already smell a weird burning rock smell, like sulphur, like burnt matches, but more metallic. 

Me and the lady finally got into some doors, but it was just a little foyer. We ran in and shut the doors behind us. The inside doors were locked. But it was somewhere to hide. There was a fire alarm. I pulled it, not really knowing why I was bothering. But I was sort of in a panic and not thinking straight. The sign said, In Case of Emergency, so I pulled it. The alarm went off, and we looked out the window. The yellow air turned brown, and then dark red. Then everything went black. The black cloud fell over the whole sky with a clattering rumble that sounded like it was raining gravel instead of water. And all light went out of the world.

The world as we knew it was over. Even if we survived, life as we know it would never be the same. We'd be set back 10,000 years, reduced to hunter gatherers again, living out of caves. If we survived the impact that is. I honestly don't think anybody would have survived the shockwave. Something with that much gravity hitting the earth would pretty much end the story for everybody.

Of course, that's when I woke up.",I just dreamed of the apocalypse. I probably won't sleep for a few days now.,138,nosleep
Charlies_friend,20,,9,1rhapg,,79,"A friend of mine posted a story here not too long ago, and he was pretty well received by your wonderful community, so I decided to create an account to share mine.


When I was a little girl, about nine years old, my family purchased a small ranch in western Kansas. My father had just gotten out of the Army, and I suppose after seven years of trotting around the world, and spending two of those years in active combat zones, my dad just wanted to go somewhere the world would leave him alone. He couldn't have found a better location for this purpose; anyone who's ever followed Interstate 70 westward through that area knows, there isn't much between Topeka and Denver.

I still remember the day we (my mom, dad, older sister and I) moved into that old ranch house. It had been built in the early 1900's, and being something of a history buff, I was pretty excited to live in a house that had stood through prohibition, the depression, both world wars, and everything since. The house itself sat at the bottom of a small incline from the main road, backed literally into a hill. This setup meant the back half of the home sat underground, buried in the hillside. Outside the house was a little grassy yard area, and across this yard was an old barn. We didn't have any horses, but my dad held a particular love for classic cars, and he turned that barn into an amateur autoshop where he worked refurbishing old cars from the junk yard in his spare time.

My sister and I were given seperate but adjoining rooms upstairs, while my parents took the master bedroom (oddly) on the first floor. My sister and I's rooms opened onto a sort of landing that looked out over the living room and kitchen, and the stairs led down from there.

It was only our second or third night in the house, that I began to notice some strange things occurring. I was unable to sleep one night, and I laid awake in bed long after I heard my parents and sister go to bed. The house was incredibly quiet, both from being in the middle of a very isolated area, and by virtue of being half buried. Just as I was reaching the half-sleep state...........SLAM! I heard a door downstairs slam shut. At first I tried convincing myself I had just dreamed it, but I couldn't make myself believe that. And the next thing I heard chilled me to my core. I heard footsteps coming up the stairway. I could tell from the sound that the individual must be wearing shoes, so it probably wasn't my parents coming up to check on me. I heard the steps reach the top of the stairs, and then begin down the landing. I was frozen with fear when I heard them arrive outside my door, pause for a moment, and then continue on. When the stranger was apparently in front of my sisters room, he paused again, and again he continued. He reached the far end of the landing, and then turned around and came back the way he came. He continued for what seemed like an eternity, pacing around outside my sister and I's rooms. I finally worked up some nine-year-old courage and crawled to the door. I could still hear footsteps coming from just outside. I waited until he was moving away from me, and I was between him and the stairs, planning on making a mad dash for my parents room when his back was turned. I barely cracked open the door and looked out, and saw....nothing. The footsteps had stopped, and the whole house was empty, and still. I was confused, and afraid, but even then I knew if I ran to my parents they would think I was nuts. So I slid a chair in front of my door and crept into bed. A minute later the footsteps started again, back and forth, all along the landing. Eventually, they lulled me to sleep. 

I didn't mention the noises that night to anyone, fearful of my parents thinking I was a whacko, and of being made fun of by my sister. But, over the next few weeks, everyone in my family began to notice strange happenings on our ranch. Objects moved on their own. Small things would disappear for days, only to be returned exactly where they'd gone missing from. It was what I guess you'd call typical poltergeist activity; nothing harmful or malevolent, just noises here and there and odds and ends moving around. And practically every night I heard those footsteps outside my room. 

My family eventually began referring to this entity as ""Charlie"". He seemed to be a harmless ghost, and sometimes downright helpful. Occasionally my parents would wake early in the morning for work, only to find a freshly brewed pot of coffee waiting in the kitchen. The coffee maker had no automatic timer. Sometimes when one of us had misplaced something, like car keys or the like, we'd search the house frantically only to turn around and find what we'd been searching for laying on the ground behind us. And sometimes Charlie would slam a door, or walk around loudly, or turn a sink on, seemingly just to let us know he was there. And always, those footsteps at night.

Charlie always seemed particularly active in my dad's auto shop. My dad would occasionally find car parts he'd been working on had been tinkered with, despite the fact that he was the only one who ever went in there. Sometimes tools would go missing, only to be returned a short time later. Once my dad came in from his shop one evening as white as a sheet. When we asked what was wrong he just said ""Charlie was walking around out there........Jesus, I thought you all were just hearing things!"". I wasn't sure why Charlie loved that shop so much, but incidentally, that was where I caught my first sight of him. It was a Saturday, and my Dad was hard at work putting together an old Chevy Fleetline. My mom mad him a sandwich as a working lunch, and asked me to take it to him. I eased open the barn door, and saw my dad seated at his work bench, his back to me. And I saw another man, next to the car, also out of my dad's field of vision. He was about 5'8"", with dark hair and eyes. He was dressed in what looked like typical 1930's clothing; black slacks, a pinstripe vest over a grey work shirt, and topped off by a brown ""paper boy"" hat, cocked to one side. He looked right at me for a second, a big, mischievous grin on his face, and then he simply disappeared. I didn't even realized I was still holding my dad's sandwich and continued to stare at the spot Charlie had stood until my dad snapped me back to reality.

So passed the next few months. My family was happy on our little haunted ranch, Charlie seemed happy enough to share the space with us, and life was good. And his nightly vigil outside my room began to seem almost comforting. One night in late November, however, I learned just how utterly terrifying Charlie could be.

My dad had some kind of dinner event for work in Topeka, almost two hours away, and since my Sister was almost 16 by then, and there was virtually no crime in our rural area, my parents figured we would do fine by ourselves until they returned the next morning. Of course, to my sister and I, it meant we could stay up as late as we wanted, watch scary movies, all the kid stuff you can't do with your parents around. At around midnight, I was in my Sister's room with her watching some movie on her TV, when we heard a loud CRASH from the living room. My first thought was that it was Charlie, playing another prank, by this felt different somehow. Charlie's noises were simply little bumps to remind you he was home. But this noise sounded violent, and angry. Before I could really react, we heard another loud crash, and another. My sister cautiously peeked out of her door, and down into the living room. I swear I saw her go white. She began trembling, and her hand covered her mouth. I peeked around her to see what she saw, and felt y blood run cold. We could just barely see two men, outside our from door. One of them was kicking it in. As we watched, a final smash from this man caused the door jam to give out, and they both entered our home, shining long flashlights all over. My sister and I crawled under her bed, and held each other tight. This was easily the most terrified I have ever felt. 

But as the two men began to go through the living room, another loud crash came from the kitchen. One of the cabinets had opened and slammed shut; a favorite trick of Charlie's. The man who seemed to be leading the show shined his flashlight into the kitchen and shouted ""Is there anyone in here?!?? If you are, you better come out now!! We will find you, and we will FUCK you up!!!!"". My sister and I had to cover our mouths to keep from screaming out loud. At the man's words though, Charlie apparently got angry. We heard another loud crash and a skittering of metal on the floor, as one of our silverware drawers apparently threw itself across the room. I heard one of the men say ""What.......the FUCK?!?!"". And then Charlie decided he was do e fucking around. All at once, every door, window, and cabinet in our home began opening and closing violently, and loudly. Small objects all over the house began to fling themselves into walls, across the floor, even at the intruders. At this point, the one in charge just yelled ""FUCK this"" and turned and ran out, his buddy close behind.

As soon as the men were out of the door, everything stopped, and the house was again silent. It was a long, long time before either my sister or myself finally worked up the courage to move. She had left her cell phone downstairs, and and she needed it to call the police and our parents. She began slowly creeping downstairs to get it, and since there was no way in hell I was being left alone, I followed. As we got to the bottom, I looked into the kitchen, and for just a moment, Charlie was standing there, exactly as I saw him before, with the same grin on his face. A moment later, he was gone.

The police arrived shortly, and my parents not far behind. The cops determined that the disorder in the home was caused by the robbers ransacking the place for valuables, and they must have been scared off by a passing car. Lucky for us. My sister and I didn't even try to tell them what really happened, and within thirty minutes, both men were caught, still fleeing. 

After that night, hearing Charlie's walk around my floor gave me a serene sense of security every night. When he played his little pranks, I would always look for him. And every now and then I would catch just a glimpse of him and smile.

Several years later, when I was a junior in high school, I was working on a school report at the local library. The topic was the history of our town, and I wanted to see if the library had any old news clippings that mentioned my family's ranch. I typed our address on the search bar, and the first result stopped me dead in my tracks. The date of the old article was July 17, 1936, and at the top was a picture of a man, about 5'8"", with dark hair and eyes. It was, unmistakably, Charlie. The title of the article read ""Local Man Murdered While Defending Daughter"". It seems the man we called Charlie was actually named Brian Davis. He had lived alone in the ranch with his only child, a daughter, after losing his wife to a bad case of the Flu. On the night of July 15, the article said, Mr. Davis was returning home from his job as an auto mechanic in town. When he pulled up to the house, he found the door had been forced open. He ran inside, and found a man on top of his daughter. The girl was sobbing, her dress had been ripped open, and the attacker held a knife to her throat. In a moment of sheer instinct, Mr. Davis threw himself at the intruder, tackling him of his daughter, and as he held the attacker, Mr. Davis yelled for the girl to run to the neighbors and call the police. The girl made it the mile and a half to the closest neighbor, who promptly called the sheriff. When deputies arrived, they were able to apprehend the attacker, who had been beaten half to death. Unfortunately, he had stabbed Mr. Davis three times in the chest. Brian Davis died right on our kitchen floor.",Charlie,88,nosleep

childrenofsamhain,9,,5,1rhdoj,,36,"My friend Jaime purchased a new home about six years ago when his wife was pregnant with their first child. Until recently, he lived there with his wife Claire and their two daughters, Sarah and Emily. Sarah is now five years old and Emily is three. Within the first two years living in the house, Jaime said that he never experienced anything out of the ordinary. It wasn't until his daughter Sarah was around two years old, that he started to notice she talked to herself. Jamie thought nothing of it, she was just learning to talk and he figured she was just entertaining herself. 

One afternoon when Claire was out at the grocery store, Jaime overheard his daughter in the upstairs hallway, whispering and giggling. Curious, he asked, ""Sweetie, who are you talking to?"" Sarah replied, 

""The woman standing in the hallway"".

""Is she your imaginary friend?""

""I guess."" 

Amused, he went upstairs to find her staring blankly at a wall, whispering quietly. ""What's your friends name?"" he asked her. 

""Her name is Helen Mary"", she said. 

""And what are you two whispering about?"" 

Sarah looked at him and paused before she piped ""I'm not supposed to tell you."" 

Suddenly the front door opened downstairs, and they heard Claire come through the door. Sarah rushed down the stairs to greet her. Jaime didn't think about that again for a few weeks. 

Over time, the two noticed that Sarah's interactions with ""Helen Mary"" became more frequent, but they attributed this to the fact that they had just given her the news that she was going to be a big sister. 

About two weeks before Claire gave birth to Emily, Jaime was at home alone with Sarah. He heard her playing upstairs, chatting away with her imaginary friend, when suddenly he heard glass breaking. He ran upstairs as quickly as possible to find his daughter standing in the hallway, holding a hammer. She was staring up at the wall of family pictures that were now smashed to pieces. There was glass everywhere. Jaime picked his daughter up and carried her down the stairs. He told her to stay put as he returned to the upstairs hallway to clean up the shattered fragments of their family portraits. When he returned to the living room, he asked her directly, ""Sweetie, why would you smash all of our family pictures?"" 

She looked at him, ""Helen Mary told me to do it.""

When Claire returned home that evening from her girls night with friends, Jaime told her about the incident. The crept up the stairs so as not to wake their daughter, so Claire could view the damage with her own eyes. She gasped silently at the sight. 

When they returned downstairs to the kitchen, they started to discuss possible explanations for her behavior. Suddenly, the color ran out of Claire's face and she looked at Jaime. ""There's no way she could have done that alone.""

""What?""

""There is no way she could have smashed all of those pictures by herself.""

Jaime was confused, ""I told you, I caught her with the hammer. She told me that she did it.""

But it wasn't until his wife said it aloud that it dawned on him, ""But… some of those pictures are almost five feet off the ground. How could she have reached those?""

His mind was racing, ""She must have moved a chair or something.""

She was adamant, ""There are no chairs upstairs that she is strong enough to move without you hearing it, and you would have seen her carry one upstairs, right?""

Jaime was silent. He didn't have an answer. 

They went to bed that night without any answers. The following morning their daughter had little recollection of smashing the pictures and Jamie wrote it off as sleepwalking. Though he didn't have much time to think about it, as two weeks later his second little girl was born.

Emily was two years old in the summer of 2012, and one afternoon, when Claire was at home alone with the girls, she heard Emily alone upstairs, whispering. She called up to her, ""Who you talking to, kiddo?""

""The woman standing in the hallway.""

Claire thought that her Sarah must have told her about her imaginary friend, and that she was simply trying to emulate her big sister. Then she spoke again.

""She doesn't like you, Mommy""

""Why doesn't she like me?"" Claire responded, surprised. 

""I don't know."" 

Suddenly her daughter came bounding down the stairs as if nothing had happened. Even though both Jaime and Claire both found this slightly creepy, nothing about the situation ever felt threatening or malevolent. Until one night last month.

Jaime had put the kids to sleep around eight o'clock in the evening and he and Claire had got into bed soon after. Exhausted, Jaime and his wife fell asleep extremely quickly. Jaime was awoken by the sound of screaming. He was disoriented and had no idea what time it was, but he could tell that it was his wife screaming right next to him. He turned to see what was wrong and saw it. His 3 year old daughter Emily, standing beside the bed, with a hammer in her hand. Blood poured from Claire's forehead. Jamie jumped out of bed and grabbed the hammer out of his daughters hand. He turned to his wife. She had stopped screaming now, and Jaime grabbed a towel from the bathroom and wiped the blood away from her face. She was going to be alright, but she did have a deep cut to her forehead. 

Jaime picked up his daughter and carried her out of the room. He went and checked on Sarah, who had awoken to the screaming but was clearly unharmed. He told her that everything was alright and closed her door. He was standing alone with his daughter in the upstairs hallway, and he finally asked her, ""Emily, why would you hurt Mommy?""

""She told me to, Daddy.""

""Who told you to?"" 

""The woman standing right behind you. She told me to hurt Mommy"" And then Jaime felt a chill run up his spine when his daughter leaned into his ear and whispered, ""And she told me to hurt you too, Daddy.""

darkened-thoughts,1,,5,1rg1d9,,21,"I want to turn around. It's three in the morning, the lights are off, and I'm bathed in the luminescent glow of this old monitor. I just kept clicking through - that was my greatest vice. I could have let it rest. But with every story, my blood pumped faster, my breath came quicker.

There's nothing like a good scare. Every rush of adrenaline left me wanting more. That next fix got harder to find, took longer. I grew discerning, opinionated, a veteran of the genre. Soon I was writing for myself; days spent clacking the keys and nights spent in marathon research sessions. I was a crow picking through the maggots and gore for that next juicy nibble. I was a man consumed, and like a junkie messiah I wanted to share my high with others.

Everything has a basis in reality. Think about it. Why do the holy men think your soul needs saving? Why do children fear the dark? What's there in the unknown deep, what is it that averts our gaze?

That's why I'm here now. That's why I'm writing to you. I come bringing the ultimate high. All you have to do is believe. Believe in me, in the hellish nightmares that chase after you in your sleep, in the stories you read and the movies you watch. When you believe, the hunt is on.

My stomach is in knots, every heartbeat a hammer blow against my sternum. My hands are shaking. My breath comes in stecatto bursts. I can't hold on much longer. The anticipation is mounting, building to orgasmic frenzy. I found it, the ultimate high. Or rather, it found me. All I had to do was believe. All I have to do is turn around.

My faith is sure, and I know it with every fiber in my being:

It's here. And it hates me.",I couldn't stop.,26,nosleep
lamented_dreams,4,,9,1rgqu8,,13,"I love the dark. I really do.

I don't mean going gothic and pagan and all that, but I do like the dark. I like to sit in my room for hours on end into the night watching videos, researching diseases and the supernatural, and writing stories.

Anyways, I've recently come across a quote from a game called 'Knock Knock'. And let me say, it's utterly terrifying for not just the player, but the watcher too. There's nothing but this overwhelming sense of dread throughout all of the game.

""You thought about it, and now, it is inside."" —Knock Knock

That quote has seemed to have seeped into my brain. Multiple broken theories have been written down in my notebooks and journals and I've seemed to have come to a conclusion.

The mind isn't wrong. Reality is. And, with that, imagination often holds more truth than what we accept.

Think about it. When you were a small child, things like fairytales and horror stories were much more real to your innocent mind. In fact, there is a theory that children have a sixth sense that they gradually lose as they progress into adulthood. Also when you were a child, you thought of monsters and what they would do to you as well as how terrifying they looked.

And when you thought about these things, you didn't want to turn around. Why? Because what if for the slightest moment, you were right? All those lone yellow eyes in the darkness, the sinking feeling of being watched, out of all those times, what if this was the moment you were right? Or moreover what if you were always right and they just didn't want you to know... until now.

Because honestly, we used to think the Earth was flat. Then that it had the sun revolving around us. So what makes us so absolutely sure that we are the only ones out there now?

This is my theory.

I shared with one of my colleagues about two weeks ago and five days later she called me screaming about how there was something in her house. The police showed up and they took her to the hospital. She had three slash marks down her back, resembling that of almost a wolf. She also had multiple bruises on her neck. They said there was no signs of break in and the wrecking of the house was most likely the result of her having a psychotic episode.

This could be true, but I don't like how unsettlingly close it is to when I told her about my theory.

""You thought about it, and now, it is inside.""

This is the phrase that keeps me from imagining creatures. When I went to the hospital to visit her she was curled up in the bed, shaking with her knees up as close to her chest as possible. When I asked her what happened she wouldn't tell me who, only that 'it' got inside. She just had this empty look in her eyes, something very uncommon since she was always so hyper and nice. When I asked how she just said, ""I thought about it, and it came in.""

Keep in mind I never told her about the quote at all. Those were her own words. So this is more than unsettling for me. It may be possible that this 'theory' spooked her enough for all of this to happen, but I don't like the coincidences.

angelcot,3,,2,1rh91p,,11,"Hi /r/nosleep. This is kind of embarrassing to post, but here's a few stories of things that happened to me as a kid. I was a pretty anxious kid, and a lot of weird stuff happened to me. Nothing paranormal, though There's more than just these stories, but I thought I'd at least start with this.

Ever since I was a kid, I've been afraid of windows. That's not saying much, though. I was afraid of just about everything else, too. But growing up, my house was full of big windows. Floor-to-ceiling windows in the family room, two sliding glass doors in the dining room, a huge window that looked out from our kitchen into the front yard. My mom never bought curtains or blinds for any of the windows other than the ones in our bedrooms because she'd get depressed if it were too dark in our house. 

I had light blue curtains in my bedroom that my grandmother sewed for me since my windows were an irregular size. Every night I would pull them closed, then pin them down to the walls with a pushpin so that I wasn't able to see even a sliver of the outside out of the corner of my eye. My bedroom window looked out on the backyard. I remember being so irritated whenever someone would accidentally leave the back porch light on. The light would shine through my light blue curtains and play shadows on my wall. I'd cover my head with my pillow so that I could fall asleep without worrying if I would be able to make out the silhouette of someone trying to peer through my curtains, still pinned to the wall. 

From a young age, I had problems with insomnia. My mom struggled with it, too. I remember my dad telling me stories of when my parents were still married, when my mom would wake him up just to talk because she still wasn't asleep at 4, 5, 6 in the morning. I remembered feeling envious that I didn't have someone to do that to. I listened to books on tape at bedtime to fill the silence. Sometimes I would sneak into my brothers' room and lay on their floor, hoping for sleep to come. Being uncomfortably aware of how their curtains weren't drawn completely closed. 

When I was 10, I moved from my room- which overlooked the backyard- to my brothers' room, and my brothers separated and took over my room, and the office. My new room was at the front of the house. If my curtains were open, someone could easily look in as they walked up the path to our front door. During the day, I didn't mind it. I could watch for my friends or packages from the postman. At night, it made me so anxious I began to develop a habit of vomiting nightly. My mom was sympathetic, but didn't know what to do about it. A year later, I was moved back into my old room, and my older brother moved back into his. I stopped vomiting every night. 

I feel like I had a reason for being so afraid of windows. One night- I must have been about 6 or 7- I was up late, as usual, listening to *Ralph S. Mouse* on tape for the billionth time. I had emptied the glass of water that my mom had gotten for me, so I got up to refill it. I was already wary of windows, so I kept my head down on my way to the kitchen. I'd often see things out of the corner of my eye; something moving, or something that *could* have been the shadow of a human, but would later try to convince myself it was nothing.

Even with my head down, something outside caught my attention. A car, parked in front of my house. I lived at the very bottom of a cul-de-sac, so we didn't have a lot of people drive down our street at night and stop to reorient themselves. The car had its headlights on, and I could tell there was someone sitting in the car. Looking at my house. I don't know if they were looking at me, but my paranoia told me they were. I stood there for a long time, forgetting about my glass of water. I didn't look away. Paralyzed, until my mom came in the kitchen. She'd seen my door was open and wondered what I was doing up. When she noticed the car in front of our house, she quieted and gently pushed me out of the kitchen and back to my bedroom. I noticed the car started to drive away as I was ushered away from the window. 

This staring contest with the person in the car in front of my house happened twice more, although over the course of a few months. Once, they switched their headlights off, and stayed for what might have been 45 minutes. Although my memory might be exaggerating. I still don't understand why I was so afraid of seeing someone in my bedroom window, but how I could fearlessly stare out of the kitchen window at the person in the parked car. Maybe I felt less vulnerable in the kitchen. Maybe I was comforted by the fact that they were so far away. Even though the walk from where they parked was just a few seconds from my front door and the window I was looking out. 

The third and final time I saw the car, the person got out of their car. They were tall, and I could see them standing on the other side of their car but I still wasn't able to make out their face. When they started to walk around their car and- I assume- towards my front door, I scurried back to my bed. 

I never liked sleepovers as a kid. Staying over at a friends house meant laying awake on their floor for hours with nothing to listen to but the sound of their calm breathing. Nothing to look at except for the sliver of their window I could see from behind their curtains. Having friends at my house was just as stressful. Usually we'd sleep in the family room, because it had a TV in it. It also had the floor-to-ceiling windows. Usually I would sneak off to my own room after my friends had fallen asleep, so that I could sleep peacefully away from those big windows. 

When I was about 8 years old, I was having a sleepover with a few of my friends. It was after 10, so my friends were starting to fall asleep. I knew I still had *at least* two or three more hours of being wide awake. I was laying on the couch, swaddled in my blanket. The TV was still on, but I'd turned the volume down for my sleeping friends to something barely audible. Usually, I tried to keep my eyes away from the windows. But that night my cat caught my attention, meowing and hissing at something outside. I cautiously looked out the window, worried about what my cat might have seen out there. Just another cat, skittering in front of the window. Relieved, I looked out at my dark backyard. Was that it? 

There was a man in my backyard, walking around. Even with the distance, I distinctly remember he was frowning. He had his hands in his pockets. I did not know this man. 

I woke up one of my friends, whispering in her ear and telling her there was somebody in the backyard. She stirred quickly, obviously alarmed, and looked outside. She saw him too. I'm not sure if he felt our little eyes on him or what, but he turned to face us. Neither of us made a move; not to lay back down and pretend we were asleep, not even to look at each other, or look away. 

There were a pair of french doors that lead to the back patio in my family room, right in the middle of the wall of windows. The man walked up to the doors and tapped on one of the small window panes. The handle of what looked to be a heavy flashlight hung out of the pocket of his sweatshirt. He smiled at us. Not a deranged smile, not a smile that looked too wide for his face. Just a calm, warm smile. He mouthed something and pointed at the doorknob. I was never very good at reading lips. I stared straight ahead, unblinking, not responding. I could hear my friends' breath, heavy and shaking. 

He spoke, the sound of his voice muffled through the glass, ""Open the door."" A pause, he knit his eyebrows together like he was concerned. ""I'm visiting your parent. Let me in."" 

My heart was beating out of my chest. I was a paranoid enough little kid to not fall for this line. I mustered up every ounce of courage I had in my little, anxious, 8-year-old body, and got up off the couch. For a moment, they man at the door looked relieved. I ran out of the room, screaming for my mom. I could hear my friend call out at me that he was leaving, and the rest of my friends starting to stir. I told my mom what had happened. She turned on all the outside lights and called the police while my step-dad looked out every window for any signs of the man. All of the girls at my sleepover had their moms come over and pick them up. I cried, and stayed the night in my parents bed, although I'm pretty sure I didn't sleep.

In my mom's bathroom, there was a big window that looked out at the sideyard. The glass was distorted, though, so my mom never bothered putting a curtain over it. You couldn't see into the bathroom if you were just passing by the window. If you stopped to press your face against the glass, you could see in or out, but everyone in the house knew not to do that when they were in the sideyard. I remember my mom shrieking one night, running out of the bathroom, saying she'd seen something through the glass. A rat, climbing up the windowsill and staring into the bathroom.

I always liked my mom's shower more than the one in my bathroom. My bathroom didn't have a fan in it, so the whole bathroom would get uncomfortably humid. The shower curtain in my bathroom reminded me too much of that scene from *Psycho*, too, and I'd always shower with the shower curtain pulled open, and I'd get water all over the floor. My mom's shower had a glass door that I liked much more, even if there was that big window I could see clearly from the shower. 

Once when I was 12, I was showering in my mom's bathroom because my parents were out of town. My brothers were home, but were playing video games in the family room. I would keep my head down when I showered in my mom's bathroom. Even if the window's glass was hard to see through, it was still a window, and the shower was the most vulnerable place I could think of being looked at. Every once and a while, I would glance up to quell my growing anxiety. To tell myself *nothing was out there*. 

Cautiously, I looked up to satisfy my anxiety. *Nothing was out there*, I told myself. My gaze met the window. There was a dark figure pressed up against the glass. Through the foggy, wet shower door, I couldn't see anything. All I know was that it was *somebody*. I screamed, and ducked down past the tiles so that whoever was out there, they couldn't see me. A few moments later, I heard my brothers knocking at the door, both of them calling my name and asking if I was ok. I pulled a towel from outside the shower and wrapped myself up before I stood up. Whoever was out there was gone. 

A few weeks later, my friends and I were playing in the side yard. There was a huge tree out there that we liked to climb in, and pretend we were characters from X-Men or Sonic. My friend called my attention to something in the grass, over by the window of my mom's bathroom. A polaroid picture of the distorted glass of the window it lay in front of.  ",Windows.,13,nosleep
Spudz_OCD,6,,6,1rgcw5,,9,"Hey redditors, im new at this so excuse my writing skills

All through my life ive had things happen that i just couldn't explain, i've told a couple of friends but even they don't know what to say.

My story begins when i was a kid about the age of six or seven, we lived in a poor neighbourhood in southern Ireland and had a shithole of a house, i lived in a room with my two brothers (kyle[8-9  at the time], and Dylan[3-4]) and had been for a couple of years so i was used to sharing a room. The first incident occurred after about a year in the house (our street was built on a graveyard) and happenned in our room. it was an ordinary day before it happenned, woke up, ate breakfast, went to school, nothing out of the ordinary. however when i came home from school that day, there was something odd about the house, I couldn't quite tell what it was but it just felt wrong. But being a kid at the time, i thought nothing of it and carried on with my daily routine. after dinner and a shower my mom put us to bed. After my mom turned out the lights and left the room, i began to drift off to sleep. after about an hour and a half of hazy dreams, i was suddenly awoken by a loud crashing sound, kind of like if you dropped a frying pan, i quiclky jumped up my pillow and sat upright in bed. I looked over to Dylan's bed at the other side of the room, he ws still asleep. I began to question if i had actually heard it at all. feeling curious i checked if kyle was awake (we had a bunk-bed, Kyle was on top) as i was climbing the four step ladder, i felt a burst of cold air rush from kyles bed and immediately dropped to the ground, waking up Kyle.
""what are you doing"", he said.
""i heard a noise so i wanted to see if--""
""--sshh"", he stopped me mid sentance, and focused his gaze to the back of the room; The look on his face will be forever imprinted into my mind. I turned around gingerly and what i saw was scary enough to make me cringe even today. I saw a scrawny black figure hunched over Dylan, who was still asleep. But this figure was definately not human; It was at least 7 feet tall, it's head was overpoweringly large compared to it's beyond anorexic body. It's fingers were 6-7 inches long minimum. From what i saw it wore nothing, but it very well could have, as it was late at night and i was still half asleep. Then the image that will haunt me forever; It, whatever it was, turned towards me and Kyle. It just stood there, staring at us for what felt like forever, it then jumped towards us and simply vanished into thin air right before it hit me. I was left lying on the floor and Kyle was wondering if what we had just seen was actually real. I looked at him and back to Dylan's bed, whatever it as, when it jumped it jumped with enough force to push the blanket off the end of Dylan's bed. I looked back towards Kyle, who was already asleep again, and decided to go back to sleep myself, not knowing if what we'd seen that night was just a figment of our imagination or not.
When i woke up the following morning i hesitantly asked my mom and sister if they'd seen or heard anything last night..they didn't. So i questioned kyle about it and he said that he had no idea what i was on about, he had no memory of seeing or hearing anything, he didnt even remember me falling off the bunk ladder.
To this day i still cant quite figure out what happened that night.

My second experience was only four or five years ago, a couple of months after moving to Australia. We were living in a pretty old house at the time so it was a bit creaky and what not. it was a pretty average day when it happenned;I was 14 and I was once again in bed at the time. I was sharing a room with Dylan (10) at the time. Kyle (16) was in a room across the hallway, Jenny (12) was the next door down and my parent's room was at the end of the hallway. It was about 11-12 at night, and we were all just about asleep. My mom and step-father at the time were out exploring the wild clubs of Surfers Paradise, so it ws just us kids. I was almost asleep when i heard slight footsteps coming from the kithcen area. I wondered who it was considering we were all in bed, so i opened the door to check. I headed towards the kitchen, once i reached the living room (about half-way to kitchen from my room) i could see into the kitchen, i slowly emerged from the wall; no one there..weird, i thought, so i headed back to my room, but as soon as i turned around Kyle was standing right in front of me with a knife. I jumped quicker than i'd ever jumped before. Kyle then laughed his head off and went back to bed. I did the same without the laughing.. I was back in my room, now lying in bed realising im too awake to go back to sleep. i just lay there for about five minutes staring at the ceiling untill i heard more footsteps in the kitchen. I called out
""Kyle, go to bed, idiot""
""i am you fuckwit"", he said as he emerged from his room half asleep
""well then who's upstairs?"" i asked
""It's probably just a possum in the attic or something don't worry""
I regretfully closed the door and went back to bed. But as soon as i did, loud heavy footsteps started making their way down the hallway, along with heavy thumping on the walls, they were getting closer and a hell of a lot louder, It sounded like someone was trying to stomp and bash rats out of the walls and floor. It kept coming closer and increasing in volume until it was at the point where it was like gunshots right outside my room. It then stomped right outside my door and my door swung open with extreme noise and force and standing at the door was, i shit you not, the same tall, black scrawny fucked up figure that i saw years ago. I practically shat myself. It stood there for a couple of seconds, but if felts like hours, then started stomping and sprinted towards my moms room. I don't know why but i instantly got up and ran towards the door and looked towards my moms room; nothing there, it vanished again. I dropped to the ground in shock, just as Kyle open his door and screamed ""WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT"" 
""It's back"" ,i said
""What's back?""
""the thing i saw hunched over Dylan""
I stayed up all night that night not wanting to sleep knowing that thing followed us to Australia

My most recent encounter with our old friend was last year. We'd moved into an old complex of houses that had a bit of a history in the crime side of things. We'd been living there for about 6 months and my friend from primary school, Jordan, was now living in the complex too. It was around 5PM and it was just Jordan Kyle and I in the house. I was playing my i-pod at the time, Kyle was in the kitchen and Jordan was behind me. Kyle decided to pick up a coin and throw it at an unsuspecting Jordan, who surprisingly, caught it, and returned fire. but then Jordan moved a little backwards and Kyle threw it further and harder. The coin flew through the air right past my head and stopped rigth in front of Jordans face, IT LITERALLY STOPPED IN MID AIR, it stood still in front of his face for less than a second and then was propelled back towards Kyle with nearly twice the force. We all just stood there speechless, not knowing if that had really just happened. Later that day we were showing a friend what had happened  and were back in the Kitchen messing around with coins to see if it would happen again. When suddenly a ball flew through the air at Kyle, like it had been thrown with force from the stairs leading upstairs. For the second time that day we were utterly speechless and had no idea what to do.
That night after Jordan had left and Kyle went to bed, i was making a late night snack. Dylan was in the living room watching TV and there was nobody else in the house. I finished making the snack and was about to head into the living room when in the corner of my eye, I saw the figure that i had seen twice before glide upstairs; same height, same scrawniness, same long fingers only this time it was a little misty, like a shadow, and it looked right into my eyes as it vanished upstairs.
I am still wondering what the actual fuck that figure is, all i know is that my mother has become a claire-voyant.I know for a fact that there is definately going to be a lot more of this thing which i have nicknamed ""the figure"".

For the time being i will keep an eye out for my little follower and if i see him/her again i will not hesitate to report the time, date, and details of the situation and of course reddit the fuck out of it.
for now redditors, i bid you farewell

the_dark_half,5,,1,1rhyj5,,7,"You know that feeling when you’re all alone and hear your name whispered? Maybe you’ve walked into a room only to suddenly feel a sudden temperature drop? Had things go missing only to re-appear in odd places? Maybe you’re like me and you lie in bed at night, only to feel like someone stroking your hair but when you become fully conscious and turn around, nothing. 
Think you walk through a cobweb or hair falls on your arms or neck and brushes against your skin delicately, tickling you? You check and nothing was there? I’m sure your parents tell you it’s nothing from a young age; perhaps because they themselves are deluded enough to believe that it is their imagination. They probably deep down fear it’s a ghost or apparition. Even they couldn’t know how much worse it really is.  Stop deluding yourself. It’s not a cobweb. It’s not the wind. It’s not nothing. It’s something far more sinister, an insidious force which slowly grows stronger the more you feed it your fear and attention. 

Some of you, I’m sure, will be fortunate enough only to feel cold spots and occasionally hear creaks and footsteps in your house. It’s such a common occurrence that people barely notice it and if they do, it’s the spookiest part of a generic horror movie, because those suits in Hollywood haven’t seen what these creatures are really capable of. If you believe in the paranormal you may experience the whispers of what I can only loosely refer to as their ‘voices’. I’m sure not many of you have had the misfortune to awaken to them standing over your bed, taking the forms of whatever creatures or person your subconscious fears most because it’s real form is so terrifying you’d probably die instantly or become paralysed with fear, a zombie-esque state you’ll never awaken from-and that would ruin their fun too early. If you don’t die instantly, seeing their faces will make your eyes bleed; hearing their voices unrestrained will shatter your ear drums and I’ve heard of cases where insides have been liquefied, skin melting and bleeding seeping out of every pore.

The first time I awoke to one in my room with me, it was after I’d given the footsteps and banging on the walls attention. I had thought it was cool, I even bought a stupid Ouija board and told them it was okay for them to try and talk to me. I had been lying in bed after a night of drinking so I passed off the initial taunts and laughs as nothing more than my intoxicated imagination, until my door slowly opened and in came one large hairy leg, followed by more spindly legs, followed by many eyes and two huge fucking fangs. Yep, a giant spider, bigger than a horse came into my room. I tried to scream, but that just resulted with me hyperventilating, then vomiting all over the floor. It strode in, all beady eyes on me and as it slinked atop my bed I tried to pathetically crawl away, but it held me down with its two front legs, piercing into the flesh of my shoulders as I whimpered like a small animal about to be devoured-which I was.  I felt the sharp pain of its fangs tear through my skin and inject me with poison that made my blood burn. I lay in bed, delirious, desperate, muttering for help. My ears were greeted with a cacophony of voices, screaming horrible things that were so foul that before that night had been unimaginable to me. I passed out shortly after, from fear, blood loss or the venom and awoke a few days later, believing to have all been a dream. I clung to that hope until I stepped outside my bedroom door and found dozens of small animals, birds mostly, wrapped up in what appeared to be spider’s webs, discoloured, drained of their blood and insides. All dead. I ran to the bathroom to throw up and caught sight of myself, dried blood caked on my body and face, puncture wounds all over me and strands of silky web still wrapped around my breasts, my stomach, my legs and in my hair. 

The second night I encountered one of them, they took the form of my uncle. I lived with my uncle for nearly 5 years while my father was travelling almost every week for business. I know my father loved me and desperately needed the money that he had to work from dawn until way after the sun set and had to leave me for long periods. He didn’t know what his brother did to me. That night as I became increasingly aware of the noises in my apartment and the feelings of someone touching me and whispering in my ear, I rolled over to see my uncle grinning at me. He crawled onto the bed and tied me down. I struggled, but when I did he beat me with his belt, like he had started doing when I was eight years old. I fought as hard as I could, tears burning my eyes and sobbing uncontrollably, but he kept cutting away at my clothes with a pocket knife and telling me to be a good girl. The torture that night lasted for many hours, possibly days. I try not to remember it. I thought I had moved on from those childhood years and buried them a few years ago, when my uncle died. This was not the last time the monsters took on forms like this to break me. They’ve only grown stronger with every drop of blood, with every scream and with every hopeless sob I’ve given them.

Their true form will only appear to you in dreams at first because they get to torment you in ways that won’t instantaneously butcher you or drive you insane, yet; they like to take their time with their toys. The dreams for me started after those incidents. I have seen what those beings really look like and…just thinking about it is enough for me to start violently shaking, unable to stop retching. The other day I wasn’t careful and thought about one of them and a stranger had to hold me back as I unconsciously started walking in front of a train. In my dreams, it is pure hell as they have my undivided attention for hours and can do whatever they want to me without my body breaking and bending the way it would in the waking world, but it all feels real. 
Part of me stares at length of rope on my coffee table and considers leaving this torment…but what if when I die, I get sent to their realm, to be their plaything forever? 

It’s not just the occasional brush against my skin, the odd floor creak and the rare moment of ‘is someone calling my name?’ Now I feel them on me at all times, their rough, sharp skin cutting mine, scratching me, violating every single part of my body. Their voices scream and howl at me, maniacally taunting and laughing at my never-ending misery. Even when I shut my eyes, I still see them, their hideous beings beyond any words the human language has to describe them to you. 

Most of you think of those household noises and strange occurrences as the work of ghosts, of spirits. Yes, it is so comforting for humans to believe these presences are the souls of dead people who are just sad and wandering, isn’t it? You want to be able to talk to someone no longer alive; you open your mind and let them in. Don’t. What’s out there isn’t human, it isn’t some person with unfinished business, what’s out there wants you to think that, to get comfortable with inviting it in and letting yourself become aware of it. 

Did you just hear that faint noise outside your window, like a soft breeze carrying a faint whisper? That creak outside your room? That faint sensation on your flesh? I hope not, because now you know what’s really there and they’ve always known about you.",Don't give them attention.,8,nosleep
Rhapsodeyus,1,,0,1rgtyq,,8,"Some may recall a story I posted a few months back, about shadow-like figures who visited me on a mission for knowledge, and afterwards, disappeared like ghosts. For those who do not recall, the story is [Curious Visitors](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l4dv2/curious_visitors/).

If you have not read that, well, you probably haven't missed much, but it will help with the backstory for this one if you do read it.

Done reading? Good, let's continue.

This happened last night, Sunday, November 24th, 2013. I woke up at precisely 4:27 AM, and I know this because I watched my small digital alarm clock on my bedside table flip to 4:27 AM as my eyes opened. I also noticed that my lamp was off (I sleep with the light on for safety reasons, since living with cats can be hazardous). However, I could see my plain, black clock in a pale blueish light.

My brain clicked. ""My laptop is on. I must have left it on and the power went out, so it's running on battery."" Then I remembered, quite clearly, turning it off and closing it before going to bed. That's when I felt a weight at the end of my bed, sitting in front of my laptop.

I sat up, looked, and spotted a shadowy figure sitting in front of my laptop. The NoSleep submission form was up. I coughed, and said quietly, ""You could have asked."" Instead of, say, a sudden spin and a glare from Brarger, as I expected, my visitor vanished instantly.

I didn't expect that, and it startled me thoroughly. My previous visitors would never have been so rude, and certainly would have asked my permission to access my personal computer. I shifted, tossed the covers aside, and moved to the end of the bed, to read what it had written.

I now wish I hadn't.

The message ends there. I suppose I interrupted the agent and he fled.

Whether this is genuine or not, I cannot know. If it is a fake by a rogue agent, then its purpose is unclear, but it is certainly unsettling. If this is a prank, then it's impressively elaborate, yet in poor taste.

JUVIE_MAKER,2,,1,1rhq9j,,8,"I have a nose for things. No seriously, all my life I’ve had a very strong sense of smell and I don’t mean for the average person. I have an abnormally, freakishly, ridiculously, absurd sense of smell. It’s been that way since I was a kid. Here’s a prime example, when I was about four or five I used to visit my grandmother (god rest her soul) every month in Daytona Beach for the summer. My grandmother was notorious for making the best homemade cakes in the neighborhood. I would always leave my Gran’s house at least ten pounds heavier each summer after gorging myself on her delicious treats. One Saturday, after a day of playing outside (when kids used to play outside!) I instantly smelled the aroma of cake wafting through the air, but something was…..off. There was another smell lingering behind the cake scent. It was kinda tangy, bitter, sorta nutty …just all around unpleasant. Being so young, I couldn’t quite put my finger on what the smell was but I knew I didn’t like it. Then out comes my Gran from the kitchen with a big slice of her freshly made cake on a china plate. She passes the dining room table and spots me standing there with my nose crinkled up in disgust.

Gran:  What’s the matter baby? Come sit at the table and have a slice of cake.

Five year old me: I aint eating that cake, it smells funny!

(Let me just interject for a second.  Now if your family is old school like mine, you know that a child is to NEVER disrespect an elder’s cooking! Especially if that elder is a family member, you just don’t do it! That is unless you want a black eye, ribs broken, missing teeth… you get the picture.)

Gran: Girl, get your hind parts over here and eat this cake before I slap the hell out of you!!

Oh geez…there’s that tone. You know it, you know it well. That angry deep tone that resonates from parents when their truly pissed off. You know… that voice that scares the living shit out of you and gives you’re delicate child-like mind nightmares for a month (or your whole life). Yeah that’s what I was hearing right about then. But still I was adamant. I would not eat that damn cake. That smell! It was just too potent. Now, you might be thinking, what’s the big deal? Surely you’ve smelled worse things than that cake before, which is very true. At that point in my life I’d smelled worse things before (WAY WORSE) but I’d never been subjected to eat those things either. Also, the stench of that pastry….it was just… so very not right. I was only a child but I was still old enough to know right from wrong, and that cake was definitely wrong! Even at that very moment I could taste its bitterness in the back of my mouth. With every inhale it burned and tingled down my throat.

Gran: Come over here and take this plate now!

Okay at this point I knew I was in REAL trouble. Even if my grandmother didn’t kill me, I was pretty sure I was in for the ass whooping of my life! I slowly started to back away from Gran as she moved closer to me with that dreaded cake. Even as she inched towards me that smell seem too magnify. With every step she took it grew more and more intense! “Girl, you better take this cake!” she yelled holding the plate out in front of her. I turned to run but she quickly snatched up my arm before I could get away. “No!” I shouted feverishly trying to pull away from her grip, “I don’t want the cake, granny!!” but my pleas of desperation came to no avail. My grandmother started to tug me towards the kitchen table, her fingers angrily wrapped around my tiny forearm. Suddenly, she yanked me forward making my body jump about two feet in her direction, tilting my face towards hers. She looked down at me with an awful glare. Dark hollow eyes glowered down from Gran’s wrinkled sockets. Her once loving face was now rigid and stiff with a sadistic expression that I had by no means seen before. “You will eat this cake!” She shouted through gritted teeth. “Even if I have to shove it down your throat piece by piece!” 

I had never seen this side to my Gran before. My once sweet, devoted granny had turned into this vicious monster plucked straight out of my worst nightmares. My small frame quaked in fear and tears began to seep from my eyes. I had never known terror like this. My insides loosened and squirmed like jelly making the contents of my bladder empty and leak down my legs. To say I was afraid would be the understatement of the freakin decade! But you know what? There was something else I was more fearful of. Even as I pissed myself in sheer horror from the presence of my devil-like grandmother, there was still something more bloodcurdling, more utterly terrifying than her…that fucking cake! 

“NO!!!!!!!” echoed from my lips in a banshee scream and with all the strength I possessed I juggernauted into my grandmother. My body throttled into her torso head first making a loud solid grunt bellow from the old woman. Her arms flew in the air (letting me go in the same instance) and her vast body collapsed backwards before suddenly….CRACK!
The sound of my grandmother’s head crashing along the rim of her kitchen table splintered throughout the house. Gran thudded to the ground like a sack of potatoes and the plate with the cake she so firmly held onto shattered on the floor. I stared at her lifeless body as blood began to seep through her head and flow on the linoleum. I was still too little to know the true meaning of life and death but I did know for sure that red liquid was not suppose to be running out of her head like that. I bent down and looked into Gran’s half opened eyes. They weren’t black any more. They’d gone back to their normal brown again. Not really knowing what to do I just stared down at the gruesomeness of it all, watching the chunks of yellow cake absorb the blood until each piece was just as red. 

To make a long story short the police were eventually called. My Gran’s weekly bridge game was on that day and a couple of her elder counterparts found her body, and me sitting in a pool of piss and blood staring at it. Needless to say there were lots of screams. Oh, and you’re probably wondering what that smell was, right? I actually didn’t find out until I was well into my teens what exactly it was. I was pouring it into my foster parent’s coffee one morning when it finally hit me…Cyanide. From the smell of it, Gran probably couldn’t have used too much either. Maybe half a teaspoon, give or take; totally undetectable to the average person’s nose…but not to mine. “So that’s what that was, go figure”.  I remember thinking that to myself as I stirred the cyanide into two mugs. My foster parents passed away later on that day, I wish I could say I feel sadness over it but I really don’t.  I was more consumed with thoughts on why my grandmother was trying to kill me? Was it because of what I’d done to Oscar, her cute little Maltese? I mean, if I’d known the oven wasn’t a suitable place to put a dog I might have done things differently. I was only two at the time. Or perhaps it had something to do with what happened with Mommy…that really was unfortunate. I didn’t want to hurt her, but she was an obstacle that just had to be removed. 

But anyways, that’s neither here nor there. I’m an adult now and those days are long behind me. I’m actually on my way to my boyfriend’s…excuse me….ex-boyfriend’s apartment right now. I’m visiting him and that slut he cheated on me with. And guess what? They just had a baby, isn’t that the sweetest thing.  ",A nose for things...,9,nosleep
1234FUCK,7,,4,1rhjmk,,6,"So my uncle has always been into the paranormal and he got me into paranormal investigation, Or ghost hunting to simplify it a few years back. Well I go with him on a lot of them and we do it for free for people who think something paranormal is going on in their houses. I always saw it as a nice little hobby to do on the weekends to blow of some time and I always liked being scared. I mean that’s how I even know about this sub-reddit because I like reading it. And that’s one of the only reasons I knew about what had happened on my last investigation. 


	We got a call from a family out in the middle of the country saying they had begun hearing weird voices when they were each alone but the 16 year old son was the one who had it happen the most. I went through every scenario I could think on the way there, Something was legitimately going on that was paranormal, one of the kids was lying and was fucking with the rest of the family and other such things. Well when we got there we talked with the family and everyone seemed happy except the two children. The son was as I said earlier 16 and the girl was 14, they seemed uneasy looking off into corners and such. I took a note about it but didn’t dwell on it that much. We went around the house marking places we would put cameras and getting the lay out of the house. Once we finished that we went back to our van and started getting ready. After we set up all of our equipment we each got our POV (Point of view) cameras strapped on and started our investigation. My Uncle took the upstairs, our colleague took the first floor, And I went into the basement to do a little investigating of my own. 


I made my way downstairs and grabbed my Walky-talky and radioed my uncle asking if everyone was ready for me to hit the main light breaker. He gave me the go ahead and I flipped the little switch plunging the whole house into darkness I held up the other camera I had with me so I could have a camera move around freely ( plus it had a night vision setting so I could see where I was going.) Well I turned it on and walked slowly to the chair I had placed in the room so I could sit comfortably waiting for something to happen. And after an hour or so of me questioning the darkness.. It answered back.
My instincts kicked in and I put a call in on the radio for everyone to tell me where they were. And everyone was exactly where they said they were supposed to be. My heart froze in my throat from fear but excitement so I stood and asked who I was talking to and I heard a small wispy chuckle before it said softly “You know who I am.” I swallowed hard before continuing to walk around the room and asking questions. It stayed silent for a few questions before I asked why it was here. It chuckled again before I heard a small sound. Like a door knob jiggling and I turned towards it. My camera landed on a door knob sticking out from a sheet that I guess had covered it before. I walked towards it slowly pulling the sheet off to reveal a shabby door about waist height with peeling paint and scratch marks.  I put in a call on the radio telling my uncle and the others I had found something and for them to meet me in the basement. I got no answer back but I assumed they had gotten the message. My uncle did that a lot; he tended to get over excited with these things so I figured he was just trying to get here as fast as possible.  But the paranormal curiosity ran in the family so I reached down and grabbed the knob, it was warm as if someone had been holding it for a longtime. I steadied myself before twisting it and pushing it open. 


I looked through my camera screen as I walked into the door. The atmosphere around me seemed to change instantly, even though all the lights in the house was off it just seemed to be darker and colder in here the basement itself.  I looked around in the room through the screen until I saw a lone chair in the center of the room. I walked forward until I was right next to it and then began looking around more. I jumped a bit at the bright light on my screen until I noticed it was a mirror. It was bolted onto a beam  next to the chair and when I looked to the left I noticed the same thing. I thought it was really strange so I walked around the front of the chair and accidentally kicked something over.  It was loud and then I heard a sound of rushing water. My heart leapt into my throat as I looked down and around looking for the source until my camera came upon a metal bucket slightly rolling with water coming out. I also saw a candle and a small match book and that’s when it hit me. My whole body filled with fear as the realization flooded my head…. This was a “three kings” set up.


 I turned towards the door pointing the camera as I looked through it I saw the door slam and I stopped. My whole body froze from pure terror and it took me a few seconds before I let out a scream for help. After I stopped I heard the soft chuckle come from behind me in the darkness and I just stood there with my eyes closed shaking as I felt a soft breath on the back of my neck I heard a voice.. My voice whisper right into my ear. “ Do you know who I am now?” I stood there for a second before screaming again and then I heard the door bust open and I saw flash lights on me and my uncle asking what was wrong. I just ran from the room to the breaker box and flipped on all the lights. I then sank to the floor looking at him as he sat next to me and asked all that happened. I just held out my camera to him and he took it. Before he watched it he asked me why I didn’t call for back up and I looked at him before telling him that I did. He looked at our colleague before watching the recording.


 After that he asked me if we all went in together would I go back in. I nodded as long as we kept the lights on and we went in. and it was as I thought. It was a set up for “ The three kings.” I shuddered as I turned to my uncle asking if he knew what it was. He didn’t so I explained it to him and I pointed to the bucket “ and it has been used recently. The bucket was full of water. “ My uncle nodded to me and put a wrap on the investigation. We went back home and I have decided to type this up. Tomorrow we will be going and talking to the family about what happened and who had done the three kings in the house.  


I think the three kings set up has something to do with what has been happening at the house. I will update you all on what happens after we talk to them.

OsamaBinHiding,3,,1,1rhxdo,,6,"Last night was like every other night for me. Have dinner on my own in my small, yet cost flat and watch a little bit of TV. Around 9 or 10 o'clock, I start to crack on with some work as I had a university deadline in a couple days time. The minutes started going faster and before I knew it it was 12 o""clock. 

""Where did the time go?"" I thought. It had only felt like a few minutes. However, this was a normal occurrence for me. The world kind of, disappears when I get lost in a train of thought and for the life of me, I can't break out of it.

I had just remembered that I had a seminar early in the morning and suddenly thought ""Fuck, I better try and get some sleep"" 

See, I live in an old building that has been converted into flats in the suburbs of a major city. So it isn't uncommon to hear floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and all the walls are very thin so noises in the middle of the night just tend to go over my head. I wouldn't consider myself someone who doesn't get scared easily but when you're familiar with floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and branches tapping your window - you tend to grow some thick skin.

Last night wasn't like any other night in my flat though. 

As I mentioned earlier, I was alone. My flatmate - let's call him, Evan for the sake of the story, was away celebrating thanksgiving with his family but he's away a lot so I'm used to spending a long period of time on my own. My usual night routine of showering, brushing my teeth and cleaning the kitchen was over and I went into my room to finally rest my head for the night and that was when I first noticed something. My drawers were all pulled open. 

To most people, this is probably nothing - but for me it wasn't normal. I suffer from borderline OCD and everything, especially in my room needs to be in order and I remember waking up and everything was in order. I hadn't left my flat today either. 

""I'm too tired for this shit"" I thought and went to bed. 

It's weird though isn't it? That something like a mattress and a duvet can make you feel so safe, like nothing can hurt you. I remember being a child and I made sure none of my limbs were outside of my bed incase something grabbed me in the middle of the night. Such a feeble piece of furniture can make you feel so safe.

Well, not anymore for me. Last night I heard the usual creaking of the floorboards - no biggy, right? However, as I drew closer to conscientious, I realised that these creaking sounds weren't coming from the surrounding walls and neighbouring flats but they were coming from under my bed.

And that's when I felt the unmistakable sensation of a cold, coarse finger stroking mine over the side of my bed.

TaylorBonaseraSr,0,,2,1rhb2e,,5,"I can explain why I'm so afraid of mirrors, or anything that could reflect light, even a glass door. It's so difficult for me to talk about it sometimes, but other times I feel her pressing me on to tell as many people about her as possible. She broke my mirror the first time, just crashed right through the glass and shattered the glass into a literal hundred pieces. It was such a pain to have to clean all that up. I got at least five cuts. But she didn't care. At the very least she didn't laugh at me or yell at me to clean faster. At least she was nice enough to check herself for that. Anyway, I got my mirror replaced. She didn't break the bathroom mirror again, but she broke the great mirror in the hallway while she was running through it. I don't understand how she did it, it's pressed up right against the wall. She'd have to ram her body sideways. She didn't even have any visible cuts. She told me she was sorry, and that she would try not to do it again. I believed her, and she was true to her word. But soon enough, I hear the crashing again. But this time it's my door. The majority of my glass door has been smashed through, but the weird thing is that the hole is shaped like Quasimodo. No one lives here that has a body shaped like that. The other times I checked her she didn't have any cuts on her, but this time she was bleeding so much from every part of her body that she had to go to the hospital. I had to sit there and watch her, but she couldn't explain what had happened. When the doctor asked, neither could I, because I hadn't been there. It's strange how selective she is; she won't smash into anything except mirrors or glass-looking things. Anywhere there isn't this kind of stuff, nothing bad happens. She tells me that she feels so cold whenever she walks by something like that, and she gets an uncontrollable urge to destroy it. She talks to me about it so often I feel like I'm beginning to share the feeling.

It's starting to unnerve me, and I don't want to live with her anymore. But I can't break the joint liability contract. She told me to cover all the things in the house that could possibly create a reflection, so I did. But I find her desperately tearing off the covers when she thinks I'm not looking.

One day I'd had enough so I decided to take off one of the covers in my room. It couldn't hurt, just for a little while when she couldn't see. She wouldn't notice. But after a minute of reveling in my refreshed reflection, I saw her standing there. So close. She was so ugly. She copied my expression and mocked my horrified face. She followed me here, to my own room. I couldn't turn around. There was no point. I felt a pressure from her on my shoulders so great I couldn't keep a straight posture. She was laughing at me.

But I'd heard that laugh somewhere before. And I'd seen that face before too. It looked so much like my own. She must have heard my thoughts, because she said she told me to never look at her by means of a reflection. I couldn't stand the sight of her face anymore, it was so scary. It'd been such a long time since I'd spent so many minutes just staring at her. I had to take control. So I bashed the bedroom mirror in, balling my bare hands into fists and repeatedly thrashing until I could feel the glass cutting into my skin.

It'd been so long since I'd last done that. Now every time I look, I can see her, feel her, I see her staring at her...our...reflection, through my eyes.",My Blank Mirror,7,nosleep
SeaDweller7,2,,2,1rhilw,,4,"I go to a regular school, its kindergarten to year twelve, so its pretty big. But, my school is an old public school, and the principle is ancient. Me? I am in year twelve, and I’m graduating next year, and my friends said I should share this story with you guys. 

Ok, where to start? Well, at my school we have a pretty serious problem with bullies, and when I say serious I mean it. One year our school was even on the news, but it was pretty traumatic. When I was in year nine, there was this little girl in fifth grade, called Melody. Her and me sort of talked sometimes, as she was a new girl and I was her school buddy (to show her around and stuff) She was a sort of short, curly brown haired, blue eyed and geeky girl. Glasses and all of that stuff, so your stereotypical nerd. Which pretty much was what she was.

After I moved up in to Tenth grade it was pretty clear that she was being bullied. Instead of gossiping or playing with the other girls, she just sort of walked around the school... bouncing a tennis ball and wandering around the grounds of the school. 

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

Then, half way through the year, school was stopped. During lunch they lined us up and called our parents. Sent us home. They just said there was an accident. My mother and father lived in Melbourne and I lived with my uncle and aunty, and they’re pretty laid back and all ‘come home when you feel’ so I stayed at school.

I saw five year six girls with that sort of ‘we know nothing it wasn’t us we didn’t do anything’ look on their face before I saw an ambulance and a white body bag. Out of the end of the body bag stuck out locks of curly brown hair, and the always-screeching birds seemed to sing a sweet tune. A melody.

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

Last week we had a substitute teacher who started screaming at a girl who was outside bouncing her ball after the end of lunch bell had rung. She didn’t realise Melody wouldn’t listen. 

No one knew why the back stairs from German were out of bounds for two months, and why the German teacher quit. No one asked why those five girls we’re stared at my Melody’s sort of... ghost.

I pieced it together. A simple push, a simple tumble. A simple death.

No one cares, all the kids just skip past her, all the laughter swallows up her silence.

It has been a little over a year since I last wrote - just over a year since the last nightmare.  I was foolish to think I was somehow cured, that, as Dr. Lough suggested, getting it out of my head and into a journal would help.

I read back over my last and only journal entry, as I tried to describe the nightmare.  It is so chaotic and scattered, yet I'm unable to find any other way to convey the details.  That is the terror of the dream at its core - utterly chaotic.  Jerking from one sensation to the next, the hesitant probing of my fingers as they cover the smooth flesh where my eyes should be, to the damp defeat in realizing those fingers have torn away the protective lids in confusion.  All of this, in layers of sleep - waking to the comfort of my mother's figure, only to then know it is just another stage of the dream playing out, with her eerie voice echoing through my body:

""You're connected now.""

Even now, in understanding that my last entry seemed to bleed out through the pages, I'm struggling to form coherent thoughts onto this paper.  Each detail seems to tie into the next, only to fall apart when I try to see the whole.  I wonder what type of clinical association Dr. Lough could make?  Is this what schizophrenia feels like?  I have no way to explain it.  It is as though there is a novelist's grand plot line swirling around my body in paper shreds and each time I reach out I can snatch only a sliver of a scene, unable to ever piece the parts into an understanding.  I'm fairly certain this entry, and perhaps any subsequent entries, will be just as erratic.  I just cannot force these thoughts together.

So much has changed in the last year, it is so hard to recall my state of mind the last time the nightmare came to me.  I have a son now, nearly 6 months old.  We must have just found out Rachel was pregnant around the time I last wrote.  Could that have been a factor in the nightmare returning after years of peace?  Was my mind so overwhelmed with the thought of being a father, the changes to my life, the responsibility, it somehow dredged that old horror back from my subconscious?  I can't help but think it must have played a role.  It has been a blur, so many other things seem to have fallen into place.  Though they are exciting, it seems predetermined, somehow rushed.

Over the last decade I have had a slight obsession with the home I grew up in.  I knew I would live there once again - returning it to ownership in my family - though I never anticipated it would happen so quickly.  Rachel's grandmother died, leaving her an inheritance that allowed us to leap forward several years in our plans together.  It was Christmas Day, the day she died - I guess her last gift to us.  Three months after my son was born, we were moving back into the mountains, back to the walls I had called home as a boy.  

One thing I feel for certain, this home is the source.  The nightmare started here, always took place here, was always fueled here.  I'm beginning to remember things, or have recurrent thoughts I have not had for nearly two decades.  It is as though these things are unlocked from muscle memory as I walk this house.

As a child I would reach the top of the second floor staircase, which opened onto a hallway, always with my head down staring at my feet.  Left, at the end of a long hallway was a guest room.  Large floor to ceiling windows would reflect back a warped view of the person looking down to them.  Right, across a short landing was my bedroom.  I had trained myself to never look left at night - as the small nightlight by my bedroom door would throw twisted shadows onto my reflection in the long guest room windows.  If I would look up, I would become stuck in fear with the reflection.  The windows seemed to pulse with my heartbeat, flexing my body larger then smaller in the glass.  My feet became rooted in place, the black of the windows and the emptiness behind them tunneling out for me.  The nightlight would flicker in then out, each time causing my shape to jump forward, as though I were being pulled down the hallway towards the darkness.  I never remembered breaking loose, turning and walking back to my bedroom and going to sleep.  I would wake up in my bed hours later, staring at my hands, inspecting for blood and knowing I just had the nightmare. 

I learned, I kept my head down and did not look to the left.

Our first night in the home, that muscle memory followed suit.  After turning off the main floor lights, I climbed the staircase.  My son was sleeping against my chest, his arms wrapped around my neck and shoulder.  My head was down as I crested the top step, turning to the right, towards my room which was now his.  As I neared the bedroom door, his forehead left my shoulder.  His back straightened and his arm peeled away from my neck.  I felt his arm extend straight back behind my head.  I didn't need to look at his eyes, I knew.  Those eyes followed his arm to his hand, reaching down the hallway to the windows.  The nightlight flickered as he let out a giggle.  I took the last step into his bedroom and shut the door.

Sunny day in Nevada. Families having lunch outside, fathers teaching their sons how to grill steak, playgrounds
filled with kids. Every year I plan a trip with my son. Nevada has really nice caves in it. When I was little,
my father always took me there and so did his father. I didn't want to break this chain. I told Jake, my son, about that
cave that I used to visit but I did not have enough time to take him there until now. He was still sleeping when
I stepped in his room.
""Honey wake up!"" Jake opened his little eyes and whispered:
""What?""

""We are going to see the cave I told you about!"" he instantly jumped out of his bed and become so excited that
I can't even tell about it. He got dressed and ran to have something to eat. About five minutes later he was screaming
from the garage door.
""Hurry up mom!""

One hour car ride. Not the longest one he ever had. He kept asking me about the place. I just smiled and told him to
be patient. As soon as I parked the car, he blasted out the door and ran to the back of the car to grab two flashlights. 
""You ready?"" I asked him. He obviously was so we started walking towards our destination.
It was dark in there. Darker than anywhere else. Flashlights on.  He just kept pushing forward. Sometimes I couldn't 
even catch up with that little kid. After a sharp left turn I saw him standing there. He found it. The biggest hall 
in the cave. Every wall was shining when the light of our flashlights reached them.
""Beautiful isn't it?""

""It is indeed!"" he answered. He turned his head towards me but it was only q light at a corner 
that he could see. He totally crapped himself. ""Mommy wait for me!"" He started running towards the light 
that he could see. It is a maze down there. - MOM! - he screamed.
""I'm here honey!"" He caught up with me. He just gasped there and started to be a bit relieved as he realized 
that he was not alone in that dark cave again.
""Hey calm down little boy! I'm not leaving you here!"" went closer to him and whispered:  ""Or am I ?

jonssijonssi,0,,0,1rilff,,2,"Hey guys, I just wanted to tell you about my dream which kind of freaked me out. I've been having a lot of bad dreams for the past 3 weeks, but i think this one tops all of them. Anyhow, I dreamt that I lived with my boyfriend in a big house, it was night and we both were sleeping. Suddely i wake up, and I sit up in our bed. I'm fully aware that I'm sleepwalking but I can't stop myself, lay down again or do anything about my actions. I start walking out in a big hallway (this is where the main door is located), then I enter a smaller, much more narrow and dark hallway, and in the end is a small wardrobe-like room which is truly pitch black. This scared me a bit since I am afraid of the dark but I just keep walking, I don't even consider NOT to walk in to the wardrobe. So I find myself inside this pitch black tiny room and I close the door and I lock it. Once I have locked the door i just panic, I'm not afraid but I simply can't stop screaming, I remember the scream so well, it was a true scream of despair, I screamed at the top of my lungs but I still was not scared. I started to bang the door, the walls, everything while screaming and crying as hard as I could. Finally my boyfriend comes to the rescue and the door was open now, he just grabs me and tells me I was sleepwalking and I just said ""I know"" in the sternest voice. He's scared out of his life and crying and I just looks at him like he's crazy and then i just go back to bed like nothing happened. 
",The sleepwalking dream,2,nosleep
ephique,0,,0,1rikrx,,4,"I grew up in a small town in Ohio with my mom, dad and big sister. We were a normal family, neither happy nor sad, somewhere in between. I was always interested in music as a kid so I spent most of my time playing piano, practicing guitar or trying my best to write my own songs. It was also some sort of medicine for me; it helped me drift away into my own world when my sister and my mom had disputes. You see, my sister was one of those rebellious teenagers at the time that had to have their own way or the rest of the world had to suffer their unfair ranting. I hated it; I hated hearing her yell at my poor mother.

During a lonesome walk home from school one day I got a call from my dad, making sure that I didn’t have any plans and telling me that I had to come home as fast as possible. My dad never called my cell phone unless he really wanted something so I knew right away something was up. I remember jogging most of the route home, since my dad sounded so serious. It gave me the creeps to say the least.

I jumped over the fence surrounding our villa and paced myself into our house. The kitchen was the first room you’d see upon entering and it was empty so I assumed they were in the living room upstairs. As I was making my way up the stairs I could hear my sister sobbing uncontrollably, something had definitely happened. My dad was standing up as my sister was sitting on the couch, he told me to sit down as well.

I was scared and curious at the same time. Dad and my sister never really spoke or had any arguments since my father didn’t bother caring too much about any of my sisters business, so I could figure out that this wasn’t about my sister. I remember sitting there in dead silence with the exception of my sister shedding tears and trying to keep her crying as quiet as possible. My dad was looking like he had no idea what to do or say, as if he didn’t know how to explain something to me.

Finally, after a long pause my dad made an introduction to whatever I thought this was about at the time. He said: “Your mother…” and then he needed to grasp some air, and he continued: “Your mother has passed away.”

I was eight years old and I couldn’t grasp that concept. I didn’t understand death, or that my mom was eternally gone. I just sat there as I was developing an irrational anger towards god-knows-what, I remember thinking how unfair this was. I do however forgive my dad for telling me so bluntly, he didn’t know what to do and he was in shock at the time.

My sister continued crying, she asked dad how mom died although it was obvious she didn’t actually care to know at that precise moment. She was just being desperate and no one could blame her. I thought it was my sisters fault when I was there, I thought that was why she was crying so much. I didn’t shed a single tear; I kept it all inside. Of course that didn’t mean this incident didn’t haunt me for years, I never stopped thinking about my mother. 

The aftermath of my mother’s death is what has been shaping my life the recent years. My sister was very weak emotionally and it basically drove her insane. My dad had to take her to an actual mental hospital. Something I didn’t even think existed when I was eight. This resulted in that I didn’t get to meet my sister very often, my dad kept telling me she was in a special school for students that wanted a challenge; but I overheard enough conversations to know where she really was. I guess my dad was trying to keep me out of it, and I didn’t blame him. 

I was guessing that my sister wasn’t doing very well at the hospital since we got to see her less and less as years went by, something that troubled me; I hated living in this big villa of ours with just my dad. It felt so dead, and my dad had been more kept to himself after mom died. We didn’t do anything, I literally spent all time at home in my room, making or playing music. Me and my dad didn’t even greet sometimes when I came home from school, it was depressing. My theory for his change in behavior has always been that he blamed himself for my mother’s death, something that I’m about to get into.

You are probably wondering how she died by now, and it’s a legit question to be asking. The best answer I could give you is that I don’t know. My dad has always told me she died of liver-failure but for some reason that has always sounded like a lie to me. It didn’t add up, my mom never had any problems with her liver before and she didn’t drink. I think it was something he made up when I was younger because he assumed I wasn’t mature enough to hear the truth. In addition to this, whenever I asked my dad about this matter he’d get heavily upset. Nowadays I never ask about my mom’s death, nor do I even bring up mom as a topic.

Years went by and I ended up being fourteen. It kept going like I just described, I spent most times in my room playing music as my dad did whatever he was doing on his own in the house. My dad did work, he had the night-time shift at a local bottle factory, I’m not joking, he actually made glass bottles for a living. He had higher ambitions but most of them got crushed when he and my mother got my sister, they had to move and dad basically had no other financial option than to quit the university he was attending at the time and get a quick and close job. You guessed it, the bottle factory.

I was riding my bike home late at night after spending the evening in the school library at one point when I was fourteen. My school was the type that had an after-school library that didn’t close till 11 pm. I didn’t need any of the books or supplies that the library offered; I just studied there sometimes since it felt less depressing than my father and our lonely villa. Either way, I hadn’t seen my sister for two years that night and I was starting to get the idea that I wouldn’t see her again for another two. 

When I arrived at the house the front door was open, “This is odd?” I thought. Upon closer examination I realized that someone had taken the spare key from its hidden spot underneath one of my mother’s old jars. It’s never smart to have a spare key hidden right next to the door, number one mistake people do when it comes to spare keys. It did look like whoever had taken it did suffer a struggle before finding it. The rug outside the door was all muffled up and there were scratches on the door, around the lock. I suspected we had been robbed so I pulled out my cell phone, ready to call the police. 

This is when I heard something coming from inside the house. I was dead scared to say the least, this could have been armed robbers or maybe something worse, I didn’t know. It sounded like someone was grinding furniture against the floor, trying to move it. It was so dark as well, I remember not seeing more than pitch black looking into the open door, technically if someone was in there they would have seen me because of the street lights. I started to slowly pace into the house, walking towards the noise. This is where I had to make a decision, was I going to suddenly turn on the lights in order to reveal whatever was in there or was I going to approach it in the dark? I picked the former. I was just going to switch the lights on when I could see someone strafe into the light coming in through the kitchen window. It was my sister, naked. My entire mindset had to change into a totally different way of dealing with the situation; it took me a good couple of seconds to assume she escaped the hospital. 

I switched on the lights in an instant. She had redecorated the entire kitchen, in the dark. Of course it all looked hideous and random; she didn’t know what the hell she was doing. I remember being in a slight discomfort, I had never seen my sister naked in my entire life. I also hadn’t seen her for a good couple of years at all. She didn’t look very comfortable either, she looked like she didn’t know who I was and was wondering what I was doing there.

I uttered “Linda?” out loud, that was her name. She didn’t respond, she just continued standing there looking at me. “Don’t you remember me, I’m your brother.” I still couldn’t get any feedback out of her; it was as if the wheel wasn’t spinning at all. I wasn’t sure what the protocol here was, not knowing the number to the mental institution or anything I figured I’d try to call dad, before I got to press the call button on my cell phone she uttered: “Don’t call dad.” This is when I realized she couldn’t be completely empty inside after all.

“You don’t want to call dad.” She continued.  I had no idea what to do, I assumed this was part of the reason she was in the mental hospital in the first place. Luckily my dad got home at that point, not coming from a finished shift at work. He had a good five hours at least left, I assumed the hospital had phoned him and told him about the situation. My father ran into the house as fast as he could.

This is when something I didn’t expect happened, he told me to leave. He pointed at the door as if I had no idea how to find my way out of my own house. I asked him where I was supposed to go, he told me to wait in his car. Judging from how serious my dad seemed I didn’t think twice about it, I ran out to the car. As I was sitting in the car I could see my sister walk past the kitchen window a couple of times, I remember how she made no effort to cover her breasts. I had no clue what the two of them were discussing, although I never saw my sister move her lips so I’m guessing my dad did most of the talking. 

After a couple of minutes my dad started to walk to the car, he joined me inside. I remember asking why he didn’t bring Linda with him, “Don’t call her that name!” he shouted in response. I was so confused at this point. Dad started the car and drove me to my only friend’s house; I didn’t see him very often though. I was a lone wolf growing up and I still was at this point, I didn’t really create any friendships. I remember sitting in the car as he ran up the steps to ring my friend’s doorbell, his mother opened in her night dress and looked confused. I assumed my dad made up some emergency story to cover what was going on in order to get me a place to stay overnight. I didn’t even know what was going on to be fair.

Whatever he told them worked, I got to spend the night at my friend’s place. Tim’s place, to be exact. It was pretty awkward I remember, I only saw Tim a couple of times a week and that was when we shared classes in Spanish. We got to be desk-mates because the teacher made up whom to sit next to each semester, so we weren’t very close. 

It was a Friday so there was no school the morning after; I guessed that made it easier for my dad, leaving him the freedom to pick me up whenever he wanted to. He did, but not before giving me enough time to fully experience the awkward breakfast conversations with Tim’s parents, both trying to justify me as Tim’s best friend. I don’t know. Tim didn’t have many friends I guess.

On the way home I asked my dad what was going on the night before and he basically stopped the car and stared at me, as if I was mocking him. I remember how desperate he looked, as if he had no fire left in his heart. He uttered the words: “Do you think I wanted any of this?” as he grabbed his hair in regret. “All I wanted was a normal family with no circumstances, and I’m not blaming you when I’m saying this because frankly you are the only sane member left in this livelihood of ours.” Is what came out of his mouth next. I tried to comfort him, telling him that he had done a good job raising me and what not; I really didn’t have a lot of cards in my deck at this point. I mean my dad was basically losing it.

When we got home he told me that he was sorry, and that I should go up to my room. I did go up to my room but I got to tell you; I was starting to get very anxious about my dad. I really wanted to know what the hell was going on. I spent that night recording some guitar sessions for a song and reading books while listening to some ambient records I had found online, I couldn’t sleep so pulling an all-nighter was my only real option. I was reading “A Brief History of Time” for a science project in school, I was somewhere in the middle section of the book and started to get dry eyes. I figured I’d go downstairs into the kitchen to get myself something to drink when I got shocked upon opening the door to the hallway. I saw my mother standing just outside, looking right at me for a fraction of a second. Had all this hassle from the last couple of days driven me insane? It freaked me out so much that I ended up never getting a drink. 

The image of my mother outside my door haunted me that entire night, I kept thinking about it as I couldn’t sleep. She looked deranged, scared and raw. The shortage of light sources in the hallway made her look like she was from a black and white 50’s movie. I kept begging for the sun to rise up, I even did that thing when you close your eyes and try not to open them because you never know what you’ll see. I might have been fourteen, but I can openly admit that I was dead scared.

It finally came to be morning and I ran downstairs, still not fully opening my eyes while passing the hallway. I remember greeting my dad who was sitting in the kitchen drinking orange juice. I was just about to pour myself a glass when he said: “I think I need help.” While holding the glass of juice as if he wasn’t sure he was going to drink the rest of it. I asked him what he meant and he said that he wasn’t sure, that he had felt very uncomfortable and unstable lately. He also mentioned that he was thinking of joining some people from his work in playing golf, he thought that could give him some relief. I told him that sounded like a pretty good idea, jokingly adding that it’s better than hanging around the house doing nothing. He looked offended when I said that, something I didn’t really understand since he obviously worked all night, so that would justify him sleeping through the days.

I understand that some of you reading this are wondering how the hell I could have been fourteen and still not know how my mother died. Well, it’s hard to explain how uncomfortable of a character my dad was at times, and it felt a bit like I was offending him whenever I had to ask because part of me did actually believe she died of liver-failure. I mean it was possible. Imagine if it was true, and I kept asking my dad as if he lied to me. That’s the type of thoughts I had in my head about the whole thing.

Having that explanation out of the way, I did summon the courage to confront my dad one last time. It was a couple of days after the conversation about my dad picking up golf; I just walked into his room unexpected. A part of me had wanted to do this for a long time because I really never knew what he did in his room; it looked similar to an office which is nothing he’d ever need since he was a labor worker in a bottle factory. He was actually sitting at his desk. Not only that, but the desk was flooded with paper-work of some sort, maybe he had picked up an accounting job for the factory during the day, something he could manage from home. I didn’t ask; I had a big enough question for him as it were.

I dragged out a small chair he had behind the door and figured I’d sit on it. It was somewhat squeaky and not very comfortable, better than standing up anyway. Then I leaned forward and I was just about to ask when he interrupted my train of thought by saying: “You want to know about your sister, and what happened the other night. Don’t you?” This is where I started to play along because he was already looking emotionally hurt, bringing up mom here would have been a car-crash. I told him that I was indeed there to ask about my sister. He took a good pause before he bluntly exclaimed it to me: “Your sister is not right in the head; she’s in a mental hospital.” I couldn’t believe he hadn’t figured out that I would have known this by then. Not wanting to make a scene I just pretended like I didn’t know. He explained the context, telling me that she couldn’t take our mother’s death. A tear started climbing down his cheeks, and then he asked me if there was anything else I wanted to talk about. There was no way I could bring up something as sensitive as my mother at this point so I told him that everything was fine, and then I left the room.

I realized on my way up to my room that my dad was fragile and very close to losing his mind in this problematic family business. I had no idea how I’d ever get the truth about my mother out of him. When I finally had landed on my bed in my room again, the image of my mom started crawling back to me. The grey scaled portrait of her in the hallway, was my mind playing tricks on me? I also had a slight feeling that I remembered it from somewhere. I mean it was my mom but that exact stare and look she had, not only did it frighten me but I swore I had seen it before. 

Night landed again, I hadn’t spoken to my father again that day. I was facing the same obstacle that I had the other night, I was too afraid to go downstairs because I thought I’d see my mother again. We all know you can imagine things in the dark, kids do it all the time. It’s as if your mind fills in the gaps, but that incident the other night was different. I got more scared the more I thought of it and figured that I’d open the door to the darn hallway, and turn on the lights in order to feel slightly safer. I’m not going to lie, I did open that door very slowly but as it turned out; there was no sign of my mother. I turned on the lights and went back into my room.

Still not wanting to go to bed, not only because it was spring break at this point but also because I was a bit scared I figured I’d listen through some of my older songs. I had loads of them; most of which weren’t very good however. I was still learning how to create music and I never really thought of myself as particularly good, especially not at writing my own songs. I guess I was decent at playing other people’s songs. I basically went through my songs in chronological order, it was interesting because was able to hear how much I had improved over the years. 
It took me a good three hours to get past most of my songs, and I was reaching the more recent creations of mine. I heard something in one of the songs that I never had paid any attention to before; it was a slight breeze of white noise in the middle of one of my guitar riffs. Knowing that this wasn’t an overworked track yet, it was made just days ago and I hadn’t gotten around to mastering it yet, I figured I wasn’t going to give it more of a thought. That was until the neurons fired, that track was made the day I couldn’t sleep, the day I saw my mother in the hallway. Being a bit gullible I figured that I’d give it a go using my acoustic headphones. I tried everything. I played the song backwards; I cut out bass, middle frequencies, high frequencies and even listened to individual recordings of the instruments and samples. I couldn’t hear anything suspicious, just that white noise. 

I was a bit disappointed, at the same time relieved. Although that white noise shouldn’t have been there, nothing in my room could have made a noise like that. I didn’t want to over-think the situation, so I ended up hitting the bed. Later that night, as I still had problems sleeping I was laying in bed listening to the same ambient soundtracks that I was using nights before, slowly dozing off to sleep. I hadn’t been asleep for much more than ten minutes when I started to ascend into that state of sleep when you’re in a dream at the same time as real life is somewhat happening to you. I could hear a thumping sound coming from somewhere. Before I knew it I got woken up by a loud bass noise, it sounded like some kind of a technical disorder. I continued lying in bed, trying to figure out if I just dreamt about the noise or if it actually occurred, this is when I heard a much dampened sound coming from the other side of my room. It sounded a lot like someone was trying to get some kind of sound device to work. It got quieter and quieter and when I thought it was about to disappear I could hear a voice; very distorted and unstable speaking in what I believe was Russian. 

It took me a couple of minutes but I finally realized what I thought the sound was coming from, I had left my old amplifier on from when I was playing guitar. I bounced out of bed in order to turn on the lights. I was overlooking the entire room as I hit the switch, for the blink of an eye, just next to the amplifier I saw my mom again; just as the light went on. The same stare, same face, still that black and white filtered look from before. I got so shocked I fell down on the floor, the noise coming from the amplifier stopped in the same instant. I wasn’t sure what to make of this, and I definitely didn’t want to tell my father about what I had seen, knowing he has already thrown one of his kin to a mental hospital. 

I had a lot of sleep to catch up on but unfortunately this wouldn’t let me sleep, I just couldn’t sleep at all. I never believed in ghosts or anything growing up, these two small incidents with my mom being my only experience in what could be categorized into the matter. I thought and assumed I was becoming what my sister had become. Whatever this all meant, and needless to say; I didn’t get any sleep that night either.

I met my father in the kitchen the next day, he was looking a lot better than the last time I had seen him. He kept going on and on about how much he was looking forward to playing golf with his work-crew later that afternoon. I was happy for him; he deserved some time out of the stress. After the conversation about an afternoon of longing for a spot in the shade and waiting for your turn on a grass field he added: “Have you been thinking of your mother lately?” As if he could read my mind. I told him that I was always missing my mother, and that I had indeed thought of her a lot lately. He stated that he thought I had. I had no clue why.  Short after that he left for playing golf.

I kept thinking of why my amplifier was acting up that night, I started recalling a clear memory of turning it off after I was done playing. In fact, I knew I did since the amplifier was connected to an electricity hub that I used to turn off a small lamp I had next to my bed, how could it have been on? I had no idea. 

Since my dad was out of the building I figured I could use this afternoon without his presence to get some answers. I stepped into his room to investigate what he had been doing sitting at that desk of his all those hours. I grabbed a bunch of paperwork and sat myself on the double bed next to his desk, it got me a slight reminder on how he hadn’t gotten rid of the bed he shared with my mother yet. The first paper I started examining looked like a letter of some sort, as if it was a letter inside a legal template of some company. I don’t know how I’d describe it better than that. After further examination I found out it was a letter from my sister sent to our address, I remember wondering why dad wouldn’t show me something like this: 

“Daddy, why didn’t you visit me last weekend. I thought you were coming back, I was waiting for you. I’m sorry if I made a scene, I thought something had happened to you! I ran to you because I wanted answers, no one has answers here. I’ve been getting visits lately, why can’t you come to me at the same time?”

I fixed some grammar and a whole lot of spelling errors for the sake of explaining this to you, my sister had the linguistic abilities of a five year-old in this state. On after-thought I guessed my dad didn’t tell me about letters from my sister since they would inevitably prove that she wasn’t in a special school for people who were after tougher challenges. Although thinking about it, that doesn’t sound ridiculously different than a mental hospital.

The rest of the papers seemed to be a real mixture of work-related things and records of local police-investigations. Why would my father be looking into cases of murder, pedophilia, rape and almost anything you can think of? It wasn’t really my business what he did with his spare time but this was just outright messed up. I knew he had a friend in the police force, that was either the reason he had these or just the tool he used to get them. I didn’t even want to know at the time, I had enough stuff on my mind already and I hadn’t slept in far too long.
I apologize to whoever reading this if it seems that I’m dragging it out with details a bit too much here and there, I’m only taking precautions to make sure that I’m telling it right. If I’m finally going to tell my story I want it to sound right. 

My father never came home after golfing so I assumed he went directly to work, which made complete sense. It was starting to get late into the evening and I had absolutely nothing better to do than to once again sit in my room, I was trying to figure out ideas for new songs on my guitar. This time I wasn’t using the amplifier since I was legitimately scared of the noises occurring again. My amplifier has been known to pick up foreign radio broadcasts before, something that explains the distorted Russian speech last time, I wasn’t worrying about that. I was thinking about my mother showing herself again. Not that I was sure that it had anything to do with the amplifier itself.

Not too long into that night I started feeling sick of being in-doors for so long, and I felt like I could use some kind of fresh air as a vacation from all this unexplained mystery I had been experiencing. I remember being on the sane side of the fence, thinking critically and trying to find solutions, not marking everything as if it was a conspiracy from hell. I figured I’d take my bike down to a local gas station, not more than ten minutes from my house; I wanted some chips, candy and maybe a couple cans of soda. 

I scrambled together some change I found in my room and took off; I got there faster than I thought I would. It wasn’t cold outside either; it was a pretty smooth night. After grabbing some generic brand of chips, Skittles and a couple cans of coke I paid for it and left. I didn’t spend much time in the store, but apparently enough time to get my bike stolen. With no bike, feeling like a stupid idiot for not locking it I had to walk home. 

Something out of the ordinary happened after this, and I wasn’t even sure if I was seeing things at first. I was walking on this huge open road; I guess you could say it was somewhat of a country road. It was tied together with the forest behind our house. It was the type of road that didn’t have any traffic other than truck drivers, passing once every couple of hours at night. I didn’t want to believe my eyes at this point but I saw my sister standing alone wearing what you’d imagine someone coming from a mental hospital would wear. I assumed she was looking for me; she was definitely staring at me. 

I continued walking, not necessarily fearing my sister. It somehow still felt as if I had a bond with her, that she would never have done anything to hurt me. As I approached her she didn’t give me any response what so ever, she was just staring at me in a light-blue scrub-coat, looking lifeless. I had reached talking-distance; I couldn’t believe this was happening. It felt surreal, like one of those scenarios you can’t be prepared for in real life. She had started to shake a bit, I couldn’t tell if she was freezing or if she was nervous. I asked her if she was looking for me out there, and if she had escaped the hospital. She didn’t respond. I got the notion that she was slightly scared of me, as if I was a threat to her. 

After a short gap of silence I noticed that she was holding something behind her back. I got a bit worried that she had some kind of a weapon, or a blunt object to swing at me so I stepped back when I spotted it. She started to slowly bring it forth, it was a plastic bag. From the way she was holding it I could tell it wasn’t heavy, or dangerous for that matter. I withdrew the step back I took earlier and tried to peer down into the bag, then she started to stretch it out to me: “I took this from your house the other day, I’m sorry. I think this belongs to you. Jonathan.” 

I do realize that I never told you my name, it is indeed Jonathan. I was slightly astonished that she had remembered my name even; she seemed to be so out of it. I remember grabbing the plastic bag, she wouldn’t let go of it too lightly either, it was as if she still wanted it. After I had gotten whatever was in the bag we shared another brief moment of silence, she wouldn’t stop staring into my eyes during these. Then she told me to never mention any of this to our dad. Shortly after she started walking towards the forest; as if she knew where she was heading. 

I saw the headlights of a car coming straight at me and my sister, whoever was in this car was driving way ahead of the speed limit. I noticed when it started to get closer to us that it was my dad’s car, acting on impulse I threw myself into a nearby ditch, as I got to witness my dad chasing after my sister. I didn’t even know if I wanted him to catch her or not, she was purposely running away from him. He dragged her into his car and they both drove away, heading the direction he was originally going. This was the second time she had successfully escaped this mental hospital, and how the hell did my sister make it so far both times? Something wasn’t right, I knew from when I was younger that the hospital wasn’t anywhere close to where we lived since my dad sometimes was gone for ten hours upon visiting her. Of course at the time it was supposedly a special school, but that doesn’t change the logic of it. He never brought me with him whenever he visited my sister, since he kept me in the dark about the whole hospital thing.

I ran the rest of the way home, trying not to drop anything; I still had all the items I bought at the gas station. I wanted to make sure that I could get home before my dad did; I had no clue whenever he would get back, and not wanting him to find out whatever was in the bag my sister gave me. I couldn’t spot my dad’s car in the driveway so I felt relieved as I stepped into the house. I didn’t bother putting my drinks in the fridge or anything, I made my way back to my room as fast as I could. I don’t really know why but I locked the door after me, as if there was something to fear. I sat myself on the bed with all the lights in the entire room switched on. I made sure to put all the bags with snacks in them aside; as I was getting ready to dig into whatever my sister ran into the night to give me. 

I never really thought of something until now, and that is how my sister could have found me. It must have been a coincidence, or she had been following me for a while; knowing she couldn’t approach me in the store. I don’t know.

I looked into the bag, it seemed to be random belongings from the drawers in our living room, and maybe some stuff from one of the cupboards we had in the kitchen. After sorting out stuff that had no relevance what so ever, for example there was a roll of tape in there. I planned to spend more time on the more interesting items. The first thing I picked up was a small collection of family photos, most being after mom died. The next thing I could grab was a couple of rocks; they weren’t even dry, I guessed she must have gotten those just before she passed me the bag. There was only one thing left in the bag, an usb-stick. 

I took the stick out and threw away the bag. Then I started looking at the photos as I was trying to reason why she would have taken any of these from our house. The only thing that somewhat made sense is that a couple of them were from when she wasn’t sent to the hospital yet, but it was pretty much pending already. In fact, most of these photos took place a couple of weeks after our mother passed away. On one of them it’s my sister showing off her prom dress she was planning on wearing, she actually wasn’t acting too badly the first couple of weeks. I guess she didn’t process our mother’s death until later or something. Another photo is of dad’s old car, he had to sell it in order to compensate for our family’s financial depression from when we lost the main income our family had, my mother’s candle business. He loved that damn car with his entire heart; we even used to joke about how mom was jealous of the car. 

There were more photos but I stopped going through them when I realized a couple of them had a handwritten marking of the letter “x” behind them. It noticed this when I was flipping them as I was trying to get them all to be facing me. I sorted the photos with no marking away and started to focus more on the ones with the marking. I figured my sister must have had done this, for what reason I was about to find out. I kept staring at the first picture; it was the one I told you about earlier, the one of my father’s old car. It was a Pontiac from the early 80’s and it must have cost him a fortune. I never had any particular memories of the car; I remember it spending most of its time in our garage.

I kept looking at the photograph and the more I stared at it the more I started to wonder why my dad hadn’t use the car more, he obviously loved it. The photo was taken for an ad in the newspaper, for selling it of course. I was just about to put the sad photo away when I caught a glimpse of my mother sitting in the backseat. It wasn’t very clear and she seemed somewhat transparent. She had the same drained-out appearance and blank stare that she had from when I saw her in the hallway outside my room, and this was taken after her death. I couldn’t believe what I was looking at. I remember dropping the photo out of shock; so many thoughts started circling inside of my head.

dinofinger,0,,1,1rie11,,1,"    17^th May 2007.
I followed my dad went to Grandma's house. My cousin who lives with grandma, had a suspicion that something had happen to Aunt L &gt; *Her initial would be appropriate here* &lt; Aunt L was never in her sound mind but she prefer to live alone which is the best option avoiding the troubles she would cause to others. Grandma has a problem of [nagging](https://www.google.com/search?q=nagging&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a) disease which makes more Aunt L better suit live far from her lectures. 

Back again to my cousin, who received a call from Aunt L's neighbour. Her respond was *there was a sudden silent for the past four days*. Aunt L was never a social person who goes anywhere she wants and always out. She prefered to live in her tiny apartment secluded only her herself and herself she enjoys being with. But her neighbour help us to watch for her just in case for anything. So we respond to go and visit her house. My father, my cousin and I, the three of us went together with nothing held us back. 

As we arrive by the door, we knock and knock. From the window we can see noise screen from her small tv at the corner. But there was no sign of her. Somehow her grill lock and the door were changed, the key my cousin brought didn't fit at all. Maybe she doesn't want us to barge in anytime we want. My dad took the liberty to call the locksmith while giving positive thoughts to my cousin that everything was fine. 

30 minutes pass. The locksmith do his magic and opened the door. Such stench came out in full loaded right to our faces. Right in front of the door we can see Aunt L laid still in the toilet facing the floor. A 15 year old me shocked and I just watched her body in strip condition only a towel covered her other half and her faeces was right below her and all over behind her. Yet she is still alive, blinking and gasping.

My dad pull me back allowing my cousin to go in. I can still feel my father clenches my arms so tightly when he saw his sister. He said ""*[I better call the ambulance](http://www.wikihow.com/Call-an-Ambulance)*"", so he did and left. My cousin call me out to help pick her up. But she was too heavy, we can't even push her to the side. So my cousin rinse her with water to clean her off. I was told to took a towel and wipe her face. I could say her face was in a total blankness. 

25 minutes later the ambulance arrive. They took her with a stretcher. Both of us went down to send her off. I can remember certain vision of some neighbours pry on their window looking out what was happening. My dad went together with Aunt L, so left me and my cousin. Soon my mom and sister arrive bringing cleaning equipment. We spent whole 3 hours cleaning her house. Based on what I heard my cousin said ""*The man who always deliver her food got no respond from her for three days. That's when he ask the neighbour if she had gone somewhere. I bet if we were too late, she might have gone by any minute unconscious on the floor*""


    18^th May, 2013
We had her funeral in the day after the day we thought she would died 6 years ago. Funny the coincidence of the date just *one day after* we laughed. My cousin gave a speech said she was a fighter. Indeed she was. I think her life is better after that 17^th May living in the retirement home. She was more happier than before she was a shut-in.

As I was doing this, the big rocking chair next to his litter box was swaying, and I gave him a quick glance. I felt him sniff at my ear. He then jumped off the chair and walked into the kitchen. I thought nothing of it for a few seconds, then froze. ""Oliver!"", I called. I then walked to the door and looked outside, he was napping on the steps.

echoes007,4,,2,1rhee9,,2,"I’ve always been a non-religious person. I was brought up by parents who told me to question everything. To not believe the crap that is forced down our throats daily. But I’ve always felt a whole in my life when it came to that stuff. I went as far as trying LSD and DMT to achieve this “religious experience” we all want, but I never got it. So, after a while, I just gave up and moved on and accepted there is no God, or spiritual experience, or anything that’s real, that will make me see life in a whole new perspective. Naturally, this got me down and depressed a bit. It was then when I started seeing 11:11 everywhere. It started one night when I was doing some heavy drinking and decided to do some coke lines. I remember vividly, my heart stopped, and I remember a sound, like a blender going off in my head. When I forced myself to snap out of what had happened to me, I remember the first thing I looked at was the clock on the cable box. It read 11:11. This stuck with me for a long long time. I felt like some force or spirit was forcing me to look at the clock when it was 11:11 in the morning and 11:11 at night. As if reminding me that it saved my life. This was going on for a while, when I went as far as Googling what it was. Unfortunately, the 11:11 thing was associated to some spiritual stuff, things I thought were bullshit to begin with. But still, 11:11 was always there. Slowly I stopped thinking about it, and my 11:11 experiences were less and less. It wasn’t until last week when I was driving home (I was butt sober) from an event when it started raining. My tires and brakes were messed up and I didn’t get a chance to change them, and besides, it hardly ever rains in this town, so this came as a surprise to me. As I was driving up a hill, I lost control of my car completely on the wet road, and was literally fighting my steering wheel and slamming on my brakes to stop the car, but I couldn’t. This went on for about five seconds until I finally stopped the car in the middle of the road. Again, when I snapped out of my panic mode, the first thing I looked at was the time, and it said 11:11. I’m not one who believes in coincidences, but this has me thinking I have some angel or spiritual entity looking after me. Even though I don’t believe this stuff, there is NO way that could happen. Has anyone else experienced 11:11, or has randomly been “forced” to look at a clock when it’s 11:11? Or is it my brain playing tricks on me because of the LSD/DMT I took? ",11:11,4,nosleep
Jerbsybear,0,,0,1rh5g6,,2,"There are tales of a man committed to Central State

Who killed his wife and children while he asphyxiates

His doctors with the bloody spinal cord

Of his fat nurse, who cares if she was old

When the guards rushed in, it was no problem at all

bashing their brutish faces straight into the wall

Bursting through the heavy front doors

He killed everyone on the first floor

No one would stop him, no, not this time

5 years of waiting, no stopping on a dime

He had to get out on this night

To meet his lover, one at first sight

Taking his science class, year after year

Convinced that she loved him, held him dear

Called her ""favorite student"" and all

Had her parents give him a call

To invite him to dinner, on a cold winter's night

Slaughtered her family, their faces were a sight

In the judge's court, he mercilessly pleaded insanity

When, in reality, it was egotistical vanity

If he couldn't have her, no one can

To kill her new parents was the plan

Standing outside of the house that was soon to be theirs,

Looking to seek justice, to seek what's fair

So as he broke in and brandished the knife

She knew he was back to take a life

So quickly she fled into the night

Leaving behind more victims, as she took flight

She ran two miles straight to the highway

Waving for anyone to stop, to go her way

As hand grabbed her from behind the bushes

His knife drives deeper and deeper as it pushes

Past her vitals and deep into her heart

All flashbacks of her life seemed to fall apart

As he whispers ""This...feels so right""

Her mind tries to escape into the night

The fires of his greed are not yet doused

As he tries to get back to the house

He plans to take another life

While sharpening his serrated knife

""Am I next, is he coming,"" you cry with fear

InsanityInABottle,0,,1,1rgw03,,2,"“Extra, Extra! The Piggy killer is at it again!” Yelled the paperboy, holding a darkened paper above his head, screaming the same phrase over again, as if it was no big deal. I walked towards him and asked him “How much?”
“Only ten cents sir.”
“Ha. Must be a pretty good story then.” I said, as I fumbled for a large dime. I handed it into the boy’s hand, it’s gleam bouncing the light of the sun, veiled through the mist of rain into my eyes. I blinked quickly and grabbed the paper, quickly turning from the boy, hearing “How about a tip sir?”
“How about you wipe your ass with the metal I’ve already given you.” I said back to the boy, who furrowed his brow and continued screaming for new customers. As I walked along Hero’s Avenue, I kept the paper open, reading it over again. In large font, shouted “Piggy killer’s new victim!” with a picture of a woman, apparently known by the name of “Jessica Turrow.” She wore a large smile on her face, as she raised a glass of champagne above her head for a toast, I presumed.
	The article read “The psychopath, depicted as a man with a pig’s head on worn over his own face, has struck again. Witnesses described him as large, while wearing a reddened trench coat, then finally, a bib, which read the term KISS THE COOK, slathered neatly against his chest in gore. He had organs and even a human spinal cord attached to his coat and as usual, was found was mist was floating through the air and at dawn. We had identified the victim, through a ring found on the hand of the woman, who had been chopped to pieces and nailed against the side of the church. If you are to spot anyone fitting under the description, contact the police immediately, or you may be his next victim.”
	I laughed as I watched terror shrouding the faces of everybody who grasped a paper in their hands, all walking along the street as automobiles drove recklessly between one another, threading the needle on the two way street, not large enough for two cars to fit on.
	I walked towards the police station, which was cleverly located across the street from a coffee shop, a brothel and a printing office. A police car drove by; it’s loud horn sounding, flashing red and white, reflecting the light from the rain directly into my eyes. I walked into the station, the smell of fresh cigars flooding into my nose. A man screamed from across a large waiting room, looking down at the paper, then looked up and said “Oh. It’s the wonderful Flynn. Of course my dear, come, come.” I walked past him, glaring at his smug face, and then opening the door into my office.
	A man sitting on a chair for those waiting to enter my office abruptly greeted me. He smiled and said, “Well hello sir, I am Dean Osterrietch and believe I have a lead on the notorious killer”
“The pig one?”
“Y- wait, there are more?”
“I believe there are, just they might not like attention as much as our friend here.”
“Well… thanks for informing me of that rather morbid concept, but I have gotten hundreds of pictures of the killer, coming out of his lair.”
	The man pulled out a large portfolio of pictures and dumped them onto my desk, arranging them appropriately. “So, if you look at these pictures, it was for when he first got into the business, holding small weapons, all identifiable, all related to the cutting of meat. Then as you look to the left, these are the later pictures, which are of him coming out, holding bodies on his shoulders, sitting in the back of his eatery and chopping them up, putting them into boxes and looking pleased with himself, all the while in his pig mask. But, he seems to be getting careless. He cam outside, barely slipping on his mask in time for my camera to flash a photo, his face seemed veiled in… something. Something sticky, something gruesome. But if you look closer, you can quite easily see the silhouette of his face. Large, hooked nose, eyes, clouded in blue, teeth, sharpened to perfection and a dripping mouth.”
“Ha. So you’re basically implying that you’ve seen a notorious killer walk in and out of a location multiple times and not even dared to act on it? I beginning to suspect you’re the killer!”
“But that would be silly. Why would a crazy give himself away?”
“I don’t know, why don’t you tell me?”
“I believe this conversation is getting a bit heated. I saw the ad in the paper that I should contact the police and thought I’d tell you where I’ve seen such events. Have you ever seen the abandoned butchery on 1800 Bellcove Street? Well there’s your place. Sir!” said the man as he gathered his pictures and threw them into his bag, which smelled of defecation and nickels. I watched as he slammed the door, then sighed and sat down on my desk, rapidly pressing the keys of my typewriter, updating the information I’ve received from the man.
“Mysterious man visits police station, says he has a lead on the piggy killer. As you all know, the notorious killer has crossed the line now. Enough to even be called a serial killer! What a sick bastard he is.” I continued being as pessimistic as possible, updating the paper, then grabbing my camera as I finished the article. Typing in my name, finishing with my name, saying “Written by: Flynn Covetail.”
	Darkness was beginning to shroud the air, perfect night for the killer to strike in his typical environment. Light rain was spattering against my window, racing down to the bottom of the screening, only to fall against an umbrella below. As I left my office, throwing on my coat, I screamed to the man in the front desk, “Going out to…oh, let’s see...1800 Bellcove Street? If I don’t come back, Phone someone.” I said with a laugh, while walking outside.
	Instantly my boots splashed against the small walkway paved on “Western Lagoon highway” as the frivolously worthless people would say. I walked down towards the street, which was naught but four blocks from here. I passed by Dontell’s Donuts, Redgar’s Rotisserie and Salam’s Spices, all involved in the fattening of desperate cops, as only fattening diners were located near the station, so I developed a theory that every restaurant owner is against us.
	I reached the butcher’s place, which had been looted to hell by the anarchists, who were just a group of thugs that didn’t do shit to overthrow the government. The door had been pried off it’s hinges, yet now it was replaced by a veil of chains, hanging off of rusted hooks attached to the doorframe. Within the butchery, the first thing I noticed was a bed, a homeless man sleeping on it.
	I simply ignored the bum and walked around, searching for anything considered suspicious. I walked through the door, smelling the bum’s shit in the corner and closing my nostrils as well as I could. I looked through the shop, behind the counter I found several rusted knifes, which were corroded to the counter, which was a wooden rotten thing, with three cutting boards lining it, all of which nobody needed. The front of the shop seemed completely normal, but I listened to the bum waking, instantly screaming, “Who’s there! I will kill you if you’re trespassing on my property!” I laughed and screamed to him “I suggest you run out of here, or I may just have to turn you in as a key suspect for the crimes.” I heard the scuffing of his shoes against the floor, running towards me.
	I quickly turned, backing up against the wall, my sidearm pointed at the bum and screamed “GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!” I shot to the side of the man, who quickly bolted for the door, a rat following closely behind him. I sat for a minute, catching my breath, while my vocal chords seemed to scratch against one another in a uncomfortable clunky fashion. As I stood, I felt the hard callused flesh of an arm pressing against the front of my throat and the sudden feeling of something hard hitting the back of my head.








	Ha. Damn fool didn’t even know what he had coming. Shouldn’t have fucked with my grandpa… shouldn’t have yelled. My ears hurt. Are they ringing? Why the FUCK am I here? I thought a conversation to myself as I raised the man into the air, the familiar heaviness of my mask pressing against my face, the pig’s blood leaking down my neck, warming me, keeping the cold away. I looked at my setup, which was simply the back room of a butcher’s shop, a heavy steel door muffling sounds on both sides of the fifty wood wide hallway of a room.
	Blood dripped into wooden bowls I’d gotten from the shop, the bodies of fresh meat hanging from the ceiling. Pigs, cows, chickens, even a few deer, but the most stubborn of prey, the pigs. The sticky cunts hung from the ceiling, their wrists cut, their feet missing, their hands stuffed into their fucking loud mouths. The damned pigs that walked the streets, reading their stories about who? About me! The beautiful man, who is dealing righteousness to the crazies, to the rich. Though they think that they’re so safe in their leather homes, they should be the ones making chairs; their dried hides need to be a part of furniture!
	Oh, what an inventor I will be! But the best part is, nobody looks twice at the photographer. Nobody looks at who’s behind the camera; they only care about the picture! And I am finally the one in the picture! Flynn, the little anus that believed he owned the whole world, because the police were backing him up. NO, NO, NO! YOU ARE MY FUCKING BITCH!
	I whistled a tune of sorrow and greed that humans so openly express. I raise him in the air, catch a hook to his leg and strip him down to his bare neck. This self-conceited asshole needs one thing. A hook curving through the cheek, wrenched from his cheek. He thought I was the killer? NO! THAT IS NOT THE FUCKING WORD!
	Oh! My friend is waking up! Finally a new toy to play with. Oh, what a joy he will be! Oh no! What will I say to him? I guess I’ll just wing it. I guess I’ll just talk to him.  Where will I display this beauty? Ooh! The police station! Mmm, how delectable would that be? To show the pigs that even their weapons can’t defend them from me. THEY ARE GOING TO LOVE ME! I am a hero. I love being a hero and don’t try to talk me out of my heroism! I AM AMAING!








	My eyes slowly opened, to find a man in a pig mask, the rotting dreaded animal seemed to have a grin on it’s face. I was hanging upside down and fuck my leg hurts! Why does my leg hurt? Where the hell am I? “Oh… you’ve awakened!” spouted the pig; it’s squeaky voice ringing through my ears. I screamed, “Help me! Help! HE’S GOING TO KILL ME!” 
“Now that’s not how you treat a guest, is it?”
“Fuck you.”
“Oh… language, language my dear friend. If you even try saying something like that, I will cut off your cock and feed it to my friend Mr.Squeaks over here!”
	I looked to where he was pointing, which was a large column in the room, a decomposing rat nailed to the pole. “Somebody is going to catch you. They know where I am!”
“Oh, I believe they do, if only your little desk friend was there to hear what you had to say!” said the phsyco with a smile. He pointed at the ceiling, which had two hooks on it, chains hanging from them and a headless man, blood dripping in a steady stream of thickness, into a wooden bowl. “Why are you doing this to these people?”
“Okay, okay, story time. Oh yay, stories! FUCK OFF GREG, THIS IS MY TIME TO SHINE!”
	I looked at the pig with doubt, pain shooting up my leg, throbbing slowly into my brain. “SO, let me tell you why I love my job, okay? Okay. So, when I was twelve, I thought, I’m going to take pictures of weddings! I’m going to take pictures of people in love, because everyone else’s happiness, is mine.” He said this, while pinning his right hand against his heart, which contained an extra few layers of flesh, sewed against his own, along with a tattoo, stolen from his victim.
	“Okay, so anyways! What do ya know! I’m doing that now! I am a photographer! I love people being happy. SO, I one day, was at this one glorious wedding, full of lovely people. I had started talking to a woman and a little, oh what is it called? Fetish of mine was developed. As we were in bed, I took out my camera and took shots of my experience and little did I know, I have a few other… kinks. I wrung my hands around her delicate throat, stuck my finger down her throat and felt the vomit shoot from her mouth! I felt the rush as eventually, she started to fuckin’ bleed! WHAT A WHORE! She began to cough up blood, she began to wheeze and it is as these coughs echoed from her throat, landing inside of my mouth as our lips touched, did I realize how wonderful blood tastes. Rich, creamy, delicious, blood, coursing from the fountains of our decapitated stumps. I invented ways of sucking people dry, licking them dry! Well, at first I was only an amateur, but, as I got better! Oh BOY did I start to love my job! Every wedding became a slaughter, every wedding gave me a new friend, because after all, nobody cares about who’s behind the camera! NOBODY GIVES TWO FUCKING SHITS!
	So, pretty boy, I believe it’s time; you… started looking into my eyes, whenever I snap a photo of your beautiful body.” He said this as his hand slid down from my chest, slowly down to my cock, grinning, spittle flying out of his mouth as he coughed, slid a blade against it as chopped it off. I screamed out loud, blood spurting from me and all the smile he smiled, then I fell asleep, never to wake again.

ReiKoroshiya,0,,0,1rgsca,,2,"Here I am and im going to write about some of the things that go on in my life. Sorry for bombarding you with some trivial things and please just hear me out.
how about I start at the beginning that seems easier. Well back in elementary, I was that kid the kid that really no one liked. I had a friend here and there but that's about it. I was basically a social outcast, 
I never really got my work done, I still don't. Note that I was a very, very angry child and no I was not spoiled if that's what your thinking, im the oldest of 3 kids who had been and are growing up in poverty, but my father is very good at managing money which means he is very cheap.
I had shared a room with my younger brother and for some reason I never grew out of the stage where you sleep with your blankets over your head. I had always liked horror even though none of it really scared me even in elementary in the 3rd grade I found an author by the
name of R.L.Stine and I had read tons of his books which remotely captured my interests.
A few of the simple things had scared me, and I most likely have experiences that I have blocked out of my mind, I don't remember much about my childhood at all.
I don't know why I can't but that's just how it is. I do remember bits and pieces though, not anything like birthdays, mind you. Here Ile give some examples, I remember
when I thought my stuffed animal had red eyes, I freaked out a little bit called my parents and my father calmed me down and took it away. Years later I went back and found it, and of course it wasn't scary anymore. Another example
would be when I saw a ""witch"" in my closet, but again my father came in and turned the light on to show me that there was nothing there, I had clearly saw something but it was gone as soon as the light turned back on.
Once he had left and turned the light back of the figure was back again. I remember when my body shot up in bed and I let out a blood curtling scream and my parents rushed into the room
and they had tried to comfort me and to calm me down I was bawling my eyes out while hugging my father he had asked me what had happened and I was just mumbling incoherently 
about it. I can't remember what it was that had freaked me out so badly. Something else that just pokes out at me was when I was lying in bed and I hear talking so I sit up strait in bed and I see my parents right there talking to each other I couldn't understand what they were saying because they were mumbling and I said hey and they say love you simultaneously and I said aww I love you too you guys, I reached out to hug them and they both just vanished and I almost fell out of bed(I got top bunk). Then their are the things that I have learned from my family throughout the years, not much really
they don't seem to want to talk much about when I was younger. I got that I was a horrible child when they brought me to church, and that I would bite and snarl when anyone got within an arms reach of me.
keep in mind I don't remember that about going to church, as a matter of fact I don't remember going to church at all. hmmm.... well skip forward to middle school where I had
actually made friends. I did got in so much trouble in middle school its not even funny. I could barely even go a week without at least one detention. Saturday school and suspensions I had gotten a ton too, now
drugs are prevalent where I live and when I say that drugs were prevalent I truly mean that, but honestly the thought of drugs never really appealed to me well I mean
certain ones that is, the only mind altering substance that I would actually want to do, smoke, drink, etc would be alcohol cause it seems fun and really any hallucinogenic drug and there
is no way I could get ahold of hallucinogenic drugs without paying a ton of money and with my broke ass I can't afford it and because of that im drug free. Not to much
happened in middle school, only a few things I started to get hellish demonic dreams (oh and speaking of dreams I have always been able to feel pain in my dreams so if
say I was to get ran through with a spear or had my flesh pealed off in a dream I would wake up and still feel it, I also talk in my sleep) which sucks ass, The vast 
majority of my dreams became violent and with me being an avid gamer there was usually a sword nearby in my dreams and usually I could and would fight back and be home
free. I enjoyed those violent dreams where I won, even though I would battle hellish creatures and people I wouldn't consider it a nightmare. I got my own room in the basement which was nice, and well my brother he was, how do you put it? 
Gassy so yeah hot air rises and all that. Electronic malfunctions had started occurring, like waking up to my radio playing static, my alarm clock started to malfunction, etc. I remember waking up minutes before my alarm clock 
went off I awoke with a shot of electricity to my left ear. Skip forward to highschool in the 9th grade I found out what creepypasta and scp were it was amazing to find real horror for a change.
I read the hell out of creepypasta's and found some really cool narrators for them, listening to those was very enjoyable I didn't read scps often and I found a very long series called the holders.
Near the end of the year I started to feel a presence in my room which was interesting because it didn't have a bad feeling to it, the only word that comes to mind to describe it would be light if that makes any sense.
Jump forward one more year, I had flunked my freshman year because I don't do my work. On those professional tests that they make you take S.A.T's or some shit I did 
insanely good on those like I should be an A- student overall. Now i reside in alternative ed. Im 15 right now. I declared to my parents that im agnostic instead of
Baptist a few months ago. Anyway that presence in my room i hardly feel it anymore and now there is something more sinister and not just in my room anymore.
That thing I actually saw it, I fucking saw it, it was short like about a foot and a half tall. I went to bed last night and you know how earlier I had said I sleep
with my blankets over my head. Well I was moving around under the covers and I glanced out underneath the covers and there it was just staring at me a few inches away 
from my face I had to resist not to punch it because half of me was saying its just my imagination and the other half says that if its real  then im going to freak the fuck out and well I never did hit it and its creepy as fuck that its been watching me. I tried to calm my breathing as to not alert it to the fact that I have seen it I
think it knows I saw it because I have been getting glances of it all day. It might have seen me and it might be watching me type this.
It is very short and I can never manage to see any features on its face it just looks dark like a shadow its really, really dark, everything distorts when I look at it like my depth perception gets thrown off and space distorts around it.

highchairchildren,3,,1,1rgqmu,,2,"I'm looking for any input. If anyone has had experiences like this, is there a way to stop it?

So this started about two years ago. In the beginning it was just a perpetual bad feeling, like something bad was going to happen all the time.  I was anxious, always alert and never at rest. I hardly slept, primarily keeping myself awake in order to feel safer. 

Then, I started seeing things.

When I say seeings things I don't mean like hallucinations, well not really. I'm not crazy. There were never any voices and there never have been. It was more like a blackout moment in which the worst possible scenario for my environment would play out seemingly right before my eyes. 

Mostly accidents.  It happened once while I was sledding.  The hill was a steep drop and then inclined back up about 20 ft. or so where it met a busy road. Usually people lost momentum and slid back down the hill and came to a rest in the valley but sometimes, people would make it all the way up and hit the metal road block that was put up along the hill. A watched as a kid went down the hill and then it happened. I continued to watch as he went all the way back up the hill and under the metal road block right into the speeding car that was passing by. There was blood everywhere. I snapped back to reality and looked around. Everything was fine. There was no blood, nobody was hurt, just kids sledding around having fun. 

I continued to have random ""visions"" for the entire year. They varied in severity. The worst one left me shaken for a few days afterwards.  I was home babysitting my younger sisters and boiling pot of spaghetti for dinner.  I moved to the sink to strain the pasta and then went back to turn off the electric stove.  My little sister approached me to ask a question and then I had my flash.  As I was seeing it, I grabbed her by her hair and pressed her face into the stove. In that moments I watched as her eyes rolled around in her head and she screamed, begging me to stop.  I snapped back and couldn't speak. I teared up and thought I was going to puke.  I ran to the bathroom, washed my face, sat down on the ground and cried. I had never felt such a mixture of fear and remorse in my life. I got up and reentered the kitchen, finished dinner and continued the night as if nothing happened.  She asked me what was wrong and I played it off as a bout of sickness.  I sat awake for hours that night and I still couldn't come up with a reason for why this kept happening to me.  I asked my mom to see a psychiatrist but unfortunately it was a luxury we simply couldn't afford. 

Then it stopped. As quickly as it came in it left and I had no more of an idea about what it was than I'd had before.  It stayed away for a while. I mean really a long time.  I was vision free for an entire year.

I was prompted to write this because I had another one the other.  The first in over a year but I am scared. I don't want it to start again.  The most recent one was more subtle.  I was shaving in the shower went as I brought the razor up my leg, somehow or another I cut myself and there was blood everywhere.  The tub was washed red with it and there was nothing I could do but stand and watch as it oozed out of my leg and swirled around in the water before going down the drain.  Then I flashed back and it wasn't there. I hadn't even cut myself.

I know this must sound crazy, like some Final Destination bullshit.  I swear to you I wouldn't have posted it if I didn't have hopes that someone could help.  Any input is welcomed.",Can anyone help?,3,nosleep

You might remember my journal entries from last month. Last month, I can't believe it's been that long. Days and weeks run now in an endless loop. Where I am now time doesn't matter. It's a nuisance, it's a hinderance. 

A lot has happened. I just wanted to let those who cared, who reached out to me, know that I am alive. Very much so. And I have met some friends. Real human beings. There is so much I want to tell you. So much I want to explain. But I can't. Not now. 

Just know that the monster under your bed is real. That shadow in the closet exists. And those voices, the voices you hear in the dead of the night are not your imagination. All your life you have been told horror stories. And now you seek them out, on this subreddit. To be entertained, to be thrilled. But these stories exist for a reason. Every story has a truth. A small bit of reality wrapped around trigger words and exaggeration. 

That truth is what lurks in the shadows of your house, just at the corner of your eye. The truth is what is waiting for you when you close your eyes to sleep, hoping for a peaceful night's rest. But nothing is peaceful in the dark. Where the light is eclipsed by the slithering, rotting presence that knows you oh so well. One day you'll know. You will wake up and know. All those stories. All those scary tales. All those fears.

Are real.

bass_slapper,0,,2,1rh8lh,,0,"*You think me cruel. No. I’ve only learned to act on what I’ve been given. I’ve learned to deal with my problems in my own way. No one understands this but me it seems. This is for ME, I don’t do it for them. But they can’t understand my need. He can’t either. I must make me. Make him understand. How did he get here? I wish I came back. I want him back. WHY WON’T I COME BACK WHY IS HE HERE ARE YOU SORRY ARE YOU SORRY ARE YOU SOR-*

Past this the note is unreadable, spewed with a fluid I can only assume is meant to go on the inside of people. Not that I’d really want to read much more anyways. I already know what happens. Well, not really “know”, but I can feel it. Who wrote it? I can only assume it was my dear Uncle Drewson, if he’s even my uncle. What is this? No clue. A note, obviously, but beyond that speculation reigns. Where did I find this? My new house, in a drawer. Nothing is inherently terrifying about that – Oh, except that it was under the clothing I had already packed there. I just missed it before, I keep telling myself. I half believe it. A few pills later and I’m not worrying about it anymore.

Before this, I didn’t even know I had an Uncle Drewson, let alone that I was to inherit his estate in the event of his untimely, but now enacted, demise. With a heavily estranged family, growing up in between various friends or close relatives passed around by uncaring parents looking to shirk responsibility, one loses track of aunts and uncles. It was in a familiar neighborhood, a spacious three bedroom, so I was in no way eager to turn it down. As a poor, regularly unemployed person I’d been accustomed to sleeping on generous friends floors in the all too often occurrence I couldn’t afford anywhere else. I thought, it’ll all be worth it one day, the day I make it in the world. I can pay all these people back tenfold. “The day I make it”, yeah right. A consistent – and more pressingly, free – living space was a welcome antonym to my recent fortunes. So I was moved in within a couple weeks. Absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened. Till that note seemed to start some kind of vicious domino effect on my life, I was content.

You know when you think back to something embarrassing, stupid, or otherwise shameful act you may have done in your younger, brasher days? Once you recall it, it starts eating away, regret seeping in to every corner of your thoughts, till you would give the world to go back and change it, or at least erase the memory. Imagine that, only you can’t remember what it was you’ve done. It’s simply gone from you. The more you try, the less you realize. The less you realize, the more you regret. The more you regret, the more you try. That’s what’s happening to me, ever since I moved here. But it even goes past that. It’s the sudden feeling you’re being watched from barely out of sight. And at the same time, a crushing loneliness in that feeling. I pop a few more pills. Of course, I’m not being watched. There’s no one else here. If you think you’re being rather clever, figuring this out, oh-no-someone’s-been-in-the-house-with-you-all-along, I was most certainly the only one here. Anyway, this was about the time I found the note. If it was this Drewson, what is he talking about? Who does he want back? What is his need? Do I even want to know the answer to any of these? Insatiable curiosity will ensure I do, personal preference notwithstanding. Putting it all to the back of my mind, I chop up steak for dinner. I like to think of myself as a fairly accomplished chef, particularly where matters of slicing and/or dicing are concerned. I once worked a sushi bar, as a side job to pay the bills, and was quite proud of my ability to launch various morsels into the air and sever them in two with one fell swipe, like you see in commercials. Until the day my knife slipped and nearly skewered a customer’s eyeball. Maybe I’m not quite as proficient as I thought… I grab the bottle of pills and take a few. I don’t really like thinking about that time in my life.

I’m digging through my drawer later, that same drawer, when I stumble upon another discovery. Instead of a clue, it only deepens my mystery. A USB stick is secured to the very back of the board. I carefully remove it, and spend a few minutes simply gawking at my find, my inner curiosity again sparring with my better senses. I think, this will perhaps answer some questions about the note, and hopefully clear up my imaginations conjuring brought on by its conclusion’s implications. As per your previous assumptions, I couldn’t be farther from the truth. I secure the stick in its dock. View files. Two folders: “Reminders” and “Media”. Reminders is empty, media contains one subfolder: “Vids”. I open the folder. Two more: “memories” and “triggers”. Memories is empty. I open triggers. I’m confronted with one video file: shotinthedark.wmv. It’s 0:40 long. I press play.

Before I continue, if you’ll permit me one aside to validate the severity of this. I’m a massive horror movie fan, and I like them brutal. The more blood and guts, the better. I like truly graphic, heart wrenching stuff, and I very rarely squirm at it. Three seconds into shotinthedark.wmv and I rushed over the trash can to puke what felt like my very soul out. The scene I’m immediately confronted with was a man on a chair wearing nothing but an undershirt and briefs. There is a single light source on the chair, but I can faintly make out a figure in the background. Then, without a word, the man’s brains are ejected out his face, accompanied with a thunderous bang. Bone and cartilage spew forth in the foreground. Nearly black red sludge runs down his white undershirt, accompanied with brain matter that had just been crackling with life, likely flooded by fear, but life. I don’t have too much time to process anymore; I’m preoccupied with regurgitating my expertly made steak into the wastebasket. I think, it must be fake, but I know it’s not. I’ve got to tell someone about this, I think, the police, someone. Yeah, I’ll talk to the cops. Then, over my subsiding retching, I hear a familiar voice utter “Are you sorry now?” in the tone of a disappointed parent talking to their disobedient toddler. Something in that voice is chilling. Something… I return my gaze to the computer screen, where the barely visible figure now stands in full view, smiling.

I recognize the smile too.

It’s me, smiling back at myself, gripping a smoking sawed off.

The computer screen goes black. My head spins. I lie down.

youngsterjose42,1,,5,1rge20,,1,"He woke up in the morning like every other day. Yet this day was different; Jordan was going back to school after being expelled last year. He was caught with drugs and his school wanted nothing to do with it. He moved, now resides in york, Pennsylvania and now goes to William Penn High. He moved to a house which was quite old and just had some renovations a while back. The rent was quite cheap so his mother said ""why not?"". I was one of Jordan's first friends, since moving to york he told me things about that house really strange things. He soon moved away a little after I moved away so I have no idea where he is now. If any of you happen to live in york I'm talking about the old burned down house on market street across the street from the kindergarten/daycare. This story takes place about 2 years before the house burned down. 

A month since school started and about two weeks since I started talking to Jordan he invited me over to his house. Jordan said ""cmon dude come and stay the night my moms gone and im pretty sure wont give a shit"". So I thought why not I haven't spent the night at a friends house in a while ""yea sure ill spend the night man"". We went around town skated for a while, went to McDonald's with a few other friends then it came around 10 or maybe 11 everyone was ready to go home and i was ready to just go to a place and chill, play video games, and maybe eat some more. We got to his place, sat down in the living room, and lit up a blunt. Playing grand auto 3, high off our asses, we ordered some pizza. We ate and everything was fine till I felt like heading over to the bathroom. As soon as I opened the door I notice under the sink there was like a small cabinet and the doors slammed shut. I was high so I didn't really questioned it much. I used the bathroom and then as I exit I suddenly hear a giggle coming from under the sink. A child's giggle, as if there was a kid under the sink playing hide'n'seek or something. Again I did not question it because I was high and didn't really wanna bother finding out what made the noise. Jordan passed out on the couch, I went to his room and tried to sleep on his bed. I remember waking up around four in the morning hearing footsteps and a child giggling I'm pretty sure it was a little boy. I couldn't really tell his age but he was young; I would guess around six or seven. He was running around the house and he stopped at the door I did not see him, I only ever got to see his outline. He said "" I'm really happy I got more friends to play with now"". Suddenly after that he vanished faster than I could blink. I didn't sleep for the rest of the night. I had goosebumps for a good 30 to 45 minutes. Eventually I  calmed myself down by eating pizza and watching TV.",Hide 'N' seek,6,nosleep

We all automatically stopped and looked at each other for about a minute, then we got up and ran to my room.

Mindlesssavage,4,,8,1rhawv,,0,"I have a Where's Wally book. Well, had. Why? I'll tell you.
So I was just searching for Wally at night like I usually do, and I heard a noise.
It was sort of a scratching noise, scratching with a walking cane maybe.
I went to investigate. I went out of my room and...
Nothing.
Maybe it was just me. I went back to my bedroom door. I saw something written on really drippy red paint.
It said ""Find me if you can"". I thought it was just my little brother Mike painting on the walls again. ""Where was Mike anyway?"", I thought. Then I remembered he was outside playing with our pet dog Molly. ( Don't ask me why he was playing in the dark, because I have no idea).
I went inside my room. That's when I saw it. The book was lying on the ground open. I picked it up. This is what the title said:
""yllaW s'erehW"" Now THIS was weird. I also saw the same Wally picture except his eyes were gone and blood was dripping from them.
It was possessed, I thought. I ran outside to bury it, and I stepped on something. It sounded like it was glass because I heard it shatter.
I looked down.
A pair of broken, black rimmed glasses. I ignored it and ran even faster than before.
I ran to my dog Molly's kennel. I always feel safe when she's with me.
She was whining in the corner. That was typical, though. But wasn't she playing with Mike? I shouted out, ""Mike! Mike! Can you hear me?""
No replies.
I ran to the middle of the yard to bury the book.
I stepped in another thing. It was squishy, and slimy.
I looked down.
Blood. Blood and guts.
And Mike.
Lying on the ground.
Stomach open.
With a walking cane through his heart.
I wanted to cry, but then I saw a little Post-It note on the cane.
A poem.
This is what it said:
""I can run, and I can hide.
Tear you apart from the inside.
Waiting in the darkness, with my cane.
Used to be for children, now insane.
Red and white, in the grey fog.
Running around with my little pet dog.
With my girlfriend Wenda, with her camera,
And an old man with a white beard.
The prisoner who escaped from jail, murdering people with no fail.
That's my gang, with no doubt.
When you're in with me, there's no way out.""
This was way too bad to just BURY. We had to set it on FIRE. Or RIP IT APART. Just destroy it in whatever way I could.
So now in my backyard, a grave for Mike, some burnt and ripped pages, shattered glasses, and a walking cane.
And to this day, I never read another Where's Wally book again.
And every night, I still hear the sound of a scratching walking cane against my bedroom door.

kimmiekissies,13,,29,1rgt5c,,122,"I never even met him, I didn't know his name or face. I was, blissfully unaware, of his very existence.

 I will never know why, or when it started. I'm glad for that I guess. I moved into my very small apartment in February last year. My landlord, Olivia, was a sweet older woman who would cook to much and bring me much appreciated leftovers. She was great to me, even after telling her my problem. I'm antisocial, but she didn't mind renting to a reclusive young girl who reminded her of her daughter.

 Every few weeks she would knock on my door then leave, letting me know she was leaving something for me. I loved that. Not even my family would cook so well. The next morning I wash and leave her empty containers outside my door and by an hour or so she would take them back again. My other neighbors seemed fine, but I never talked or visited with them.

 I work from home so anytime I ever was forced to go out I rushed out and into my apartment avoiding an, uncomfortable situation. I loved living alone, it was everything I hoped for. I could just, breathe. By April though, I started noticing things were not right. They were moving, or plain disappearing. I was convinced it was just anxiety caused by my new medication and the move, another side affect was it would make me so drowsy. Since I hated seeing the doctor I just dealt.

 I took naps during the day now and eventually stopped caring. Until one incident doubled my paranoia, Olivia brought me some sort of greek tossed salad and dressing for lunch one day and I enjoyed it with my friend netflix. I fell asleep in the middle of Portlandia, and woke up that evening at 5pm. Per usual, what was not usual was my bedding on the opposite side of me was disturbed. I only sleep on the right side. Always. Even more it felt.. *warm.* My first thought was I must have rolled around a lot, but I knew it was to odd to dismiss. 

I got up and searched my apartment gripping my phone with 911 typed in. Nothing else was disturbed, everything was exactly like it should be. I let it go, for the next few weeks everything was normal pardon the occasional misplaced shoe or drawn back shower curtain. I thought about telling someone, my parents, maybe Olivia, but if it's not life or death I am not reaching out to anyone. 

I wasn't scared, I was nervous, maybe a little stubborn.. But I stayed. I am not letting some stupid anxiety ruin my lovely lonely world.
 May came and It was getting worse. My panties, toothbrush, hell even my food was being misplaced. Every time I woke up there was this strange odor in the air. I finally realized this won't go away by ignoring it. I called my mom and begged to come stay a few days, when I got home I told them everything. Saying it out loud solidified any creepy suspicions. 

That weekend my dad went to my apartment and what was found was true horror. Written all over that walls: ""COME BACK"" ""BABY PLEASE"" He ran out and called the police. There was no one living in my apartment but someone definitely had access besides me. 
The investigation revealed a man, Henry, the son of my landlord Olivia, was in a projected relationship with me.

 They showed me his confession on tape. He admitted coming into my apartment every night and everyday with his mother's extra key. He claims we were in love and he had my permission. He drugged his mother's food she left out for me causing my drowsiness and falling asleep so he could come in and watch me sleep, touch my hair, kiss my shoulder. The leftovers I had in the fridge were tested and confirmed.
 I was absolutely, horrified and disgusted. A man, I never knew existed, collected my drain hair, clothes, and trash and practically lived in my apartment for *four months.*

Thanks to everyone for your responses, I have taken a lot of your advice.
I'll just give you all a quick update on what happened after I posted yesterday. She ended up having a nap after sitting in front of the TV for a few hours. I was going to walk our dog, Zeus, but I decided to wait until she woke up just in case she woke up and was confused.


She woke up after a couple of hours and was.....well. Happy. Really, really happy. Almost manic. She woke up full of beans, and smiling like a maniac. I was initially relieved. I asked would she like to come for a walk with Zeus and I and she happily agreed. We set off for our normal walk, and she was extremely energetic, bounding off in front of Zeus and I. Zeus is a Labrador, and although he is a big boy, he's still a pup. We usually just meander along on these walks while he sniffs at everything along the way. But she set a cracking pace and Zeus and I struggled to keep up. 


We got up to this park where we usually let him off his lead for a while as we're trying to train him to not run off on us and to be sociable. It's always been a real task getting him back on the leash though, he never ever comes when he's called. Anyway, we let him off, and he's running around and smelling everything and peeing on anything that stands still long enough. My wife, she's picking flowers and sniffing them, and singing. She gets on the swings at the park and I push her for a bit, as she sings under her breath. I was feeling quite content at this point. Figured she must have just been over tired.


She's swinging vigourously when all of a sudden she comes to a dead halt. She yells, in an almost unfamiliar, masculine voice, ""Zeus! Here!"" and points in front of her feet.


I stood in disbelief as I watched Zeus, the most disobedient rascal of a dog I know, solemnly trot over to where she's pointing, sit in front of her, and stare up into her face. They both sat there for a split second, very still, looking at each other. I picked my jaw up off the floor and asked her ""Um..what the hell! How did you manage that!"" and that seemed to break both their concentration and Zeus shot off like a bat out of hell again, and she started swinging again - ""Oh"" she said, ""I used my mind to call out to him...it's something new I learned..""
She seemed kind of sheepish about it to be honest. I pressed her for more details, but the more questions I asked the more defensive she got. She knows I don't believe that for a second. I'm just happy that Zeus is finally starting to be trained. That's really the only explanation. I asked her to do it again but she refused, so I think we both know it was a fluke.


The rest of the afternoon was....nice. Kind of odd. It's like there's something that's amiss. Like when you walk into your messy bedroom and you can tell that *something* is not how it should be but you can't pin point what.


We talked a bit about the seminar. She said that it was very intense. The days were very long. She said that the premise of the seminar is to get to the root of any emotional upset, to explore the root causes for what's going on in your life. I asked if any hypnosis was used, as suggested by you guys, and she said no. They talked a lot, and were assigned to small groups, and encouraged to open up and explore their ""inner beings"". She said she felt a lot better since attending.
Still, something was not quite right. For instance, we were talking about my sister who lives in another state, and how she had recently got a new job. A few minutes later, my phone rang and it was her. I picked it up and said ""Emma! Speak of the devil..."" and my wife smashed me up the side of the head, causing me to drop the phone and shouted ""Emma is NOT the devil!! How could you say that!!! Emma is NOT THE DEVIL!!"" I told Emma I would call her back and tried to get my wife to calm down. She was very upset at what I had said. She sort of went silent again, and was very still. She seemed rather annoyed at me, but by this point, I was nearing exhaustion myself, so I let her be.

She fell asleep early, about 8pm, on the couch. I covered her with a blanket, and noticed that her eyes are kind of half opened..... I used to have a friend who slept like that at school and I've never noticed it before, I think that in my state of hyper vigilance, I am being overly perceptive of small details.
 
I read more of my original post, and all your comments, and decided to step outside and call our therapist, just to find out more about the seminar, as I knew she was there assisting.

I walked out onto our back porch and lit a cigarette and rang her. She answered on my first ring. What she said has really weirded me out. Only because although she gave me a lot of information, she has raised many more questions, as well as answered them.
 
She said these seminars are more like interactive workshops run by a man named Brian and his wife Linda, who are both self-appointed ""psychotherapists"". She said that there are psychologists such as herself on stand by to assist because sometimes when people are in such a vulnerable state, they may need assistance. She said she has referred a lot of her client's to attend these workshops and has found them to be helpful in most cases.
 
Basically, the course is about discovering your inner self, and using different methods to connect to your inner voice, to find out what the cause of your worries are. She said that it is incredibly demanding and intense. Each session goes for 14 hours with only an hour break. During these sessions, many different activities and topics are explored, including, regression. Apparently Brian does this 3 hour session on the second last day, where he gets everyone to meditate, and be still, and he regresses them back to childhood, or even, in some extreme cases, past lives. Our therapist said, it was so intense that she had to fight from being regressed herself. She did make comment that she had been concerned initially about how my wife would handle that, but that she seemed ""brighter, had a clarity about her"" after this experience. They discussed what my wife had gone back to, in her mind, and the therapist was happy that it hadn't caused her any great distress, but reminded me she couldn't discuss the specifics. She said when she wakes tomorrow I could gently try and open the lines of communication with her and she may explain her ""experience"".
 
I told her about my wife's strange behaviour. She said it is normal to be a little out of sorts after one of these sessions, but nothing major. I don't know if it's just me, but I could sense a tiny bit of alarm in her voice.... I don't know, maybe I imagined it. She said to call her if there's any further problems.
 
I hung up, and as I was putting out my cigarette, I turned to go inside and my wife's standing there staring at me. I jump and say ""Jesus Christ honey you scared me!"" and she replied ""Not as fucking much as I'm going to scare you.""
 
Ummm ok. I had to physically turn her and direct her into the house. In the moonlight she almost looked like a stranger to me. Her long blonde hair was hanging in her face, and her face was fixed in this awful scowl. I figured she must still be pissed at me from before. I put her to bed and she goes back to sleep.
 
And, well, that's where she is now.... she was supposed to be off work today too, but I was meant to go back to my job. But when my alarm went off, I just had this weird feeling that I should stick around and make sure she was ok. I rang in sick for work, and I'm just doing some household jobs, waiting to see if she's better when she wakes up, and googling what regression means, and what these intense emotional exercises can do to someone. Still nothing that convincing though. I dont know. Maybe I'm *too* skeptical. I just don't believe this crap.

The whole thing sounds a bit stupid to me, if I'm honest. But I have to say, it has caused some kind of change in my wife. She is very extreme in her emotions at the moment, and I'm worried, because we both have to go back to work tomorrow, and her work environment is very proper. She is always a perfect employee, and very dedicated to her work. I can't help but feel concerned that she might wake up tomorrow and still be in this....mood. Do you guys know anything about this ""regression""....is it the same as hypnosis? She was adamant she wasn't hypnotised, but it sounds like it to me!!



EDIT: Ok now I'm getting really freaked out. I went to check on her and she was talking and singing her sleep. I can't quit work out what song she's singing I've never heard it before. But she's saying something about being someone called Azara or something??? It's really fucking unnerving it doesn't even sound like her. Ill try and get a recording and see if you guys can shed some light. 


EDIT TWO: Ok I managed to record a bit of it...she's singing but I don't know what, has anyone heard this before????????? Ignore the TV in the background I was watching it in the lounge room to drown her out, and it was really unnerving when I turned it off and all I could hear was her. I'm kind freaked out now, I'll admit it. [Here it is](http://soundcloud.com/user165636719/a0ynmqy5tete/s-jECMW)",UPDATE!!! Need some advice.

floydnimrod,21,,25,1rhxtb,,113,"I'd just come from church for some reason. I'm not sure why I'd gone into the church, but it was the weirdest service I'd ever been too. Everybody was there. It was a packed house. Rich people, poor people, criminals, middle class folk. It was all people who didn't normally go to church. I looked into the coat room as I walked in, and some guy was snorting cocaine on this little counter top. Right in a church. I was like, what the hell? I've never see that.

I sat in a pew, and looked up. There was no minister. They were just playing a movie of an old church service on the screen. Some little old lady was playing a hymn on an organ, and the minister was applauding her. She seemed happy. But the audience was restless, not really paying attention, not sitting down, just kind of wandering around, talking to everybody. 

And then I saw a woman I used to know, someone I worked with years ago. I went to sit down next to her, and she sort of jumped on my lap and hugged me, saying she was so glad to see me. I wasn't sure if she was sad, or drunk, or terrified, or just lonely, but she whispered in my ear, offering me sex, saying she's always wanted me, ever since she'd known me. I sort of pushed her off my lap, thinking this was hardly the place for that kind of cheap pick-up. And then I got up and walked out. There wasn't really a church service going on anyway, I don't even think it was Sunday.

And then for some reason, I was in a car with this old lady. I don't even know who it was, or why I was with her. She was old like my grandma Freddie, but it wasn't her. We were driving down the street. She was driving too slow because she was kind of lost. I don't think I was in Winnipeg I was on a large street, almost the size of Portage with several lanes. But they all seemed to be deserted, like very early on a Sunday morning. I'm not sure if it was early in the morning or near sunset, but the sun was low in the sky. I think it was late in the day. The streets were mostly clear though.

The lady pulled over and for some reason she got out of the car. I think she was going to ask somebody for directions. I looked at the GPS thing she had on her dashboard, and suddenly the direction went all fuzzy and scrambled, like the satellite was confused, or just no longer there. And then the whole sky got this weird greenish tint to it for about ten seconds. It basically turned green instead of blue, but only for a moment, and then it was back to normal. Everybody stopped and looked up.

I was still in the car, but I leaned forward and looked out the window. The sun was over in the west, low in the sky. And I saw what looked like a second moon fly over the sky in a direction that was diagonal to the sun's normal path. It was huge. And my stomach got queasy for a moment. It made your stomach sick because it was so big, it actually pulled on you with its own gravity, like the moon pulls on the tides, but much bigger, and everything inside you just got tugged around.

But it went straight across the sky, without hitting. When I realized how close it was, though, I knew it was gonna hit somewhere, probably on the other side of the world. The gravity of the earth pulled it in, and it sling-shotted around to the other side somewhere. I jumped out of the car and grabbed the old lady's arm.

""Come on! We have to find shelter! It's gonna hit!"" 

We just abandoned the car in the street, and I dragged her toward a nearby fire station, or hydro office, or whatever it was. I'm not sure which it was, but there were large utility trucks, with lifts on them. It was also deserted for some reason, except for two guys loading one of the trucks. We banged on the doors, but it was locked up. We ran from door to door trying to get in, but everything was locked. 

And then I felt a great rumble under my feet. It nearly knocked me down. I've never been in an earthquake, so I don't know what it's like, but it felt like the entire planet shivered. Car alarms started going off in every direction and I heard a weird sound like gravel tumbling down a hillside, except there were no hills. I think it was pieces falling off houses in all directions. We were able to stay on our feet though. 

A few moments later, the sky in the north went dark. If I assume the sun was setting in the west, and the meteor or asteroid or whatever flew over the sky in a north-west to south-east direction, then it was north the black came from. And I mean the entire sky. Like a wall of blackness, smoke and ash suddenly filling the view from the ground to the upper atmosphere, from west to east as far as you could see, in one huge wall of black cloud. And it was coming toward us. Well, sort of going towards everyone, everywhere, I guess. It came over the horizon like an charging army, fast and steady, advancing.

""It hit on the other side of the world somewhere! Come on! we have to get indoors! We won't be able to breathe!""

The air started turning yellow. Ash started raining down, and bits of rock and debris from the blast, where ever it hit. I took a deep breath and held it as I was running. I could already smell a weird burning rock smell, like sulphur, like burnt matches, but more metallic. 

Me and the lady finally got into some doors, but it was just a little foyer. We ran in and shut the doors behind us. The inside doors were locked. But it was somewhere to hide. There was a fire alarm. I pulled it, not really knowing why I was bothering. But I was sort of in a panic and not thinking straight. The sign said, In Case of Emergency, so I pulled it. The alarm went off, and we looked out the window. The yellow air turned brown, and then dark red. Then everything went black. The black cloud fell over the whole sky with a clattering rumble that sounded like it was raining gravel instead of water. And all light went out of the world.

The world as we knew it was over. Even if we survived, life as we know it would never be the same. We'd be set back 10,000 years, reduced to hunter gatherers again, living out of caves. If we survived the impact that is. I honestly don't think anybody would have survived the shockwave. Something with that much gravity hitting the earth would pretty much end the story for everybody.

Charlies_friend,20,,9,1rhapg,,79,"A friend of mine posted a story here not too long ago, and he was pretty well received by your wonderful community, so I decided to create an account to share mine.


When I was a little girl, about nine years old, my family purchased a small ranch in western Kansas. My father had just gotten out of the Army, and I suppose after seven years of trotting around the world, and spending two of those years in active combat zones, my dad just wanted to go somewhere the world would leave him alone. He couldn't have found a better location for this purpose; anyone who's ever followed Interstate 70 westward through that area knows, there isn't much between Topeka and Denver.

I still remember the day we (my mom, dad, older sister and I) moved into that old ranch house. It had been built in the early 1900's, and being something of a history buff, I was pretty excited to live in a house that had stood through prohibition, the depression, both world wars, and everything since. The house itself sat at the bottom of a small incline from the main road, backed literally into a hill. This setup meant the back half of the home sat underground, buried in the hillside. Outside the house was a little grassy yard area, and across this yard was an old barn. We didn't have any horses, but my dad held a particular love for classic cars, and he turned that barn into an amateur autoshop where he worked refurbishing old cars from the junk yard in his spare time.

My sister and I were given seperate but adjoining rooms upstairs, while my parents took the master bedroom (oddly) on the first floor. My sister and I's rooms opened onto a sort of landing that looked out over the living room and kitchen, and the stairs led down from there.

It was only our second or third night in the house, that I began to notice some strange things occurring. I was unable to sleep one night, and I laid awake in bed long after I heard my parents and sister go to bed. The house was incredibly quiet, both from being in the middle of a very isolated area, and by virtue of being half buried. Just as I was reaching the half-sleep state...........SLAM! I heard a door downstairs slam shut. At first I tried convincing myself I had just dreamed it, but I couldn't make myself believe that. And the next thing I heard chilled me to my core. I heard footsteps coming up the stairway. I could tell from the sound that the individual must be wearing shoes, so it probably wasn't my parents coming up to check on me. I heard the steps reach the top of the stairs, and then begin down the landing. I was frozen with fear when I heard them arrive outside my door, pause for a moment, and then continue on. When the stranger was apparently in front of my sisters room, he paused again, and again he continued. He reached the far end of the landing, and then turned around and came back the way he came. He continued for what seemed like an eternity, pacing around outside my sister and I's rooms. I finally worked up some nine-year-old courage and crawled to the door. I could still hear footsteps coming from just outside. I waited until he was moving away from me, and I was between him and the stairs, planning on making a mad dash for my parents room when his back was turned. I barely cracked open the door and looked out, and saw....nothing. The footsteps had stopped, and the whole house was empty, and still. I was confused, and afraid, but even then I knew if I ran to my parents they would think I was nuts. So I slid a chair in front of my door and crept into bed. A minute later the footsteps started again, back and forth, all along the landing. Eventually, they lulled me to sleep. 

I didn't mention the noises that night to anyone, fearful of my parents thinking I was a whacko, and of being made fun of by my sister. But, over the next few weeks, everyone in my family began to notice strange happenings on our ranch. Objects moved on their own. Small things would disappear for days, only to be returned exactly where they'd gone missing from. It was what I guess you'd call typical poltergeist activity; nothing harmful or malevolent, just noises here and there and odds and ends moving around. And practically every night I heard those footsteps outside my room. 

My family eventually began referring to this entity as ""Charlie"". He seemed to be a harmless ghost, and sometimes downright helpful. Occasionally my parents would wake early in the morning for work, only to find a freshly brewed pot of coffee waiting in the kitchen. The coffee maker had no automatic timer. Sometimes when one of us had misplaced something, like car keys or the like, we'd search the house frantically only to turn around and find what we'd been searching for laying on the ground behind us. And sometimes Charlie would slam a door, or walk around loudly, or turn a sink on, seemingly just to let us know he was there. And always, those footsteps at night.

Charlie always seemed particularly active in my dad's auto shop. My dad would occasionally find car parts he'd been working on had been tinkered with, despite the fact that he was the only one who ever went in there. Sometimes tools would go missing, only to be returned a short time later. Once my dad came in from his shop one evening as white as a sheet. When we asked what was wrong he just said ""Charlie was walking around out there........Jesus, I thought you all were just hearing things!"". I wasn't sure why Charlie loved that shop so much, but incidentally, that was where I caught my first sight of him. It was a Saturday, and my Dad was hard at work putting together an old Chevy Fleetline. My mom mad him a sandwich as a working lunch, and asked me to take it to him. I eased open the barn door, and saw my dad seated at his work bench, his back to me. And I saw another man, next to the car, also out of my dad's field of vision. He was about 5'8"", with dark hair and eyes. He was dressed in what looked like typical 1930's clothing; black slacks, a pinstripe vest over a grey work shirt, and topped off by a brown ""paper boy"" hat, cocked to one side. He looked right at me for a second, a big, mischievous grin on his face, and then he simply disappeared. I didn't even realized I was still holding my dad's sandwich and continued to stare at the spot Charlie had stood until my dad snapped me back to reality.

So passed the next few months. My family was happy on our little haunted ranch, Charlie seemed happy enough to share the space with us, and life was good. And his nightly vigil outside my room began to seem almost comforting. One night in late November, however, I learned just how utterly terrifying Charlie could be.

My dad had some kind of dinner event for work in Topeka, almost two hours away, and since my Sister was almost 16 by then, and there was virtually no crime in our rural area, my parents figured we would do fine by ourselves until they returned the next morning. Of course, to my sister and I, it meant we could stay up as late as we wanted, watch scary movies, all the kid stuff you can't do with your parents around. At around midnight, I was in my Sister's room with her watching some movie on her TV, when we heard a loud CRASH from the living room. My first thought was that it was Charlie, playing another prank, by this felt different somehow. Charlie's noises were simply little bumps to remind you he was home. But this noise sounded violent, and angry. Before I could really react, we heard another loud crash, and another. My sister cautiously peeked out of her door, and down into the living room. I swear I saw her go white. She began trembling, and her hand covered her mouth. I peeked around her to see what she saw, and felt y blood run cold. We could just barely see two men, outside our from door. One of them was kicking it in. As we watched, a final smash from this man caused the door jam to give out, and they both entered our home, shining long flashlights all over. My sister and I crawled under her bed, and held each other tight. This was easily the most terrified I have ever felt. 

But as the two men began to go through the living room, another loud crash came from the kitchen. One of the cabinets had opened and slammed shut; a favorite trick of Charlie's. The man who seemed to be leading the show shined his flashlight into the kitchen and shouted ""Is there anyone in here?!?? If you are, you better come out now!! We will find you, and we will FUCK you up!!!!"". My sister and I had to cover our mouths to keep from screaming out loud. At the man's words though, Charlie apparently got angry. We heard another loud crash and a skittering of metal on the floor, as one of our silverware drawers apparently threw itself across the room. I heard one of the men say ""What.......the FUCK?!?!"". And then Charlie decided he was do e fucking around. All at once, every door, window, and cabinet in our home began opening and closing violently, and loudly. Small objects all over the house began to fling themselves into walls, across the floor, even at the intruders. At this point, the one in charge just yelled ""FUCK this"" and turned and ran out, his buddy close behind.

As soon as the men were out of the door, everything stopped, and the house was again silent. It was a long, long time before either my sister or myself finally worked up the courage to move. She had left her cell phone downstairs, and and she needed it to call the police and our parents. She began slowly creeping downstairs to get it, and since there was no way in hell I was being left alone, I followed. As we got to the bottom, I looked into the kitchen, and for just a moment, Charlie was standing there, exactly as I saw him before, with the same grin on his face. A moment later, he was gone.

The police arrived shortly, and my parents not far behind. The cops determined that the disorder in the home was caused by the robbers ransacking the place for valuables, and they must have been scared off by a passing car. Lucky for us. My sister and I didn't even try to tell them what really happened, and within thirty minutes, both men were caught, still fleeing. 

After that night, hearing Charlie's walk around my floor gave me a serene sense of security every night. When he played his little pranks, I would always look for him. And every now and then I would catch just a glimpse of him and smile.

Several years later, when I was a junior in high school, I was working on a school report at the local library. The topic was the history of our town, and I wanted to see if the library had any old news clippings that mentioned my family's ranch. I typed our address on the search bar, and the first result stopped me dead in my tracks. The date of the old article was July 17, 1936, and at the top was a picture of a man, about 5'8"", with dark hair and eyes. It was, unmistakably, Charlie. The title of the article read ""Local Man Murdered While Defending Daughter"". It seems the man we called Charlie was actually named Brian Davis. He had lived alone in the ranch with his only child, a daughter, after losing his wife to a bad case of the Flu. On the night of July 15, the article said, Mr. Davis was returning home from his job as an auto mechanic in town. When he pulled up to the house, he found the door had been forced open. He ran inside, and found a man on top of his daughter. The girl was sobbing, her dress had been ripped open, and the attacker held a knife to her throat. In a moment of sheer instinct, Mr. Davis threw himself at the intruder, tackling him of his daughter, and as he held the attacker, Mr. Davis yelled for the girl to run to the neighbors and call the police. The girl made it the mile and a half to the closest neighbor, who promptly called the sheriff. When deputies arrived, they were able to apprehend the attacker, who had been beaten half to death. Unfortunately, he had stabbed Mr. Davis three times in the chest. Brian Davis died right on our kitchen floor.",Charlie,88,nosleep

childrenofsamhain,9,,5,1rhdoj,,36,"My friend Jaime purchased a new home about six years ago when his wife was pregnant with their first child. Until recently, he lived there with his wife Claire and their two daughters, Sarah and Emily. Sarah is now five years old and Emily is three. Within the first two years living in the house, Jaime said that he never experienced anything out of the ordinary. It wasn't until his daughter Sarah was around two years old, that he started to notice she talked to herself. Jamie thought nothing of it, she was just learning to talk and he figured she was just entertaining herself. 

One afternoon when Claire was out at the grocery store, Jaime overheard his daughter in the upstairs hallway, whispering and giggling. Curious, he asked, ""Sweetie, who are you talking to?"" Sarah replied, 

""The woman standing in the hallway"".

""Is she your imaginary friend?""

""I guess."" 

Amused, he went upstairs to find her staring blankly at a wall, whispering quietly. ""What's your friends name?"" he asked her. 

""Her name is Helen Mary"", she said. 

""And what are you two whispering about?"" 

Sarah looked at him and paused before she piped ""I'm not supposed to tell you."" 

Suddenly the front door opened downstairs, and they heard Claire come through the door. Sarah rushed down the stairs to greet her. Jaime didn't think about that again for a few weeks. 

Over time, the two noticed that Sarah's interactions with ""Helen Mary"" became more frequent, but they attributed this to the fact that they had just given her the news that she was going to be a big sister. 

About two weeks before Claire gave birth to Emily, Jaime was at home alone with Sarah. He heard her playing upstairs, chatting away with her imaginary friend, when suddenly he heard glass breaking. He ran upstairs as quickly as possible to find his daughter standing in the hallway, holding a hammer. She was staring up at the wall of family pictures that were now smashed to pieces. There was glass everywhere. Jaime picked his daughter up and carried her down the stairs. He told her to stay put as he returned to the upstairs hallway to clean up the shattered fragments of their family portraits. When he returned to the living room, he asked her directly, ""Sweetie, why would you smash all of our family pictures?"" 

She looked at him, ""Helen Mary told me to do it.""

When Claire returned home that evening from her girls night with friends, Jaime told her about the incident. The crept up the stairs so as not to wake their daughter, so Claire could view the damage with her own eyes. She gasped silently at the sight. 

When they returned downstairs to the kitchen, they started to discuss possible explanations for her behavior. Suddenly, the color ran out of Claire's face and she looked at Jaime. ""There's no way she could have done that alone.""

""What?""

""There is no way she could have smashed all of those pictures by herself.""

Jaime was confused, ""I told you, I caught her with the hammer. She told me that she did it.""

But it wasn't until his wife said it aloud that it dawned on him, ""But… some of those pictures are almost five feet off the ground. How could she have reached those?""

His mind was racing, ""She must have moved a chair or something.""

She was adamant, ""There are no chairs upstairs that she is strong enough to move without you hearing it, and you would have seen her carry one upstairs, right?""

Jaime was silent. He didn't have an answer. 

They went to bed that night without any answers. The following morning their daughter had little recollection of smashing the pictures and Jamie wrote it off as sleepwalking. Though he didn't have much time to think about it, as two weeks later his second little girl was born.

Emily was two years old in the summer of 2012, and one afternoon, when Claire was at home alone with the girls, she heard Emily alone upstairs, whispering. She called up to her, ""Who you talking to, kiddo?""

""The woman standing in the hallway.""

Claire thought that her Sarah must have told her about her imaginary friend, and that she was simply trying to emulate her big sister. Then she spoke again.

""She doesn't like you, Mommy""

""Why doesn't she like me?"" Claire responded, surprised. 

""I don't know."" 

Suddenly her daughter came bounding down the stairs as if nothing had happened. Even though both Jaime and Claire both found this slightly creepy, nothing about the situation ever felt threatening or malevolent. Until one night last month.

Jaime had put the kids to sleep around eight o'clock in the evening and he and Claire had got into bed soon after. Exhausted, Jaime and his wife fell asleep extremely quickly. Jaime was awoken by the sound of screaming. He was disoriented and had no idea what time it was, but he could tell that it was his wife screaming right next to him. He turned to see what was wrong and saw it. His 3 year old daughter Emily, standing beside the bed, with a hammer in her hand. Blood poured from Claire's forehead. Jamie jumped out of bed and grabbed the hammer out of his daughters hand. He turned to his wife. She had stopped screaming now, and Jaime grabbed a towel from the bathroom and wiped the blood away from her face. She was going to be alright, but she did have a deep cut to her forehead. 

Jaime picked up his daughter and carried her out of the room. He went and checked on Sarah, who had awoken to the screaming but was clearly unharmed. He told her that everything was alright and closed her door. He was standing alone with his daughter in the upstairs hallway, and he finally asked her, ""Emily, why would you hurt Mommy?""

""She told me to, Daddy.""

""Who told you to?"" 

""The woman standing right behind you. She told me to hurt Mommy"" And then Jaime felt a chill run up his spine when his daughter leaned into his ear and whispered, ""And she told me to hurt you too, Daddy.""

There's nothing like a good scare. Every rush of adrenaline left me wanting more. That next fix got harder to find, took longer. I grew discerning, opinionated, a veteran of the genre. Soon I was writing for myself; days spent clacking the keys and nights spent in marathon research sessions. I was a crow picking through the maggots and gore for that next juicy nibble. I was a man consumed, and like a junkie messiah I wanted to share my high with others.

Everything has a basis in reality. Think about it. Why do the holy men think your soul needs saving? Why do children fear the dark? What's there in the unknown deep, what is it that averts our gaze?

That's why I'm here now. That's why I'm writing to you. I come bringing the ultimate high. All you have to do is believe. Believe in me, in the hellish nightmares that chase after you in your sleep, in the stories you read and the movies you watch. When you believe, the hunt is on.

That quote has seemed to have seeped into my brain. Multiple broken theories have been written down in my notebooks and journals and I've seemed to have come to a conclusion.

The mind isn't wrong. Reality is. And, with that, imagination often holds more truth than what we accept.

Think about it. When you were a small child, things like fairytales and horror stories were much more real to your innocent mind. In fact, there is a theory that children have a sixth sense that they gradually lose as they progress into adulthood. Also when you were a child, you thought of monsters and what they would do to you as well as how terrifying they looked.

And when you thought about these things, you didn't want to turn around. Why? Because what if for the slightest moment, you were right? All those lone yellow eyes in the darkness, the sinking feeling of being watched, out of all those times, what if this was the moment you were right? Or moreover what if you were always right and they just didn't want you to know... until now.

Because honestly, we used to think the Earth was flat. Then that it had the sun revolving around us. So what makes us so absolutely sure that we are the only ones out there now?

This is my theory.

I shared with one of my colleagues about two weeks ago and five days later she called me screaming about how there was something in her house. The police showed up and they took her to the hospital. She had three slash marks down her back, resembling that of almost a wolf. She also had multiple bruises on her neck. They said there was no signs of break in and the wrecking of the house was most likely the result of her having a psychotic episode.

This could be true, but I don't like how unsettlingly close it is to when I told her about my theory.

""You thought about it, and now, it is inside.""

This is the phrase that keeps me from imagining creatures. When I went to the hospital to visit her she was curled up in the bed, shaking with her knees up as close to her chest as possible. When I asked her what happened she wouldn't tell me who, only that 'it' got inside. She just had this empty look in her eyes, something very uncommon since she was always so hyper and nice. When I asked how she just said, ""I thought about it, and it came in.""

Keep in mind I never told her about the quote at all. Those were her own words. So this is more than unsettling for me. It may be possible that this 'theory' spooked her enough for all of this to happen, but I don't like the coincidences.

angelcot,3,,2,1rh91p,,11,"Hi /r/nosleep. This is kind of embarrassing to post, but here's a few stories of things that happened to me as a kid. I was a pretty anxious kid, and a lot of weird stuff happened to me. Nothing paranormal, though There's more than just these stories, but I thought I'd at least start with this.

Ever since I was a kid, I've been afraid of windows. That's not saying much, though. I was afraid of just about everything else, too. But growing up, my house was full of big windows. Floor-to-ceiling windows in the family room, two sliding glass doors in the dining room, a huge window that looked out from our kitchen into the front yard. My mom never bought curtains or blinds for any of the windows other than the ones in our bedrooms because she'd get depressed if it were too dark in our house. 

I had light blue curtains in my bedroom that my grandmother sewed for me since my windows were an irregular size. Every night I would pull them closed, then pin them down to the walls with a pushpin so that I wasn't able to see even a sliver of the outside out of the corner of my eye. My bedroom window looked out on the backyard. I remember being so irritated whenever someone would accidentally leave the back porch light on. The light would shine through my light blue curtains and play shadows on my wall. I'd cover my head with my pillow so that I could fall asleep without worrying if I would be able to make out the silhouette of someone trying to peer through my curtains, still pinned to the wall. 

From a young age, I had problems with insomnia. My mom struggled with it, too. I remember my dad telling me stories of when my parents were still married, when my mom would wake him up just to talk because she still wasn't asleep at 4, 5, 6 in the morning. I remembered feeling envious that I didn't have someone to do that to. I listened to books on tape at bedtime to fill the silence. Sometimes I would sneak into my brothers' room and lay on their floor, hoping for sleep to come. Being uncomfortably aware of how their curtains weren't drawn completely closed. 

When I was 10, I moved from my room- which overlooked the backyard- to my brothers' room, and my brothers separated and took over my room, and the office. My new room was at the front of the house. If my curtains were open, someone could easily look in as they walked up the path to our front door. During the day, I didn't mind it. I could watch for my friends or packages from the postman. At night, it made me so anxious I began to develop a habit of vomiting nightly. My mom was sympathetic, but didn't know what to do about it. A year later, I was moved back into my old room, and my older brother moved back into his. I stopped vomiting every night. 

I feel like I had a reason for being so afraid of windows. One night- I must have been about 6 or 7- I was up late, as usual, listening to *Ralph S. Mouse* on tape for the billionth time. I had emptied the glass of water that my mom had gotten for me, so I got up to refill it. I was already wary of windows, so I kept my head down on my way to the kitchen. I'd often see things out of the corner of my eye; something moving, or something that *could* have been the shadow of a human, but would later try to convince myself it was nothing.

Even with my head down, something outside caught my attention. A car, parked in front of my house. I lived at the very bottom of a cul-de-sac, so we didn't have a lot of people drive down our street at night and stop to reorient themselves. The car had its headlights on, and I could tell there was someone sitting in the car. Looking at my house. I don't know if they were looking at me, but my paranoia told me they were. I stood there for a long time, forgetting about my glass of water. I didn't look away. Paralyzed, until my mom came in the kitchen. She'd seen my door was open and wondered what I was doing up. When she noticed the car in front of our house, she quieted and gently pushed me out of the kitchen and back to my bedroom. I noticed the car started to drive away as I was ushered away from the window. 

This staring contest with the person in the car in front of my house happened twice more, although over the course of a few months. Once, they switched their headlights off, and stayed for what might have been 45 minutes. Although my memory might be exaggerating. I still don't understand why I was so afraid of seeing someone in my bedroom window, but how I could fearlessly stare out of the kitchen window at the person in the parked car. Maybe I felt less vulnerable in the kitchen. Maybe I was comforted by the fact that they were so far away. Even though the walk from where they parked was just a few seconds from my front door and the window I was looking out. 

The third and final time I saw the car, the person got out of their car. They were tall, and I could see them standing on the other side of their car but I still wasn't able to make out their face. When they started to walk around their car and- I assume- towards my front door, I scurried back to my bed. 

I never liked sleepovers as a kid. Staying over at a friends house meant laying awake on their floor for hours with nothing to listen to but the sound of their calm breathing. Nothing to look at except for the sliver of their window I could see from behind their curtains. Having friends at my house was just as stressful. Usually we'd sleep in the family room, because it had a TV in it. It also had the floor-to-ceiling windows. Usually I would sneak off to my own room after my friends had fallen asleep, so that I could sleep peacefully away from those big windows. 

When I was about 8 years old, I was having a sleepover with a few of my friends. It was after 10, so my friends were starting to fall asleep. I knew I still had *at least* two or three more hours of being wide awake. I was laying on the couch, swaddled in my blanket. The TV was still on, but I'd turned the volume down for my sleeping friends to something barely audible. Usually, I tried to keep my eyes away from the windows. But that night my cat caught my attention, meowing and hissing at something outside. I cautiously looked out the window, worried about what my cat might have seen out there. Just another cat, skittering in front of the window. Relieved, I looked out at my dark backyard. Was that it? 

There was a man in my backyard, walking around. Even with the distance, I distinctly remember he was frowning. He had his hands in his pockets. I did not know this man. 

I woke up one of my friends, whispering in her ear and telling her there was somebody in the backyard. She stirred quickly, obviously alarmed, and looked outside. She saw him too. I'm not sure if he felt our little eyes on him or what, but he turned to face us. Neither of us made a move; not to lay back down and pretend we were asleep, not even to look at each other, or look away. 

There were a pair of french doors that lead to the back patio in my family room, right in the middle of the wall of windows. The man walked up to the doors and tapped on one of the small window panes. The handle of what looked to be a heavy flashlight hung out of the pocket of his sweatshirt. He smiled at us. Not a deranged smile, not a smile that looked too wide for his face. Just a calm, warm smile. He mouthed something and pointed at the doorknob. I was never very good at reading lips. I stared straight ahead, unblinking, not responding. I could hear my friends' breath, heavy and shaking. 

He spoke, the sound of his voice muffled through the glass, ""Open the door."" A pause, he knit his eyebrows together like he was concerned. ""I'm visiting your parent. Let me in."" 

My heart was beating out of my chest. I was a paranoid enough little kid to not fall for this line. I mustered up every ounce of courage I had in my little, anxious, 8-year-old body, and got up off the couch. For a moment, they man at the door looked relieved. I ran out of the room, screaming for my mom. I could hear my friend call out at me that he was leaving, and the rest of my friends starting to stir. I told my mom what had happened. She turned on all the outside lights and called the police while my step-dad looked out every window for any signs of the man. All of the girls at my sleepover had their moms come over and pick them up. I cried, and stayed the night in my parents bed, although I'm pretty sure I didn't sleep.

In my mom's bathroom, there was a big window that looked out at the sideyard. The glass was distorted, though, so my mom never bothered putting a curtain over it. You couldn't see into the bathroom if you were just passing by the window. If you stopped to press your face against the glass, you could see in or out, but everyone in the house knew not to do that when they were in the sideyard. I remember my mom shrieking one night, running out of the bathroom, saying she'd seen something through the glass. A rat, climbing up the windowsill and staring into the bathroom.

I always liked my mom's shower more than the one in my bathroom. My bathroom didn't have a fan in it, so the whole bathroom would get uncomfortably humid. The shower curtain in my bathroom reminded me too much of that scene from *Psycho*, too, and I'd always shower with the shower curtain pulled open, and I'd get water all over the floor. My mom's shower had a glass door that I liked much more, even if there was that big window I could see clearly from the shower. 

Once when I was 12, I was showering in my mom's bathroom because my parents were out of town. My brothers were home, but were playing video games in the family room. I would keep my head down when I showered in my mom's bathroom. Even if the window's glass was hard to see through, it was still a window, and the shower was the most vulnerable place I could think of being looked at. Every once and a while, I would glance up to quell my growing anxiety. To tell myself *nothing was out there*. 

Cautiously, I looked up to satisfy my anxiety. *Nothing was out there*, I told myself. My gaze met the window. There was a dark figure pressed up against the glass. Through the foggy, wet shower door, I couldn't see anything. All I know was that it was *somebody*. I screamed, and ducked down past the tiles so that whoever was out there, they couldn't see me. A few moments later, I heard my brothers knocking at the door, both of them calling my name and asking if I was ok. I pulled a towel from outside the shower and wrapped myself up before I stood up. Whoever was out there was gone. 

A few weeks later, my friends and I were playing in the side yard. There was a huge tree out there that we liked to climb in, and pretend we were characters from X-Men or Sonic. My friend called my attention to something in the grass, over by the window of my mom's bathroom. A polaroid picture of the distorted glass of the window it lay in front of.  ",Windows.,13,nosleep
Spudz_OCD,6,,6,1rgcw5,,9,"Hey redditors, im new at this so excuse my writing skills

All through my life ive had things happen that i just couldn't explain, i've told a couple of friends but even they don't know what to say.

My story begins when i was a kid about the age of six or seven, we lived in a poor neighbourhood in southern Ireland and had a shithole of a house, i lived in a room with my two brothers (kyle[8-9  at the time], and Dylan[3-4]) and had been for a couple of years so i was used to sharing a room. The first incident occurred after about a year in the house (our street was built on a graveyard) and happenned in our room. it was an ordinary day before it happenned, woke up, ate breakfast, went to school, nothing out of the ordinary. however when i came home from school that day, there was something odd about the house, I couldn't quite tell what it was but it just felt wrong. But being a kid at the time, i thought nothing of it and carried on with my daily routine. after dinner and a shower my mom put us to bed. After my mom turned out the lights and left the room, i began to drift off to sleep. after about an hour and a half of hazy dreams, i was suddenly awoken by a loud crashing sound, kind of like if you dropped a frying pan, i quiclky jumped up my pillow and sat upright in bed. I looked over to Dylan's bed at the other side of the room, he ws still asleep. I began to question if i had actually heard it at all. feeling curious i checked if kyle was awake (we had a bunk-bed, Kyle was on top) as i was climbing the four step ladder, i felt a burst of cold air rush from kyles bed and immediately dropped to the ground, waking up Kyle.
""what are you doing"", he said.
""i heard a noise so i wanted to see if--""
""--sshh"", he stopped me mid sentance, and focused his gaze to the back of the room; The look on his face will be forever imprinted into my mind. I turned around gingerly and what i saw was scary enough to make me cringe even today. I saw a scrawny black figure hunched over Dylan, who was still asleep. But this figure was definately not human; It was at least 7 feet tall, it's head was overpoweringly large compared to it's beyond anorexic body. It's fingers were 6-7 inches long minimum. From what i saw it wore nothing, but it very well could have, as it was late at night and i was still half asleep. Then the image that will haunt me forever; It, whatever it was, turned towards me and Kyle. It just stood there, staring at us for what felt like forever, it then jumped towards us and simply vanished into thin air right before it hit me. I was left lying on the floor and Kyle was wondering if what we had just seen was actually real. I looked at him and back to Dylan's bed, whatever it as, when it jumped it jumped with enough force to push the blanket off the end of Dylan's bed. I looked back towards Kyle, who was already asleep again, and decided to go back to sleep myself, not knowing if what we'd seen that night was just a figment of our imagination or not.
When i woke up the following morning i hesitantly asked my mom and sister if they'd seen or heard anything last night..they didn't. So i questioned kyle about it and he said that he had no idea what i was on about, he had no memory of seeing or hearing anything, he didnt even remember me falling off the bunk ladder.
To this day i still cant quite figure out what happened that night.

My second experience was only four or five years ago, a couple of months after moving to Australia. We were living in a pretty old house at the time so it was a bit creaky and what not. it was a pretty average day when it happenned;I was 14 and I was once again in bed at the time. I was sharing a room with Dylan (10) at the time. Kyle (16) was in a room across the hallway, Jenny (12) was the next door down and my parent's room was at the end of the hallway. It was about 11-12 at night, and we were all just about asleep. My mom and step-father at the time were out exploring the wild clubs of Surfers Paradise, so it ws just us kids. I was almost asleep when i heard slight footsteps coming from the kithcen area. I wondered who it was considering we were all in bed, so i opened the door to check. I headed towards the kitchen, once i reached the living room (about half-way to kitchen from my room) i could see into the kitchen, i slowly emerged from the wall; no one there..weird, i thought, so i headed back to my room, but as soon as i turned around Kyle was standing right in front of me with a knife. I jumped quicker than i'd ever jumped before. Kyle then laughed his head off and went back to bed. I did the same without the laughing.. I was back in my room, now lying in bed realising im too awake to go back to sleep. i just lay there for about five minutes staring at the ceiling untill i heard more footsteps in the kitchen. I called out
""Kyle, go to bed, idiot""
""i am you fuckwit"", he said as he emerged from his room half asleep
""well then who's upstairs?"" i asked
""It's probably just a possum in the attic or something don't worry""
I regretfully closed the door and went back to bed. But as soon as i did, loud heavy footsteps started making their way down the hallway, along with heavy thumping on the walls, they were getting closer and a hell of a lot louder, It sounded like someone was trying to stomp and bash rats out of the walls and floor. It kept coming closer and increasing in volume until it was at the point where it was like gunshots right outside my room. It then stomped right outside my door and my door swung open with extreme noise and force and standing at the door was, i shit you not, the same tall, black scrawny fucked up figure that i saw years ago. I practically shat myself. It stood there for a couple of seconds, but if felts like hours, then started stomping and sprinted towards my moms room. I don't know why but i instantly got up and ran towards the door and looked towards my moms room; nothing there, it vanished again. I dropped to the ground in shock, just as Kyle open his door and screamed ""WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT"" 
""It's back"" ,i said
""What's back?""
""the thing i saw hunched over Dylan""
I stayed up all night that night not wanting to sleep knowing that thing followed us to Australia

My most recent encounter with our old friend was last year. We'd moved into an old complex of houses that had a bit of a history in the crime side of things. We'd been living there for about 6 months and my friend from primary school, Jordan, was now living in the complex too. It was around 5PM and it was just Jordan Kyle and I in the house. I was playing my i-pod at the time, Kyle was in the kitchen and Jordan was behind me. Kyle decided to pick up a coin and throw it at an unsuspecting Jordan, who surprisingly, caught it, and returned fire. but then Jordan moved a little backwards and Kyle threw it further and harder. The coin flew through the air right past my head and stopped rigth in front of Jordans face, IT LITERALLY STOPPED IN MID AIR, it stood still in front of his face for less than a second and then was propelled back towards Kyle with nearly twice the force. We all just stood there speechless, not knowing if that had really just happened. Later that day we were showing a friend what had happened  and were back in the Kitchen messing around with coins to see if it would happen again. When suddenly a ball flew through the air at Kyle, like it had been thrown with force from the stairs leading upstairs. For the second time that day we were utterly speechless and had no idea what to do.
That night after Jordan had left and Kyle went to bed, i was making a late night snack. Dylan was in the living room watching TV and there was nobody else in the house. I finished making the snack and was about to head into the living room when in the corner of my eye, I saw the figure that i had seen twice before glide upstairs; same height, same scrawniness, same long fingers only this time it was a little misty, like a shadow, and it looked right into my eyes as it vanished upstairs.
I am still wondering what the actual fuck that figure is, all i know is that my mother has become a claire-voyant.I know for a fact that there is definately going to be a lot more of this thing which i have nicknamed ""the figure"".

For the time being i will keep an eye out for my little follower and if i see him/her again i will not hesitate to report the time, date, and details of the situation and of course reddit the fuck out of it.
for now redditors, i bid you farewell

the_dark_half,5,,1,1rhyj5,,7,"You know that feeling when you’re all alone and hear your name whispered? Maybe you’ve walked into a room only to suddenly feel a sudden temperature drop? Had things go missing only to re-appear in odd places? Maybe you’re like me and you lie in bed at night, only to feel like someone stroking your hair but when you become fully conscious and turn around, nothing. 
Think you walk through a cobweb or hair falls on your arms or neck and brushes against your skin delicately, tickling you? You check and nothing was there? I’m sure your parents tell you it’s nothing from a young age; perhaps because they themselves are deluded enough to believe that it is their imagination. They probably deep down fear it’s a ghost or apparition. Even they couldn’t know how much worse it really is.  Stop deluding yourself. It’s not a cobweb. It’s not the wind. It’s not nothing. It’s something far more sinister, an insidious force which slowly grows stronger the more you feed it your fear and attention. 

Some of you, I’m sure, will be fortunate enough only to feel cold spots and occasionally hear creaks and footsteps in your house. It’s such a common occurrence that people barely notice it and if they do, it’s the spookiest part of a generic horror movie, because those suits in Hollywood haven’t seen what these creatures are really capable of. If you believe in the paranormal you may experience the whispers of what I can only loosely refer to as their ‘voices’. I’m sure not many of you have had the misfortune to awaken to them standing over your bed, taking the forms of whatever creatures or person your subconscious fears most because it’s real form is so terrifying you’d probably die instantly or become paralysed with fear, a zombie-esque state you’ll never awaken from-and that would ruin their fun too early. If you don’t die instantly, seeing their faces will make your eyes bleed; hearing their voices unrestrained will shatter your ear drums and I’ve heard of cases where insides have been liquefied, skin melting and bleeding seeping out of every pore.

The first time I awoke to one in my room with me, it was after I’d given the footsteps and banging on the walls attention. I had thought it was cool, I even bought a stupid Ouija board and told them it was okay for them to try and talk to me. I had been lying in bed after a night of drinking so I passed off the initial taunts and laughs as nothing more than my intoxicated imagination, until my door slowly opened and in came one large hairy leg, followed by more spindly legs, followed by many eyes and two huge fucking fangs. Yep, a giant spider, bigger than a horse came into my room. I tried to scream, but that just resulted with me hyperventilating, then vomiting all over the floor. It strode in, all beady eyes on me and as it slinked atop my bed I tried to pathetically crawl away, but it held me down with its two front legs, piercing into the flesh of my shoulders as I whimpered like a small animal about to be devoured-which I was.  I felt the sharp pain of its fangs tear through my skin and inject me with poison that made my blood burn. I lay in bed, delirious, desperate, muttering for help. My ears were greeted with a cacophony of voices, screaming horrible things that were so foul that before that night had been unimaginable to me. I passed out shortly after, from fear, blood loss or the venom and awoke a few days later, believing to have all been a dream. I clung to that hope until I stepped outside my bedroom door and found dozens of small animals, birds mostly, wrapped up in what appeared to be spider’s webs, discoloured, drained of their blood and insides. All dead. I ran to the bathroom to throw up and caught sight of myself, dried blood caked on my body and face, puncture wounds all over me and strands of silky web still wrapped around my breasts, my stomach, my legs and in my hair. 

The second night I encountered one of them, they took the form of my uncle. I lived with my uncle for nearly 5 years while my father was travelling almost every week for business. I know my father loved me and desperately needed the money that he had to work from dawn until way after the sun set and had to leave me for long periods. He didn’t know what his brother did to me. That night as I became increasingly aware of the noises in my apartment and the feelings of someone touching me and whispering in my ear, I rolled over to see my uncle grinning at me. He crawled onto the bed and tied me down. I struggled, but when I did he beat me with his belt, like he had started doing when I was eight years old. I fought as hard as I could, tears burning my eyes and sobbing uncontrollably, but he kept cutting away at my clothes with a pocket knife and telling me to be a good girl. The torture that night lasted for many hours, possibly days. I try not to remember it. I thought I had moved on from those childhood years and buried them a few years ago, when my uncle died. This was not the last time the monsters took on forms like this to break me. They’ve only grown stronger with every drop of blood, with every scream and with every hopeless sob I’ve given them.

Their true form will only appear to you in dreams at first because they get to torment you in ways that won’t instantaneously butcher you or drive you insane, yet; they like to take their time with their toys. The dreams for me started after those incidents. I have seen what those beings really look like and…just thinking about it is enough for me to start violently shaking, unable to stop retching. The other day I wasn’t careful and thought about one of them and a stranger had to hold me back as I unconsciously started walking in front of a train. In my dreams, it is pure hell as they have my undivided attention for hours and can do whatever they want to me without my body breaking and bending the way it would in the waking world, but it all feels real. 
Part of me stares at length of rope on my coffee table and considers leaving this torment…but what if when I die, I get sent to their realm, to be their plaything forever? 

It’s not just the occasional brush against my skin, the odd floor creak and the rare moment of ‘is someone calling my name?’ Now I feel them on me at all times, their rough, sharp skin cutting mine, scratching me, violating every single part of my body. Their voices scream and howl at me, maniacally taunting and laughing at my never-ending misery. Even when I shut my eyes, I still see them, their hideous beings beyond any words the human language has to describe them to you. 

Most of you think of those household noises and strange occurrences as the work of ghosts, of spirits. Yes, it is so comforting for humans to believe these presences are the souls of dead people who are just sad and wandering, isn’t it? You want to be able to talk to someone no longer alive; you open your mind and let them in. Don’t. What’s out there isn’t human, it isn’t some person with unfinished business, what’s out there wants you to think that, to get comfortable with inviting it in and letting yourself become aware of it. 

Did you just hear that faint noise outside your window, like a soft breeze carrying a faint whisper? That creak outside your room? That faint sensation on your flesh? I hope not, because now you know what’s really there and they’ve always known about you.",Don't give them attention.,8,nosleep
Rhapsodeyus,1,,0,1rgtyq,,8,"Some may recall a story I posted a few months back, about shadow-like figures who visited me on a mission for knowledge, and afterwards, disappeared like ghosts. For those who do not recall, the story is [Curious Visitors](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l4dv2/curious_visitors/).

If you have not read that, well, you probably haven't missed much, but it will help with the backstory for this one if you do read it.

Done reading? Good, let's continue.

This happened last night, Sunday, November 24th, 2013. I woke up at precisely 4:27 AM, and I know this because I watched my small digital alarm clock on my bedside table flip to 4:27 AM as my eyes opened. I also noticed that my lamp was off (I sleep with the light on for safety reasons, since living with cats can be hazardous). However, I could see my plain, black clock in a pale blueish light.

My brain clicked. ""My laptop is on. I must have left it on and the power went out, so it's running on battery."" Then I remembered, quite clearly, turning it off and closing it before going to bed. That's when I felt a weight at the end of my bed, sitting in front of my laptop.

I sat up, looked, and spotted a shadowy figure sitting in front of my laptop. The NoSleep submission form was up. I coughed, and said quietly, ""You could have asked."" Instead of, say, a sudden spin and a glare from Brarger, as I expected, my visitor vanished instantly.

I didn't expect that, and it startled me thoroughly. My previous visitors would never have been so rude, and certainly would have asked my permission to access my personal computer. I shifted, tossed the covers aside, and moved to the end of the bed, to read what it had written.

I now wish I hadn't.

JUVIE_MAKER,2,,1,1rhq9j,,8,"I have a nose for things. No seriously, all my life I’ve had a very strong sense of smell and I don’t mean for the average person. I have an abnormally, freakishly, ridiculously, absurd sense of smell. It’s been that way since I was a kid. Here’s a prime example, when I was about four or five I used to visit my grandmother (god rest her soul) every month in Daytona Beach for the summer. My grandmother was notorious for making the best homemade cakes in the neighborhood. I would always leave my Gran’s house at least ten pounds heavier each summer after gorging myself on her delicious treats. One Saturday, after a day of playing outside (when kids used to play outside!) I instantly smelled the aroma of cake wafting through the air, but something was…..off. There was another smell lingering behind the cake scent. It was kinda tangy, bitter, sorta nutty …just all around unpleasant. Being so young, I couldn’t quite put my finger on what the smell was but I knew I didn’t like it. Then out comes my Gran from the kitchen with a big slice of her freshly made cake on a china plate. She passes the dining room table and spots me standing there with my nose crinkled up in disgust.

Gran:  What’s the matter baby? Come sit at the table and have a slice of cake.

Five year old me: I aint eating that cake, it smells funny!

(Let me just interject for a second.  Now if your family is old school like mine, you know that a child is to NEVER disrespect an elder’s cooking! Especially if that elder is a family member, you just don’t do it! That is unless you want a black eye, ribs broken, missing teeth… you get the picture.)

Gran: Girl, get your hind parts over here and eat this cake before I slap the hell out of you!!

Oh geez…there’s that tone. You know it, you know it well. That angry deep tone that resonates from parents when their truly pissed off. You know… that voice that scares the living shit out of you and gives you’re delicate child-like mind nightmares for a month (or your whole life). Yeah that’s what I was hearing right about then. But still I was adamant. I would not eat that damn cake. That smell! It was just too potent. Now, you might be thinking, what’s the big deal? Surely you’ve smelled worse things than that cake before, which is very true. At that point in my life I’d smelled worse things before (WAY WORSE) but I’d never been subjected to eat those things either. Also, the stench of that pastry….it was just… so very not right. I was only a child but I was still old enough to know right from wrong, and that cake was definitely wrong! Even at that very moment I could taste its bitterness in the back of my mouth. With every inhale it burned and tingled down my throat.

Gran: Come over here and take this plate now!

Okay at this point I knew I was in REAL trouble. Even if my grandmother didn’t kill me, I was pretty sure I was in for the ass whooping of my life! I slowly started to back away from Gran as she moved closer to me with that dreaded cake. Even as she inched towards me that smell seem too magnify. With every step she took it grew more and more intense! “Girl, you better take this cake!” she yelled holding the plate out in front of her. I turned to run but she quickly snatched up my arm before I could get away. “No!” I shouted feverishly trying to pull away from her grip, “I don’t want the cake, granny!!” but my pleas of desperation came to no avail. My grandmother started to tug me towards the kitchen table, her fingers angrily wrapped around my tiny forearm. Suddenly, she yanked me forward making my body jump about two feet in her direction, tilting my face towards hers. She looked down at me with an awful glare. Dark hollow eyes glowered down from Gran’s wrinkled sockets. Her once loving face was now rigid and stiff with a sadistic expression that I had by no means seen before. “You will eat this cake!” She shouted through gritted teeth. “Even if I have to shove it down your throat piece by piece!” 

I had never seen this side to my Gran before. My once sweet, devoted granny had turned into this vicious monster plucked straight out of my worst nightmares. My small frame quaked in fear and tears began to seep from my eyes. I had never known terror like this. My insides loosened and squirmed like jelly making the contents of my bladder empty and leak down my legs. To say I was afraid would be the understatement of the freakin decade! But you know what? There was something else I was more fearful of. Even as I pissed myself in sheer horror from the presence of my devil-like grandmother, there was still something more bloodcurdling, more utterly terrifying than her…that fucking cake! 

“NO!!!!!!!” echoed from my lips in a banshee scream and with all the strength I possessed I juggernauted into my grandmother. My body throttled into her torso head first making a loud solid grunt bellow from the old woman. Her arms flew in the air (letting me go in the same instance) and her vast body collapsed backwards before suddenly….CRACK!
The sound of my grandmother’s head crashing along the rim of her kitchen table splintered throughout the house. Gran thudded to the ground like a sack of potatoes and the plate with the cake she so firmly held onto shattered on the floor. I stared at her lifeless body as blood began to seep through her head and flow on the linoleum. I was still too little to know the true meaning of life and death but I did know for sure that red liquid was not suppose to be running out of her head like that. I bent down and looked into Gran’s half opened eyes. They weren’t black any more. They’d gone back to their normal brown again. Not really knowing what to do I just stared down at the gruesomeness of it all, watching the chunks of yellow cake absorb the blood until each piece was just as red. 

To make a long story short the police were eventually called. My Gran’s weekly bridge game was on that day and a couple of her elder counterparts found her body, and me sitting in a pool of piss and blood staring at it. Needless to say there were lots of screams. Oh, and you’re probably wondering what that smell was, right? I actually didn’t find out until I was well into my teens what exactly it was. I was pouring it into my foster parent’s coffee one morning when it finally hit me…Cyanide. From the smell of it, Gran probably couldn’t have used too much either. Maybe half a teaspoon, give or take; totally undetectable to the average person’s nose…but not to mine. “So that’s what that was, go figure”.  I remember thinking that to myself as I stirred the cyanide into two mugs. My foster parents passed away later on that day, I wish I could say I feel sadness over it but I really don’t.  I was more consumed with thoughts on why my grandmother was trying to kill me? Was it because of what I’d done to Oscar, her cute little Maltese? I mean, if I’d known the oven wasn’t a suitable place to put a dog I might have done things differently. I was only two at the time. Or perhaps it had something to do with what happened with Mommy…that really was unfortunate. I didn’t want to hurt her, but she was an obstacle that just had to be removed. 

But anyways, that’s neither here nor there. I’m an adult now and those days are long behind me. I’m actually on my way to my boyfriend’s…excuse me….ex-boyfriend’s apartment right now. I’m visiting him and that slut he cheated on me with. And guess what? They just had a baby, isn’t that the sweetest thing.  ",A nose for things...,9,nosleep
1234FUCK,7,,4,1rhjmk,,6,"So my uncle has always been into the paranormal and he got me into paranormal investigation, Or ghost hunting to simplify it a few years back. Well I go with him on a lot of them and we do it for free for people who think something paranormal is going on in their houses. I always saw it as a nice little hobby to do on the weekends to blow of some time and I always liked being scared. I mean that’s how I even know about this sub-reddit because I like reading it. And that’s one of the only reasons I knew about what had happened on my last investigation. 


	We got a call from a family out in the middle of the country saying they had begun hearing weird voices when they were each alone but the 16 year old son was the one who had it happen the most. I went through every scenario I could think on the way there, Something was legitimately going on that was paranormal, one of the kids was lying and was fucking with the rest of the family and other such things. Well when we got there we talked with the family and everyone seemed happy except the two children. The son was as I said earlier 16 and the girl was 14, they seemed uneasy looking off into corners and such. I took a note about it but didn’t dwell on it that much. We went around the house marking places we would put cameras and getting the lay out of the house. Once we finished that we went back to our van and started getting ready. After we set up all of our equipment we each got our POV (Point of view) cameras strapped on and started our investigation. My Uncle took the upstairs, our colleague took the first floor, And I went into the basement to do a little investigating of my own. 


I made my way downstairs and grabbed my Walky-talky and radioed my uncle asking if everyone was ready for me to hit the main light breaker. He gave me the go ahead and I flipped the little switch plunging the whole house into darkness I held up the other camera I had with me so I could have a camera move around freely ( plus it had a night vision setting so I could see where I was going.) Well I turned it on and walked slowly to the chair I had placed in the room so I could sit comfortably waiting for something to happen. And after an hour or so of me questioning the darkness.. It answered back.
My instincts kicked in and I put a call in on the radio for everyone to tell me where they were. And everyone was exactly where they said they were supposed to be. My heart froze in my throat from fear but excitement so I stood and asked who I was talking to and I heard a small wispy chuckle before it said softly “You know who I am.” I swallowed hard before continuing to walk around the room and asking questions. It stayed silent for a few questions before I asked why it was here. It chuckled again before I heard a small sound. Like a door knob jiggling and I turned towards it. My camera landed on a door knob sticking out from a sheet that I guess had covered it before. I walked towards it slowly pulling the sheet off to reveal a shabby door about waist height with peeling paint and scratch marks.  I put in a call on the radio telling my uncle and the others I had found something and for them to meet me in the basement. I got no answer back but I assumed they had gotten the message. My uncle did that a lot; he tended to get over excited with these things so I figured he was just trying to get here as fast as possible.  But the paranormal curiosity ran in the family so I reached down and grabbed the knob, it was warm as if someone had been holding it for a longtime. I steadied myself before twisting it and pushing it open. 


I looked through my camera screen as I walked into the door. The atmosphere around me seemed to change instantly, even though all the lights in the house was off it just seemed to be darker and colder in here the basement itself.  I looked around in the room through the screen until I saw a lone chair in the center of the room. I walked forward until I was right next to it and then began looking around more. I jumped a bit at the bright light on my screen until I noticed it was a mirror. It was bolted onto a beam  next to the chair and when I looked to the left I noticed the same thing. I thought it was really strange so I walked around the front of the chair and accidentally kicked something over.  It was loud and then I heard a sound of rushing water. My heart leapt into my throat as I looked down and around looking for the source until my camera came upon a metal bucket slightly rolling with water coming out. I also saw a candle and a small match book and that’s when it hit me. My whole body filled with fear as the realization flooded my head…. This was a “three kings” set up.


 I turned towards the door pointing the camera as I looked through it I saw the door slam and I stopped. My whole body froze from pure terror and it took me a few seconds before I let out a scream for help. After I stopped I heard the soft chuckle come from behind me in the darkness and I just stood there with my eyes closed shaking as I felt a soft breath on the back of my neck I heard a voice.. My voice whisper right into my ear. “ Do you know who I am now?” I stood there for a second before screaming again and then I heard the door bust open and I saw flash lights on me and my uncle asking what was wrong. I just ran from the room to the breaker box and flipped on all the lights. I then sank to the floor looking at him as he sat next to me and asked all that happened. I just held out my camera to him and he took it. Before he watched it he asked me why I didn’t call for back up and I looked at him before telling him that I did. He looked at our colleague before watching the recording.


 After that he asked me if we all went in together would I go back in. I nodded as long as we kept the lights on and we went in. and it was as I thought. It was a set up for “ The three kings.” I shuddered as I turned to my uncle asking if he knew what it was. He didn’t so I explained it to him and I pointed to the bucket “ and it has been used recently. The bucket was full of water. “ My uncle nodded to me and put a wrap on the investigation. We went back home and I have decided to type this up. Tomorrow we will be going and talking to the family about what happened and who had done the three kings in the house.  


I think the three kings set up has something to do with what has been happening at the house. I will update you all on what happens after we talk to them.

OsamaBinHiding,3,,1,1rhxdo,,6,"Last night was like every other night for me. Have dinner on my own in my small, yet cost flat and watch a little bit of TV. Around 9 or 10 o'clock, I start to crack on with some work as I had a university deadline in a couple days time. The minutes started going faster and before I knew it it was 12 o""clock. 

""Where did the time go?"" I thought. It had only felt like a few minutes. However, this was a normal occurrence for me. The world kind of, disappears when I get lost in a train of thought and for the life of me, I can't break out of it.

I had just remembered that I had a seminar early in the morning and suddenly thought ""Fuck, I better try and get some sleep"" 

See, I live in an old building that has been converted into flats in the suburbs of a major city. So it isn't uncommon to hear floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and all the walls are very thin so noises in the middle of the night just tend to go over my head. I wouldn't consider myself someone who doesn't get scared easily but when you're familiar with floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and branches tapping your window - you tend to grow some thick skin.

Last night wasn't like any other night in my flat though. 

As I mentioned earlier, I was alone. My flatmate - let's call him, Evan for the sake of the story, was away celebrating thanksgiving with his family but he's away a lot so I'm used to spending a long period of time on my own. My usual night routine of showering, brushing my teeth and cleaning the kitchen was over and I went into my room to finally rest my head for the night and that was when I first noticed something. My drawers were all pulled open. 

To most people, this is probably nothing - but for me it wasn't normal. I suffer from borderline OCD and everything, especially in my room needs to be in order and I remember waking up and everything was in order. I hadn't left my flat today either. 

""I'm too tired for this shit"" I thought and went to bed. 

It's weird though isn't it? That something like a mattress and a duvet can make you feel so safe, like nothing can hurt you. I remember being a child and I made sure none of my limbs were outside of my bed incase something grabbed me in the middle of the night. Such a feeble piece of furniture can make you feel so safe.

Well, not anymore for me. Last night I heard the usual creaking of the floorboards - no biggy, right? However, as I drew closer to conscientious, I realised that these creaking sounds weren't coming from the surrounding walls and neighbouring flats but they were coming from under my bed.

And that's when I felt the unmistakable sensation of a cold, coarse finger stroking mine over the side of my bed.

TaylorBonaseraSr,0,,2,1rhb2e,,5,"I can explain why I'm so afraid of mirrors, or anything that could reflect light, even a glass door. It's so difficult for me to talk about it sometimes, but other times I feel her pressing me on to tell as many people about her as possible. She broke my mirror the first time, just crashed right through the glass and shattered the glass into a literal hundred pieces. It was such a pain to have to clean all that up. I got at least five cuts. But she didn't care. At the very least she didn't laugh at me or yell at me to clean faster. At least she was nice enough to check herself for that. Anyway, I got my mirror replaced. She didn't break the bathroom mirror again, but she broke the great mirror in the hallway while she was running through it. I don't understand how she did it, it's pressed up right against the wall. She'd have to ram her body sideways. She didn't even have any visible cuts. She told me she was sorry, and that she would try not to do it again. I believed her, and she was true to her word. But soon enough, I hear the crashing again. But this time it's my door. The majority of my glass door has been smashed through, but the weird thing is that the hole is shaped like Quasimodo. No one lives here that has a body shaped like that. The other times I checked her she didn't have any cuts on her, but this time she was bleeding so much from every part of her body that she had to go to the hospital. I had to sit there and watch her, but she couldn't explain what had happened. When the doctor asked, neither could I, because I hadn't been there. It's strange how selective she is; she won't smash into anything except mirrors or glass-looking things. Anywhere there isn't this kind of stuff, nothing bad happens. She tells me that she feels so cold whenever she walks by something like that, and she gets an uncontrollable urge to destroy it. She talks to me about it so often I feel like I'm beginning to share the feeling.

It's starting to unnerve me, and I don't want to live with her anymore. But I can't break the joint liability contract. She told me to cover all the things in the house that could possibly create a reflection, so I did. But I find her desperately tearing off the covers when she thinks I'm not looking.

One day I'd had enough so I decided to take off one of the covers in my room. It couldn't hurt, just for a little while when she couldn't see. She wouldn't notice. But after a minute of reveling in my refreshed reflection, I saw her standing there. So close. She was so ugly. She copied my expression and mocked my horrified face. She followed me here, to my own room. I couldn't turn around. There was no point. I felt a pressure from her on my shoulders so great I couldn't keep a straight posture. She was laughing at me.

But I'd heard that laugh somewhere before. And I'd seen that face before too. It looked so much like my own. She must have heard my thoughts, because she said she told me to never look at her by means of a reflection. I couldn't stand the sight of her face anymore, it was so scary. It'd been such a long time since I'd spent so many minutes just staring at her. I had to take control. So I bashed the bedroom mirror in, balling my bare hands into fists and repeatedly thrashing until I could feel the glass cutting into my skin.

It'd been so long since I'd last done that. Now every time I look, I can see her, feel her, I see her staring at her...our...reflection, through my eyes.",My Blank Mirror,7,nosleep
SeaDweller7,2,,2,1rhilw,,4,"I go to a regular school, its kindergarten to year twelve, so its pretty big. But, my school is an old public school, and the principle is ancient. Me? I am in year twelve, and I’m graduating next year, and my friends said I should share this story with you guys. 

Ok, where to start? Well, at my school we have a pretty serious problem with bullies, and when I say serious I mean it. One year our school was even on the news, but it was pretty traumatic. When I was in year nine, there was this little girl in fifth grade, called Melody. Her and me sort of talked sometimes, as she was a new girl and I was her school buddy (to show her around and stuff) She was a sort of short, curly brown haired, blue eyed and geeky girl. Glasses and all of that stuff, so your stereotypical nerd. Which pretty much was what she was.

After I moved up in to Tenth grade it was pretty clear that she was being bullied. Instead of gossiping or playing with the other girls, she just sort of walked around the school... bouncing a tennis ball and wandering around the grounds of the school. 

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

Then, half way through the year, school was stopped. During lunch they lined us up and called our parents. Sent us home. They just said there was an accident. My mother and father lived in Melbourne and I lived with my uncle and aunty, and they’re pretty laid back and all ‘come home when you feel’ so I stayed at school.

I saw five year six girls with that sort of ‘we know nothing it wasn’t us we didn’t do anything’ look on their face before I saw an ambulance and a white body bag. Out of the end of the body bag stuck out locks of curly brown hair, and the always-screeching birds seemed to sing a sweet tune. A melody.

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

Last week we had a substitute teacher who started screaming at a girl who was outside bouncing her ball after the end of lunch bell had rung. She didn’t realise Melody wouldn’t listen. 

No one knew why the back stairs from German were out of bounds for two months, and why the German teacher quit. No one asked why those five girls we’re stared at my Melody’s sort of... ghost.

I pieced it together. A simple push, a simple tumble. A simple death.

No one cares, all the kids just skip past her, all the laughter swallows up her silence. 

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

It has been a little over a year since I last wrote - just over a year since the last nightmare.  I was foolish to think I was somehow cured, that, as Dr. Lough suggested, getting it out of my head and into a journal would help.

I read back over my last and only journal entry, as I tried to describe the nightmare.  It is so chaotic and scattered, yet I'm unable to find any other way to convey the details.  That is the terror of the dream at its core - utterly chaotic.  Jerking from one sensation to the next, the hesitant probing of my fingers as they cover the smooth flesh where my eyes should be, to the damp defeat in realizing those fingers have torn away the protective lids in confusion.  All of this, in layers of sleep - waking to the comfort of my mother's figure, only to then know it is just another stage of the dream playing out, with her eerie voice echoing through my body:

""You're connected now.""

Even now, in understanding that my last entry seemed to bleed out through the pages, I'm struggling to form coherent thoughts onto this paper.  Each detail seems to tie into the next, only to fall apart when I try to see the whole.  I wonder what type of clinical association Dr. Lough could make?  Is this what schizophrenia feels like?  I have no way to explain it.  It is as though there is a novelist's grand plot line swirling around my body in paper shreds and each time I reach out I can snatch only a sliver of a scene, unable to ever piece the parts into an understanding.  I'm fairly certain this entry, and perhaps any subsequent entries, will be just as erratic.  I just cannot force these thoughts together.

So much has changed in the last year, it is so hard to recall my state of mind the last time the nightmare came to me.  I have a son now, nearly 6 months old.  We must have just found out Rachel was pregnant around the time I last wrote.  Could that have been a factor in the nightmare returning after years of peace?  Was my mind so overwhelmed with the thought of being a father, the changes to my life, the responsibility, it somehow dredged that old horror back from my subconscious?  I can't help but think it must have played a role.  It has been a blur, so many other things seem to have fallen into place.  Though they are exciting, it seems predetermined, somehow rushed.

Over the last decade I have had a slight obsession with the home I grew up in.  I knew I would live there once again - returning it to ownership in my family - though I never anticipated it would happen so quickly.  Rachel's grandmother died, leaving her an inheritance that allowed us to leap forward several years in our plans together.  It was Christmas Day, the day she died - I guess her last gift to us.  Three months after my son was born, we were moving back into the mountains, back to the walls I had called home as a boy.  

One thing I feel for certain, this home is the source.  The nightmare started here, always took place here, was always fueled here.  I'm beginning to remember things, or have recurrent thoughts I have not had for nearly two decades.  It is as though these things are unlocked from muscle memory as I walk this house.

As a child I would reach the top of the second floor staircase, which opened onto a hallway, always with my head down staring at my feet.  Left, at the end of a long hallway was a guest room.  Large floor to ceiling windows would reflect back a warped view of the person looking down to them.  Right, across a short landing was my bedroom.  I had trained myself to never look left at night - as the small nightlight by my bedroom door would throw twisted shadows onto my reflection in the long guest room windows.  If I would look up, I would become stuck in fear with the reflection.  The windows seemed to pulse with my heartbeat, flexing my body larger then smaller in the glass.  My feet became rooted in place, the black of the windows and the emptiness behind them tunneling out for me.  The nightlight would flicker in then out, each time causing my shape to jump forward, as though I were being pulled down the hallway towards the darkness.  I never remembered breaking loose, turning and walking back to my bedroom and going to sleep.  I would wake up in my bed hours later, staring at my hands, inspecting for blood and knowing I just had the nightmare. 

I learned, I kept my head down and did not look to the left.

Our first night in the home, that muscle memory followed suit.  After turning off the main floor lights, I climbed the staircase.  My son was sleeping against my chest, his arms wrapped around my neck and shoulder.  My head was down as I crested the top step, turning to the right, towards my room which was now his.  As I neared the bedroom door, his forehead left my shoulder.  His back straightened and his arm peeled away from my neck.  I felt his arm extend straight back behind my head.  I didn't need to look at his eyes, I knew.  Those eyes followed his arm to his hand, reaching down the hallway to the windows.  The nightlight flickered as he let out a giggle.  I took the last step into his bedroom and shut the door.

Sunny day in Nevada. Families having lunch outside, fathers teaching their sons how to grill steak, playgrounds
filled with kids. Every year I plan a trip with my son. Nevada has really nice caves in it. When I was little,
my father always took me there and so did his father. I didn't want to break this chain. I told Jake, my son, about that
cave that I used to visit but I did not have enough time to take him there until now. He was still sleeping when
I stepped in his room.
""Honey wake up!"" Jake opened his little eyes and whispered:
""What?""

""We are going to see the cave I told you about!"" he instantly jumped out of his bed and become so excited that
I can't even tell about it. He got dressed and ran to have something to eat. About five minutes later he was screaming
from the garage door.
""Hurry up mom!""

One hour car ride. Not the longest one he ever had. He kept asking me about the place. I just smiled and told him to
be patient. As soon as I parked the car, he blasted out the door and ran to the back of the car to grab two flashlights. 
""You ready?"" I asked him. He obviously was so we started walking towards our destination.
It was dark in there. Darker than anywhere else. Flashlights on.  He just kept pushing forward. Sometimes I couldn't 
even catch up with that little kid. After a sharp left turn I saw him standing there. He found it. The biggest hall 
in the cave. Every wall was shining when the light of our flashlights reached them.
""Beautiful isn't it?""

""It is indeed!"" he answered. He turned his head towards me but it was only q light at a corner 
that he could see. He totally crapped himself. ""Mommy wait for me!"" He started running towards the light 
that he could see. It is a maze down there. - MOM! - he screamed.
""I'm here honey!"" He caught up with me. He just gasped there and started to be a bit relieved as he realized 
that he was not alone in that dark cave again.
""Hey calm down little boy! I'm not leaving you here!"" went closer to him and whispered:  ""Or am I ?

I've been having a lot of bad dreams for the past 3 weeks, but i think this one tops all of them. Anyhow, I dreamt that I lived with my boyfriend in a big house, it was night and we both were sleeping. Suddely i wake up, and I sit up in our bed. I'm fully aware that I'm sleepwalking but I can't stop myself, lay down again or do anything about my actions. I start walking out in a big hallway (this is where the main door is located), then I enter a smaller, much more narrow and dark hallway, and in the end is a small wardrobe-like room which is truly pitch black. This scared me a bit since I am afraid of the dark but I just keep walking, I don't even consider NOT to walk in to the wardrobe. So I find myself inside this pitch black tiny room and I close the door and I lock it. Once I have locked the door i just panic, I'm not afraid but I simply can't stop screaming, I remember the scream so well, it was a true scream of despair, I screamed at the top of my lungs but I still was not scared. I started to bang the door, the walls, everything while screaming and crying as hard as I could. Finally my boyfriend comes to the rescue and the door was open now, he just grabs me and tells me I was sleepwalking and I just said ""I know"" in the sternest voice. He's scared out of his life and crying and I just looks at him like he's crazy and then i just go back to bed like nothing happened. 
",The sleepwalking dream,2,nosleep
ephique,0,,0,1rikrx,,4,"I grew up in a small town in Ohio with my mom, dad and big sister. We were a normal family, neither happy nor sad, somewhere in between. I was always interested in music as a kid so I spent most of my time playing piano, practicing guitar or trying my best to write my own songs. It was also some sort of medicine for me; it helped me drift away into my own world when my sister and my mom had disputes. You see, my sister was one of those rebellious teenagers at the time that had to have their own way or the rest of the world had to suffer their unfair ranting. I hated it; I hated hearing her yell at my poor mother.

During a lonesome walk home from school one day I got a call from my dad, making sure that I didn’t have any plans and telling me that I had to come home as fast as possible. My dad never called my cell phone unless he really wanted something so I knew right away something was up. I remember jogging most of the route home, since my dad sounded so serious. It gave me the creeps to say the least.

I jumped over the fence surrounding our villa and paced myself into our house. The kitchen was the first room you’d see upon entering and it was empty so I assumed they were in the living room upstairs. As I was making my way up the stairs I could hear my sister sobbing uncontrollably, something had definitely happened. My dad was standing up as my sister was sitting on the couch, he told me to sit down as well.

I was scared and curious at the same time. Dad and my sister never really spoke or had any arguments since my father didn’t bother caring too much about any of my sisters business, so I could figure out that this wasn’t about my sister. I remember sitting there in dead silence with the exception of my sister shedding tears and trying to keep her crying as quiet as possible. My dad was looking like he had no idea what to do or say, as if he didn’t know how to explain something to me.

Finally, after a long pause my dad made an introduction to whatever I thought this was about at the time. He said: “Your mother…” and then he needed to grasp some air, and he continued: “Your mother has passed away.”

I was eight years old and I couldn’t grasp that concept. I didn’t understand death, or that my mom was eternally gone. I just sat there as I was developing an irrational anger towards god-knows-what, I remember thinking how unfair this was. I do however forgive my dad for telling me so bluntly, he didn’t know what to do and he was in shock at the time.

My sister continued crying, she asked dad how mom died although it was obvious she didn’t actually care to know at that precise moment. She was just being desperate and no one could blame her. I thought it was my sisters fault when I was there, I thought that was why she was crying so much. I didn’t shed a single tear; I kept it all inside. Of course that didn’t mean this incident didn’t haunt me for years, I never stopped thinking about my mother. 

The aftermath of my mother’s death is what has been shaping my life the recent years. My sister was very weak emotionally and it basically drove her insane. My dad had to take her to an actual mental hospital. Something I didn’t even think existed when I was eight. This resulted in that I didn’t get to meet my sister very often, my dad kept telling me she was in a special school for students that wanted a challenge; but I overheard enough conversations to know where she really was. I guess my dad was trying to keep me out of it, and I didn’t blame him. 

I was guessing that my sister wasn’t doing very well at the hospital since we got to see her less and less as years went by, something that troubled me; I hated living in this big villa of ours with just my dad. It felt so dead, and my dad had been more kept to himself after mom died. We didn’t do anything, I literally spent all time at home in my room, making or playing music. Me and my dad didn’t even greet sometimes when I came home from school, it was depressing. My theory for his change in behavior has always been that he blamed himself for my mother’s death, something that I’m about to get into.

You are probably wondering how she died by now, and it’s a legit question to be asking. The best answer I could give you is that I don’t know. My dad has always told me she died of liver-failure but for some reason that has always sounded like a lie to me. It didn’t add up, my mom never had any problems with her liver before and she didn’t drink. I think it was something he made up when I was younger because he assumed I wasn’t mature enough to hear the truth. In addition to this, whenever I asked my dad about this matter he’d get heavily upset. Nowadays I never ask about my mom’s death, nor do I even bring up mom as a topic.

Years went by and I ended up being fourteen. It kept going like I just described, I spent most times in my room playing music as my dad did whatever he was doing on his own in the house. My dad did work, he had the night-time shift at a local bottle factory, I’m not joking, he actually made glass bottles for a living. He had higher ambitions but most of them got crushed when he and my mother got my sister, they had to move and dad basically had no other financial option than to quit the university he was attending at the time and get a quick and close job. You guessed it, the bottle factory.

I was riding my bike home late at night after spending the evening in the school library at one point when I was fourteen. My school was the type that had an after-school library that didn’t close till 11 pm. I didn’t need any of the books or supplies that the library offered; I just studied there sometimes since it felt less depressing than my father and our lonely villa. Either way, I hadn’t seen my sister for two years that night and I was starting to get the idea that I wouldn’t see her again for another two. 

When I arrived at the house the front door was open, “This is odd?” I thought. Upon closer examination I realized that someone had taken the spare key from its hidden spot underneath one of my mother’s old jars. It’s never smart to have a spare key hidden right next to the door, number one mistake people do when it comes to spare keys. It did look like whoever had taken it did suffer a struggle before finding it. The rug outside the door was all muffled up and there were scratches on the door, around the lock. I suspected we had been robbed so I pulled out my cell phone, ready to call the police. 

This is when I heard something coming from inside the house. I was dead scared to say the least, this could have been armed robbers or maybe something worse, I didn’t know. It sounded like someone was grinding furniture against the floor, trying to move it. It was so dark as well, I remember not seeing more than pitch black looking into the open door, technically if someone was in there they would have seen me because of the street lights. I started to slowly pace into the house, walking towards the noise. This is where I had to make a decision, was I going to suddenly turn on the lights in order to reveal whatever was in there or was I going to approach it in the dark? I picked the former. I was just going to switch the lights on when I could see someone strafe into the light coming in through the kitchen window. It was my sister, naked. My entire mindset had to change into a totally different way of dealing with the situation; it took me a good couple of seconds to assume she escaped the hospital. 

I switched on the lights in an instant. She had redecorated the entire kitchen, in the dark. Of course it all looked hideous and random; she didn’t know what the hell she was doing. I remember being in a slight discomfort, I had never seen my sister naked in my entire life. I also hadn’t seen her for a good couple of years at all. She didn’t look very comfortable either, she looked like she didn’t know who I was and was wondering what I was doing there.

I uttered “Linda?” out loud, that was her name. She didn’t respond, she just continued standing there looking at me. “Don’t you remember me, I’m your brother.” I still couldn’t get any feedback out of her; it was as if the wheel wasn’t spinning at all. I wasn’t sure what the protocol here was, not knowing the number to the mental institution or anything I figured I’d try to call dad, before I got to press the call button on my cell phone she uttered: “Don’t call dad.” This is when I realized she couldn’t be completely empty inside after all.

“You don’t want to call dad.” She continued.  I had no idea what to do, I assumed this was part of the reason she was in the mental hospital in the first place. Luckily my dad got home at that point, not coming from a finished shift at work. He had a good five hours at least left, I assumed the hospital had phoned him and told him about the situation. My father ran into the house as fast as he could.

This is when something I didn’t expect happened, he told me to leave. He pointed at the door as if I had no idea how to find my way out of my own house. I asked him where I was supposed to go, he told me to wait in his car. Judging from how serious my dad seemed I didn’t think twice about it, I ran out to the car. As I was sitting in the car I could see my sister walk past the kitchen window a couple of times, I remember how she made no effort to cover her breasts. I had no clue what the two of them were discussing, although I never saw my sister move her lips so I’m guessing my dad did most of the talking. 

After a couple of minutes my dad started to walk to the car, he joined me inside. I remember asking why he didn’t bring Linda with him, “Don’t call her that name!” he shouted in response. I was so confused at this point. Dad started the car and drove me to my only friend’s house; I didn’t see him very often though. I was a lone wolf growing up and I still was at this point, I didn’t really create any friendships. I remember sitting in the car as he ran up the steps to ring my friend’s doorbell, his mother opened in her night dress and looked confused. I assumed my dad made up some emergency story to cover what was going on in order to get me a place to stay overnight. I didn’t even know what was going on to be fair.

Whatever he told them worked, I got to spend the night at my friend’s place. Tim’s place, to be exact. It was pretty awkward I remember, I only saw Tim a couple of times a week and that was when we shared classes in Spanish. We got to be desk-mates because the teacher made up whom to sit next to each semester, so we weren’t very close. 

It was a Friday so there was no school the morning after; I guessed that made it easier for my dad, leaving him the freedom to pick me up whenever he wanted to. He did, but not before giving me enough time to fully experience the awkward breakfast conversations with Tim’s parents, both trying to justify me as Tim’s best friend. I don’t know. Tim didn’t have many friends I guess.

On the way home I asked my dad what was going on the night before and he basically stopped the car and stared at me, as if I was mocking him. I remember how desperate he looked, as if he had no fire left in his heart. He uttered the words: “Do you think I wanted any of this?” as he grabbed his hair in regret. “All I wanted was a normal family with no circumstances, and I’m not blaming you when I’m saying this because frankly you are the only sane member left in this livelihood of ours.” Is what came out of his mouth next. I tried to comfort him, telling him that he had done a good job raising me and what not; I really didn’t have a lot of cards in my deck at this point. I mean my dad was basically losing it.

When we got home he told me that he was sorry, and that I should go up to my room. I did go up to my room but I got to tell you; I was starting to get very anxious about my dad. I really wanted to know what the hell was going on. I spent that night recording some guitar sessions for a song and reading books while listening to some ambient records I had found online, I couldn’t sleep so pulling an all-nighter was my only real option. I was reading “A Brief History of Time” for a science project in school, I was somewhere in the middle section of the book and started to get dry eyes. I figured I’d go downstairs into the kitchen to get myself something to drink when I got shocked upon opening the door to the hallway. I saw my mother standing just outside, looking right at me for a fraction of a second. Had all this hassle from the last couple of days driven me insane? It freaked me out so much that I ended up never getting a drink. 

The image of my mother outside my door haunted me that entire night, I kept thinking about it as I couldn’t sleep. She looked deranged, scared and raw. The shortage of light sources in the hallway made her look like she was from a black and white 50’s movie. I kept begging for the sun to rise up, I even did that thing when you close your eyes and try not to open them because you never know what you’ll see. I might have been fourteen, but I can openly admit that I was dead scared.

It finally came to be morning and I ran downstairs, still not fully opening my eyes while passing the hallway. I remember greeting my dad who was sitting in the kitchen drinking orange juice. I was just about to pour myself a glass when he said: “I think I need help.” While holding the glass of juice as if he wasn’t sure he was going to drink the rest of it. I asked him what he meant and he said that he wasn’t sure, that he had felt very uncomfortable and unstable lately. He also mentioned that he was thinking of joining some people from his work in playing golf, he thought that could give him some relief. I told him that sounded like a pretty good idea, jokingly adding that it’s better than hanging around the house doing nothing. He looked offended when I said that, something I didn’t really understand since he obviously worked all night, so that would justify him sleeping through the days.

I understand that some of you reading this are wondering how the hell I could have been fourteen and still not know how my mother died. Well, it’s hard to explain how uncomfortable of a character my dad was at times, and it felt a bit like I was offending him whenever I had to ask because part of me did actually believe she died of liver-failure. I mean it was possible. Imagine if it was true, and I kept asking my dad as if he lied to me. That’s the type of thoughts I had in my head about the whole thing.

Having that explanation out of the way, I did summon the courage to confront my dad one last time. It was a couple of days after the conversation about my dad picking up golf; I just walked into his room unexpected. A part of me had wanted to do this for a long time because I really never knew what he did in his room; it looked similar to an office which is nothing he’d ever need since he was a labor worker in a bottle factory. He was actually sitting at his desk. Not only that, but the desk was flooded with paper-work of some sort, maybe he had picked up an accounting job for the factory during the day, something he could manage from home. I didn’t ask; I had a big enough question for him as it were.

I dragged out a small chair he had behind the door and figured I’d sit on it. It was somewhat squeaky and not very comfortable, better than standing up anyway. Then I leaned forward and I was just about to ask when he interrupted my train of thought by saying: “You want to know about your sister, and what happened the other night. Don’t you?” This is where I started to play along because he was already looking emotionally hurt, bringing up mom here would have been a car-crash. I told him that I was indeed there to ask about my sister. He took a good pause before he bluntly exclaimed it to me: “Your sister is not right in the head; she’s in a mental hospital.” I couldn’t believe he hadn’t figured out that I would have known this by then. Not wanting to make a scene I just pretended like I didn’t know. He explained the context, telling me that she couldn’t take our mother’s death. A tear started climbing down his cheeks, and then he asked me if there was anything else I wanted to talk about. There was no way I could bring up something as sensitive as my mother at this point so I told him that everything was fine, and then I left the room.

I realized on my way up to my room that my dad was fragile and very close to losing his mind in this problematic family business. I had no idea how I’d ever get the truth about my mother out of him. When I finally had landed on my bed in my room again, the image of my mom started crawling back to me. The grey scaled portrait of her in the hallway, was my mind playing tricks on me? I also had a slight feeling that I remembered it from somewhere. I mean it was my mom but that exact stare and look she had, not only did it frighten me but I swore I had seen it before. 

Night landed again, I hadn’t spoken to my father again that day. I was facing the same obstacle that I had the other night, I was too afraid to go downstairs because I thought I’d see my mother again. We all know you can imagine things in the dark, kids do it all the time. It’s as if your mind fills in the gaps, but that incident the other night was different. I got more scared the more I thought of it and figured that I’d open the door to the darn hallway, and turn on the lights in order to feel slightly safer. I’m not going to lie, I did open that door very slowly but as it turned out; there was no sign of my mother. I turned on the lights and went back into my room.

Still not wanting to go to bed, not only because it was spring break at this point but also because I was a bit scared I figured I’d listen through some of my older songs. I had loads of them; most of which weren’t very good however. I was still learning how to create music and I never really thought of myself as particularly good, especially not at writing my own songs. I guess I was decent at playing other people’s songs. I basically went through my songs in chronological order, it was interesting because was able to hear how much I had improved over the years. 
It took me a good three hours to get past most of my songs, and I was reaching the more recent creations of mine. I heard something in one of the songs that I never had paid any attention to before; it was a slight breeze of white noise in the middle of one of my guitar riffs. Knowing that this wasn’t an overworked track yet, it was made just days ago and I hadn’t gotten around to mastering it yet, I figured I wasn’t going to give it more of a thought. That was until the neurons fired, that track was made the day I couldn’t sleep, the day I saw my mother in the hallway. Being a bit gullible I figured that I’d give it a go using my acoustic headphones. I tried everything. I played the song backwards; I cut out bass, middle frequencies, high frequencies and even listened to individual recordings of the instruments and samples. I couldn’t hear anything suspicious, just that white noise. 

I was a bit disappointed, at the same time relieved. Although that white noise shouldn’t have been there, nothing in my room could have made a noise like that. I didn’t want to over-think the situation, so I ended up hitting the bed. Later that night, as I still had problems sleeping I was laying in bed listening to the same ambient soundtracks that I was using nights before, slowly dozing off to sleep. I hadn’t been asleep for much more than ten minutes when I started to ascend into that state of sleep when you’re in a dream at the same time as real life is somewhat happening to you. I could hear a thumping sound coming from somewhere. Before I knew it I got woken up by a loud bass noise, it sounded like some kind of a technical disorder. I continued lying in bed, trying to figure out if I just dreamt about the noise or if it actually occurred, this is when I heard a much dampened sound coming from the other side of my room. It sounded a lot like someone was trying to get some kind of sound device to work. It got quieter and quieter and when I thought it was about to disappear I could hear a voice; very distorted and unstable speaking in what I believe was Russian. 

It took me a couple of minutes but I finally realized what I thought the sound was coming from, I had left my old amplifier on from when I was playing guitar. I bounced out of bed in order to turn on the lights. I was overlooking the entire room as I hit the switch, for the blink of an eye, just next to the amplifier I saw my mom again; just as the light went on. The same stare, same face, still that black and white filtered look from before. I got so shocked I fell down on the floor, the noise coming from the amplifier stopped in the same instant. I wasn’t sure what to make of this, and I definitely didn’t want to tell my father about what I had seen, knowing he has already thrown one of his kin to a mental hospital. 

I had a lot of sleep to catch up on but unfortunately this wouldn’t let me sleep, I just couldn’t sleep at all. I never believed in ghosts or anything growing up, these two small incidents with my mom being my only experience in what could be categorized into the matter. I thought and assumed I was becoming what my sister had become. Whatever this all meant, and needless to say; I didn’t get any sleep that night either.

I met my father in the kitchen the next day, he was looking a lot better than the last time I had seen him. He kept going on and on about how much he was looking forward to playing golf with his work-crew later that afternoon. I was happy for him; he deserved some time out of the stress. After the conversation about an afternoon of longing for a spot in the shade and waiting for your turn on a grass field he added: “Have you been thinking of your mother lately?” As if he could read my mind. I told him that I was always missing my mother, and that I had indeed thought of her a lot lately. He stated that he thought I had. I had no clue why.  Short after that he left for playing golf.

I kept thinking of why my amplifier was acting up that night, I started recalling a clear memory of turning it off after I was done playing. In fact, I knew I did since the amplifier was connected to an electricity hub that I used to turn off a small lamp I had next to my bed, how could it have been on? I had no idea. 

Since my dad was out of the building I figured I could use this afternoon without his presence to get some answers. I stepped into his room to investigate what he had been doing sitting at that desk of his all those hours. I grabbed a bunch of paperwork and sat myself on the double bed next to his desk, it got me a slight reminder on how he hadn’t gotten rid of the bed he shared with my mother yet. The first paper I started examining looked like a letter of some sort, as if it was a letter inside a legal template of some company. I don’t know how I’d describe it better than that. After further examination I found out it was a letter from my sister sent to our address, I remember wondering why dad wouldn’t show me something like this: 

“Daddy, why didn’t you visit me last weekend. I thought you were coming back, I was waiting for you. I’m sorry if I made a scene, I thought something had happened to you! I ran to you because I wanted answers, no one has answers here. I’ve been getting visits lately, why can’t you come to me at the same time?”

I fixed some grammar and a whole lot of spelling errors for the sake of explaining this to you, my sister had the linguistic abilities of a five year-old in this state. On after-thought I guessed my dad didn’t tell me about letters from my sister since they would inevitably prove that she wasn’t in a special school for people who were after tougher challenges. Although thinking about it, that doesn’t sound ridiculously different than a mental hospital.

The rest of the papers seemed to be a real mixture of work-related things and records of local police-investigations. Why would my father be looking into cases of murder, pedophilia, rape and almost anything you can think of? It wasn’t really my business what he did with his spare time but this was just outright messed up. I knew he had a friend in the police force, that was either the reason he had these or just the tool he used to get them. I didn’t even want to know at the time, I had enough stuff on my mind already and I hadn’t slept in far too long.
I apologize to whoever reading this if it seems that I’m dragging it out with details a bit too much here and there, I’m only taking precautions to make sure that I’m telling it right. If I’m finally going to tell my story I want it to sound right. 

My father never came home after golfing so I assumed he went directly to work, which made complete sense. It was starting to get late into the evening and I had absolutely nothing better to do than to once again sit in my room, I was trying to figure out ideas for new songs on my guitar. This time I wasn’t using the amplifier since I was legitimately scared of the noises occurring again. My amplifier has been known to pick up foreign radio broadcasts before, something that explains the distorted Russian speech last time, I wasn’t worrying about that. I was thinking about my mother showing herself again. Not that I was sure that it had anything to do with the amplifier itself.

Not too long into that night I started feeling sick of being in-doors for so long, and I felt like I could use some kind of fresh air as a vacation from all this unexplained mystery I had been experiencing. I remember being on the sane side of the fence, thinking critically and trying to find solutions, not marking everything as if it was a conspiracy from hell. I figured I’d take my bike down to a local gas station, not more than ten minutes from my house; I wanted some chips, candy and maybe a couple cans of soda. 

I scrambled together some change I found in my room and took off; I got there faster than I thought I would. It wasn’t cold outside either; it was a pretty smooth night. After grabbing some generic brand of chips, Skittles and a couple cans of coke I paid for it and left. I didn’t spend much time in the store, but apparently enough time to get my bike stolen. With no bike, feeling like a stupid idiot for not locking it I had to walk home. 

Something out of the ordinary happened after this, and I wasn’t even sure if I was seeing things at first. I was walking on this huge open road; I guess you could say it was somewhat of a country road. It was tied together with the forest behind our house. It was the type of road that didn’t have any traffic other than truck drivers, passing once every couple of hours at night. I didn’t want to believe my eyes at this point but I saw my sister standing alone wearing what you’d imagine someone coming from a mental hospital would wear. I assumed she was looking for me; she was definitely staring at me. 

I continued walking, not necessarily fearing my sister. It somehow still felt as if I had a bond with her, that she would never have done anything to hurt me. As I approached her she didn’t give me any response what so ever, she was just staring at me in a light-blue scrub-coat, looking lifeless. I had reached talking-distance; I couldn’t believe this was happening. It felt surreal, like one of those scenarios you can’t be prepared for in real life. She had started to shake a bit, I couldn’t tell if she was freezing or if she was nervous. I asked her if she was looking for me out there, and if she had escaped the hospital. She didn’t respond. I got the notion that she was slightly scared of me, as if I was a threat to her. 

After a short gap of silence I noticed that she was holding something behind her back. I got a bit worried that she had some kind of a weapon, or a blunt object to swing at me so I stepped back when I spotted it. She started to slowly bring it forth, it was a plastic bag. From the way she was holding it I could tell it wasn’t heavy, or dangerous for that matter. I withdrew the step back I took earlier and tried to peer down into the bag, then she started to stretch it out to me: “I took this from your house the other day, I’m sorry. I think this belongs to you. Jonathan.” 

I do realize that I never told you my name, it is indeed Jonathan. I was slightly astonished that she had remembered my name even; she seemed to be so out of it. I remember grabbing the plastic bag, she wouldn’t let go of it too lightly either, it was as if she still wanted it. After I had gotten whatever was in the bag we shared another brief moment of silence, she wouldn’t stop staring into my eyes during these. Then she told me to never mention any of this to our dad. Shortly after she started walking towards the forest; as if she knew where she was heading. 

I saw the headlights of a car coming straight at me and my sister, whoever was in this car was driving way ahead of the speed limit. I noticed when it started to get closer to us that it was my dad’s car, acting on impulse I threw myself into a nearby ditch, as I got to witness my dad chasing after my sister. I didn’t even know if I wanted him to catch her or not, she was purposely running away from him. He dragged her into his car and they both drove away, heading the direction he was originally going. This was the second time she had successfully escaped this mental hospital, and how the hell did my sister make it so far both times? Something wasn’t right, I knew from when I was younger that the hospital wasn’t anywhere close to where we lived since my dad sometimes was gone for ten hours upon visiting her. Of course at the time it was supposedly a special school, but that doesn’t change the logic of it. He never brought me with him whenever he visited my sister, since he kept me in the dark about the whole hospital thing.

I ran the rest of the way home, trying not to drop anything; I still had all the items I bought at the gas station. I wanted to make sure that I could get home before my dad did; I had no clue whenever he would get back, and not wanting him to find out whatever was in the bag my sister gave me. I couldn’t spot my dad’s car in the driveway so I felt relieved as I stepped into the house. I didn’t bother putting my drinks in the fridge or anything, I made my way back to my room as fast as I could. I don’t really know why but I locked the door after me, as if there was something to fear. I sat myself on the bed with all the lights in the entire room switched on. I made sure to put all the bags with snacks in them aside; as I was getting ready to dig into whatever my sister ran into the night to give me. 

I never really thought of something until now, and that is how my sister could have found me. It must have been a coincidence, or she had been following me for a while; knowing she couldn’t approach me in the store. I don’t know.

I looked into the bag, it seemed to be random belongings from the drawers in our living room, and maybe some stuff from one of the cupboards we had in the kitchen. After sorting out stuff that had no relevance what so ever, for example there was a roll of tape in there. I planned to spend more time on the more interesting items. The first thing I picked up was a small collection of family photos, most being after mom died. The next thing I could grab was a couple of rocks; they weren’t even dry, I guessed she must have gotten those just before she passed me the bag. There was only one thing left in the bag, an usb-stick. 

I took the stick out and threw away the bag. Then I started looking at the photos as I was trying to reason why she would have taken any of these from our house. The only thing that somewhat made sense is that a couple of them were from when she wasn’t sent to the hospital yet, but it was pretty much pending already. In fact, most of these photos took place a couple of weeks after our mother passed away. On one of them it’s my sister showing off her prom dress she was planning on wearing, she actually wasn’t acting too badly the first couple of weeks. I guess she didn’t process our mother’s death until later or something. Another photo is of dad’s old car, he had to sell it in order to compensate for our family’s financial depression from when we lost the main income our family had, my mother’s candle business. He loved that damn car with his entire heart; we even used to joke about how mom was jealous of the car. 

There were more photos but I stopped going through them when I realized a couple of them had a handwritten marking of the letter “x” behind them. It noticed this when I was flipping them as I was trying to get them all to be facing me. I sorted the photos with no marking away and started to focus more on the ones with the marking. I figured my sister must have had done this, for what reason I was about to find out. I kept staring at the first picture; it was the one I told you about earlier, the one of my father’s old car. It was a Pontiac from the early 80’s and it must have cost him a fortune. I never had any particular memories of the car; I remember it spending most of its time in our garage.

I kept looking at the photograph and the more I stared at it the more I started to wonder why my dad hadn’t use the car more, he obviously loved it. The photo was taken for an ad in the newspaper, for selling it of course. I was just about to put the sad photo away when I caught a glimpse of my mother sitting in the backseat. It wasn’t very clear and she seemed somewhat transparent. She had the same drained-out appearance and blank stare that she had from when I saw her in the hallway outside my room, and this was taken after her death. I couldn’t believe what I was looking at. I remember dropping the photo out of shock; so many thoughts started circling inside of my head.

dinofinger,0,,1,1rie11,,1,"    17^th May 2007.
I followed my dad went to Grandma's house. My cousin who lives with grandma, had a suspicion that something had happen to Aunt L &gt; *Her initial would be appropriate here* &lt; Aunt L was never in her sound mind but she prefer to live alone which is the best option avoiding the troubles she would cause to others. Grandma has a problem of [nagging](https://www.google.com/search?q=nagging&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a) disease which makes more Aunt L better suit live far from her lectures. 

Back again to my cousin, who received a call from Aunt L's neighbour. Her respond was *there was a sudden silent for the past four days*. Aunt L was never a social person who goes anywhere she wants and always out. She prefered to live in her tiny apartment secluded only her herself and herself she enjoys being with. But her neighbour help us to watch for her just in case for anything. So we respond to go and visit her house. My father, my cousin and I, the three of us went together with nothing held us back. 

As we arrive by the door, we knock and knock. From the window we can see noise screen from her small tv at the corner. But there was no sign of her. Somehow her grill lock and the door were changed, the key my cousin brought didn't fit at all. Maybe she doesn't want us to barge in anytime we want. My dad took the liberty to call the locksmith while giving positive thoughts to my cousin that everything was fine. 

30 minutes pass. The locksmith do his magic and opened the door. Such stench came out in full loaded right to our faces. Right in front of the door we can see Aunt L laid still in the toilet facing the floor. A 15 year old me shocked and I just watched her body in strip condition only a towel covered her other half and her faeces was right below her and all over behind her. Yet she is still alive, blinking and gasping.

My dad pull me back allowing my cousin to go in. I can still feel my father clenches my arms so tightly when he saw his sister. He said ""*[I better call the ambulance](http://www.wikihow.com/Call-an-Ambulance)*"", so he did and left. My cousin call me out to help pick her up. But she was too heavy, we can't even push her to the side. So my cousin rinse her with water to clean her off. I was told to took a towel and wipe her face. I could say her face was in a total blankness. 

25 minutes later the ambulance arrive. They took her with a stretcher. Both of us went down to send her off. I can remember certain vision of some neighbours pry on their window looking out what was happening. My dad went together with Aunt L, so left me and my cousin. Soon my mom and sister arrive bringing cleaning equipment. We spent whole 3 hours cleaning her house. Based on what I heard my cousin said ""*The man who always deliver her food got no respond from her for three days. That's when he ask the neighbour if she had gone somewhere. I bet if we were too late, she might have gone by any minute unconscious on the floor*""


    18^th May, 2013
We had her funeral in the day after the day we thought she would died 6 years ago. Funny the coincidence of the date just *one day after* we laughed. My cousin gave a speech said she was a fighter. Indeed she was. I think her life is better after that 17^th May living in the retirement home. She was more happier than before she was a shut-in. R.I.P Aunt L, our auntie we always concern hereafter. ",Brief moments,2,nosleep

As I was doing this, the big rocking chair next to his litter box was swaying, and I gave him a quick glance. I felt him sniff at my ear. He then jumped off the chair and walked into the kitchen. I thought nothing of it for a few seconds, then froze. ""Oliver!"", I called. I then walked to the door and looked outside, he was napping on the steps.

echoes007,4,,2,1rhee9,,2,"I’ve always been a non-religious person. I was brought up by parents who told me to question everything. To not believe the crap that is forced down our throats daily. But I’ve always felt a whole in my life when it came to that stuff. I went as far as trying LSD and DMT to achieve this “religious experience” we all want, but I never got it. So, after a while, I just gave up and moved on and accepted there is no God, or spiritual experience, or anything that’s real, that will make me see life in a whole new perspective. Naturally, this got me down and depressed a bit. It was then when I started seeing 11:11 everywhere. It started one night when I was doing some heavy drinking and decided to do some coke lines. I remember vividly, my heart stopped, and I remember a sound, like a blender going off in my head. When I forced myself to snap out of what had happened to me, I remember the first thing I looked at was the clock on the cable box. It read 11:11. This stuck with me for a long long time. I felt like some force or spirit was forcing me to look at the clock when it was 11:11 in the morning and 11:11 at night. As if reminding me that it saved my life. This was going on for a while, when I went as far as Googling what it was. Unfortunately, the 11:11 thing was associated to some spiritual stuff, things I thought were bullshit to begin with. But still, 11:11 was always there. Slowly I stopped thinking about it, and my 11:11 experiences were less and less. It wasn’t until last week when I was driving home (I was butt sober) from an event when it started raining. My tires and brakes were messed up and I didn’t get a chance to change them, and besides, it hardly ever rains in this town, so this came as a surprise to me. As I was driving up a hill, I lost control of my car completely on the wet road, and was literally fighting my steering wheel and slamming on my brakes to stop the car, but I couldn’t. This went on for about five seconds until I finally stopped the car in the middle of the road. Again, when I snapped out of my panic mode, the first thing I looked at was the time, and it said 11:11. I’m not one who believes in coincidences, but this has me thinking I have some angel or spiritual entity looking after me. Even though I don’t believe this stuff, there is NO way that could happen. Has anyone else experienced 11:11, or has randomly been “forced” to look at a clock when it’s 11:11? Or is it my brain playing tricks on me because of the LSD/DMT I took? ",11:11,4,nosleep
Jerbsybear,0,,0,1rh5g6,,2,"There are tales of a man committed to Central State

Who killed his wife and children while he asphyxiates

His doctors with the bloody spinal cord

Of his fat nurse, who cares if she was old

When the guards rushed in, it was no problem at all

bashing their brutish faces straight into the wall

Bursting through the heavy front doors

He killed everyone on the first floor

No one would stop him, no, not this time

5 years of waiting, no stopping on a dime

He had to get out on this night

To meet his lover, one at first sight

Taking his science class, year after year

Convinced that she loved him, held him dear

Called her ""favorite student"" and all

Had her parents give him a call

To invite him to dinner, on a cold winter's night

Slaughtered her family, their faces were a sight

In the judge's court, he mercilessly pleaded insanity

When, in reality, it was egotistical vanity

If he couldn't have her, no one can

To kill her new parents was the plan

Standing outside of the house that was soon to be theirs,

Looking to seek justice, to seek what's fair

So as he broke in and brandished the knife

She knew he was back to take a life

So quickly she fled into the night

Leaving behind more victims, as she took flight

She ran two miles straight to the highway

Waving for anyone to stop, to go her way

As hand grabbed her from behind the bushes

His knife drives deeper and deeper as it pushes

Past her vitals and deep into her heart

All flashbacks of her life seemed to fall apart

As he whispers ""This...feels so right""

Her mind tries to escape into the night

The fires of his greed are not yet doused

As he tries to get back to the house

He plans to take another life

While sharpening his serrated knife

""Am I next, is he coming,"" you cry with fear

InsanityInABottle,0,,1,1rgw03,,2,"“Extra, Extra! The Piggy killer is at it again!” Yelled the paperboy, holding a darkened paper above his head, screaming the same phrase over again, as if it was no big deal. I walked towards him and asked him “How much?”
“Only ten cents sir.”
“Ha. Must be a pretty good story then.” I said, as I fumbled for a large dime. I handed it into the boy’s hand, it’s gleam bouncing the light of the sun, veiled through the mist of rain into my eyes. I blinked quickly and grabbed the paper, quickly turning from the boy, hearing “How about a tip sir?”
“How about you wipe your ass with the metal I’ve already given you.” I said back to the boy, who furrowed his brow and continued screaming for new customers. As I walked along Hero’s Avenue, I kept the paper open, reading it over again. In large font, shouted “Piggy killer’s new victim!” with a picture of a woman, apparently known by the name of “Jessica Turrow.” She wore a large smile on her face, as she raised a glass of champagne above her head for a toast, I presumed.
	The article read “The psychopath, depicted as a man with a pig’s head on worn over his own face, has struck again. Witnesses described him as large, while wearing a reddened trench coat, then finally, a bib, which read the term KISS THE COOK, slathered neatly against his chest in gore. He had organs and even a human spinal cord attached to his coat and as usual, was found was mist was floating through the air and at dawn. We had identified the victim, through a ring found on the hand of the woman, who had been chopped to pieces and nailed against the side of the church. If you are to spot anyone fitting under the description, contact the police immediately, or you may be his next victim.”
	I laughed as I watched terror shrouding the faces of everybody who grasped a paper in their hands, all walking along the street as automobiles drove recklessly between one another, threading the needle on the two way street, not large enough for two cars to fit on.
	I walked towards the police station, which was cleverly located across the street from a coffee shop, a brothel and a printing office. A police car drove by; it’s loud horn sounding, flashing red and white, reflecting the light from the rain directly into my eyes. I walked into the station, the smell of fresh cigars flooding into my nose. A man screamed from across a large waiting room, looking down at the paper, then looked up and said “Oh. It’s the wonderful Flynn. Of course my dear, come, come.” I walked past him, glaring at his smug face, and then opening the door into my office.
	A man sitting on a chair for those waiting to enter my office abruptly greeted me. He smiled and said, “Well hello sir, I am Dean Osterrietch and believe I have a lead on the notorious killer”
“The pig one?”
“Y- wait, there are more?”
“I believe there are, just they might not like attention as much as our friend here.”
“Well… thanks for informing me of that rather morbid concept, but I have gotten hundreds of pictures of the killer, coming out of his lair.”
	The man pulled out a large portfolio of pictures and dumped them onto my desk, arranging them appropriately. “So, if you look at these pictures, it was for when he first got into the business, holding small weapons, all identifiable, all related to the cutting of meat. Then as you look to the left, these are the later pictures, which are of him coming out, holding bodies on his shoulders, sitting in the back of his eatery and chopping them up, putting them into boxes and looking pleased with himself, all the while in his pig mask. But, he seems to be getting careless. He cam outside, barely slipping on his mask in time for my camera to flash a photo, his face seemed veiled in… something. Something sticky, something gruesome. But if you look closer, you can quite easily see the silhouette of his face. Large, hooked nose, eyes, clouded in blue, teeth, sharpened to perfection and a dripping mouth.”
“Ha. So you’re basically implying that you’ve seen a notorious killer walk in and out of a location multiple times and not even dared to act on it? I beginning to suspect you’re the killer!”
“But that would be silly. Why would a crazy give himself away?”
“I don’t know, why don’t you tell me?”
“I believe this conversation is getting a bit heated. I saw the ad in the paper that I should contact the police and thought I’d tell you where I’ve seen such events. Have you ever seen the abandoned butchery on 1800 Bellcove Street? Well there’s your place. Sir!” said the man as he gathered his pictures and threw them into his bag, which smelled of defecation and nickels. I watched as he slammed the door, then sighed and sat down on my desk, rapidly pressing the keys of my typewriter, updating the information I’ve received from the man.
“Mysterious man visits police station, says he has a lead on the piggy killer. As you all know, the notorious killer has crossed the line now. Enough to even be called a serial killer! What a sick bastard he is.” I continued being as pessimistic as possible, updating the paper, then grabbing my camera as I finished the article. Typing in my name, finishing with my name, saying “Written by: Flynn Covetail.”
	Darkness was beginning to shroud the air, perfect night for the killer to strike in his typical environment. Light rain was spattering against my window, racing down to the bottom of the screening, only to fall against an umbrella below. As I left my office, throwing on my coat, I screamed to the man in the front desk, “Going out to…oh, let’s see...1800 Bellcove Street? If I don’t come back, Phone someone.” I said with a laugh, while walking outside.
	Instantly my boots splashed against the small walkway paved on “Western Lagoon highway” as the frivolously worthless people would say. I walked down towards the street, which was naught but four blocks from here. I passed by Dontell’s Donuts, Redgar’s Rotisserie and Salam’s Spices, all involved in the fattening of desperate cops, as only fattening diners were located near the station, so I developed a theory that every restaurant owner is against us.
	I reached the butcher’s place, which had been looted to hell by the anarchists, who were just a group of thugs that didn’t do shit to overthrow the government. The door had been pried off it’s hinges, yet now it was replaced by a veil of chains, hanging off of rusted hooks attached to the doorframe. Within the butchery, the first thing I noticed was a bed, a homeless man sleeping on it.
	I simply ignored the bum and walked around, searching for anything considered suspicious. I walked through the door, smelling the bum’s shit in the corner and closing my nostrils as well as I could. I looked through the shop, behind the counter I found several rusted knifes, which were corroded to the counter, which was a wooden rotten thing, with three cutting boards lining it, all of which nobody needed. The front of the shop seemed completely normal, but I listened to the bum waking, instantly screaming, “Who’s there! I will kill you if you’re trespassing on my property!” I laughed and screamed to him “I suggest you run out of here, or I may just have to turn you in as a key suspect for the crimes.” I heard the scuffing of his shoes against the floor, running towards me.
	I quickly turned, backing up against the wall, my sidearm pointed at the bum and screamed “GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!” I shot to the side of the man, who quickly bolted for the door, a rat following closely behind him. I sat for a minute, catching my breath, while my vocal chords seemed to scratch against one another in a uncomfortable clunky fashion. As I stood, I felt the hard callused flesh of an arm pressing against the front of my throat and the sudden feeling of something hard hitting the back of my head.








	Ha. Damn fool didn’t even know what he had coming. Shouldn’t have fucked with my grandpa… shouldn’t have yelled. My ears hurt. Are they ringing? Why the FUCK am I here? I thought a conversation to myself as I raised the man into the air, the familiar heaviness of my mask pressing against my face, the pig’s blood leaking down my neck, warming me, keeping the cold away. I looked at my setup, which was simply the back room of a butcher’s shop, a heavy steel door muffling sounds on both sides of the fifty wood wide hallway of a room.
	Blood dripped into wooden bowls I’d gotten from the shop, the bodies of fresh meat hanging from the ceiling. Pigs, cows, chickens, even a few deer, but the most stubborn of prey, the pigs. The sticky cunts hung from the ceiling, their wrists cut, their feet missing, their hands stuffed into their fucking loud mouths. The damned pigs that walked the streets, reading their stories about who? About me! The beautiful man, who is dealing righteousness to the crazies, to the rich. Though they think that they’re so safe in their leather homes, they should be the ones making chairs; their dried hides need to be a part of furniture!
	Oh, what an inventor I will be! But the best part is, nobody looks twice at the photographer. Nobody looks at who’s behind the camera; they only care about the picture! And I am finally the one in the picture! Flynn, the little anus that believed he owned the whole world, because the police were backing him up. NO, NO, NO! YOU ARE MY FUCKING BITCH!
	I whistled a tune of sorrow and greed that humans so openly express. I raise him in the air, catch a hook to his leg and strip him down to his bare neck. This self-conceited asshole needs one thing. A hook curving through the cheek, wrenched from his cheek. He thought I was the killer? NO! THAT IS NOT THE FUCKING WORD!
	Oh! My friend is waking up! Finally a new toy to play with. Oh, what a joy he will be! Oh no! What will I say to him? I guess I’ll just wing it. I guess I’ll just talk to him.  Where will I display this beauty? Ooh! The police station! Mmm, how delectable would that be? To show the pigs that even their weapons can’t defend them from me. THEY ARE GOING TO LOVE ME! I am a hero. I love being a hero and don’t try to talk me out of my heroism! I AM AMAING!








	My eyes slowly opened, to find a man in a pig mask, the rotting dreaded animal seemed to have a grin on it’s face. I was hanging upside down and fuck my leg hurts! Why does my leg hurt? Where the hell am I? “Oh… you’ve awakened!” spouted the pig; it’s squeaky voice ringing through my ears. I screamed, “Help me! Help! HE’S GOING TO KILL ME!” 
“Now that’s not how you treat a guest, is it?”
“Fuck you.”
“Oh… language, language my dear friend. If you even try saying something like that, I will cut off your cock and feed it to my friend Mr.Squeaks over here!”
	I looked to where he was pointing, which was a large column in the room, a decomposing rat nailed to the pole. “Somebody is going to catch you. They know where I am!”
“Oh, I believe they do, if only your little desk friend was there to hear what you had to say!” said the phsyco with a smile. He pointed at the ceiling, which had two hooks on it, chains hanging from them and a headless man, blood dripping in a steady stream of thickness, into a wooden bowl. “Why are you doing this to these people?”
“Okay, okay, story time. Oh yay, stories! FUCK OFF GREG, THIS IS MY TIME TO SHINE!”
	I looked at the pig with doubt, pain shooting up my leg, throbbing slowly into my brain. “SO, let me tell you why I love my job, okay? Okay. So, when I was twelve, I thought, I’m going to take pictures of weddings! I’m going to take pictures of people in love, because everyone else’s happiness, is mine.” He said this, while pinning his right hand against his heart, which contained an extra few layers of flesh, sewed against his own, along with a tattoo, stolen from his victim.
	“Okay, so anyways! What do ya know! I’m doing that now! I am a photographer! I love people being happy. SO, I one day, was at this one glorious wedding, full of lovely people. I had started talking to a woman and a little, oh what is it called? Fetish of mine was developed. As we were in bed, I took out my camera and took shots of my experience and little did I know, I have a few other… kinks. I wrung my hands around her delicate throat, stuck my finger down her throat and felt the vomit shoot from her mouth! I felt the rush as eventually, she started to fuckin’ bleed! WHAT A WHORE! She began to cough up blood, she began to wheeze and it is as these coughs echoed from her throat, landing inside of my mouth as our lips touched, did I realize how wonderful blood tastes. Rich, creamy, delicious, blood, coursing from the fountains of our decapitated stumps. I invented ways of sucking people dry, licking them dry! Well, at first I was only an amateur, but, as I got better! Oh BOY did I start to love my job! Every wedding became a slaughter, every wedding gave me a new friend, because after all, nobody cares about who’s behind the camera! NOBODY GIVES TWO FUCKING SHITS!
	So, pretty boy, I believe it’s time; you… started looking into my eyes, whenever I snap a photo of your beautiful body.” He said this as his hand slid down from my chest, slowly down to my cock, grinning, spittle flying out of his mouth as he coughed, slid a blade against it as chopped it off. I screamed out loud, blood spurting from me and all the smile he smiled, then I fell asleep, never to wake again.

ReiKoroshiya,0,,0,1rgsca,,2,"Here I am and im going to write about some of the things that go on in my life. Sorry for bombarding you with some trivial things and please just hear me out.
how about I start at the beginning that seems easier. Well back in elementary, I was that kid the kid that really no one liked. I had a friend here and there but that's about it. I was basically a social outcast, 
I never really got my work done, I still don't. Note that I was a very, very angry child and no I was not spoiled if that's what your thinking, im the oldest of 3 kids who had been and are growing up in poverty, but my father is very good at managing money which means he is very cheap.
I had shared a room with my younger brother and for some reason I never grew out of the stage where you sleep with your blankets over your head. I had always liked horror even though none of it really scared me even in elementary in the 3rd grade I found an author by the
name of R.L.Stine and I had read tons of his books which remotely captured my interests.
A few of the simple things had scared me, and I most likely have experiences that I have blocked out of my mind, I don't remember much about my childhood at all.
I don't know why I can't but that's just how it is. I do remember bits and pieces though, not anything like birthdays, mind you. Here Ile give some examples, I remember
when I thought my stuffed animal had red eyes, I freaked out a little bit called my parents and my father calmed me down and took it away. Years later I went back and found it, and of course it wasn't scary anymore. Another example
would be when I saw a ""witch"" in my closet, but again my father came in and turned the light on to show me that there was nothing there, I had clearly saw something but it was gone as soon as the light turned back on.
Once he had left and turned the light back of the figure was back again. I remember when my body shot up in bed and I let out a blood curtling scream and my parents rushed into the room
and they had tried to comfort me and to calm me down I was bawling my eyes out while hugging my father he had asked me what had happened and I was just mumbling incoherently 
about it. I can't remember what it was that had freaked me out so badly. Something else that just pokes out at me was when I was lying in bed and I hear talking so I sit up strait in bed and I see my parents right there talking to each other I couldn't understand what they were saying because they were mumbling and I said hey and they say love you simultaneously and I said aww I love you too you guys, I reached out to hug them and they both just vanished and I almost fell out of bed(I got top bunk). Then their are the things that I have learned from my family throughout the years, not much really
they don't seem to want to talk much about when I was younger. I got that I was a horrible child when they brought me to church, and that I would bite and snarl when anyone got within an arms reach of me.
keep in mind I don't remember that about going to church, as a matter of fact I don't remember going to church at all. hmmm.... well skip forward to middle school where I had
actually made friends. I did got in so much trouble in middle school its not even funny. I could barely even go a week without at least one detention. Saturday school and suspensions I had gotten a ton too, now
drugs are prevalent where I live and when I say that drugs were prevalent I truly mean that, but honestly the thought of drugs never really appealed to me well I mean
certain ones that is, the only mind altering substance that I would actually want to do, smoke, drink, etc would be alcohol cause it seems fun and really any hallucinogenic drug and there
is no way I could get ahold of hallucinogenic drugs without paying a ton of money and with my broke ass I can't afford it and because of that im drug free. Not to much
happened in middle school, only a few things I started to get hellish demonic dreams (oh and speaking of dreams I have always been able to feel pain in my dreams so if
say I was to get ran through with a spear or had my flesh pealed off in a dream I would wake up and still feel it, I also talk in my sleep) which sucks ass, The vast 
majority of my dreams became violent and with me being an avid gamer there was usually a sword nearby in my dreams and usually I could and would fight back and be home
free. I enjoyed those violent dreams where I won, even though I would battle hellish creatures and people I wouldn't consider it a nightmare. I got my own room in the basement which was nice, and well my brother he was, how do you put it? 
Gassy so yeah hot air rises and all that. Electronic malfunctions had started occurring, like waking up to my radio playing static, my alarm clock started to malfunction, etc. I remember waking up minutes before my alarm clock 
went off I awoke with a shot of electricity to my left ear. Skip forward to highschool in the 9th grade I found out what creepypasta and scp were it was amazing to find real horror for a change.
I read the hell out of creepypasta's and found some really cool narrators for them, listening to those was very enjoyable I didn't read scps often and I found a very long series called the holders.
Near the end of the year I started to feel a presence in my room which was interesting because it didn't have a bad feeling to it, the only word that comes to mind to describe it would be light if that makes any sense.
Jump forward one more year, I had flunked my freshman year because I don't do my work. On those professional tests that they make you take S.A.T's or some shit I did 
insanely good on those like I should be an A- student overall. Now i reside in alternative ed. Im 15 right now. I declared to my parents that im agnostic instead of
Baptist a few months ago. Anyway that presence in my room i hardly feel it anymore and now there is something more sinister and not just in my room anymore.
That thing I actually saw it, I fucking saw it, it was short like about a foot and a half tall. I went to bed last night and you know how earlier I had said I sleep
with my blankets over my head. Well I was moving around under the covers and I glanced out underneath the covers and there it was just staring at me a few inches away 
from my face I had to resist not to punch it because half of me was saying its just my imagination and the other half says that if its real  then im going to freak the fuck out and well I never did hit it and its creepy as fuck that its been watching me. I tried to calm my breathing as to not alert it to the fact that I have seen it I
think it knows I saw it because I have been getting glances of it all day. It might have seen me and it might be watching me type this.
It is very short and I can never manage to see any features on its face it just looks dark like a shadow its really, really dark, everything distorts when I look at it like my depth perception gets thrown off and space distorts around it.
If anyone knows what this might be
please tell me.",My Life.,2,nosleep
highchairchildren,3,,1,1rgqmu,,2,"I'm looking for any input. If anyone has had experiences like this, is there a way to stop it?

So this started about two years ago. In the beginning it was just a perpetual bad feeling, like something bad was going to happen all the time.  I was anxious, always alert and never at rest. I hardly slept, primarily keeping myself awake in order to feel safer. 

Then, I started seeing things.

When I say seeings things I don't mean like hallucinations, well not really. I'm not crazy. There were never any voices and there never have been. It was more like a blackout moment in which the worst possible scenario for my environment would play out seemingly right before my eyes. 

Mostly accidents.  It happened once while I was sledding.  The hill was a steep drop and then inclined back up about 20 ft. or so where it met a busy road. Usually people lost momentum and slid back down the hill and came to a rest in the valley but sometimes, people would make it all the way up and hit the metal road block that was put up along the hill. A watched as a kid went down the hill and then it happened. I continued to watch as he went all the way back up the hill and under the metal road block right into the speeding car that was passing by. There was blood everywhere. I snapped back to reality and looked around. Everything was fine. There was no blood, nobody was hurt, just kids sledding around having fun. 

I continued to have random ""visions"" for the entire year. They varied in severity. The worst one left me shaken for a few days afterwards.  I was home babysitting my younger sisters and boiling pot of spaghetti for dinner.  I moved to the sink to strain the pasta and then went back to turn off the electric stove.  My little sister approached me to ask a question and then I had my flash.  As I was seeing it, I grabbed her by her hair and pressed her face into the stove. In that moments I watched as her eyes rolled around in her head and she screamed, begging me to stop.  I snapped back and couldn't speak. I teared up and thought I was going to puke.  I ran to the bathroom, washed my face, sat down on the ground and cried. I had never felt such a mixture of fear and remorse in my life. I got up and reentered the kitchen, finished dinner and continued the night as if nothing happened.  She asked me what was wrong and I played it off as a bout of sickness.  I sat awake for hours that night and I still couldn't come up with a reason for why this kept happening to me.  I asked my mom to see a psychiatrist but unfortunately it was a luxury we simply couldn't afford. 

Then it stopped. As quickly as it came in it left and I had no more of an idea about what it was than I'd had before.  It stayed away for a while. I mean really a long time.  I was vision free for an entire year.

I was prompted to write this because I had another one the other.  The first in over a year but I am scared. I don't want it to start again.  The most recent one was more subtle.  I was shaving in the shower went as I brought the razor up my leg, somehow or another I cut myself and there was blood everywhere.  The tub was washed red with it and there was nothing I could do but stand and watch as it oozed out of my leg and swirled around in the water before going down the drain.  Then I flashed back and it wasn't there. I hadn't even cut myself.

I know this must sound crazy, like some Final Destination bullshit.  I swear to you I wouldn't have posted it if I didn't have hopes that someone could help.  Any input is welcomed.",Can anyone help?,3,nosleep

You might remember my journal entries from last month. Last month, I can't believe it's been that long. Days and weeks run now in an endless loop. Where I am now time doesn't matter. It's a nuisance, it's a hinderance. 

A lot has happened. I just wanted to let those who cared, who reached out to me, know that I am alive. Very much so. And I have met some friends. Real human beings. There is so much I want to tell you. So much I want to explain. But I can't. Not now. 

Just know that the monster under your bed is real. That shadow in the closet exists. And those voices, the voices you hear in the dead of the night are not your imagination. All your life you have been told horror stories. And now you seek them out, on this subreddit. To be entertained, to be thrilled. But these stories exist for a reason. Every story has a truth. A small bit of reality wrapped around trigger words and exaggeration. 

That truth is what lurks in the shadows of your house, just at the corner of your eye. The truth is what is waiting for you when you close your eyes to sleep, hoping for a peaceful night's rest. But nothing is peaceful in the dark. Where the light is eclipsed by the slithering, rotting presence that knows you oh so well. One day you'll know. You will wake up and know. All those stories. All those scary tales. All those fears.

Are real. 

It doesn't take much to become a monster. All you need is the dark to find it's way in. ",I am the monster,6,nosleep
bass_slapper,0,,2,1rh8lh,,0,"*You think me cruel. No. I’ve only learned to act on what I’ve been given. I’ve learned to deal with my problems in my own way. No one understands this but me it seems. This is for ME, I don’t do it for them. But they can’t understand my need. He can’t either. I must make me. Make him understand. How did he get here? I wish I came back. I want him back. WHY WON’T I COME BACK WHY IS HE HERE ARE YOU SORRY ARE YOU SORRY ARE YOU SOR-*

Past this the note is unreadable, spewed with a fluid I can only assume is meant to go on the inside of people. Not that I’d really want to read much more anyways. I already know what happens. Well, not really “know”, but I can feel it. Who wrote it? I can only assume it was my dear Uncle Drewson, if he’s even my uncle. What is this? No clue. A note, obviously, but beyond that speculation reigns. Where did I find this? My new house, in a drawer. Nothing is inherently terrifying about that – Oh, except that it was under the clothing I had already packed there. I just missed it before, I keep telling myself. I half believe it. A few pills later and I’m not worrying about it anymore.

Before this, I didn’t even know I had an Uncle Drewson, let alone that I was to inherit his estate in the event of his untimely, but now enacted, demise. With a heavily estranged family, growing up in between various friends or close relatives passed around by uncaring parents looking to shirk responsibility, one loses track of aunts and uncles. It was in a familiar neighborhood, a spacious three bedroom, so I was in no way eager to turn it down. As a poor, regularly unemployed person I’d been accustomed to sleeping on generous friends floors in the all too often occurrence I couldn’t afford anywhere else. I thought, it’ll all be worth it one day, the day I make it in the world. I can pay all these people back tenfold. “The day I make it”, yeah right. A consistent – and more pressingly, free – living space was a welcome antonym to my recent fortunes. So I was moved in within a couple weeks. Absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened. Till that note seemed to start some kind of vicious domino effect on my life, I was content.

You know when you think back to something embarrassing, stupid, or otherwise shameful act you may have done in your younger, brasher days? Once you recall it, it starts eating away, regret seeping in to every corner of your thoughts, till you would give the world to go back and change it, or at least erase the memory. Imagine that, only you can’t remember what it was you’ve done. It’s simply gone from you. The more you try, the less you realize. The less you realize, the more you regret. The more you regret, the more you try. That’s what’s happening to me, ever since I moved here. But it even goes past that. It’s the sudden feeling you’re being watched from barely out of sight. And at the same time, a crushing loneliness in that feeling. I pop a few more pills. Of course, I’m not being watched. There’s no one else here. If you think you’re being rather clever, figuring this out, oh-no-someone’s-been-in-the-house-with-you-all-along, I was most certainly the only one here. Anyway, this was about the time I found the note. If it was this Drewson, what is he talking about? Who does he want back? What is his need? Do I even want to know the answer to any of these? Insatiable curiosity will ensure I do, personal preference notwithstanding. Putting it all to the back of my mind, I chop up steak for dinner. I like to think of myself as a fairly accomplished chef, particularly where matters of slicing and/or dicing are concerned. I once worked a sushi bar, as a side job to pay the bills, and was quite proud of my ability to launch various morsels into the air and sever them in two with one fell swipe, like you see in commercials. Until the day my knife slipped and nearly skewered a customer’s eyeball. Maybe I’m not quite as proficient as I thought… I grab the bottle of pills and take a few. I don’t really like thinking about that time in my life.

I’m digging through my drawer later, that same drawer, when I stumble upon another discovery. Instead of a clue, it only deepens my mystery. A USB stick is secured to the very back of the board. I carefully remove it, and spend a few minutes simply gawking at my find, my inner curiosity again sparring with my better senses. I think, this will perhaps answer some questions about the note, and hopefully clear up my imaginations conjuring brought on by its conclusion’s implications. As per your previous assumptions, I couldn’t be farther from the truth. I secure the stick in its dock. View files. Two folders: “Reminders” and “Media”. Reminders is empty, media contains one subfolder: “Vids”. I open the folder. Two more: “memories” and “triggers”. Memories is empty. I open triggers. I’m confronted with one video file: shotinthedark.wmv. It’s 0:40 long. I press play.

Before I continue, if you’ll permit me one aside to validate the severity of this. I’m a massive horror movie fan, and I like them brutal. The more blood and guts, the better. I like truly graphic, heart wrenching stuff, and I very rarely squirm at it. Three seconds into shotinthedark.wmv and I rushed over the trash can to puke what felt like my very soul out. The scene I’m immediately confronted with was a man on a chair wearing nothing but an undershirt and briefs. There is a single light source on the chair, but I can faintly make out a figure in the background. Then, without a word, the man’s brains are ejected out his face, accompanied with a thunderous bang. Bone and cartilage spew forth in the foreground. Nearly black red sludge runs down his white undershirt, accompanied with brain matter that had just been crackling with life, likely flooded by fear, but life. I don’t have too much time to process anymore; I’m preoccupied with regurgitating my expertly made steak into the wastebasket. I think, it must be fake, but I know it’s not. I’ve got to tell someone about this, I think, the police, someone. Yeah, I’ll talk to the cops. Then, over my subsiding retching, I hear a familiar voice utter “Are you sorry now?” in the tone of a disappointed parent talking to their disobedient toddler. Something in that voice is chilling. Something… I return my gaze to the computer screen, where the barely visible figure now stands in full view, smiling.

I recognize the smile too.

It’s me, smiling back at myself, gripping a smoking sawed off.

The computer screen goes black. My head spins. I lie down.

youngsterjose42,1,,5,1rge20,,1,"He woke up in the morning like every other day. Yet this day was different; Jordan was going back to school after being expelled last year. He was caught with drugs and his school wanted nothing to do with it. He moved, now resides in york, Pennsylvania and now goes to William Penn High. He moved to a house which was quite old and just had some renovations a while back. The rent was quite cheap so his mother said ""why not?"". I was one of Jordan's first friends, since moving to york he told me things about that house really strange things. He soon moved away a little after I moved away so I have no idea where he is now. If any of you happen to live in york I'm talking about the old burned down house on market street across the street from the kindergarten/daycare. This story takes place about 2 years before the house burned down. 

A month since school started and about two weeks since I started talking to Jordan he invited me over to his house. Jordan said ""cmon dude come and stay the night my moms gone and im pretty sure wont give a shit"". So I thought why not I haven't spent the night at a friends house in a while ""yea sure ill spend the night man"". We went around town skated for a while, went to McDonald's with a few other friends then it came around 10 or maybe 11 everyone was ready to go home and i was ready to just go to a place and chill, play video games, and maybe eat some more. We got to his place, sat down in the living room, and lit up a blunt. Playing grand auto 3, high off our asses, we ordered some pizza. We ate and everything was fine till I felt like heading over to the bathroom. As soon as I opened the door I notice under the sink there was like a small cabinet and the doors slammed shut. I was high so I didn't really questioned it much. I used the bathroom and then as I exit I suddenly hear a giggle coming from under the sink. A child's giggle, as if there was a kid under the sink playing hide'n'seek or something. Again I did not question it because I was high and didn't really wanna bother finding out what made the noise. Jordan passed out on the couch, I went to his room and tried to sleep on his bed. I remember waking up around four in the morning hearing footsteps and a child giggling I'm pretty sure it was a little boy. I couldn't really tell his age but he was young; I would guess around six or seven. He was running around the house and he stopped at the door I did not see him, I only ever got to see his outline. He said "" I'm really happy I got more friends to play with now"". Suddenly after that he vanished faster than I could blink. I didn't sleep for the rest of the night. I had goosebumps for a good 30 to 45 minutes. Eventually I  calmed myself down by eating pizza and watching TV.",Hide 'N' seek,6,nosleep

So, we were close to the end of the movie, and we heard the loose framing hit it like someone pulled it away from the pillar. We all automatically stopped and looked at each other for about a minute, then we got up and ran to my room.

Mindlesssavage,4,,8,1rhawv,,0,"I have a Where's Wally book. Well, had. Why? I'll tell you.
So I was just searching for Wally at night like I usually do, and I heard a noise.
It was sort of a scratching noise, scratching with a walking cane maybe.
I went to investigate. I went out of my room and...
Nothing.
Maybe it was just me. I went back to my bedroom door. I saw something written on really drippy red paint.
It said ""Find me if you can"". I thought it was just my little brother Mike painting on the walls again. ""Where was Mike anyway?"", I thought. Then I remembered he was outside playing with our pet dog Molly. ( Don't ask me why he was playing in the dark, because I have no idea).
I went inside my room. That's when I saw it. The book was lying on the ground open. I picked it up. This is what the title said:
""yllaW s'erehW"" Now THIS was weird. I also saw the same Wally picture except his eyes were gone and blood was dripping from them.
It was possessed, I thought. I ran outside to bury it, and I stepped on something. It sounded like it was glass because I heard it shatter.
I looked down.
A pair of broken, black rimmed glasses. I ignored it and ran even faster than before.
I ran to my dog Molly's kennel. I always feel safe when she's with me.
She was whining in the corner. That was typical, though. But wasn't she playing with Mike? I shouted out, ""Mike! Mike! Can you hear me?""
No replies.
I ran to the middle of the yard to bury the book.
I stepped in another thing. It was squishy, and slimy.
I looked down.
Blood. Blood and guts.
And Mike.
Lying on the ground.
Stomach open.
With a walking cane through his heart.
I wanted to cry, but then I saw a little Post-It note on the cane.
A poem.
This is what it said:
""I can run, and I can hide.
Tear you apart from the inside.
Waiting in the darkness, with my cane.
Used to be for children, now insane.
Red and white, in the grey fog.
Running around with my little pet dog.
With my girlfriend Wenda, with her camera,
And an old man with a white beard.
The prisoner who escaped from jail, murdering people with no fail.
That's my gang, with no doubt.
When you're in with me, there's no way out.""
This was way too bad to just BURY. We had to set it on FIRE. Or RIP IT APART. Just destroy it in whatever way I could.
So now in my backyard, a grave for Mike, some burnt and ripped pages, shattered glasses, and a walking cane.
And to this day, I never read another Where's Wally book again.
And every night, I still hear the sound of a scratching walking cane against my bedroom door.

kimmiekissies,13,,29,1rgt5c,,122,"I never even met him, I didn't know his name or face. I was, blissfully unaware, of his very existence.

 I will never know why, or when it started. I'm glad for that I guess. I moved into my very small apartment in February last year. My landlord, Olivia, was a sweet older woman who would cook to much and bring me much appreciated leftovers. She was great to me, even after telling her my problem. I'm antisocial, but she didn't mind renting to a reclusive young girl who reminded her of her daughter.

 Every few weeks she would knock on my door then leave, letting me know she was leaving something for me. I loved that. Not even my family would cook so well. The next morning I wash and leave her empty containers outside my door and by an hour or so she would take them back again. My other neighbors seemed fine, but I never talked or visited with them.

 I work from home so anytime I ever was forced to go out I rushed out and into my apartment avoiding an, uncomfortable situation. I loved living alone, it was everything I hoped for. I could just, breathe. By April though, I started noticing things were not right. They were moving, or plain disappearing. I was convinced it was just anxiety caused by my new medication and the move, another side affect was it would make me so drowsy. Since I hated seeing the doctor I just dealt.

 I took naps during the day now and eventually stopped caring. Until one incident doubled my paranoia, Olivia brought me some sort of greek tossed salad and dressing for lunch one day and I enjoyed it with my friend netflix. I fell asleep in the middle of Portlandia, and woke up that evening at 5pm. Per usual, what was not usual was my bedding on the opposite side of me was disturbed. I only sleep on the right side. Always. Even more it felt.. *warm.* My first thought was I must have rolled around a lot, but I knew it was to odd to dismiss. 

I got up and searched my apartment gripping my phone with 911 typed in. Nothing else was disturbed, everything was exactly like it should be. I let it go, for the next few weeks everything was normal pardon the occasional misplaced shoe or drawn back shower curtain. I thought about telling someone, my parents, maybe Olivia, but if it's not life or death I am not reaching out to anyone. 

I wasn't scared, I was nervous, maybe a little stubborn.. But I stayed. I am not letting some stupid anxiety ruin my lovely lonely world.
 May came and It was getting worse. My panties, toothbrush, hell even my food was being misplaced. Every time I woke up there was this strange odor in the air. I finally realized this won't go away by ignoring it. I called my mom and begged to come stay a few days, when I got home I told them everything. Saying it out loud solidified any creepy suspicions. 

That weekend my dad went to my apartment and what was found was true horror. Written all over that walls: ""COME BACK"" ""BABY PLEASE"" He ran out and called the police. There was no one living in my apartment but someone definitely had access besides me. 
The investigation revealed a man, Henry, the son of my landlord Olivia, was in a projected relationship with me.

 They showed me his confession on tape. He admitted coming into my apartment every night and everyday with his mother's extra key. He claims we were in love and he had my permission. He drugged his mother's food she left out for me causing my drowsiness and falling asleep so he could come in and watch me sleep, touch my hair, kiss my shoulder. The leftovers I had in the fridge were tested and confirmed.
 I was absolutely, horrified and disgusted. A man, I never knew existed, collected my drain hair, clothes, and trash and practically lived in my apartment for *four months.*

Thanks to everyone for your responses, I have taken a lot of your advice.
I'll just give you all a quick update on what happened after I posted yesterday. She ended up having a nap after sitting in front of the TV for a few hours. I was going to walk our dog, Zeus, but I decided to wait until she woke up just in case she woke up and was confused.


She woke up after a couple of hours and was.....well. Happy. Really, really happy. Almost manic. She woke up full of beans, and smiling like a maniac. I was initially relieved. I asked would she like to come for a walk with Zeus and I and she happily agreed. We set off for our normal walk, and she was extremely energetic, bounding off in front of Zeus and I. Zeus is a Labrador, and although he is a big boy, he's still a pup. We usually just meander along on these walks while he sniffs at everything along the way. But she set a cracking pace and Zeus and I struggled to keep up. 


We got up to this park where we usually let him off his lead for a while as we're trying to train him to not run off on us and to be sociable. It's always been a real task getting him back on the leash though, he never ever comes when he's called. Anyway, we let him off, and he's running around and smelling everything and peeing on anything that stands still long enough. My wife, she's picking flowers and sniffing them, and singing. She gets on the swings at the park and I push her for a bit, as she sings under her breath. I was feeling quite content at this point. Figured she must have just been over tired.


She's swinging vigourously when all of a sudden she comes to a dead halt. She yells, in an almost unfamiliar, masculine voice, ""Zeus! Here!"" and points in front of her feet.


I stood in disbelief as I watched Zeus, the most disobedient rascal of a dog I know, solemnly trot over to where she's pointing, sit in front of her, and stare up into her face. They both sat there for a split second, very still, looking at each other. I picked my jaw up off the floor and asked her ""Um..what the hell! How did you manage that!"" and that seemed to break both their concentration and Zeus shot off like a bat out of hell again, and she started swinging again - ""Oh"" she said, ""I used my mind to call out to him...it's something new I learned..""
She seemed kind of sheepish about it to be honest. I pressed her for more details, but the more questions I asked the more defensive she got. She knows I don't believe that for a second. I'm just happy that Zeus is finally starting to be trained. That's really the only explanation. I asked her to do it again but she refused, so I think we both know it was a fluke.


The rest of the afternoon was....nice. Kind of odd. It's like there's something that's amiss. Like when you walk into your messy bedroom and you can tell that *something* is not how it should be but you can't pin point what.


We talked a bit about the seminar. She said that it was very intense. The days were very long. She said that the premise of the seminar is to get to the root of any emotional upset, to explore the root causes for what's going on in your life. I asked if any hypnosis was used, as suggested by you guys, and she said no. They talked a lot, and were assigned to small groups, and encouraged to open up and explore their ""inner beings"". She said she felt a lot better since attending.
Still, something was not quite right. For instance, we were talking about my sister who lives in another state, and how she had recently got a new job. A few minutes later, my phone rang and it was her. I picked it up and said ""Emma! Speak of the devil..."" and my wife smashed me up the side of the head, causing me to drop the phone and shouted ""Emma is NOT the devil!! How could you say that!!! Emma is NOT THE DEVIL!!"" I told Emma I would call her back and tried to get my wife to calm down. She was very upset at what I had said. She sort of went silent again, and was very still. She seemed rather annoyed at me, but by this point, I was nearing exhaustion myself, so I let her be.

She fell asleep early, about 8pm, on the couch. I covered her with a blanket, and noticed that her eyes are kind of half opened..... I used to have a friend who slept like that at school and I've never noticed it before, I think that in my state of hyper vigilance, I am being overly perceptive of small details.
 
I read more of my original post, and all your comments, and decided to step outside and call our therapist, just to find out more about the seminar, as I knew she was there assisting.

I walked out onto our back porch and lit a cigarette and rang her. She answered on my first ring. What she said has really weirded me out. Only because although she gave me a lot of information, she has raised many more questions, as well as answered them.
 
She said these seminars are more like interactive workshops run by a man named Brian and his wife Linda, who are both self-appointed ""psychotherapists"". She said that there are psychologists such as herself on stand by to assist because sometimes when people are in such a vulnerable state, they may need assistance. She said she has referred a lot of her client's to attend these workshops and has found them to be helpful in most cases.
 
Basically, the course is about discovering your inner self, and using different methods to connect to your inner voice, to find out what the cause of your worries are. She said that it is incredibly demanding and intense. Each session goes for 14 hours with only an hour break. During these sessions, many different activities and topics are explored, including, regression. Apparently Brian does this 3 hour session on the second last day, where he gets everyone to meditate, and be still, and he regresses them back to childhood, or even, in some extreme cases, past lives. Our therapist said, it was so intense that she had to fight from being regressed herself. She did make comment that she had been concerned initially about how my wife would handle that, but that she seemed ""brighter, had a clarity about her"" after this experience. They discussed what my wife had gone back to, in her mind, and the therapist was happy that it hadn't caused her any great distress, but reminded me she couldn't discuss the specifics. She said when she wakes tomorrow I could gently try and open the lines of communication with her and she may explain her ""experience"".
 
I told her about my wife's strange behaviour. She said it is normal to be a little out of sorts after one of these sessions, but nothing major. I don't know if it's just me, but I could sense a tiny bit of alarm in her voice.... I don't know, maybe I imagined it. She said to call her if there's any further problems.
 
I hung up, and as I was putting out my cigarette, I turned to go inside and my wife's standing there staring at me. I jump and say ""Jesus Christ honey you scared me!"" and she replied ""Not as fucking much as I'm going to scare you.""
 
Ummm ok. I had to physically turn her and direct her into the house. In the moonlight she almost looked like a stranger to me. Her long blonde hair was hanging in her face, and her face was fixed in this awful scowl. I figured she must still be pissed at me from before. I put her to bed and she goes back to sleep.
 
And, well, that's where she is now.... she was supposed to be off work today too, but I was meant to go back to my job. But when my alarm went off, I just had this weird feeling that I should stick around and make sure she was ok. I rang in sick for work, and I'm just doing some household jobs, waiting to see if she's better when she wakes up, and googling what regression means, and what these intense emotional exercises can do to someone. Still nothing that convincing though. I dont know. Maybe I'm *too* skeptical. I just don't believe this crap.

The whole thing sounds a bit stupid to me, if I'm honest. But I have to say, it has caused some kind of change in my wife. She is very extreme in her emotions at the moment, and I'm worried, because we both have to go back to work tomorrow, and her work environment is very proper. She is always a perfect employee, and very dedicated to her work. I can't help but feel concerned that she might wake up tomorrow and still be in this....mood. Do you guys know anything about this ""regression""....is it the same as hypnosis? She was adamant she wasn't hypnotised, but it sounds like it to me!!



EDIT: Ok now I'm getting really freaked out. I went to check on her and she was talking and singing her sleep. I can't quit work out what song she's singing I've never heard it before. But she's saying something about being someone called Azara or something??? It's really fucking unnerving it doesn't even sound like her. Ill try and get a recording and see if you guys can shed some light. 


EDIT TWO: Ok I managed to record a bit of it...she's singing but I don't know what, has anyone heard this before????????? Ignore the TV in the background I was watching it in the lounge room to drown her out, and it was really unnerving when I turned it off and all I could hear was her.

floydnimrod,21,,25,1rhxtb,,113,"I'd just come from church for some reason. I'm not sure why I'd gone into the church, but it was the weirdest service I'd ever been too. Everybody was there. It was a packed house. Rich people, poor people, criminals, middle class folk. It was all people who didn't normally go to church. I looked into the coat room as I walked in, and some guy was snorting cocaine on this little counter top. Right in a church. I was like, what the hell? I've never see that.

I sat in a pew, and looked up. There was no minister. They were just playing a movie of an old church service on the screen. Some little old lady was playing a hymn on an organ, and the minister was applauding her. She seemed happy. But the audience was restless, not really paying attention, not sitting down, just kind of wandering around, talking to everybody. 

And then I saw a woman I used to know, someone I worked with years ago. I went to sit down next to her, and she sort of jumped on my lap and hugged me, saying she was so glad to see me. I wasn't sure if she was sad, or drunk, or terrified, or just lonely, but she whispered in my ear, offering me sex, saying she's always wanted me, ever since she'd known me. I sort of pushed her off my lap, thinking this was hardly the place for that kind of cheap pick-up. And then I got up and walked out. There wasn't really a church service going on anyway, I don't even think it was Sunday.

And then for some reason, I was in a car with this old lady. I don't even know who it was, or why I was with her. She was old like my grandma Freddie, but it wasn't her. We were driving down the street. She was driving too slow because she was kind of lost. I don't think I was in Winnipeg I was on a large street, almost the size of Portage with several lanes. But they all seemed to be deserted, like very early on a Sunday morning. I'm not sure if it was early in the morning or near sunset, but the sun was low in the sky. I think it was late in the day. The streets were mostly clear though.

The lady pulled over and for some reason she got out of the car. I think she was going to ask somebody for directions. I looked at the GPS thing she had on her dashboard, and suddenly the direction went all fuzzy and scrambled, like the satellite was confused, or just no longer there. And then the whole sky got this weird greenish tint to it for about ten seconds. It basically turned green instead of blue, but only for a moment, and then it was back to normal. Everybody stopped and looked up.

I was still in the car, but I leaned forward and looked out the window. The sun was over in the west, low in the sky. And I saw what looked like a second moon fly over the sky in a direction that was diagonal to the sun's normal path. It was huge. And my stomach got queasy for a moment. It made your stomach sick because it was so big, it actually pulled on you with its own gravity, like the moon pulls on the tides, but much bigger, and everything inside you just got tugged around.

But it went straight across the sky, without hitting. When I realized how close it was, though, I knew it was gonna hit somewhere, probably on the other side of the world. The gravity of the earth pulled it in, and it sling-shotted around to the other side somewhere. I jumped out of the car and grabbed the old lady's arm.

""Come on! We have to find shelter! It's gonna hit!"" 

We just abandoned the car in the street, and I dragged her toward a nearby fire station, or hydro office, or whatever it was. I'm not sure which it was, but there were large utility trucks, with lifts on them. It was also deserted for some reason, except for two guys loading one of the trucks. We banged on the doors, but it was locked up. We ran from door to door trying to get in, but everything was locked. 

And then I felt a great rumble under my feet. It nearly knocked me down. I've never been in an earthquake, so I don't know what it's like, but it felt like the entire planet shivered. Car alarms started going off in every direction and I heard a weird sound like gravel tumbling down a hillside, except there were no hills. I think it was pieces falling off houses in all directions. We were able to stay on our feet though. 

A few moments later, the sky in the north went dark. If I assume the sun was setting in the west, and the meteor or asteroid or whatever flew over the sky in a north-west to south-east direction, then it was north the black came from. And I mean the entire sky. Like a wall of blackness, smoke and ash suddenly filling the view from the ground to the upper atmosphere, from west to east as far as you could see, in one huge wall of black cloud. And it was coming toward us. Well, sort of going towards everyone, everywhere, I guess. It came over the horizon like an charging army, fast and steady, advancing.

""It hit on the other side of the world somewhere! Come on! we have to get indoors! We won't be able to breathe!""

The air started turning yellow. Ash started raining down, and bits of rock and debris from the blast, where ever it hit. I took a deep breath and held it as I was running. I could already smell a weird burning rock smell, like sulphur, like burnt matches, but more metallic. 

Me and the lady finally got into some doors, but it was just a little foyer. We ran in and shut the doors behind us. The inside doors were locked. But it was somewhere to hide. There was a fire alarm. I pulled it, not really knowing why I was bothering. But I was sort of in a panic and not thinking straight. The sign said, In Case of Emergency, so I pulled it. The alarm went off, and we looked out the window. The yellow air turned brown, and then dark red. Then everything went black. The black cloud fell over the whole sky with a clattering rumble that sounded like it was raining gravel instead of water. And all light went out of the world.

The world as we knew it was over. Even if we survived, life as we know it would never be the same. We'd be set back 10,000 years, reduced to hunter gatherers again, living out of caves. If we survived the impact that is. I honestly don't think anybody would have survived the shockwave. Something with that much gravity hitting the earth would pretty much end the story for everybody.

Charlies_friend,20,,9,1rhapg,,79,"A friend of mine posted a story here not too long ago, and he was pretty well received by your wonderful community, so I decided to create an account to share mine.


When I was a little girl, about nine years old, my family purchased a small ranch in western Kansas. My father had just gotten out of the Army, and I suppose after seven years of trotting around the world, and spending two of those years in active combat zones, my dad just wanted to go somewhere the world would leave him alone. He couldn't have found a better location for this purpose; anyone who's ever followed Interstate 70 westward through that area knows, there isn't much between Topeka and Denver.

I still remember the day we (my mom, dad, older sister and I) moved into that old ranch house. It had been built in the early 1900's, and being something of a history buff, I was pretty excited to live in a house that had stood through prohibition, the depression, both world wars, and everything since. The house itself sat at the bottom of a small incline from the main road, backed literally into a hill. This setup meant the back half of the home sat underground, buried in the hillside. Outside the house was a little grassy yard area, and across this yard was an old barn. We didn't have any horses, but my dad held a particular love for classic cars, and he turned that barn into an amateur autoshop where he worked refurbishing old cars from the junk yard in his spare time.

My sister and I were given seperate but adjoining rooms upstairs, while my parents took the master bedroom (oddly) on the first floor. My sister and I's rooms opened onto a sort of landing that looked out over the living room and kitchen, and the stairs led down from there.

It was only our second or third night in the house, that I began to notice some strange things occurring. I was unable to sleep one night, and I laid awake in bed long after I heard my parents and sister go to bed. The house was incredibly quiet, both from being in the middle of a very isolated area, and by virtue of being half buried. Just as I was reaching the half-sleep state...........SLAM! I heard a door downstairs slam shut. At first I tried convincing myself I had just dreamed it, but I couldn't make myself believe that. And the next thing I heard chilled me to my core. I heard footsteps coming up the stairway. I could tell from the sound that the individual must be wearing shoes, so it probably wasn't my parents coming up to check on me. I heard the steps reach the top of the stairs, and then begin down the landing. I was frozen with fear when I heard them arrive outside my door, pause for a moment, and then continue on. When the stranger was apparently in front of my sisters room, he paused again, and again he continued. He reached the far end of the landing, and then turned around and came back the way he came. He continued for what seemed like an eternity, pacing around outside my sister and I's rooms. I finally worked up some nine-year-old courage and crawled to the door. I could still hear footsteps coming from just outside. I waited until he was moving away from me, and I was between him and the stairs, planning on making a mad dash for my parents room when his back was turned. I barely cracked open the door and looked out, and saw....nothing. The footsteps had stopped, and the whole house was empty, and still. I was confused, and afraid, but even then I knew if I ran to my parents they would think I was nuts. So I slid a chair in front of my door and crept into bed. A minute later the footsteps started again, back and forth, all along the landing. Eventually, they lulled me to sleep. 

I didn't mention the noises that night to anyone, fearful of my parents thinking I was a whacko, and of being made fun of by my sister. But, over the next few weeks, everyone in my family began to notice strange happenings on our ranch. Objects moved on their own. Small things would disappear for days, only to be returned exactly where they'd gone missing from. It was what I guess you'd call typical poltergeist activity; nothing harmful or malevolent, just noises here and there and odds and ends moving around. And practically every night I heard those footsteps outside my room. 

My family eventually began referring to this entity as ""Charlie"". He seemed to be a harmless ghost, and sometimes downright helpful. Occasionally my parents would wake early in the morning for work, only to find a freshly brewed pot of coffee waiting in the kitchen. The coffee maker had no automatic timer. Sometimes when one of us had misplaced something, like car keys or the like, we'd search the house frantically only to turn around and find what we'd been searching for laying on the ground behind us. And sometimes Charlie would slam a door, or walk around loudly, or turn a sink on, seemingly just to let us know he was there. And always, those footsteps at night.

Charlie always seemed particularly active in my dad's auto shop. My dad would occasionally find car parts he'd been working on had been tinkered with, despite the fact that he was the only one who ever went in there. Sometimes tools would go missing, only to be returned a short time later. Once my dad came in from his shop one evening as white as a sheet. When we asked what was wrong he just said ""Charlie was walking around out there........Jesus, I thought you all were just hearing things!"". I wasn't sure why Charlie loved that shop so much, but incidentally, that was where I caught my first sight of him. It was a Saturday, and my Dad was hard at work putting together an old Chevy Fleetline. My mom mad him a sandwich as a working lunch, and asked me to take it to him. I eased open the barn door, and saw my dad seated at his work bench, his back to me. And I saw another man, next to the car, also out of my dad's field of vision. He was about 5'8"", with dark hair and eyes. He was dressed in what looked like typical 1930's clothing; black slacks, a pinstripe vest over a grey work shirt, and topped off by a brown ""paper boy"" hat, cocked to one side. He looked right at me for a second, a big, mischievous grin on his face, and then he simply disappeared. I didn't even realized I was still holding my dad's sandwich and continued to stare at the spot Charlie had stood until my dad snapped me back to reality.

So passed the next few months. My family was happy on our little haunted ranch, Charlie seemed happy enough to share the space with us, and life was good. And his nightly vigil outside my room began to seem almost comforting. One night in late November, however, I learned just how utterly terrifying Charlie could be.

My dad had some kind of dinner event for work in Topeka, almost two hours away, and since my Sister was almost 16 by then, and there was virtually no crime in our rural area, my parents figured we would do fine by ourselves until they returned the next morning. Of course, to my sister and I, it meant we could stay up as late as we wanted, watch scary movies, all the kid stuff you can't do with your parents around. At around midnight, I was in my Sister's room with her watching some movie on her TV, when we heard a loud CRASH from the living room. My first thought was that it was Charlie, playing another prank, by this felt different somehow. Charlie's noises were simply little bumps to remind you he was home. But this noise sounded violent, and angry. Before I could really react, we heard another loud crash, and another. My sister cautiously peeked out of her door, and down into the living room. I swear I saw her go white. She began trembling, and her hand covered her mouth. I peeked around her to see what she saw, and felt y blood run cold. We could just barely see two men, outside our from door. One of them was kicking it in. As we watched, a final smash from this man caused the door jam to give out, and they both entered our home, shining long flashlights all over. My sister and I crawled under her bed, and held each other tight. This was easily the most terrified I have ever felt. 

But as the two men began to go through the living room, another loud crash came from the kitchen. One of the cabinets had opened and slammed shut; a favorite trick of Charlie's. The man who seemed to be leading the show shined his flashlight into the kitchen and shouted ""Is there anyone in here?!?? If you are, you better come out now!! We will find you, and we will FUCK you up!!!!"". My sister and I had to cover our mouths to keep from screaming out loud. At the man's words though, Charlie apparently got angry. We heard another loud crash and a skittering of metal on the floor, as one of our silverware drawers apparently threw itself across the room. I heard one of the men say ""What.......the FUCK?!?!"". And then Charlie decided he was do e fucking around. All at once, every door, window, and cabinet in our home began opening and closing violently, and loudly. Small objects all over the house began to fling themselves into walls, across the floor, even at the intruders. At this point, the one in charge just yelled ""FUCK this"" and turned and ran out, his buddy close behind.

As soon as the men were out of the door, everything stopped, and the house was again silent. It was a long, long time before either my sister or myself finally worked up the courage to move. She had left her cell phone downstairs, and and she needed it to call the police and our parents. She began slowly creeping downstairs to get it, and since there was no way in hell I was being left alone, I followed. As we got to the bottom, I looked into the kitchen, and for just a moment, Charlie was standing there, exactly as I saw him before, with the same grin on his face. A moment later, he was gone.

The police arrived shortly, and my parents not far behind. The cops determined that the disorder in the home was caused by the robbers ransacking the place for valuables, and they must have been scared off by a passing car. Lucky for us. My sister and I didn't even try to tell them what really happened, and within thirty minutes, both men were caught, still fleeing. 

After that night, hearing Charlie's walk around my floor gave me a serene sense of security every night. When he played his little pranks, I would always look for him. And every now and then I would catch just a glimpse of him and smile.

Several years later, when I was a junior in high school, I was working on a school report at the local library. The topic was the history of our town, and I wanted to see if the library had any old news clippings that mentioned my family's ranch. I typed our address on the search bar, and the first result stopped me dead in my tracks. The date of the old article was July 17, 1936, and at the top was a picture of a man, about 5'8"", with dark hair and eyes. It was, unmistakably, Charlie. The title of the article read ""Local Man Murdered While Defending Daughter"". It seems the man we called Charlie was actually named Brian Davis. He had lived alone in the ranch with his only child, a daughter, after losing his wife to a bad case of the Flu. On the night of July 15, the article said, Mr. Davis was returning home from his job as an auto mechanic in town. When he pulled up to the house, he found the door had been forced open. He ran inside, and found a man on top of his daughter. The girl was sobbing, her dress had been ripped open, and the attacker held a knife to her throat. In a moment of sheer instinct, Mr. Davis threw himself at the intruder, tackling him of his daughter, and as he held the attacker, Mr. Davis yelled for the girl to run to the neighbors and call the police. The girl made it the mile and a half to the closest neighbor, who promptly called the sheriff. When deputies arrived, they were able to apprehend the attacker, who had been beaten half to death. Unfortunately, he had stabbed Mr. Davis three times in the chest. Brian Davis died right on our kitchen floor.",Charlie,88,nosleep

childrenofsamhain,9,,5,1rhdoj,,36,"My friend Jaime purchased a new home about six years ago when his wife was pregnant with their first child. Until recently, he lived there with his wife Claire and their two daughters, Sarah and Emily. Sarah is now five years old and Emily is three. Within the first two years living in the house, Jaime said that he never experienced anything out of the ordinary. It wasn't until his daughter Sarah was around two years old, that he started to notice she talked to herself. Jamie thought nothing of it, she was just learning to talk and he figured she was just entertaining herself. 

One afternoon when Claire was out at the grocery store, Jaime overheard his daughter in the upstairs hallway, whispering and giggling. Curious, he asked, ""Sweetie, who are you talking to?"" Sarah replied, 

""The woman standing in the hallway"".

""Is she your imaginary friend?""

""I guess."" 

Amused, he went upstairs to find her staring blankly at a wall, whispering quietly. ""What's your friends name?"" he asked her. 

""Her name is Helen Mary"", she said. 

""And what are you two whispering about?"" 

Sarah looked at him and paused before she piped ""I'm not supposed to tell you."" 

Suddenly the front door opened downstairs, and they heard Claire come through the door. Sarah rushed down the stairs to greet her. Jaime didn't think about that again for a few weeks. 

Over time, the two noticed that Sarah's interactions with ""Helen Mary"" became more frequent, but they attributed this to the fact that they had just given her the news that she was going to be a big sister. 

About two weeks before Claire gave birth to Emily, Jaime was at home alone with Sarah. He heard her playing upstairs, chatting away with her imaginary friend, when suddenly he heard glass breaking. He ran upstairs as quickly as possible to find his daughter standing in the hallway, holding a hammer. She was staring up at the wall of family pictures that were now smashed to pieces. There was glass everywhere. Jaime picked his daughter up and carried her down the stairs. He told her to stay put as he returned to the upstairs hallway to clean up the shattered fragments of their family portraits. When he returned to the living room, he asked her directly, ""Sweetie, why would you smash all of our family pictures?"" 

She looked at him, ""Helen Mary told me to do it.""

When Claire returned home that evening from her girls night with friends, Jaime told her about the incident. The crept up the stairs so as not to wake their daughter, so Claire could view the damage with her own eyes. She gasped silently at the sight. 

When they returned downstairs to the kitchen, they started to discuss possible explanations for her behavior. Suddenly, the color ran out of Claire's face and she looked at Jaime. ""There's no way she could have done that alone.""

""What?""

""There is no way she could have smashed all of those pictures by herself.""

Jaime was confused, ""I told you, I caught her with the hammer. She told me that she did it.""

But it wasn't until his wife said it aloud that it dawned on him, ""But… some of those pictures are almost five feet off the ground. How could she have reached those?""

His mind was racing, ""She must have moved a chair or something.""

She was adamant, ""There are no chairs upstairs that she is strong enough to move without you hearing it, and you would have seen her carry one upstairs, right?""

Jaime was silent. He didn't have an answer. 

They went to bed that night without any answers. The following morning their daughter had little recollection of smashing the pictures and Jamie wrote it off as sleepwalking. Though he didn't have much time to think about it, as two weeks later his second little girl was born.

Emily was two years old in the summer of 2012, and one afternoon, when Claire was at home alone with the girls, she heard Emily alone upstairs, whispering. She called up to her, ""Who you talking to, kiddo?""

""The woman standing in the hallway.""

Claire thought that her Sarah must have told her about her imaginary friend, and that she was simply trying to emulate her big sister. Then she spoke again.

""She doesn't like you, Mommy""

""Why doesn't she like me?"" Claire responded, surprised. 

""I don't know."" 

Suddenly her daughter came bounding down the stairs as if nothing had happened. Even though both Jaime and Claire both found this slightly creepy, nothing about the situation ever felt threatening or malevolent. Until one night last month.

Jaime had put the kids to sleep around eight o'clock in the evening and he and Claire had got into bed soon after. Exhausted, Jaime and his wife fell asleep extremely quickly. Jaime was awoken by the sound of screaming. He was disoriented and had no idea what time it was, but he could tell that it was his wife screaming right next to him. He turned to see what was wrong and saw it. His 3 year old daughter Emily, standing beside the bed, with a hammer in her hand. Blood poured from Claire's forehead. Jamie jumped out of bed and grabbed the hammer out of his daughters hand. He turned to his wife. She had stopped screaming now, and Jaime grabbed a towel from the bathroom and wiped the blood away from her face. She was going to be alright, but she did have a deep cut to her forehead. 

Jaime picked up his daughter and carried her out of the room. He went and checked on Sarah, who had awoken to the screaming but was clearly unharmed. He told her that everything was alright and closed her door. He was standing alone with his daughter in the upstairs hallway, and he finally asked her, ""Emily, why would you hurt Mommy?""

""She told me to, Daddy.""

""Who told you to?"" 

""The woman standing right behind you. She told me to hurt Mommy"" And then Jaime felt a chill run up his spine when his daughter leaned into his ear and whispered, ""And she told me to hurt you too, Daddy.""

I just kept clicking through - that was my greatest vice. I could have let it rest. But with every story, my blood pumped faster, my breath came quicker.

There's nothing like a good scare. Every rush of adrenaline left me wanting more. That next fix got harder to find, took longer. I grew discerning, opinionated, a veteran of the genre. Soon I was writing for myself; days spent clacking the keys and nights spent in marathon research sessions. I was a crow picking through the maggots and gore for that next juicy nibble. I was a man consumed, and like a junkie messiah I wanted to share my high with others.

Everything has a basis in reality. Think about it. Why do the holy men think your soul needs saving? Why do children fear the dark? What's there in the unknown deep, what is it that averts our gaze?

That's why I'm here now. That's why I'm writing to you. I come bringing the ultimate high. All you have to do is believe. Believe in me, in the hellish nightmares that chase after you in your sleep, in the stories you read and the movies you watch. When you believe, the hunt is on.

My stomach is in knots, every heartbeat a hammer blow against my sternum. My hands are shaking. My breath comes in stecatto bursts. I can't hold on much longer. The anticipation is mounting, building to orgasmic frenzy. I found it, the ultimate high. Or rather, it found me. All I had to do was believe. All I have to do is turn around.

lamented_dreams,4,,9,1rgqu8,,13,"I love the dark. I really do.

I don't mean going gothic and pagan and all that, but I do like the dark. I like to sit in my room for hours on end into the night watching videos, researching diseases and the supernatural, and writing stories.

Anyways, I've recently come across a quote from a game called 'Knock Knock'. And let me say, it's utterly terrifying for not just the player, but the watcher too. There's nothing but this overwhelming sense of dread throughout all of the game.

""You thought about it, and now, it is inside."" —Knock Knock

That quote has seemed to have seeped into my brain. Multiple broken theories have been written down in my notebooks and journals and I've seemed to have come to a conclusion.

The mind isn't wrong. Reality is. And, with that, imagination often holds more truth than what we accept.

Think about it. When you were a small child, things like fairytales and horror stories were much more real to your innocent mind. In fact, there is a theory that children have a sixth sense that they gradually lose as they progress into adulthood. Also when you were a child, you thought of monsters and what they would do to you as well as how terrifying they looked.

And when you thought about these things, you didn't want to turn around. Why? Because what if for the slightest moment, you were right? All those lone yellow eyes in the darkness, the sinking feeling of being watched, out of all those times, what if this was the moment you were right? Or moreover what if you were always right and they just didn't want you to know... until now.

Because honestly, we used to think the Earth was flat. Then that it had the sun revolving around us. So what makes us so absolutely sure that we are the only ones out there now?

This is my theory.

I shared with one of my colleagues about two weeks ago and five days later she called me screaming about how there was something in her house. The police showed up and they took her to the hospital. She had three slash marks down her back, resembling that of almost a wolf. She also had multiple bruises on her neck. They said there was no signs of break in and the wrecking of the house was most likely the result of her having a psychotic episode.

This could be true, but I don't like how unsettlingly close it is to when I told her about my theory.

""You thought about it, and now, it is inside.""

This is the phrase that keeps me from imagining creatures. When I went to the hospital to visit her she was curled up in the bed, shaking with her knees up as close to her chest as possible. When I asked her what happened she wouldn't tell me who, only that 'it' got inside. She just had this empty look in her eyes, something very uncommon since she was always so hyper and nice. When I asked how she just said, ""I thought about it, and it came in.""

Keep in mind I never told her about the quote at all. Those were her own words. So this is more than unsettling for me. It may be possible that this 'theory' spooked her enough for all of this to happen, but I don't like the coincidences.

angelcot,3,,2,1rh91p,,11,"Hi /r/nosleep. This is kind of embarrassing to post, but here's a few stories of things that happened to me as a kid. I was a pretty anxious kid, and a lot of weird stuff happened to me. Nothing paranormal, though There's more than just these stories, but I thought I'd at least start with this.

Ever since I was a kid, I've been afraid of windows. That's not saying much, though. I was afraid of just about everything else, too. But growing up, my house was full of big windows. Floor-to-ceiling windows in the family room, two sliding glass doors in the dining room, a huge window that looked out from our kitchen into the front yard. My mom never bought curtains or blinds for any of the windows other than the ones in our bedrooms because she'd get depressed if it were too dark in our house. 

I had light blue curtains in my bedroom that my grandmother sewed for me since my windows were an irregular size. Every night I would pull them closed, then pin them down to the walls with a pushpin so that I wasn't able to see even a sliver of the outside out of the corner of my eye. My bedroom window looked out on the backyard. I remember being so irritated whenever someone would accidentally leave the back porch light on. The light would shine through my light blue curtains and play shadows on my wall. I'd cover my head with my pillow so that I could fall asleep without worrying if I would be able to make out the silhouette of someone trying to peer through my curtains, still pinned to the wall. 

From a young age, I had problems with insomnia. My mom struggled with it, too. I remember my dad telling me stories of when my parents were still married, when my mom would wake him up just to talk because she still wasn't asleep at 4, 5, 6 in the morning. I remembered feeling envious that I didn't have someone to do that to. I listened to books on tape at bedtime to fill the silence. Sometimes I would sneak into my brothers' room and lay on their floor, hoping for sleep to come. Being uncomfortably aware of how their curtains weren't drawn completely closed. 

When I was 10, I moved from my room- which overlooked the backyard- to my brothers' room, and my brothers separated and took over my room, and the office. My new room was at the front of the house. If my curtains were open, someone could easily look in as they walked up the path to our front door. During the day, I didn't mind it. I could watch for my friends or packages from the postman. At night, it made me so anxious I began to develop a habit of vomiting nightly. My mom was sympathetic, but didn't know what to do about it. A year later, I was moved back into my old room, and my older brother moved back into his. I stopped vomiting every night. 

I feel like I had a reason for being so afraid of windows. One night- I must have been about 6 or 7- I was up late, as usual, listening to *Ralph S. Mouse* on tape for the billionth time. I had emptied the glass of water that my mom had gotten for me, so I got up to refill it. I was already wary of windows, so I kept my head down on my way to the kitchen. I'd often see things out of the corner of my eye; something moving, or something that *could* have been the shadow of a human, but would later try to convince myself it was nothing.

Even with my head down, something outside caught my attention. A car, parked in front of my house. I lived at the very bottom of a cul-de-sac, so we didn't have a lot of people drive down our street at night and stop to reorient themselves. The car had its headlights on, and I could tell there was someone sitting in the car. Looking at my house. I don't know if they were looking at me, but my paranoia told me they were. I stood there for a long time, forgetting about my glass of water. I didn't look away. Paralyzed, until my mom came in the kitchen. She'd seen my door was open and wondered what I was doing up. When she noticed the car in front of our house, she quieted and gently pushed me out of the kitchen and back to my bedroom. I noticed the car started to drive away as I was ushered away from the window. 

This staring contest with the person in the car in front of my house happened twice more, although over the course of a few months. Once, they switched their headlights off, and stayed for what might have been 45 minutes. Although my memory might be exaggerating. I still don't understand why I was so afraid of seeing someone in my bedroom window, but how I could fearlessly stare out of the kitchen window at the person in the parked car. Maybe I felt less vulnerable in the kitchen. Maybe I was comforted by the fact that they were so far away. Even though the walk from where they parked was just a few seconds from my front door and the window I was looking out. 

The third and final time I saw the car, the person got out of their car. They were tall, and I could see them standing on the other side of their car but I still wasn't able to make out their face. When they started to walk around their car and- I assume- towards my front door, I scurried back to my bed. 

I never liked sleepovers as a kid. Staying over at a friends house meant laying awake on their floor for hours with nothing to listen to but the sound of their calm breathing. Nothing to look at except for the sliver of their window I could see from behind their curtains. Having friends at my house was just as stressful. Usually we'd sleep in the family room, because it had a TV in it. It also had the floor-to-ceiling windows. Usually I would sneak off to my own room after my friends had fallen asleep, so that I could sleep peacefully away from those big windows. 

When I was about 8 years old, I was having a sleepover with a few of my friends. It was after 10, so my friends were starting to fall asleep. I knew I still had *at least* two or three more hours of being wide awake. I was laying on the couch, swaddled in my blanket. The TV was still on, but I'd turned the volume down for my sleeping friends to something barely audible. Usually, I tried to keep my eyes away from the windows. But that night my cat caught my attention, meowing and hissing at something outside. I cautiously looked out the window, worried about what my cat might have seen out there. Just another cat, skittering in front of the window. Relieved, I looked out at my dark backyard. Was that it? 

There was a man in my backyard, walking around. Even with the distance, I distinctly remember he was frowning. He had his hands in his pockets. I did not know this man. 

I woke up one of my friends, whispering in her ear and telling her there was somebody in the backyard. She stirred quickly, obviously alarmed, and looked outside. She saw him too. I'm not sure if he felt our little eyes on him or what, but he turned to face us. Neither of us made a move; not to lay back down and pretend we were asleep, not even to look at each other, or look away. 

There were a pair of french doors that lead to the back patio in my family room, right in the middle of the wall of windows. The man walked up to the doors and tapped on one of the small window panes. The handle of what looked to be a heavy flashlight hung out of the pocket of his sweatshirt. He smiled at us. Not a deranged smile, not a smile that looked too wide for his face. Just a calm, warm smile. He mouthed something and pointed at the doorknob. I was never very good at reading lips. I stared straight ahead, unblinking, not responding. I could hear my friends' breath, heavy and shaking. 

He spoke, the sound of his voice muffled through the glass, ""Open the door."" A pause, he knit his eyebrows together like he was concerned. ""I'm visiting your parent. Let me in."" 

My heart was beating out of my chest. I was a paranoid enough little kid to not fall for this line. I mustered up every ounce of courage I had in my little, anxious, 8-year-old body, and got up off the couch. For a moment, they man at the door looked relieved. I ran out of the room, screaming for my mom. I could hear my friend call out at me that he was leaving, and the rest of my friends starting to stir. I told my mom what had happened. She turned on all the outside lights and called the police while my step-dad looked out every window for any signs of the man. All of the girls at my sleepover had their moms come over and pick them up. I cried, and stayed the night in my parents bed, although I'm pretty sure I didn't sleep.

In my mom's bathroom, there was a big window that looked out at the sideyard. The glass was distorted, though, so my mom never bothered putting a curtain over it. You couldn't see into the bathroom if you were just passing by the window. If you stopped to press your face against the glass, you could see in or out, but everyone in the house knew not to do that when they were in the sideyard. I remember my mom shrieking one night, running out of the bathroom, saying she'd seen something through the glass. A rat, climbing up the windowsill and staring into the bathroom.

I always liked my mom's shower more than the one in my bathroom. My bathroom didn't have a fan in it, so the whole bathroom would get uncomfortably humid. The shower curtain in my bathroom reminded me too much of that scene from *Psycho*, too, and I'd always shower with the shower curtain pulled open, and I'd get water all over the floor. My mom's shower had a glass door that I liked much more, even if there was that big window I could see clearly from the shower. 

Once when I was 12, I was showering in my mom's bathroom because my parents were out of town. My brothers were home, but were playing video games in the family room. I would keep my head down when I showered in my mom's bathroom. Even if the window's glass was hard to see through, it was still a window, and the shower was the most vulnerable place I could think of being looked at. Every once and a while, I would glance up to quell my growing anxiety. To tell myself *nothing was out there*. 

Cautiously, I looked up to satisfy my anxiety. *Nothing was out there*, I told myself. My gaze met the window. There was a dark figure pressed up against the glass. Through the foggy, wet shower door, I couldn't see anything. All I know was that it was *somebody*. I screamed, and ducked down past the tiles so that whoever was out there, they couldn't see me. A few moments later, I heard my brothers knocking at the door, both of them calling my name and asking if I was ok. I pulled a towel from outside the shower and wrapped myself up before I stood up. Whoever was out there was gone. 

A few weeks later, my friends and I were playing in the side yard. There was a huge tree out there that we liked to climb in, and pretend we were characters from X-Men or Sonic. My friend called my attention to something in the grass, over by the window of my mom's bathroom. A polaroid picture of the distorted glass of the window it lay in front of.  ",Windows.,13,nosleep
Spudz_OCD,6,,6,1rgcw5,,9,"Hey redditors, im new at this so excuse my writing skills

All through my life ive had things happen that i just couldn't explain, i've told a couple of friends but even they don't know what to say.

My story begins when i was a kid about the age of six or seven, we lived in a poor neighbourhood in southern Ireland and had a shithole of a house, i lived in a room with my two brothers (kyle[8-9  at the time], and Dylan[3-4]) and had been for a couple of years so i was used to sharing a room. The first incident occurred after about a year in the house (our street was built on a graveyard) and happenned in our room. it was an ordinary day before it happenned, woke up, ate breakfast, went to school, nothing out of the ordinary. however when i came home from school that day, there was something odd about the house, I couldn't quite tell what it was but it just felt wrong. But being a kid at the time, i thought nothing of it and carried on with my daily routine. after dinner and a shower my mom put us to bed. After my mom turned out the lights and left the room, i began to drift off to sleep. after about an hour and a half of hazy dreams, i was suddenly awoken by a loud crashing sound, kind of like if you dropped a frying pan, i quiclky jumped up my pillow and sat upright in bed. I looked over to Dylan's bed at the other side of the room, he ws still asleep. I began to question if i had actually heard it at all. feeling curious i checked if kyle was awake (we had a bunk-bed, Kyle was on top) as i was climbing the four step ladder, i felt a burst of cold air rush from kyles bed and immediately dropped to the ground, waking up Kyle.
""what are you doing"", he said.
""i heard a noise so i wanted to see if--""
""--sshh"", he stopped me mid sentance, and focused his gaze to the back of the room; The look on his face will be forever imprinted into my mind. I turned around gingerly and what i saw was scary enough to make me cringe even today. I saw a scrawny black figure hunched over Dylan, who was still asleep. But this figure was definately not human; It was at least 7 feet tall, it's head was overpoweringly large compared to it's beyond anorexic body. It's fingers were 6-7 inches long minimum. From what i saw it wore nothing, but it very well could have, as it was late at night and i was still half asleep. Then the image that will haunt me forever; It, whatever it was, turned towards me and Kyle. It just stood there, staring at us for what felt like forever, it then jumped towards us and simply vanished into thin air right before it hit me. I was left lying on the floor and Kyle was wondering if what we had just seen was actually real. I looked at him and back to Dylan's bed, whatever it as, when it jumped it jumped with enough force to push the blanket off the end of Dylan's bed. I looked back towards Kyle, who was already asleep again, and decided to go back to sleep myself, not knowing if what we'd seen that night was just a figment of our imagination or not.
When i woke up the following morning i hesitantly asked my mom and sister if they'd seen or heard anything last night..they didn't. So i questioned kyle about it and he said that he had no idea what i was on about, he had no memory of seeing or hearing anything, he didnt even remember me falling off the bunk ladder.
To this day i still cant quite figure out what happened that night.

My second experience was only four or five years ago, a couple of months after moving to Australia. We were living in a pretty old house at the time so it was a bit creaky and what not. it was a pretty average day when it happenned;I was 14 and I was once again in bed at the time. I was sharing a room with Dylan (10) at the time. Kyle (16) was in a room across the hallway, Jenny (12) was the next door down and my parent's room was at the end of the hallway. It was about 11-12 at night, and we were all just about asleep. My mom and step-father at the time were out exploring the wild clubs of Surfers Paradise, so it ws just us kids. I was almost asleep when i heard slight footsteps coming from the kithcen area. I wondered who it was considering we were all in bed, so i opened the door to check. I headed towards the kitchen, once i reached the living room (about half-way to kitchen from my room) i could see into the kitchen, i slowly emerged from the wall; no one there..weird, i thought, so i headed back to my room, but as soon as i turned around Kyle was standing right in front of me with a knife. I jumped quicker than i'd ever jumped before. Kyle then laughed his head off and went back to bed. I did the same without the laughing.. I was back in my room, now lying in bed realising im too awake to go back to sleep. i just lay there for about five minutes staring at the ceiling untill i heard more footsteps in the kitchen. I called out
""Kyle, go to bed, idiot""
""i am you fuckwit"", he said as he emerged from his room half asleep
""well then who's upstairs?"" i asked
""It's probably just a possum in the attic or something don't worry""
I regretfully closed the door and went back to bed. But as soon as i did, loud heavy footsteps started making their way down the hallway, along with heavy thumping on the walls, they were getting closer and a hell of a lot louder, It sounded like someone was trying to stomp and bash rats out of the walls and floor. It kept coming closer and increasing in volume until it was at the point where it was like gunshots right outside my room. It then stomped right outside my door and my door swung open with extreme noise and force and standing at the door was, i shit you not, the same tall, black scrawny fucked up figure that i saw years ago. I practically shat myself. It stood there for a couple of seconds, but if felts like hours, then started stomping and sprinted towards my moms room. I don't know why but i instantly got up and ran towards the door and looked towards my moms room; nothing there, it vanished again. I dropped to the ground in shock, just as Kyle open his door and screamed ""WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT"" 
""It's back"" ,i said
""What's back?""
""the thing i saw hunched over Dylan""
I stayed up all night that night not wanting to sleep knowing that thing followed us to Australia

My most recent encounter with our old friend was last year. We'd moved into an old complex of houses that had a bit of a history in the crime side of things. We'd been living there for about 6 months and my friend from primary school, Jordan, was now living in the complex too. It was around 5PM and it was just Jordan Kyle and I in the house. I was playing my i-pod at the time, Kyle was in the kitchen and Jordan was behind me. Kyle decided to pick up a coin and throw it at an unsuspecting Jordan, who surprisingly, caught it, and returned fire. but then Jordan moved a little backwards and Kyle threw it further and harder. The coin flew through the air right past my head and stopped rigth in front of Jordans face, IT LITERALLY STOPPED IN MID AIR, it stood still in front of his face for less than a second and then was propelled back towards Kyle with nearly twice the force. We all just stood there speechless, not knowing if that had really just happened. Later that day we were showing a friend what had happened  and were back in the Kitchen messing around with coins to see if it would happen again. When suddenly a ball flew through the air at Kyle, like it had been thrown with force from the stairs leading upstairs. For the second time that day we were utterly speechless and had no idea what to do.
That night after Jordan had left and Kyle went to bed, i was making a late night snack. Dylan was in the living room watching TV and there was nobody else in the house. I finished making the snack and was about to head into the living room when in the corner of my eye, I saw the figure that i had seen twice before glide upstairs; same height, same scrawniness, same long fingers only this time it was a little misty, like a shadow, and it looked right into my eyes as it vanished upstairs.
I am still wondering what the actual fuck that figure is, all i know is that my mother has become a claire-voyant.I know for a fact that there is definately going to be a lot more of this thing which i have nicknamed ""the figure"".

For the time being i will keep an eye out for my little follower and if i see him/her again i will not hesitate to report the time, date, and details of the situation and of course reddit the fuck out of it.
for now redditors, i bid you farewell

the_dark_half,5,,1,1rhyj5,,7,"You know that feeling when you’re all alone and hear your name whispered? Maybe you’ve walked into a room only to suddenly feel a sudden temperature drop? Had things go missing only to re-appear in odd places? Maybe you’re like me and you lie in bed at night, only to feel like someone stroking your hair but when you become fully conscious and turn around, nothing. 
Think you walk through a cobweb or hair falls on your arms or neck and brushes against your skin delicately, tickling you? You check and nothing was there? I’m sure your parents tell you it’s nothing from a young age; perhaps because they themselves are deluded enough to believe that it is their imagination. They probably deep down fear it’s a ghost or apparition. Even they couldn’t know how much worse it really is.  Stop deluding yourself. It’s not a cobweb. It’s not the wind. It’s not nothing. It’s something far more sinister, an insidious force which slowly grows stronger the more you feed it your fear and attention. 

Some of you, I’m sure, will be fortunate enough only to feel cold spots and occasionally hear creaks and footsteps in your house. It’s such a common occurrence that people barely notice it and if they do, it’s the spookiest part of a generic horror movie, because those suits in Hollywood haven’t seen what these creatures are really capable of. If you believe in the paranormal you may experience the whispers of what I can only loosely refer to as their ‘voices’. I’m sure not many of you have had the misfortune to awaken to them standing over your bed, taking the forms of whatever creatures or person your subconscious fears most because it’s real form is so terrifying you’d probably die instantly or become paralysed with fear, a zombie-esque state you’ll never awaken from-and that would ruin their fun too early. If you don’t die instantly, seeing their faces will make your eyes bleed; hearing their voices unrestrained will shatter your ear drums and I’ve heard of cases where insides have been liquefied, skin melting and bleeding seeping out of every pore.

The first time I awoke to one in my room with me, it was after I’d given the footsteps and banging on the walls attention. I had thought it was cool, I even bought a stupid Ouija board and told them it was okay for them to try and talk to me. I had been lying in bed after a night of drinking so I passed off the initial taunts and laughs as nothing more than my intoxicated imagination, until my door slowly opened and in came one large hairy leg, followed by more spindly legs, followed by many eyes and two huge fucking fangs. Yep, a giant spider, bigger than a horse came into my room. I tried to scream, but that just resulted with me hyperventilating, then vomiting all over the floor. It strode in, all beady eyes on me and as it slinked atop my bed I tried to pathetically crawl away, but it held me down with its two front legs, piercing into the flesh of my shoulders as I whimpered like a small animal about to be devoured-which I was.  I felt the sharp pain of its fangs tear through my skin and inject me with poison that made my blood burn. I lay in bed, delirious, desperate, muttering for help. My ears were greeted with a cacophony of voices, screaming horrible things that were so foul that before that night had been unimaginable to me. I passed out shortly after, from fear, blood loss or the venom and awoke a few days later, believing to have all been a dream. I clung to that hope until I stepped outside my bedroom door and found dozens of small animals, birds mostly, wrapped up in what appeared to be spider’s webs, discoloured, drained of their blood and insides. All dead. I ran to the bathroom to throw up and caught sight of myself, dried blood caked on my body and face, puncture wounds all over me and strands of silky web still wrapped around my breasts, my stomach, my legs and in my hair. 

The second night I encountered one of them, they took the form of my uncle. I lived with my uncle for nearly 5 years while my father was travelling almost every week for business. I know my father loved me and desperately needed the money that he had to work from dawn until way after the sun set and had to leave me for long periods. He didn’t know what his brother did to me. That night as I became increasingly aware of the noises in my apartment and the feelings of someone touching me and whispering in my ear, I rolled over to see my uncle grinning at me. He crawled onto the bed and tied me down. I struggled, but when I did he beat me with his belt, like he had started doing when I was eight years old. I fought as hard as I could, tears burning my eyes and sobbing uncontrollably, but he kept cutting away at my clothes with a pocket knife and telling me to be a good girl. The torture that night lasted for many hours, possibly days. I try not to remember it. I thought I had moved on from those childhood years and buried them a few years ago, when my uncle died. This was not the last time the monsters took on forms like this to break me. They’ve only grown stronger with every drop of blood, with every scream and with every hopeless sob I’ve given them.

Their true form will only appear to you in dreams at first because they get to torment you in ways that won’t instantaneously butcher you or drive you insane, yet; they like to take their time with their toys. The dreams for me started after those incidents. I have seen what those beings really look like and…just thinking about it is enough for me to start violently shaking, unable to stop retching. The other day I wasn’t careful and thought about one of them and a stranger had to hold me back as I unconsciously started walking in front of a train. In my dreams, it is pure hell as they have my undivided attention for hours and can do whatever they want to me without my body breaking and bending the way it would in the waking world, but it all feels real. 
Part of me stares at length of rope on my coffee table and considers leaving this torment…but what if when I die, I get sent to their realm, to be their plaything forever? 

It’s not just the occasional brush against my skin, the odd floor creak and the rare moment of ‘is someone calling my name?’ Now I feel them on me at all times, their rough, sharp skin cutting mine, scratching me, violating every single part of my body. Their voices scream and howl at me, maniacally taunting and laughing at my never-ending misery. Even when I shut my eyes, I still see them, their hideous beings beyond any words the human language has to describe them to you. 

Most of you think of those household noises and strange occurrences as the work of ghosts, of spirits. Yes, it is so comforting for humans to believe these presences are the souls of dead people who are just sad and wandering, isn’t it? You want to be able to talk to someone no longer alive; you open your mind and let them in. Don’t. What’s out there isn’t human, it isn’t some person with unfinished business, what’s out there wants you to think that, to get comfortable with inviting it in and letting yourself become aware of it. 

Did you just hear that faint noise outside your window, like a soft breeze carrying a faint whisper? That creak outside your room? That faint sensation on your flesh? I hope not, because now you know what’s really there and they’ve always known about you.",Don't give them attention.,8,nosleep
Rhapsodeyus,1,,0,1rgtyq,,8,"Some may recall a story I posted a few months back, about shadow-like figures who visited me on a mission for knowledge, and afterwards, disappeared like ghosts. For those who do not recall, the story is [Curious Visitors](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l4dv2/curious_visitors/).

If you have not read that, well, you probably haven't missed much, but it will help with the backstory for this one if you do read it.

Done reading? Good, let's continue.

This happened last night, Sunday, November 24th, 2013. I woke up at precisely 4:27 AM, and I know this because I watched my small digital alarm clock on my bedside table flip to 4:27 AM as my eyes opened. I also noticed that my lamp was off (I sleep with the light on for safety reasons, since living with cats can be hazardous). However, I could see my plain, black clock in a pale blueish light.

My brain clicked. ""My laptop is on. I must have left it on and the power went out, so it's running on battery."" Then I remembered, quite clearly, turning it off and closing it before going to bed. That's when I felt a weight at the end of my bed, sitting in front of my laptop.

I sat up, looked, and spotted a shadowy figure sitting in front of my laptop. The NoSleep submission form was up. I coughed, and said quietly, ""You could have asked."" Instead of, say, a sudden spin and a glare from Brarger, as I expected, my visitor vanished instantly.

I didn't expect that, and it startled me thoroughly. My previous visitors would never have been so rude, and certainly would have asked my permission to access my personal computer. I shifted, tossed the covers aside, and moved to the end of the bed, to read what it had written.

I now wish I hadn't.

JUVIE_MAKER,2,,1,1rhq9j,,8,"I have a nose for things. No seriously, all my life I’ve had a very strong sense of smell and I don’t mean for the average person. I have an abnormally, freakishly, ridiculously, absurd sense of smell. It’s been that way since I was a kid. Here’s a prime example, when I was about four or five I used to visit my grandmother (god rest her soul) every month in Daytona Beach for the summer. My grandmother was notorious for making the best homemade cakes in the neighborhood. I would always leave my Gran’s house at least ten pounds heavier each summer after gorging myself on her delicious treats. One Saturday, after a day of playing outside (when kids used to play outside!) I instantly smelled the aroma of cake wafting through the air, but something was…..off. There was another smell lingering behind the cake scent. It was kinda tangy, bitter, sorta nutty …just all around unpleasant. Being so young, I couldn’t quite put my finger on what the smell was but I knew I didn’t like it. Then out comes my Gran from the kitchen with a big slice of her freshly made cake on a china plate. She passes the dining room table and spots me standing there with my nose crinkled up in disgust.

Gran:  What’s the matter baby? Come sit at the table and have a slice of cake.

Five year old me: I aint eating that cake, it smells funny!

(Let me just interject for a second.  Now if your family is old school like mine, you know that a child is to NEVER disrespect an elder’s cooking! Especially if that elder is a family member, you just don’t do it! That is unless you want a black eye, ribs broken, missing teeth… you get the picture.)

Gran: Girl, get your hind parts over here and eat this cake before I slap the hell out of you!!

Oh geez…there’s that tone. You know it, you know it well. That angry deep tone that resonates from parents when their truly pissed off. You know… that voice that scares the living shit out of you and gives you’re delicate child-like mind nightmares for a month (or your whole life). Yeah that’s what I was hearing right about then. But still I was adamant. I would not eat that damn cake. That smell! It was just too potent. Now, you might be thinking, what’s the big deal? Surely you’ve smelled worse things than that cake before, which is very true. At that point in my life I’d smelled worse things before (WAY WORSE) but I’d never been subjected to eat those things either. Also, the stench of that pastry….it was just… so very not right. I was only a child but I was still old enough to know right from wrong, and that cake was definitely wrong! Even at that very moment I could taste its bitterness in the back of my mouth. With every inhale it burned and tingled down my throat.

Gran: Come over here and take this plate now!

Okay at this point I knew I was in REAL trouble. Even if my grandmother didn’t kill me, I was pretty sure I was in for the ass whooping of my life! I slowly started to back away from Gran as she moved closer to me with that dreaded cake. Even as she inched towards me that smell seem too magnify. With every step she took it grew more and more intense! “Girl, you better take this cake!” she yelled holding the plate out in front of her. I turned to run but she quickly snatched up my arm before I could get away. “No!” I shouted feverishly trying to pull away from her grip, “I don’t want the cake, granny!!” but my pleas of desperation came to no avail. My grandmother started to tug me towards the kitchen table, her fingers angrily wrapped around my tiny forearm. Suddenly, she yanked me forward making my body jump about two feet in her direction, tilting my face towards hers. She looked down at me with an awful glare. Dark hollow eyes glowered down from Gran’s wrinkled sockets. Her once loving face was now rigid and stiff with a sadistic expression that I had by no means seen before. “You will eat this cake!” She shouted through gritted teeth. “Even if I have to shove it down your throat piece by piece!” 

I had never seen this side to my Gran before. My once sweet, devoted granny had turned into this vicious monster plucked straight out of my worst nightmares. My small frame quaked in fear and tears began to seep from my eyes. I had never known terror like this. My insides loosened and squirmed like jelly making the contents of my bladder empty and leak down my legs. To say I was afraid would be the understatement of the freakin decade! But you know what? There was something else I was more fearful of. Even as I pissed myself in sheer horror from the presence of my devil-like grandmother, there was still something more bloodcurdling, more utterly terrifying than her…that fucking cake! 

“NO!!!!!!!” echoed from my lips in a banshee scream and with all the strength I possessed I juggernauted into my grandmother. My body throttled into her torso head first making a loud solid grunt bellow from the old woman. Her arms flew in the air (letting me go in the same instance) and her vast body collapsed backwards before suddenly….CRACK!
The sound of my grandmother’s head crashing along the rim of her kitchen table splintered throughout the house. Gran thudded to the ground like a sack of potatoes and the plate with the cake she so firmly held onto shattered on the floor. I stared at her lifeless body as blood began to seep through her head and flow on the linoleum. I was still too little to know the true meaning of life and death but I did know for sure that red liquid was not suppose to be running out of her head like that. I bent down and looked into Gran’s half opened eyes. They weren’t black any more. They’d gone back to their normal brown again. Not really knowing what to do I just stared down at the gruesomeness of it all, watching the chunks of yellow cake absorb the blood until each piece was just as red. 

To make a long story short the police were eventually called. My Gran’s weekly bridge game was on that day and a couple of her elder counterparts found her body, and me sitting in a pool of piss and blood staring at it. Needless to say there were lots of screams. Oh, and you’re probably wondering what that smell was, right? I actually didn’t find out until I was well into my teens what exactly it was. I was pouring it into my foster parent’s coffee one morning when it finally hit me…Cyanide. From the smell of it, Gran probably couldn’t have used too much either. Maybe half a teaspoon, give or take; totally undetectable to the average person’s nose…but not to mine. “So that’s what that was, go figure”.  I remember thinking that to myself as I stirred the cyanide into two mugs. My foster parents passed away later on that day, I wish I could say I feel sadness over it but I really don’t.  I was more consumed with thoughts on why my grandmother was trying to kill me? Was it because of what I’d done to Oscar, her cute little Maltese? I mean, if I’d known the oven wasn’t a suitable place to put a dog I might have done things differently. I was only two at the time. Or perhaps it had something to do with what happened with Mommy…that really was unfortunate. I didn’t want to hurt her, but she was an obstacle that just had to be removed. 

But anyways, that’s neither here nor there. I’m an adult now and those days are long behind me. I’m actually on my way to my boyfriend’s…excuse me….ex-boyfriend’s apartment right now. I’m visiting him and that slut he cheated on me with. And guess what? They just had a baby, isn’t that the sweetest thing.  ",A nose for things...,9,nosleep
1234FUCK,7,,4,1rhjmk,,6,"So my uncle has always been into the paranormal and he got me into paranormal investigation, Or ghost hunting to simplify it a few years back. Well I go with him on a lot of them and we do it for free for people who think something paranormal is going on in their houses. I always saw it as a nice little hobby to do on the weekends to blow of some time and I always liked being scared. I mean that’s how I even know about this sub-reddit because I like reading it. And that’s one of the only reasons I knew about what had happened on my last investigation. 


	We got a call from a family out in the middle of the country saying they had begun hearing weird voices when they were each alone but the 16 year old son was the one who had it happen the most. I went through every scenario I could think on the way there, Something was legitimately going on that was paranormal, one of the kids was lying and was fucking with the rest of the family and other such things. Well when we got there we talked with the family and everyone seemed happy except the two children. The son was as I said earlier 16 and the girl was 14, they seemed uneasy looking off into corners and such. I took a note about it but didn’t dwell on it that much. We went around the house marking places we would put cameras and getting the lay out of the house. Once we finished that we went back to our van and started getting ready. After we set up all of our equipment we each got our POV (Point of view) cameras strapped on and started our investigation. My Uncle took the upstairs, our colleague took the first floor, And I went into the basement to do a little investigating of my own. 


I made my way downstairs and grabbed my Walky-talky and radioed my uncle asking if everyone was ready for me to hit the main light breaker. He gave me the go ahead and I flipped the little switch plunging the whole house into darkness I held up the other camera I had with me so I could have a camera move around freely ( plus it had a night vision setting so I could see where I was going.) Well I turned it on and walked slowly to the chair I had placed in the room so I could sit comfortably waiting for something to happen. And after an hour or so of me questioning the darkness.. It answered back.
My instincts kicked in and I put a call in on the radio for everyone to tell me where they were. And everyone was exactly where they said they were supposed to be. My heart froze in my throat from fear but excitement so I stood and asked who I was talking to and I heard a small wispy chuckle before it said softly “You know who I am.” I swallowed hard before continuing to walk around the room and asking questions. It stayed silent for a few questions before I asked why it was here. It chuckled again before I heard a small sound. Like a door knob jiggling and I turned towards it. My camera landed on a door knob sticking out from a sheet that I guess had covered it before. I walked towards it slowly pulling the sheet off to reveal a shabby door about waist height with peeling paint and scratch marks.  I put in a call on the radio telling my uncle and the others I had found something and for them to meet me in the basement. I got no answer back but I assumed they had gotten the message. My uncle did that a lot; he tended to get over excited with these things so I figured he was just trying to get here as fast as possible.  But the paranormal curiosity ran in the family so I reached down and grabbed the knob, it was warm as if someone had been holding it for a longtime. I steadied myself before twisting it and pushing it open. 


I looked through my camera screen as I walked into the door. The atmosphere around me seemed to change instantly, even though all the lights in the house was off it just seemed to be darker and colder in here the basement itself.  I looked around in the room through the screen until I saw a lone chair in the center of the room. I walked forward until I was right next to it and then began looking around more. I jumped a bit at the bright light on my screen until I noticed it was a mirror. It was bolted onto a beam  next to the chair and when I looked to the left I noticed the same thing. I thought it was really strange so I walked around the front of the chair and accidentally kicked something over.  It was loud and then I heard a sound of rushing water. My heart leapt into my throat as I looked down and around looking for the source until my camera came upon a metal bucket slightly rolling with water coming out. I also saw a candle and a small match book and that’s when it hit me. My whole body filled with fear as the realization flooded my head…. This was a “three kings” set up.


 I turned towards the door pointing the camera as I looked through it I saw the door slam and I stopped. My whole body froze from pure terror and it took me a few seconds before I let out a scream for help. After I stopped I heard the soft chuckle come from behind me in the darkness and I just stood there with my eyes closed shaking as I felt a soft breath on the back of my neck I heard a voice.. My voice whisper right into my ear. “ Do you know who I am now?” I stood there for a second before screaming again and then I heard the door bust open and I saw flash lights on me and my uncle asking what was wrong. I just ran from the room to the breaker box and flipped on all the lights. I then sank to the floor looking at him as he sat next to me and asked all that happened. I just held out my camera to him and he took it. Before he watched it he asked me why I didn’t call for back up and I looked at him before telling him that I did. He looked at our colleague before watching the recording.


 After that he asked me if we all went in together would I go back in. I nodded as long as we kept the lights on and we went in. and it was as I thought. It was a set up for “ The three kings.” I shuddered as I turned to my uncle asking if he knew what it was. He didn’t so I explained it to him and I pointed to the bucket “ and it has been used recently. The bucket was full of water. “ My uncle nodded to me and put a wrap on the investigation. We went back home and I have decided to type this up. Tomorrow we will be going and talking to the family about what happened and who had done the three kings in the house.  


I think the three kings set up has something to do with what has been happening at the house. I will update you all on what happens after we talk to them.

OsamaBinHiding,3,,1,1rhxdo,,6,"Last night was like every other night for me. Have dinner on my own in my small, yet cost flat and watch a little bit of TV. Around 9 or 10 o'clock, I start to crack on with some work as I had a university deadline in a couple days time. The minutes started going faster and before I knew it it was 12 o""clock. 

""Where did the time go?"" I thought. It had only felt like a few minutes. However, this was a normal occurrence for me. The world kind of, disappears when I get lost in a train of thought and for the life of me, I can't break out of it.

I had just remembered that I had a seminar early in the morning and suddenly thought ""Fuck, I better try and get some sleep"" 

See, I live in an old building that has been converted into flats in the suburbs of a major city. So it isn't uncommon to hear floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and all the walls are very thin so noises in the middle of the night just tend to go over my head. I wouldn't consider myself someone who doesn't get scared easily but when you're familiar with floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and branches tapping your window - you tend to grow some thick skin.

Last night wasn't like any other night in my flat though. 

As I mentioned earlier, I was alone. My flatmate - let's call him, Evan for the sake of the story, was away celebrating thanksgiving with his family but he's away a lot so I'm used to spending a long period of time on my own. My usual night routine of showering, brushing my teeth and cleaning the kitchen was over and I went into my room to finally rest my head for the night and that was when I first noticed something. My drawers were all pulled open. 

To most people, this is probably nothing - but for me it wasn't normal. I suffer from borderline OCD and everything, especially in my room needs to be in order and I remember waking up and everything was in order. I hadn't left my flat today either. 

""I'm too tired for this shit"" I thought and went to bed. 

It's weird though isn't it? That something like a mattress and a duvet can make you feel so safe, like nothing can hurt you. I remember being a child and I made sure none of my limbs were outside of my bed incase something grabbed me in the middle of the night. Such a feeble piece of furniture can make you feel so safe.

Well, not anymore for me. Last night I heard the usual creaking of the floorboards - no biggy, right? However, as I drew closer to conscientious, I realised that these creaking sounds weren't coming from the surrounding walls and neighbouring flats but they were coming from under my bed.

And that's when I felt the unmistakable sensation of a cold, coarse finger stroking mine over the side of my bed.

TaylorBonaseraSr,0,,2,1rhb2e,,5,"I can explain why I'm so afraid of mirrors, or anything that could reflect light, even a glass door. It's so difficult for me to talk about it sometimes, but other times I feel her pressing me on to tell as many people about her as possible. She broke my mirror the first time, just crashed right through the glass and shattered the glass into a literal hundred pieces. It was such a pain to have to clean all that up. I got at least five cuts. But she didn't care. At the very least she didn't laugh at me or yell at me to clean faster. At least she was nice enough to check herself for that. Anyway, I got my mirror replaced. She didn't break the bathroom mirror again, but she broke the great mirror in the hallway while she was running through it. I don't understand how she did it, it's pressed up right against the wall. She'd have to ram her body sideways. She didn't even have any visible cuts. She told me she was sorry, and that she would try not to do it again. I believed her, and she was true to her word. But soon enough, I hear the crashing again. But this time it's my door. The majority of my glass door has been smashed through, but the weird thing is that the hole is shaped like Quasimodo. No one lives here that has a body shaped like that. The other times I checked her she didn't have any cuts on her, but this time she was bleeding so much from every part of her body that she had to go to the hospital. I had to sit there and watch her, but she couldn't explain what had happened. When the doctor asked, neither could I, because I hadn't been there. It's strange how selective she is; she won't smash into anything except mirrors or glass-looking things. Anywhere there isn't this kind of stuff, nothing bad happens. She tells me that she feels so cold whenever she walks by something like that, and she gets an uncontrollable urge to destroy it. She talks to me about it so often I feel like I'm beginning to share the feeling.

It's starting to unnerve me, and I don't want to live with her anymore. But I can't break the joint liability contract. She told me to cover all the things in the house that could possibly create a reflection, so I did. But I find her desperately tearing off the covers when she thinks I'm not looking.

One day I'd had enough so I decided to take off one of the covers in my room. It couldn't hurt, just for a little while when she couldn't see. She wouldn't notice. But after a minute of reveling in my refreshed reflection, I saw her standing there. So close. She was so ugly. She copied my expression and mocked my horrified face. She followed me here, to my own room. I couldn't turn around. There was no point. I felt a pressure from her on my shoulders so great I couldn't keep a straight posture. She was laughing at me.

But I'd heard that laugh somewhere before. And I'd seen that face before too. It looked so much like my own. She must have heard my thoughts, because she said she told me to never look at her by means of a reflection. I couldn't stand the sight of her face anymore, it was so scary. It'd been such a long time since I'd spent so many minutes just staring at her. I had to take control. So I bashed the bedroom mirror in, balling my bare hands into fists and repeatedly thrashing until I could feel the glass cutting into my skin.

It'd been so long since I'd last done that. Now every time I look, I can see her, feel her, I see her staring at her...our...reflection, through my eyes.",My Blank Mirror,7,nosleep
SeaDweller7,2,,2,1rhilw,,4,"I go to a regular school, its kindergarten to year twelve, so its pretty big. But, my school is an old public school, and the principle is ancient. Me? I am in year twelve, and I’m graduating next year, and my friends said I should share this story with you guys. 

Ok, where to start? Well, at my school we have a pretty serious problem with bullies, and when I say serious I mean it. One year our school was even on the news, but it was pretty traumatic. When I was in year nine, there was this little girl in fifth grade, called Melody. Her and me sort of talked sometimes, as she was a new girl and I was her school buddy (to show her around and stuff) She was a sort of short, curly brown haired, blue eyed and geeky girl. Glasses and all of that stuff, so your stereotypical nerd. Which pretty much was what she was.

After I moved up in to Tenth grade it was pretty clear that she was being bullied. Instead of gossiping or playing with the other girls, she just sort of walked around the school... bouncing a tennis ball and wandering around the grounds of the school. 

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

Then, half way through the year, school was stopped. During lunch they lined us up and called our parents. Sent us home. They just said there was an accident. My mother and father lived in Melbourne and I lived with my uncle and aunty, and they’re pretty laid back and all ‘come home when you feel’ so I stayed at school.

I saw five year six girls with that sort of ‘we know nothing it wasn’t us we didn’t do anything’ look on their face before I saw an ambulance and a white body bag. Out of the end of the body bag stuck out locks of curly brown hair, and the always-screeching birds seemed to sing a sweet tune. A melody.

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

Last week we had a substitute teacher who started screaming at a girl who was outside bouncing her ball after the end of lunch bell had rung. She didn’t realise Melody wouldn’t listen. 

No one knew why the back stairs from German were out of bounds for two months, and why the German teacher quit. No one asked why those five girls we’re stared at my Melody’s sort of... ghost.

I pieced it together. A simple push, a simple tumble. A simple death.

No one cares, all the kids just skip past her, all the laughter swallows up her silence. 

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

It has been a little over a year since I last wrote - just over a year since the last nightmare.  I was foolish to think I was somehow cured, that, as Dr. Lough suggested, getting it out of my head and into a journal would help.

I read back over my last and only journal entry, as I tried to describe the nightmare.  It is so chaotic and scattered, yet I'm unable to find any other way to convey the details.  That is the terror of the dream at its core - utterly chaotic.  Jerking from one sensation to the next, the hesitant probing of my fingers as they cover the smooth flesh where my eyes should be, to the damp defeat in realizing those fingers have torn away the protective lids in confusion.  All of this, in layers of sleep - waking to the comfort of my mother's figure, only to then know it is just another stage of the dream playing out, with her eerie voice echoing through my body:

""You're connected now.""

Even now, in understanding that my last entry seemed to bleed out through the pages, I'm struggling to form coherent thoughts onto this paper.  Each detail seems to tie into the next, only to fall apart when I try to see the whole.  I wonder what type of clinical association Dr. Lough could make?  Is this what schizophrenia feels like?  I have no way to explain it.  It is as though there is a novelist's grand plot line swirling around my body in paper shreds and each time I reach out I can snatch only a sliver of a scene, unable to ever piece the parts into an understanding.  I'm fairly certain this entry, and perhaps any subsequent entries, will be just as erratic.  I just cannot force these thoughts together.

So much has changed in the last year, it is so hard to recall my state of mind the last time the nightmare came to me.  I have a son now, nearly 6 months old.  We must have just found out Rachel was pregnant around the time I last wrote.  Could that have been a factor in the nightmare returning after years of peace?  Was my mind so overwhelmed with the thought of being a father, the changes to my life, the responsibility, it somehow dredged that old horror back from my subconscious?  I can't help but think it must have played a role.  It has been a blur, so many other things seem to have fallen into place.  Though they are exciting, it seems predetermined, somehow rushed.

Over the last decade I have had a slight obsession with the home I grew up in.  I knew I would live there once again - returning it to ownership in my family - though I never anticipated it would happen so quickly.  Rachel's grandmother died, leaving her an inheritance that allowed us to leap forward several years in our plans together.  It was Christmas Day, the day she died - I guess her last gift to us.  Three months after my son was born, we were moving back into the mountains, back to the walls I had called home as a boy.  

One thing I feel for certain, this home is the source.  The nightmare started here, always took place here, was always fueled here.  I'm beginning to remember things, or have recurrent thoughts I have not had for nearly two decades.  It is as though these things are unlocked from muscle memory as I walk this house.

As a child I would reach the top of the second floor staircase, which opened onto a hallway, always with my head down staring at my feet.  Left, at the end of a long hallway was a guest room.  Large floor to ceiling windows would reflect back a warped view of the person looking down to them.  Right, across a short landing was my bedroom.  I had trained myself to never look left at night - as the small nightlight by my bedroom door would throw twisted shadows onto my reflection in the long guest room windows.  If I would look up, I would become stuck in fear with the reflection.  The windows seemed to pulse with my heartbeat, flexing my body larger then smaller in the glass.  My feet became rooted in place, the black of the windows and the emptiness behind them tunneling out for me.  The nightlight would flicker in then out, each time causing my shape to jump forward, as though I were being pulled down the hallway towards the darkness.  I never remembered breaking loose, turning and walking back to my bedroom and going to sleep.  I would wake up in my bed hours later, staring at my hands, inspecting for blood and knowing I just had the nightmare. 

I learned, I kept my head down and did not look to the left.

Our first night in the home, that muscle memory followed suit.  After turning off the main floor lights, I climbed the staircase.  My son was sleeping against my chest, his arms wrapped around my neck and shoulder.  My head was down as I crested the top step, turning to the right, towards my room which was now his.  As I neared the bedroom door, his forehead left my shoulder.  His back straightened and his arm peeled away from my neck.  I felt his arm extend straight back behind my head.  I didn't need to look at his eyes, I knew.  Those eyes followed his arm to his hand, reaching down the hallway to the windows.  The nightlight flickered as he let out a giggle.  I took the last step into his bedroom and shut the door.

Sunny day in Nevada. Families having lunch outside, fathers teaching their sons how to grill steak, playgrounds
filled with kids. Every year I plan a trip with my son. Nevada has really nice caves in it. When I was little,
my father always took me there and so did his father. I didn't want to break this chain. I told Jake, my son, about that
cave that I used to visit but I did not have enough time to take him there until now. He was still sleeping when
I stepped in his room.
""Honey wake up!"" Jake opened his little eyes and whispered:
""What?""

""We are going to see the cave I told you about!"" he instantly jumped out of his bed and become so excited that
I can't even tell about it. He got dressed and ran to have something to eat. About five minutes later he was screaming
from the garage door.
""Hurry up mom!""

One hour car ride. Not the longest one he ever had. He kept asking me about the place. I just smiled and told him to
be patient. As soon as I parked the car, he blasted out the door and ran to the back of the car to grab two flashlights. 
""You ready?"" I asked him. He obviously was so we started walking towards our destination.
It was dark in there. Darker than anywhere else. Flashlights on.  He just kept pushing forward. Sometimes I couldn't 
even catch up with that little kid. After a sharp left turn I saw him standing there. He found it. The biggest hall 
in the cave. Every wall was shining when the light of our flashlights reached them.
""Beautiful isn't it?""

""It is indeed!"" he answered. He turned his head towards me but it was only q light at a corner 
that he could see. He totally crapped himself. ""Mommy wait for me!"" He started running towards the light 
that he could see. It is a maze down there. - MOM! - he screamed.
""I'm here honey!"" He caught up with me. He just gasped there and started to be a bit relieved as he realized 
that he was not alone in that dark cave again.
""Hey calm down little boy! I'm not leaving you here!"" went closer to him and whispered:  ""Or am I ?

Anyhow, I dreamt that I lived with my boyfriend in a big house, it was night and we both were sleeping. Suddely i wake up, and I sit up in our bed. I'm fully aware that I'm sleepwalking but I can't stop myself, lay down again or do anything about my actions. I start walking out in a big hallway (this is where the main door is located), then I enter a smaller, much more narrow and dark hallway, and in the end is a small wardrobe-like room which is truly pitch black. This scared me a bit since I am afraid of the dark but I just keep walking, I don't even consider NOT to walk in to the wardrobe. So I find myself inside this pitch black tiny room and I close the door and I lock it. Once I have locked the door i just panic, I'm not afraid but I simply can't stop screaming, I remember the scream so well, it was a true scream of despair, I screamed at the top of my lungs but I still was not scared. I started to bang the door, the walls, everything while screaming and crying as hard as I could. Finally my boyfriend comes to the rescue and the door was open now, he just grabs me and tells me I was sleepwalking and I just said ""I know"" in the sternest voice. He's scared out of his life and crying and I just looks at him like he's crazy and then i just go back to bed like nothing happened.

ephique,0,,0,1rikrx,,4,"I grew up in a small town in Ohio with my mom, dad and big sister. We were a normal family, neither happy nor sad, somewhere in between. I was always interested in music as a kid so I spent most of my time playing piano, practicing guitar or trying my best to write my own songs. It was also some sort of medicine for me; it helped me drift away into my own world when my sister and my mom had disputes. You see, my sister was one of those rebellious teenagers at the time that had to have their own way or the rest of the world had to suffer their unfair ranting. I hated it; I hated hearing her yell at my poor mother.

During a lonesome walk home from school one day I got a call from my dad, making sure that I didn’t have any plans and telling me that I had to come home as fast as possible. My dad never called my cell phone unless he really wanted something so I knew right away something was up. I remember jogging most of the route home, since my dad sounded so serious. It gave me the creeps to say the least.

I jumped over the fence surrounding our villa and paced myself into our house. The kitchen was the first room you’d see upon entering and it was empty so I assumed they were in the living room upstairs. As I was making my way up the stairs I could hear my sister sobbing uncontrollably, something had definitely happened. My dad was standing up as my sister was sitting on the couch, he told me to sit down as well.

I was scared and curious at the same time. Dad and my sister never really spoke or had any arguments since my father didn’t bother caring too much about any of my sisters business, so I could figure out that this wasn’t about my sister. I remember sitting there in dead silence with the exception of my sister shedding tears and trying to keep her crying as quiet as possible. My dad was looking like he had no idea what to do or say, as if he didn’t know how to explain something to me.

Finally, after a long pause my dad made an introduction to whatever I thought this was about at the time. He said: “Your mother…” and then he needed to grasp some air, and he continued: “Your mother has passed away.”

I was eight years old and I couldn’t grasp that concept. I didn’t understand death, or that my mom was eternally gone. I just sat there as I was developing an irrational anger towards god-knows-what, I remember thinking how unfair this was. I do however forgive my dad for telling me so bluntly, he didn’t know what to do and he was in shock at the time.

My sister continued crying, she asked dad how mom died although it was obvious she didn’t actually care to know at that precise moment. She was just being desperate and no one could blame her. I thought it was my sisters fault when I was there, I thought that was why she was crying so much. I didn’t shed a single tear; I kept it all inside. Of course that didn’t mean this incident didn’t haunt me for years, I never stopped thinking about my mother. 

The aftermath of my mother’s death is what has been shaping my life the recent years. My sister was very weak emotionally and it basically drove her insane. My dad had to take her to an actual mental hospital. Something I didn’t even think existed when I was eight. This resulted in that I didn’t get to meet my sister very often, my dad kept telling me she was in a special school for students that wanted a challenge; but I overheard enough conversations to know where she really was. I guess my dad was trying to keep me out of it, and I didn’t blame him. 

I was guessing that my sister wasn’t doing very well at the hospital since we got to see her less and less as years went by, something that troubled me; I hated living in this big villa of ours with just my dad. It felt so dead, and my dad had been more kept to himself after mom died. We didn’t do anything, I literally spent all time at home in my room, making or playing music. Me and my dad didn’t even greet sometimes when I came home from school, it was depressing. My theory for his change in behavior has always been that he blamed himself for my mother’s death, something that I’m about to get into.

You are probably wondering how she died by now, and it’s a legit question to be asking. The best answer I could give you is that I don’t know. My dad has always told me she died of liver-failure but for some reason that has always sounded like a lie to me. It didn’t add up, my mom never had any problems with her liver before and she didn’t drink. I think it was something he made up when I was younger because he assumed I wasn’t mature enough to hear the truth. In addition to this, whenever I asked my dad about this matter he’d get heavily upset. Nowadays I never ask about my mom’s death, nor do I even bring up mom as a topic.

Years went by and I ended up being fourteen. It kept going like I just described, I spent most times in my room playing music as my dad did whatever he was doing on his own in the house. My dad did work, he had the night-time shift at a local bottle factory, I’m not joking, he actually made glass bottles for a living. He had higher ambitions but most of them got crushed when he and my mother got my sister, they had to move and dad basically had no other financial option than to quit the university he was attending at the time and get a quick and close job. You guessed it, the bottle factory.

I was riding my bike home late at night after spending the evening in the school library at one point when I was fourteen. My school was the type that had an after-school library that didn’t close till 11 pm. I didn’t need any of the books or supplies that the library offered; I just studied there sometimes since it felt less depressing than my father and our lonely villa. Either way, I hadn’t seen my sister for two years that night and I was starting to get the idea that I wouldn’t see her again for another two. 

When I arrived at the house the front door was open, “This is odd?” I thought. Upon closer examination I realized that someone had taken the spare key from its hidden spot underneath one of my mother’s old jars. It’s never smart to have a spare key hidden right next to the door, number one mistake people do when it comes to spare keys. It did look like whoever had taken it did suffer a struggle before finding it. The rug outside the door was all muffled up and there were scratches on the door, around the lock. I suspected we had been robbed so I pulled out my cell phone, ready to call the police. 

This is when I heard something coming from inside the house. I was dead scared to say the least, this could have been armed robbers or maybe something worse, I didn’t know. It sounded like someone was grinding furniture against the floor, trying to move it. It was so dark as well, I remember not seeing more than pitch black looking into the open door, technically if someone was in there they would have seen me because of the street lights. I started to slowly pace into the house, walking towards the noise. This is where I had to make a decision, was I going to suddenly turn on the lights in order to reveal whatever was in there or was I going to approach it in the dark? I picked the former. I was just going to switch the lights on when I could see someone strafe into the light coming in through the kitchen window. It was my sister, naked. My entire mindset had to change into a totally different way of dealing with the situation; it took me a good couple of seconds to assume she escaped the hospital. 

I switched on the lights in an instant. She had redecorated the entire kitchen, in the dark. Of course it all looked hideous and random; she didn’t know what the hell she was doing. I remember being in a slight discomfort, I had never seen my sister naked in my entire life. I also hadn’t seen her for a good couple of years at all. She didn’t look very comfortable either, she looked like she didn’t know who I was and was wondering what I was doing there.

I uttered “Linda?” out loud, that was her name. She didn’t respond, she just continued standing there looking at me. “Don’t you remember me, I’m your brother.” I still couldn’t get any feedback out of her; it was as if the wheel wasn’t spinning at all. I wasn’t sure what the protocol here was, not knowing the number to the mental institution or anything I figured I’d try to call dad, before I got to press the call button on my cell phone she uttered: “Don’t call dad.” This is when I realized she couldn’t be completely empty inside after all.

“You don’t want to call dad.” She continued.  I had no idea what to do, I assumed this was part of the reason she was in the mental hospital in the first place. Luckily my dad got home at that point, not coming from a finished shift at work. He had a good five hours at least left, I assumed the hospital had phoned him and told him about the situation. My father ran into the house as fast as he could.

This is when something I didn’t expect happened, he told me to leave. He pointed at the door as if I had no idea how to find my way out of my own house. I asked him where I was supposed to go, he told me to wait in his car. Judging from how serious my dad seemed I didn’t think twice about it, I ran out to the car. As I was sitting in the car I could see my sister walk past the kitchen window a couple of times, I remember how she made no effort to cover her breasts. I had no clue what the two of them were discussing, although I never saw my sister move her lips so I’m guessing my dad did most of the talking. 

After a couple of minutes my dad started to walk to the car, he joined me inside. I remember asking why he didn’t bring Linda with him, “Don’t call her that name!” he shouted in response. I was so confused at this point. Dad started the car and drove me to my only friend’s house; I didn’t see him very often though. I was a lone wolf growing up and I still was at this point, I didn’t really create any friendships. I remember sitting in the car as he ran up the steps to ring my friend’s doorbell, his mother opened in her night dress and looked confused. I assumed my dad made up some emergency story to cover what was going on in order to get me a place to stay overnight. I didn’t even know what was going on to be fair.

Whatever he told them worked, I got to spend the night at my friend’s place. Tim’s place, to be exact. It was pretty awkward I remember, I only saw Tim a couple of times a week and that was when we shared classes in Spanish. We got to be desk-mates because the teacher made up whom to sit next to each semester, so we weren’t very close. 

It was a Friday so there was no school the morning after; I guessed that made it easier for my dad, leaving him the freedom to pick me up whenever he wanted to. He did, but not before giving me enough time to fully experience the awkward breakfast conversations with Tim’s parents, both trying to justify me as Tim’s best friend. I don’t know. Tim didn’t have many friends I guess.

On the way home I asked my dad what was going on the night before and he basically stopped the car and stared at me, as if I was mocking him. I remember how desperate he looked, as if he had no fire left in his heart. He uttered the words: “Do you think I wanted any of this?” as he grabbed his hair in regret. “All I wanted was a normal family with no circumstances, and I’m not blaming you when I’m saying this because frankly you are the only sane member left in this livelihood of ours.” Is what came out of his mouth next. I tried to comfort him, telling him that he had done a good job raising me and what not; I really didn’t have a lot of cards in my deck at this point. I mean my dad was basically losing it.

When we got home he told me that he was sorry, and that I should go up to my room. I did go up to my room but I got to tell you; I was starting to get very anxious about my dad. I really wanted to know what the hell was going on. I spent that night recording some guitar sessions for a song and reading books while listening to some ambient records I had found online, I couldn’t sleep so pulling an all-nighter was my only real option. I was reading “A Brief History of Time” for a science project in school, I was somewhere in the middle section of the book and started to get dry eyes. I figured I’d go downstairs into the kitchen to get myself something to drink when I got shocked upon opening the door to the hallway. I saw my mother standing just outside, looking right at me for a fraction of a second. Had all this hassle from the last couple of days driven me insane? It freaked me out so much that I ended up never getting a drink. 

The image of my mother outside my door haunted me that entire night, I kept thinking about it as I couldn’t sleep. She looked deranged, scared and raw. The shortage of light sources in the hallway made her look like she was from a black and white 50’s movie. I kept begging for the sun to rise up, I even did that thing when you close your eyes and try not to open them because you never know what you’ll see. I might have been fourteen, but I can openly admit that I was dead scared.

It finally came to be morning and I ran downstairs, still not fully opening my eyes while passing the hallway. I remember greeting my dad who was sitting in the kitchen drinking orange juice. I was just about to pour myself a glass when he said: “I think I need help.” While holding the glass of juice as if he wasn’t sure he was going to drink the rest of it. I asked him what he meant and he said that he wasn’t sure, that he had felt very uncomfortable and unstable lately. He also mentioned that he was thinking of joining some people from his work in playing golf, he thought that could give him some relief. I told him that sounded like a pretty good idea, jokingly adding that it’s better than hanging around the house doing nothing. He looked offended when I said that, something I didn’t really understand since he obviously worked all night, so that would justify him sleeping through the days.

I understand that some of you reading this are wondering how the hell I could have been fourteen and still not know how my mother died. Well, it’s hard to explain how uncomfortable of a character my dad was at times, and it felt a bit like I was offending him whenever I had to ask because part of me did actually believe she died of liver-failure. I mean it was possible. Imagine if it was true, and I kept asking my dad as if he lied to me. That’s the type of thoughts I had in my head about the whole thing.

Having that explanation out of the way, I did summon the courage to confront my dad one last time. It was a couple of days after the conversation about my dad picking up golf; I just walked into his room unexpected. A part of me had wanted to do this for a long time because I really never knew what he did in his room; it looked similar to an office which is nothing he’d ever need since he was a labor worker in a bottle factory. He was actually sitting at his desk. Not only that, but the desk was flooded with paper-work of some sort, maybe he had picked up an accounting job for the factory during the day, something he could manage from home. I didn’t ask; I had a big enough question for him as it were.

I dragged out a small chair he had behind the door and figured I’d sit on it. It was somewhat squeaky and not very comfortable, better than standing up anyway. Then I leaned forward and I was just about to ask when he interrupted my train of thought by saying: “You want to know about your sister, and what happened the other night. Don’t you?” This is where I started to play along because he was already looking emotionally hurt, bringing up mom here would have been a car-crash. I told him that I was indeed there to ask about my sister. He took a good pause before he bluntly exclaimed it to me: “Your sister is not right in the head; she’s in a mental hospital.” I couldn’t believe he hadn’t figured out that I would have known this by then. Not wanting to make a scene I just pretended like I didn’t know. He explained the context, telling me that she couldn’t take our mother’s death. A tear started climbing down his cheeks, and then he asked me if there was anything else I wanted to talk about. There was no way I could bring up something as sensitive as my mother at this point so I told him that everything was fine, and then I left the room.

I realized on my way up to my room that my dad was fragile and very close to losing his mind in this problematic family business. I had no idea how I’d ever get the truth about my mother out of him. When I finally had landed on my bed in my room again, the image of my mom started crawling back to me. The grey scaled portrait of her in the hallway, was my mind playing tricks on me? I also had a slight feeling that I remembered it from somewhere. I mean it was my mom but that exact stare and look she had, not only did it frighten me but I swore I had seen it before. 

Night landed again, I hadn’t spoken to my father again that day. I was facing the same obstacle that I had the other night, I was too afraid to go downstairs because I thought I’d see my mother again. We all know you can imagine things in the dark, kids do it all the time. It’s as if your mind fills in the gaps, but that incident the other night was different. I got more scared the more I thought of it and figured that I’d open the door to the darn hallway, and turn on the lights in order to feel slightly safer. I’m not going to lie, I did open that door very slowly but as it turned out; there was no sign of my mother. I turned on the lights and went back into my room.

Still not wanting to go to bed, not only because it was spring break at this point but also because I was a bit scared I figured I’d listen through some of my older songs. I had loads of them; most of which weren’t very good however. I was still learning how to create music and I never really thought of myself as particularly good, especially not at writing my own songs. I guess I was decent at playing other people’s songs. I basically went through my songs in chronological order, it was interesting because was able to hear how much I had improved over the years. 
It took me a good three hours to get past most of my songs, and I was reaching the more recent creations of mine. I heard something in one of the songs that I never had paid any attention to before; it was a slight breeze of white noise in the middle of one of my guitar riffs. Knowing that this wasn’t an overworked track yet, it was made just days ago and I hadn’t gotten around to mastering it yet, I figured I wasn’t going to give it more of a thought. That was until the neurons fired, that track was made the day I couldn’t sleep, the day I saw my mother in the hallway. Being a bit gullible I figured that I’d give it a go using my acoustic headphones. I tried everything. I played the song backwards; I cut out bass, middle frequencies, high frequencies and even listened to individual recordings of the instruments and samples. I couldn’t hear anything suspicious, just that white noise. 

I was a bit disappointed, at the same time relieved. Although that white noise shouldn’t have been there, nothing in my room could have made a noise like that. I didn’t want to over-think the situation, so I ended up hitting the bed. Later that night, as I still had problems sleeping I was laying in bed listening to the same ambient soundtracks that I was using nights before, slowly dozing off to sleep. I hadn’t been asleep for much more than ten minutes when I started to ascend into that state of sleep when you’re in a dream at the same time as real life is somewhat happening to you. I could hear a thumping sound coming from somewhere. Before I knew it I got woken up by a loud bass noise, it sounded like some kind of a technical disorder. I continued lying in bed, trying to figure out if I just dreamt about the noise or if it actually occurred, this is when I heard a much dampened sound coming from the other side of my room. It sounded a lot like someone was trying to get some kind of sound device to work. It got quieter and quieter and when I thought it was about to disappear I could hear a voice; very distorted and unstable speaking in what I believe was Russian. 

It took me a couple of minutes but I finally realized what I thought the sound was coming from, I had left my old amplifier on from when I was playing guitar. I bounced out of bed in order to turn on the lights. I was overlooking the entire room as I hit the switch, for the blink of an eye, just next to the amplifier I saw my mom again; just as the light went on. The same stare, same face, still that black and white filtered look from before. I got so shocked I fell down on the floor, the noise coming from the amplifier stopped in the same instant. I wasn’t sure what to make of this, and I definitely didn’t want to tell my father about what I had seen, knowing he has already thrown one of his kin to a mental hospital. 

I had a lot of sleep to catch up on but unfortunately this wouldn’t let me sleep, I just couldn’t sleep at all. I never believed in ghosts or anything growing up, these two small incidents with my mom being my only experience in what could be categorized into the matter. I thought and assumed I was becoming what my sister had become. Whatever this all meant, and needless to say; I didn’t get any sleep that night either.

I met my father in the kitchen the next day, he was looking a lot better than the last time I had seen him. He kept going on and on about how much he was looking forward to playing golf with his work-crew later that afternoon. I was happy for him; he deserved some time out of the stress. After the conversation about an afternoon of longing for a spot in the shade and waiting for your turn on a grass field he added: “Have you been thinking of your mother lately?” As if he could read my mind. I told him that I was always missing my mother, and that I had indeed thought of her a lot lately. He stated that he thought I had. I had no clue why.  Short after that he left for playing golf.

I kept thinking of why my amplifier was acting up that night, I started recalling a clear memory of turning it off after I was done playing. In fact, I knew I did since the amplifier was connected to an electricity hub that I used to turn off a small lamp I had next to my bed, how could it have been on? I had no idea. 

Since my dad was out of the building I figured I could use this afternoon without his presence to get some answers. I stepped into his room to investigate what he had been doing sitting at that desk of his all those hours. I grabbed a bunch of paperwork and sat myself on the double bed next to his desk, it got me a slight reminder on how he hadn’t gotten rid of the bed he shared with my mother yet. The first paper I started examining looked like a letter of some sort, as if it was a letter inside a legal template of some company. I don’t know how I’d describe it better than that. After further examination I found out it was a letter from my sister sent to our address, I remember wondering why dad wouldn’t show me something like this: 

“Daddy, why didn’t you visit me last weekend. I thought you were coming back, I was waiting for you. I’m sorry if I made a scene, I thought something had happened to you! I ran to you because I wanted answers, no one has answers here. I’ve been getting visits lately, why can’t you come to me at the same time?”

I fixed some grammar and a whole lot of spelling errors for the sake of explaining this to you, my sister had the linguistic abilities of a five year-old in this state. On after-thought I guessed my dad didn’t tell me about letters from my sister since they would inevitably prove that she wasn’t in a special school for people who were after tougher challenges. Although thinking about it, that doesn’t sound ridiculously different than a mental hospital.

The rest of the papers seemed to be a real mixture of work-related things and records of local police-investigations. Why would my father be looking into cases of murder, pedophilia, rape and almost anything you can think of? It wasn’t really my business what he did with his spare time but this was just outright messed up. I knew he had a friend in the police force, that was either the reason he had these or just the tool he used to get them. I didn’t even want to know at the time, I had enough stuff on my mind already and I hadn’t slept in far too long.
I apologize to whoever reading this if it seems that I’m dragging it out with details a bit too much here and there, I’m only taking precautions to make sure that I’m telling it right. If I’m finally going to tell my story I want it to sound right. 

My father never came home after golfing so I assumed he went directly to work, which made complete sense. It was starting to get late into the evening and I had absolutely nothing better to do than to once again sit in my room, I was trying to figure out ideas for new songs on my guitar. This time I wasn’t using the amplifier since I was legitimately scared of the noises occurring again. My amplifier has been known to pick up foreign radio broadcasts before, something that explains the distorted Russian speech last time, I wasn’t worrying about that. I was thinking about my mother showing herself again. Not that I was sure that it had anything to do with the amplifier itself.

Not too long into that night I started feeling sick of being in-doors for so long, and I felt like I could use some kind of fresh air as a vacation from all this unexplained mystery I had been experiencing. I remember being on the sane side of the fence, thinking critically and trying to find solutions, not marking everything as if it was a conspiracy from hell. I figured I’d take my bike down to a local gas station, not more than ten minutes from my house; I wanted some chips, candy and maybe a couple cans of soda. 

I scrambled together some change I found in my room and took off; I got there faster than I thought I would. It wasn’t cold outside either; it was a pretty smooth night. After grabbing some generic brand of chips, Skittles and a couple cans of coke I paid for it and left. I didn’t spend much time in the store, but apparently enough time to get my bike stolen. With no bike, feeling like a stupid idiot for not locking it I had to walk home. 

Something out of the ordinary happened after this, and I wasn’t even sure if I was seeing things at first. I was walking on this huge open road; I guess you could say it was somewhat of a country road. It was tied together with the forest behind our house. It was the type of road that didn’t have any traffic other than truck drivers, passing once every couple of hours at night. I didn’t want to believe my eyes at this point but I saw my sister standing alone wearing what you’d imagine someone coming from a mental hospital would wear. I assumed she was looking for me; she was definitely staring at me. 

I continued walking, not necessarily fearing my sister. It somehow still felt as if I had a bond with her, that she would never have done anything to hurt me. As I approached her she didn’t give me any response what so ever, she was just staring at me in a light-blue scrub-coat, looking lifeless. I had reached talking-distance; I couldn’t believe this was happening. It felt surreal, like one of those scenarios you can’t be prepared for in real life. She had started to shake a bit, I couldn’t tell if she was freezing or if she was nervous. I asked her if she was looking for me out there, and if she had escaped the hospital. She didn’t respond. I got the notion that she was slightly scared of me, as if I was a threat to her. 

After a short gap of silence I noticed that she was holding something behind her back. I got a bit worried that she had some kind of a weapon, or a blunt object to swing at me so I stepped back when I spotted it. She started to slowly bring it forth, it was a plastic bag. From the way she was holding it I could tell it wasn’t heavy, or dangerous for that matter. I withdrew the step back I took earlier and tried to peer down into the bag, then she started to stretch it out to me: “I took this from your house the other day, I’m sorry. I think this belongs to you. Jonathan.” 

I do realize that I never told you my name, it is indeed Jonathan. I was slightly astonished that she had remembered my name even; she seemed to be so out of it. I remember grabbing the plastic bag, she wouldn’t let go of it too lightly either, it was as if she still wanted it. After I had gotten whatever was in the bag we shared another brief moment of silence, she wouldn’t stop staring into my eyes during these. Then she told me to never mention any of this to our dad. Shortly after she started walking towards the forest; as if she knew where she was heading. 

I saw the headlights of a car coming straight at me and my sister, whoever was in this car was driving way ahead of the speed limit. I noticed when it started to get closer to us that it was my dad’s car, acting on impulse I threw myself into a nearby ditch, as I got to witness my dad chasing after my sister. I didn’t even know if I wanted him to catch her or not, she was purposely running away from him. He dragged her into his car and they both drove away, heading the direction he was originally going. This was the second time she had successfully escaped this mental hospital, and how the hell did my sister make it so far both times? Something wasn’t right, I knew from when I was younger that the hospital wasn’t anywhere close to where we lived since my dad sometimes was gone for ten hours upon visiting her. Of course at the time it was supposedly a special school, but that doesn’t change the logic of it. He never brought me with him whenever he visited my sister, since he kept me in the dark about the whole hospital thing.

I ran the rest of the way home, trying not to drop anything; I still had all the items I bought at the gas station. I wanted to make sure that I could get home before my dad did; I had no clue whenever he would get back, and not wanting him to find out whatever was in the bag my sister gave me. I couldn’t spot my dad’s car in the driveway so I felt relieved as I stepped into the house. I didn’t bother putting my drinks in the fridge or anything, I made my way back to my room as fast as I could. I don’t really know why but I locked the door after me, as if there was something to fear. I sat myself on the bed with all the lights in the entire room switched on. I made sure to put all the bags with snacks in them aside; as I was getting ready to dig into whatever my sister ran into the night to give me. 

I never really thought of something until now, and that is how my sister could have found me. It must have been a coincidence, or she had been following me for a while; knowing she couldn’t approach me in the store. I don’t know.

I looked into the bag, it seemed to be random belongings from the drawers in our living room, and maybe some stuff from one of the cupboards we had in the kitchen. After sorting out stuff that had no relevance what so ever, for example there was a roll of tape in there. I planned to spend more time on the more interesting items. The first thing I picked up was a small collection of family photos, most being after mom died. The next thing I could grab was a couple of rocks; they weren’t even dry, I guessed she must have gotten those just before she passed me the bag. There was only one thing left in the bag, an usb-stick. 

I took the stick out and threw away the bag. Then I started looking at the photos as I was trying to reason why she would have taken any of these from our house. The only thing that somewhat made sense is that a couple of them were from when she wasn’t sent to the hospital yet, but it was pretty much pending already. In fact, most of these photos took place a couple of weeks after our mother passed away. On one of them it’s my sister showing off her prom dress she was planning on wearing, she actually wasn’t acting too badly the first couple of weeks. I guess she didn’t process our mother’s death until later or something. Another photo is of dad’s old car, he had to sell it in order to compensate for our family’s financial depression from when we lost the main income our family had, my mother’s candle business. He loved that damn car with his entire heart; we even used to joke about how mom was jealous of the car. 

There were more photos but I stopped going through them when I realized a couple of them had a handwritten marking of the letter “x” behind them. It noticed this when I was flipping them as I was trying to get them all to be facing me. I sorted the photos with no marking away and started to focus more on the ones with the marking. I figured my sister must have had done this, for what reason I was about to find out. I kept staring at the first picture; it was the one I told you about earlier, the one of my father’s old car. It was a Pontiac from the early 80’s and it must have cost him a fortune. I never had any particular memories of the car; I remember it spending most of its time in our garage.

I kept looking at the photograph and the more I stared at it the more I started to wonder why my dad hadn’t use the car more, he obviously loved it. The photo was taken for an ad in the newspaper, for selling it of course. I was just about to put the sad photo away when I caught a glimpse of my mother sitting in the backseat. It wasn’t very clear and she seemed somewhat transparent. She had the same drained-out appearance and blank stare that she had from when I saw her in the hallway outside my room, and this was taken after her death. I couldn’t believe what I was looking at. I remember dropping the photo out of shock; so many thoughts started circling inside of my head.

dinofinger,0,,1,1rie11,,1,"    17^th May 2007.
I followed my dad went to Grandma's house. My cousin who lives with grandma, had a suspicion that something had happen to Aunt L &gt; *Her initial would be appropriate here* &lt; Aunt L was never in her sound mind but she prefer to live alone which is the best option avoiding the troubles she would cause to others. Grandma has a problem of [nagging](https://www.google.com/search?q=nagging&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a) disease which makes more Aunt L better suit live far from her lectures. 

Back again to my cousin, who received a call from Aunt L's neighbour. Her respond was *there was a sudden silent for the past four days*. Aunt L was never a social person who goes anywhere she wants and always out. She prefered to live in her tiny apartment secluded only her herself and herself she enjoys being with. But her neighbour help us to watch for her just in case for anything. So we respond to go and visit her house. My father, my cousin and I, the three of us went together with nothing held us back. 

As we arrive by the door, we knock and knock. From the window we can see noise screen from her small tv at the corner. But there was no sign of her. Somehow her grill lock and the door were changed, the key my cousin brought didn't fit at all. Maybe she doesn't want us to barge in anytime we want. My dad took the liberty to call the locksmith while giving positive thoughts to my cousin that everything was fine. 

30 minutes pass. The locksmith do his magic and opened the door. Such stench came out in full loaded right to our faces. Right in front of the door we can see Aunt L laid still in the toilet facing the floor. A 15 year old me shocked and I just watched her body in strip condition only a towel covered her other half and her faeces was right below her and all over behind her. Yet she is still alive, blinking and gasping.

My dad pull me back allowing my cousin to go in. I can still feel my father clenches my arms so tightly when he saw his sister. He said ""*[I better call the ambulance](http://www.wikihow.com/Call-an-Ambulance)*"", so he did and left. My cousin call me out to help pick her up. But she was too heavy, we can't even push her to the side. So my cousin rinse her with water to clean her off. I was told to took a towel and wipe her face. I could say her face was in a total blankness. 

25 minutes later the ambulance arrive. They took her with a stretcher. Both of us went down to send her off. I can remember certain vision of some neighbours pry on their window looking out what was happening. My dad went together with Aunt L, so left me and my cousin. Soon my mom and sister arrive bringing cleaning equipment. We spent whole 3 hours cleaning her house. Based on what I heard my cousin said ""*The man who always deliver her food got no respond from her for three days. That's when he ask the neighbour if she had gone somewhere. I bet if we were too late, she might have gone by any minute unconscious on the floor*""


    18^th May, 2013
We had her funeral in the day after the day we thought she would died 6 years ago. Funny the coincidence of the date just *one day after* we laughed. My cousin gave a speech said she was a fighter. Indeed she was. I think her life is better after that 17^th May living in the retirement home. She was more happier than before she was a shut-in.

echoes007,4,,2,1rhee9,,2,"I’ve always been a non-religious person. I was brought up by parents who told me to question everything. To not believe the crap that is forced down our throats daily. But I’ve always felt a whole in my life when it came to that stuff. I went as far as trying LSD and DMT to achieve this “religious experience” we all want, but I never got it. So, after a while, I just gave up and moved on and accepted there is no God, or spiritual experience, or anything that’s real, that will make me see life in a whole new perspective. Naturally, this got me down and depressed a bit. It was then when I started seeing 11:11 everywhere. It started one night when I was doing some heavy drinking and decided to do some coke lines. I remember vividly, my heart stopped, and I remember a sound, like a blender going off in my head. When I forced myself to snap out of what had happened to me, I remember the first thing I looked at was the clock on the cable box. It read 11:11. This stuck with me for a long long time. I felt like some force or spirit was forcing me to look at the clock when it was 11:11 in the morning and 11:11 at night. As if reminding me that it saved my life. This was going on for a while, when I went as far as Googling what it was. Unfortunately, the 11:11 thing was associated to some spiritual stuff, things I thought were bullshit to begin with. But still, 11:11 was always there. Slowly I stopped thinking about it, and my 11:11 experiences were less and less. It wasn’t until last week when I was driving home (I was butt sober) from an event when it started raining. My tires and brakes were messed up and I didn’t get a chance to change them, and besides, it hardly ever rains in this town, so this came as a surprise to me. As I was driving up a hill, I lost control of my car completely on the wet road, and was literally fighting my steering wheel and slamming on my brakes to stop the car, but I couldn’t. This went on for about five seconds until I finally stopped the car in the middle of the road. Again, when I snapped out of my panic mode, the first thing I looked at was the time, and it said 11:11. I’m not one who believes in coincidences, but this has me thinking I have some angel or spiritual entity looking after me. Even though I don’t believe this stuff, there is NO way that could happen. Has anyone else experienced 11:11, or has randomly been “forced” to look at a clock when it’s 11:11? Or is it my brain playing tricks on me because of the LSD/DMT I took? ",11:11,4,nosleep
Jerbsybear,0,,0,1rh5g6,,2,"There are tales of a man committed to Central State

Who killed his wife and children while he asphyxiates

His doctors with the bloody spinal cord

Of his fat nurse, who cares if she was old

When the guards rushed in, it was no problem at all

bashing their brutish faces straight into the wall

Bursting through the heavy front doors

He killed everyone on the first floor

No one would stop him, no, not this time

5 years of waiting, no stopping on a dime

He had to get out on this night

To meet his lover, one at first sight

Taking his science class, year after year

Convinced that she loved him, held him dear

Called her ""favorite student"" and all

Had her parents give him a call

To invite him to dinner, on a cold winter's night

Slaughtered her family, their faces were a sight

In the judge's court, he mercilessly pleaded insanity

When, in reality, it was egotistical vanity

If he couldn't have her, no one can

To kill her new parents was the plan

Standing outside of the house that was soon to be theirs,

Looking to seek justice, to seek what's fair

So as he broke in and brandished the knife

She knew he was back to take a life

So quickly she fled into the night

Leaving behind more victims, as she took flight

She ran two miles straight to the highway

Waving for anyone to stop, to go her way

As hand grabbed her from behind the bushes

His knife drives deeper and deeper as it pushes

Past her vitals and deep into her heart

All flashbacks of her life seemed to fall apart

As he whispers ""This...feels so right""

Her mind tries to escape into the night

The fires of his greed are not yet doused

As he tries to get back to the house

He plans to take another life

While sharpening his serrated knife

""Am I next, is he coming,"" you cry with fear

Hell no, I'm done and sitting right here.",Sitting Here,2,nosleep
InsanityInABottle,0,,1,1rgw03,,2,"“Extra, Extra! The Piggy killer is at it again!” Yelled the paperboy, holding a darkened paper above his head, screaming the same phrase over again, as if it was no big deal. I walked towards him and asked him “How much?”
“Only ten cents sir.”
“Ha. Must be a pretty good story then.” I said, as I fumbled for a large dime. I handed it into the boy’s hand, it’s gleam bouncing the light of the sun, veiled through the mist of rain into my eyes. I blinked quickly and grabbed the paper, quickly turning from the boy, hearing “How about a tip sir?”
“How about you wipe your ass with the metal I’ve already given you.” I said back to the boy, who furrowed his brow and continued screaming for new customers. As I walked along Hero’s Avenue, I kept the paper open, reading it over again. In large font, shouted “Piggy killer’s new victim!” with a picture of a woman, apparently known by the name of “Jessica Turrow.” She wore a large smile on her face, as she raised a glass of champagne above her head for a toast, I presumed.
	The article read “The psychopath, depicted as a man with a pig’s head on worn over his own face, has struck again. Witnesses described him as large, while wearing a reddened trench coat, then finally, a bib, which read the term KISS THE COOK, slathered neatly against his chest in gore. He had organs and even a human spinal cord attached to his coat and as usual, was found was mist was floating through the air and at dawn. We had identified the victim, through a ring found on the hand of the woman, who had been chopped to pieces and nailed against the side of the church. If you are to spot anyone fitting under the description, contact the police immediately, or you may be his next victim.”
	I laughed as I watched terror shrouding the faces of everybody who grasped a paper in their hands, all walking along the street as automobiles drove recklessly between one another, threading the needle on the two way street, not large enough for two cars to fit on.
	I walked towards the police station, which was cleverly located across the street from a coffee shop, a brothel and a printing office. A police car drove by; it’s loud horn sounding, flashing red and white, reflecting the light from the rain directly into my eyes. I walked into the station, the smell of fresh cigars flooding into my nose. A man screamed from across a large waiting room, looking down at the paper, then looked up and said “Oh. It’s the wonderful Flynn. Of course my dear, come, come.” I walked past him, glaring at his smug face, and then opening the door into my office.
	A man sitting on a chair for those waiting to enter my office abruptly greeted me. He smiled and said, “Well hello sir, I am Dean Osterrietch and believe I have a lead on the notorious killer”
“The pig one?”
“Y- wait, there are more?”
“I believe there are, just they might not like attention as much as our friend here.”
“Well… thanks for informing me of that rather morbid concept, but I have gotten hundreds of pictures of the killer, coming out of his lair.”
	The man pulled out a large portfolio of pictures and dumped them onto my desk, arranging them appropriately. “So, if you look at these pictures, it was for when he first got into the business, holding small weapons, all identifiable, all related to the cutting of meat. Then as you look to the left, these are the later pictures, which are of him coming out, holding bodies on his shoulders, sitting in the back of his eatery and chopping them up, putting them into boxes and looking pleased with himself, all the while in his pig mask. But, he seems to be getting careless. He cam outside, barely slipping on his mask in time for my camera to flash a photo, his face seemed veiled in… something. Something sticky, something gruesome. But if you look closer, you can quite easily see the silhouette of his face. Large, hooked nose, eyes, clouded in blue, teeth, sharpened to perfection and a dripping mouth.”
“Ha. So you’re basically implying that you’ve seen a notorious killer walk in and out of a location multiple times and not even dared to act on it? I beginning to suspect you’re the killer!”
“But that would be silly. Why would a crazy give himself away?”
“I don’t know, why don’t you tell me?”
“I believe this conversation is getting a bit heated. I saw the ad in the paper that I should contact the police and thought I’d tell you where I’ve seen such events. Have you ever seen the abandoned butchery on 1800 Bellcove Street? Well there’s your place. Sir!” said the man as he gathered his pictures and threw them into his bag, which smelled of defecation and nickels. I watched as he slammed the door, then sighed and sat down on my desk, rapidly pressing the keys of my typewriter, updating the information I’ve received from the man.
“Mysterious man visits police station, says he has a lead on the piggy killer. As you all know, the notorious killer has crossed the line now. Enough to even be called a serial killer! What a sick bastard he is.” I continued being as pessimistic as possible, updating the paper, then grabbing my camera as I finished the article. Typing in my name, finishing with my name, saying “Written by: Flynn Covetail.”
	Darkness was beginning to shroud the air, perfect night for the killer to strike in his typical environment. Light rain was spattering against my window, racing down to the bottom of the screening, only to fall against an umbrella below. As I left my office, throwing on my coat, I screamed to the man in the front desk, “Going out to…oh, let’s see...1800 Bellcove Street? If I don’t come back, Phone someone.” I said with a laugh, while walking outside.
	Instantly my boots splashed against the small walkway paved on “Western Lagoon highway” as the frivolously worthless people would say. I walked down towards the street, which was naught but four blocks from here. I passed by Dontell’s Donuts, Redgar’s Rotisserie and Salam’s Spices, all involved in the fattening of desperate cops, as only fattening diners were located near the station, so I developed a theory that every restaurant owner is against us.
	I reached the butcher’s place, which had been looted to hell by the anarchists, who were just a group of thugs that didn’t do shit to overthrow the government. The door had been pried off it’s hinges, yet now it was replaced by a veil of chains, hanging off of rusted hooks attached to the doorframe. Within the butchery, the first thing I noticed was a bed, a homeless man sleeping on it.
	I simply ignored the bum and walked around, searching for anything considered suspicious. I walked through the door, smelling the bum’s shit in the corner and closing my nostrils as well as I could. I looked through the shop, behind the counter I found several rusted knifes, which were corroded to the counter, which was a wooden rotten thing, with three cutting boards lining it, all of which nobody needed. The front of the shop seemed completely normal, but I listened to the bum waking, instantly screaming, “Who’s there! I will kill you if you’re trespassing on my property!” I laughed and screamed to him “I suggest you run out of here, or I may just have to turn you in as a key suspect for the crimes.” I heard the scuffing of his shoes against the floor, running towards me.
	I quickly turned, backing up against the wall, my sidearm pointed at the bum and screamed “GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!” I shot to the side of the man, who quickly bolted for the door, a rat following closely behind him. I sat for a minute, catching my breath, while my vocal chords seemed to scratch against one another in a uncomfortable clunky fashion. As I stood, I felt the hard callused flesh of an arm pressing against the front of my throat and the sudden feeling of something hard hitting the back of my head.








	Ha. Damn fool didn’t even know what he had coming. Shouldn’t have fucked with my grandpa… shouldn’t have yelled. My ears hurt. Are they ringing? Why the FUCK am I here? I thought a conversation to myself as I raised the man into the air, the familiar heaviness of my mask pressing against my face, the pig’s blood leaking down my neck, warming me, keeping the cold away. I looked at my setup, which was simply the back room of a butcher’s shop, a heavy steel door muffling sounds on both sides of the fifty wood wide hallway of a room.
	Blood dripped into wooden bowls I’d gotten from the shop, the bodies of fresh meat hanging from the ceiling. Pigs, cows, chickens, even a few deer, but the most stubborn of prey, the pigs. The sticky cunts hung from the ceiling, their wrists cut, their feet missing, their hands stuffed into their fucking loud mouths. The damned pigs that walked the streets, reading their stories about who? About me! The beautiful man, who is dealing righteousness to the crazies, to the rich. Though they think that they’re so safe in their leather homes, they should be the ones making chairs; their dried hides need to be a part of furniture!
	Oh, what an inventor I will be! But the best part is, nobody looks twice at the photographer. Nobody looks at who’s behind the camera; they only care about the picture! And I am finally the one in the picture! Flynn, the little anus that believed he owned the whole world, because the police were backing him up. NO, NO, NO! YOU ARE MY FUCKING BITCH!
	I whistled a tune of sorrow and greed that humans so openly express. I raise him in the air, catch a hook to his leg and strip him down to his bare neck. This self-conceited asshole needs one thing. A hook curving through the cheek, wrenched from his cheek. He thought I was the killer? NO! THAT IS NOT THE FUCKING WORD!
	Oh! My friend is waking up! Finally a new toy to play with. Oh, what a joy he will be! Oh no! What will I say to him? I guess I’ll just wing it. I guess I’ll just talk to him.  Where will I display this beauty? Ooh! The police station! Mmm, how delectable would that be? To show the pigs that even their weapons can’t defend them from me. THEY ARE GOING TO LOVE ME! I am a hero. I love being a hero and don’t try to talk me out of my heroism! I AM AMAING!








	My eyes slowly opened, to find a man in a pig mask, the rotting dreaded animal seemed to have a grin on it’s face. I was hanging upside down and fuck my leg hurts! Why does my leg hurt? Where the hell am I? “Oh… you’ve awakened!” spouted the pig; it’s squeaky voice ringing through my ears. I screamed, “Help me! Help! HE’S GOING TO KILL ME!” 
“Now that’s not how you treat a guest, is it?”
“Fuck you.”
“Oh… language, language my dear friend. If you even try saying something like that, I will cut off your cock and feed it to my friend Mr.Squeaks over here!”
	I looked to where he was pointing, which was a large column in the room, a decomposing rat nailed to the pole. “Somebody is going to catch you. They know where I am!”
“Oh, I believe they do, if only your little desk friend was there to hear what you had to say!” said the phsyco with a smile. He pointed at the ceiling, which had two hooks on it, chains hanging from them and a headless man, blood dripping in a steady stream of thickness, into a wooden bowl. “Why are you doing this to these people?”
“Okay, okay, story time. Oh yay, stories! FUCK OFF GREG, THIS IS MY TIME TO SHINE!”
	I looked at the pig with doubt, pain shooting up my leg, throbbing slowly into my brain. “SO, let me tell you why I love my job, okay? Okay. So, when I was twelve, I thought, I’m going to take pictures of weddings! I’m going to take pictures of people in love, because everyone else’s happiness, is mine.” He said this, while pinning his right hand against his heart, which contained an extra few layers of flesh, sewed against his own, along with a tattoo, stolen from his victim.
	“Okay, so anyways! What do ya know! I’m doing that now! I am a photographer! I love people being happy. SO, I one day, was at this one glorious wedding, full of lovely people. I had started talking to a woman and a little, oh what is it called? Fetish of mine was developed. As we were in bed, I took out my camera and took shots of my experience and little did I know, I have a few other… kinks. I wrung my hands around her delicate throat, stuck my finger down her throat and felt the vomit shoot from her mouth! I felt the rush as eventually, she started to fuckin’ bleed! WHAT A WHORE! She began to cough up blood, she began to wheeze and it is as these coughs echoed from her throat, landing inside of my mouth as our lips touched, did I realize how wonderful blood tastes. Rich, creamy, delicious, blood, coursing from the fountains of our decapitated stumps. I invented ways of sucking people dry, licking them dry! Well, at first I was only an amateur, but, as I got better! Oh BOY did I start to love my job! Every wedding became a slaughter, every wedding gave me a new friend, because after all, nobody cares about who’s behind the camera! NOBODY GIVES TWO FUCKING SHITS!
	So, pretty boy, I believe it’s time; you… started looking into my eyes, whenever I snap a photo of your beautiful body.” He said this as his hand slid down from my chest, slowly down to my cock, grinning, spittle flying out of his mouth as he coughed, slid a blade against it as chopped it off. I screamed out loud, blood spurting from me and all the smile he smiled, then I fell asleep, never to wake again.

ReiKoroshiya,0,,0,1rgsca,,2,"Here I am and im going to write about some of the things that go on in my life. Sorry for bombarding you with some trivial things and please just hear me out.
how about I start at the beginning that seems easier. Well back in elementary, I was that kid the kid that really no one liked. I had a friend here and there but that's about it. I was basically a social outcast, 
I never really got my work done, I still don't. Note that I was a very, very angry child and no I was not spoiled if that's what your thinking, im the oldest of 3 kids who had been and are growing up in poverty, but my father is very good at managing money which means he is very cheap.
I had shared a room with my younger brother and for some reason I never grew out of the stage where you sleep with your blankets over your head. I had always liked horror even though none of it really scared me even in elementary in the 3rd grade I found an author by the
name of R.L.Stine and I had read tons of his books which remotely captured my interests.
A few of the simple things had scared me, and I most likely have experiences that I have blocked out of my mind, I don't remember much about my childhood at all.
I don't know why I can't but that's just how it is. I do remember bits and pieces though, not anything like birthdays, mind you. Here Ile give some examples, I remember
when I thought my stuffed animal had red eyes, I freaked out a little bit called my parents and my father calmed me down and took it away. Years later I went back and found it, and of course it wasn't scary anymore. Another example
would be when I saw a ""witch"" in my closet, but again my father came in and turned the light on to show me that there was nothing there, I had clearly saw something but it was gone as soon as the light turned back on.
Once he had left and turned the light back of the figure was back again. I remember when my body shot up in bed and I let out a blood curtling scream and my parents rushed into the room
and they had tried to comfort me and to calm me down I was bawling my eyes out while hugging my father he had asked me what had happened and I was just mumbling incoherently 
about it. I can't remember what it was that had freaked me out so badly. Something else that just pokes out at me was when I was lying in bed and I hear talking so I sit up strait in bed and I see my parents right there talking to each other I couldn't understand what they were saying because they were mumbling and I said hey and they say love you simultaneously and I said aww I love you too you guys, I reached out to hug them and they both just vanished and I almost fell out of bed(I got top bunk). Then their are the things that I have learned from my family throughout the years, not much really
they don't seem to want to talk much about when I was younger. I got that I was a horrible child when they brought me to church, and that I would bite and snarl when anyone got within an arms reach of me.
keep in mind I don't remember that about going to church, as a matter of fact I don't remember going to church at all. hmmm.... well skip forward to middle school where I had
actually made friends. I did got in so much trouble in middle school its not even funny. I could barely even go a week without at least one detention. Saturday school and suspensions I had gotten a ton too, now
drugs are prevalent where I live and when I say that drugs were prevalent I truly mean that, but honestly the thought of drugs never really appealed to me well I mean
certain ones that is, the only mind altering substance that I would actually want to do, smoke, drink, etc would be alcohol cause it seems fun and really any hallucinogenic drug and there
is no way I could get ahold of hallucinogenic drugs without paying a ton of money and with my broke ass I can't afford it and because of that im drug free. Not to much
happened in middle school, only a few things I started to get hellish demonic dreams (oh and speaking of dreams I have always been able to feel pain in my dreams so if
say I was to get ran through with a spear or had my flesh pealed off in a dream I would wake up and still feel it, I also talk in my sleep) which sucks ass, The vast 
majority of my dreams became violent and with me being an avid gamer there was usually a sword nearby in my dreams and usually I could and would fight back and be home
free. I enjoyed those violent dreams where I won, even though I would battle hellish creatures and people I wouldn't consider it a nightmare. I got my own room in the basement which was nice, and well my brother he was, how do you put it? 
Gassy so yeah hot air rises and all that. Electronic malfunctions had started occurring, like waking up to my radio playing static, my alarm clock started to malfunction, etc. I remember waking up minutes before my alarm clock 
went off I awoke with a shot of electricity to my left ear. Skip forward to highschool in the 9th grade I found out what creepypasta and scp were it was amazing to find real horror for a change.
I read the hell out of creepypasta's and found some really cool narrators for them, listening to those was very enjoyable I didn't read scps often and I found a very long series called the holders.
Near the end of the year I started to feel a presence in my room which was interesting because it didn't have a bad feeling to it, the only word that comes to mind to describe it would be light if that makes any sense.
Jump forward one more year, I had flunked my freshman year because I don't do my work. On those professional tests that they make you take S.A.T's or some shit I did 
insanely good on those like I should be an A- student overall. Now i reside in alternative ed. Im 15 right now. I declared to my parents that im agnostic instead of
Baptist a few months ago. Anyway that presence in my room i hardly feel it anymore and now there is something more sinister and not just in my room anymore.
That thing I actually saw it, I fucking saw it, it was short like about a foot and a half tall. I went to bed last night and you know how earlier I had said I sleep
with my blankets over my head. Well I was moving around under the covers and I glanced out underneath the covers and there it was just staring at me a few inches away 
from my face I had to resist not to punch it because half of me was saying its just my imagination and the other half says that if its real  then im going to freak the fuck out and well I never did hit it and its creepy as fuck that its been watching me. I tried to calm my breathing as to not alert it to the fact that I have seen it I
think it knows I saw it because I have been getting glances of it all day. It might have seen me and it might be watching me type this.
It is very short and I can never manage to see any features on its face it just looks dark like a shadow its really, really dark, everything distorts when I look at it like my depth perception gets thrown off and space distorts around it.

highchairchildren,3,,1,1rgqmu,,2,"I'm looking for any input. If anyone has had experiences like this, is there a way to stop it?

So this started about two years ago. In the beginning it was just a perpetual bad feeling, like something bad was going to happen all the time.  I was anxious, always alert and never at rest. I hardly slept, primarily keeping myself awake in order to feel safer. 

Then, I started seeing things.

When I say seeings things I don't mean like hallucinations, well not really. I'm not crazy. There were never any voices and there never have been. It was more like a blackout moment in which the worst possible scenario for my environment would play out seemingly right before my eyes. 

Mostly accidents.  It happened once while I was sledding.  The hill was a steep drop and then inclined back up about 20 ft. or so where it met a busy road. Usually people lost momentum and slid back down the hill and came to a rest in the valley but sometimes, people would make it all the way up and hit the metal road block that was put up along the hill. A watched as a kid went down the hill and then it happened. I continued to watch as he went all the way back up the hill and under the metal road block right into the speeding car that was passing by. There was blood everywhere. I snapped back to reality and looked around. Everything was fine. There was no blood, nobody was hurt, just kids sledding around having fun. 

I continued to have random ""visions"" for the entire year. They varied in severity. The worst one left me shaken for a few days afterwards.  I was home babysitting my younger sisters and boiling pot of spaghetti for dinner.  I moved to the sink to strain the pasta and then went back to turn off the electric stove.  My little sister approached me to ask a question and then I had my flash.  As I was seeing it, I grabbed her by her hair and pressed her face into the stove. In that moments I watched as her eyes rolled around in her head and she screamed, begging me to stop.  I snapped back and couldn't speak. I teared up and thought I was going to puke.  I ran to the bathroom, washed my face, sat down on the ground and cried. I had never felt such a mixture of fear and remorse in my life. I got up and reentered the kitchen, finished dinner and continued the night as if nothing happened.  She asked me what was wrong and I played it off as a bout of sickness.  I sat awake for hours that night and I still couldn't come up with a reason for why this kept happening to me.  I asked my mom to see a psychiatrist but unfortunately it was a luxury we simply couldn't afford. 

Then it stopped. As quickly as it came in it left and I had no more of an idea about what it was than I'd had before.  It stayed away for a while. I mean really a long time.  I was vision free for an entire year.

I was prompted to write this because I had another one the other.  The first in over a year but I am scared. I don't want it to start again.  The most recent one was more subtle.  I was shaving in the shower went as I brought the razor up my leg, somehow or another I cut myself and there was blood everywhere.  The tub was washed red with it and there was nothing I could do but stand and watch as it oozed out of my leg and swirled around in the water before going down the drain.  Then I flashed back and it wasn't there. I hadn't even cut myself.

I know this must sound crazy, like some Final Destination bullshit.  I swear to you I wouldn't have posted it if I didn't have hopes that someone could help.  Any input is welcomed.",Can anyone help?,3,nosleep

You might remember my journal entries from last month. Last month, I can't believe it's been that long. Days and weeks run now in an endless loop. Where I am now time doesn't matter. It's a nuisance, it's a hinderance. 

A lot has happened. I just wanted to let those who cared, who reached out to me, know that I am alive. Very much so. And I have met some friends. Real human beings. There is so much I want to tell you. So much I want to explain. But I can't. Not now. 

Just know that the monster under your bed is real. That shadow in the closet exists. And those voices, the voices you hear in the dead of the night are not your imagination. All your life you have been told horror stories. And now you seek them out, on this subreddit. To be entertained, to be thrilled. But these stories exist for a reason. Every story has a truth. A small bit of reality wrapped around trigger words and exaggeration. 

That truth is what lurks in the shadows of your house, just at the corner of your eye. The truth is what is waiting for you when you close your eyes to sleep, hoping for a peaceful night's rest. But nothing is peaceful in the dark. Where the light is eclipsed by the slithering, rotting presence that knows you oh so well. One day you'll know. You will wake up and know. All those stories. All those scary tales. All those fears.

Past this the note is unreadable, spewed with a fluid I can only assume is meant to go on the inside of people. Not that I’d really want to read much more anyways. I already know what happens. Well, not really “know”, but I can feel it. Who wrote it? I can only assume it was my dear Uncle Drewson, if he’s even my uncle. What is this? No clue. A note, obviously, but beyond that speculation reigns. Where did I find this? My new house, in a drawer. Nothing is inherently terrifying about that – Oh, except that it was under the clothing I had already packed there. I just missed it before, I keep telling myself. I half believe it. A few pills later and I’m not worrying about it anymore.

Before this, I didn’t even know I had an Uncle Drewson, let alone that I was to inherit his estate in the event of his untimely, but now enacted, demise. With a heavily estranged family, growing up in between various friends or close relatives passed around by uncaring parents looking to shirk responsibility, one loses track of aunts and uncles. It was in a familiar neighborhood, a spacious three bedroom, so I was in no way eager to turn it down. As a poor, regularly unemployed person I’d been accustomed to sleeping on generous friends floors in the all too often occurrence I couldn’t afford anywhere else.

A consistent – and more pressingly, free – living space was a welcome antonym to my recent fortunes. So I was moved in within a couple weeks. Absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened. Till that note seemed to start some kind of vicious domino effect on my life, I was content.

You know when you think back to something embarrassing, stupid, or otherwise shameful act you may have done in your younger, brasher days? Once you recall it, it starts eating away, regret seeping in to every corner of your thoughts, till you would give the world to go back and change it, or at least erase the memory. Imagine that, only you can’t remember what it was you’ve done. It’s simply gone from you. The more you try, the less you realize. The less you realize, the more you regret. The more you regret, the more you try. That’s what’s happening to me, ever since I moved here. But it even goes past that. It’s the sudden feeling you’re being watched from barely out of sight. And at the same time, a crushing loneliness in that feeling. I pop a few more pills. Of course, I’m not being watched. There’s no one else here. If you think you’re being rather clever, figuring this out, oh-no-someone’s-been-in-the-house-with-you-all-along, I was most certainly the only one here. Anyway, this was about the time I found the note. If it was this Drewson, what is he talking about? Who does he want back? What is his need? Do I even want to know the answer to any of these? Insatiable curiosity will ensure I do, personal preference notwithstanding. Putting it all to the back of my mind, I chop up steak for dinner. I like to think of myself as a fairly accomplished chef, particularly where matters of slicing and/or dicing are concerned. I once worked a sushi bar, as a side job to pay the bills, and was quite proud of my ability to launch various morsels into the air and sever them in two with one fell swipe, like you see in commercials. Until the day my knife slipped and nearly skewered a customer’s eyeball. Maybe I’m not quite as proficient as I thought… I grab the bottle of pills and take a few. I don’t really like thinking about that time in my life.

I’m digging through my drawer later, that same drawer, when I stumble upon another discovery. Instead of a clue, it only deepens my mystery. A USB stick is secured to the very back of the board. I carefully remove it, and spend a few minutes simply gawking at my find, my inner curiosity again sparring with my better senses. I think, this will perhaps answer some questions about the note, and hopefully clear up my imaginations conjuring brought on by its conclusion’s implications. As per your previous assumptions, I couldn’t be farther from the truth. I secure the stick in its dock. View files. Two folders: “Reminders” and “Media”. Reminders is empty, media contains one subfolder: “Vids”. I open the folder. Two more: “memories” and “triggers”. Memories is empty. I open triggers. I’m confronted with one video file: shotinthedark.wmv. It’s 0:40 long. I press play.

Before I continue, if you’ll permit me one aside to validate the severity of this. I’m a massive horror movie fan, and I like them brutal. The more blood and guts, the better. I like truly graphic, heart wrenching stuff, and I very rarely squirm at it. Three seconds into shotinthedark.wmv and I rushed over the trash can to puke what felt like my very soul out. The scene I’m immediately confronted with was a man on a chair wearing nothing but an undershirt and briefs. There is a single light source on the chair, but I can faintly make out a figure in the background. Then, without a word, the man’s brains are ejected out his face, accompanied with a thunderous bang. Bone and cartilage spew forth in the foreground. Nearly black red sludge runs down his white undershirt, accompanied with brain matter that had just been crackling with life, likely flooded by fear, but life. I don’t have too much time to process anymore; I’m preoccupied with regurgitating my expertly made steak into the wastebasket. I think, it must be fake, but I know it’s not. I’ve got to tell someone about this, I think, the police, someone. Yeah, I’ll talk to the cops. Then, over my subsiding retching, I hear a familiar voice utter “Are you sorry now?” in the tone of a disappointed parent talking to their disobedient toddler. Something in that voice is chilling. Something… I return my gaze to the computer screen, where the barely visible figure now stands in full view, smiling.

I recognize the smile too.

It’s me, smiling back at myself, gripping a smoking sawed off.

The computer screen goes black. My head spins. I lie down.

youngsterjose42,1,,5,1rge20,,1,"He woke up in the morning like every other day. Yet this day was different; Jordan was going back to school after being expelled last year. He was caught with drugs and his school wanted nothing to do with it. He moved, now resides in york, Pennsylvania and now goes to William Penn High. He moved to a house which was quite old and just had some renovations a while back. The rent was quite cheap so his mother said ""why not?"". I was one of Jordan's first friends, since moving to york he told me things about that house really strange things. He soon moved away a little after I moved away so I have no idea where he is now. If any of you happen to live in york I'm talking about the old burned down house on market street across the street from the kindergarten/daycare. This story takes place about 2 years before the house burned down. 

A month since school started and about two weeks since I started talking to Jordan he invited me over to his house. Jordan said ""cmon dude come and stay the night my moms gone and im pretty sure wont give a shit"". So I thought why not I haven't spent the night at a friends house in a while ""yea sure ill spend the night man"". We went around town skated for a while, went to McDonald's with a few other friends then it came around 10 or maybe 11 everyone was ready to go home and i was ready to just go to a place and chill, play video games, and maybe eat some more. We got to his place, sat down in the living room, and lit up a blunt. Playing grand auto 3, high off our asses, we ordered some pizza. We ate and everything was fine till I felt like heading over to the bathroom. As soon as I opened the door I notice under the sink there was like a small cabinet and the doors slammed shut. I was high so I didn't really questioned it much. I used the bathroom and then as I exit I suddenly hear a giggle coming from under the sink. A child's giggle, as if there was a kid under the sink playing hide'n'seek or something. Again I did not question it because I was high and didn't really wanna bother finding out what made the noise. Jordan passed out on the couch, I went to his room and tried to sleep on his bed. I remember waking up around four in the morning hearing footsteps and a child giggling I'm pretty sure it was a little boy. I couldn't really tell his age but he was young; I would guess around six or seven. He was running around the house and he stopped at the door I did not see him, I only ever got to see his outline. He said "" I'm really happy I got more friends to play with now"". Suddenly after that he vanished faster than I could blink. I didn't sleep for the rest of the night. I had goosebumps for a good 30 to 45 minutes. Eventually I  calmed myself down by eating pizza and watching TV.",Hide 'N' seek,6,nosleep

We were watching Toy Story 3 in my downstairs, and we have 2 pillars downstairs to support our house and the framing on a the one behind the couch is loose, so sometimes it snags on clothes and makes a loud noise when it hits the pillar. So, we were close to the end of the movie, and we heard the loose framing hit it like someone pulled it away from the pillar. We all automatically stopped and looked at each other for about a minute, then we got up and ran to my room. We had to go past the pillar to get to my room so it snagged on my blanket and made the snapping noise again, which made everyone go faster.

Mindlesssavage,4,,8,1rhawv,,0,"I have a Where's Wally book. Well, had. Why? I'll tell you.
So I was just searching for Wally at night like I usually do, and I heard a noise.
It was sort of a scratching noise, scratching with a walking cane maybe.
I went to investigate. I went out of my room and...
Nothing.
Maybe it was just me. I went back to my bedroom door. I saw something written on really drippy red paint.
It said ""Find me if you can"". I thought it was just my little brother Mike painting on the walls again. ""Where was Mike anyway?"", I thought. Then I remembered he was outside playing with our pet dog Molly. ( Don't ask me why he was playing in the dark, because I have no idea).
I went inside my room. That's when I saw it. The book was lying on the ground open. I picked it up. This is what the title said:
""yllaW s'erehW"" Now THIS was weird. I also saw the same Wally picture except his eyes were gone and blood was dripping from them.
It was possessed, I thought. I ran outside to bury it, and I stepped on something. It sounded like it was glass because I heard it shatter.
I looked down.
A pair of broken, black rimmed glasses. I ignored it and ran even faster than before.
I ran to my dog Molly's kennel. I always feel safe when she's with me.
She was whining in the corner. That was typical, though. But wasn't she playing with Mike? I shouted out, ""Mike! Mike! Can you hear me?""
No replies.
I ran to the middle of the yard to bury the book.
I stepped in another thing. It was squishy, and slimy.
I looked down.
Blood. Blood and guts.
And Mike.
Lying on the ground.
Stomach open.
With a walking cane through his heart.
I wanted to cry, but then I saw a little Post-It note on the cane.
A poem.
This is what it said:
""I can run, and I can hide.
Tear you apart from the inside.
Waiting in the darkness, with my cane.
Used to be for children, now insane.
Red and white, in the grey fog.
Running around with my little pet dog.
With my girlfriend Wenda, with her camera,
And an old man with a white beard.
The prisoner who escaped from jail, murdering people with no fail.
That's my gang, with no doubt.
When you're in with me, there's no way out.""
This was way too bad to just BURY. We had to set it on FIRE. Or RIP IT APART. Just destroy it in whatever way I could.
So now in my backyard, a grave for Mike, some burnt and ripped pages, shattered glasses, and a walking cane.
And to this day, I never read another Where's Wally book again.
And every night, I still hear the sound of a scratching walking cane against my bedroom door.
THE END.

kimmiekissies,13,,29,1rgt5c,,122,"I never even met him, I didn't know his name or face. I was, blissfully unaware, of his very existence.

 I will never know why, or when it started. I'm glad for that I guess. I moved into my very small apartment in February last year. My landlord, Olivia, was a sweet older woman who would cook to much and bring me much appreciated leftovers. She was great to me, even after telling her my problem. I'm antisocial, but she didn't mind renting to a reclusive young girl who reminded her of her daughter.

 Every few weeks she would knock on my door then leave, letting me know she was leaving something for me. I loved that. Not even my family would cook so well. The next morning I wash and leave her empty containers outside my door and by an hour or so she would take them back again. My other neighbors seemed fine, but I never talked or visited with them.

 I work from home so anytime I ever was forced to go out I rushed out and into my apartment avoiding an, uncomfortable situation. I loved living alone, it was everything I hoped for. I could just, breathe. By April though, I started noticing things were not right. They were moving, or plain disappearing. I was convinced it was just anxiety caused by my new medication and the move, another side affect was it would make me so drowsy. Since I hated seeing the doctor I just dealt.

 I took naps during the day now and eventually stopped caring. Until one incident doubled my paranoia, Olivia brought me some sort of greek tossed salad and dressing for lunch one day and I enjoyed it with my friend netflix. I fell asleep in the middle of Portlandia, and woke up that evening at 5pm. Per usual, what was not usual was my bedding on the opposite side of me was disturbed. I only sleep on the right side. Always. Even more it felt.. *warm.* My first thought was I must have rolled around a lot, but I knew it was to odd to dismiss. 

I got up and searched my apartment gripping my phone with 911 typed in. Nothing else was disturbed, everything was exactly like it should be. I let it go, for the next few weeks everything was normal pardon the occasional misplaced shoe or drawn back shower curtain. I thought about telling someone, my parents, maybe Olivia, but if it's not life or death I am not reaching out to anyone. 

I wasn't scared, I was nervous, maybe a little stubborn.. But I stayed. I am not letting some stupid anxiety ruin my lovely lonely world.
 May came and It was getting worse. My panties, toothbrush, hell even my food was being misplaced. Every time I woke up there was this strange odor in the air. I finally realized this won't go away by ignoring it. I called my mom and begged to come stay a few days, when I got home I told them everything. Saying it out loud solidified any creepy suspicions. 

That weekend my dad went to my apartment and what was found was true horror. Written all over that walls: ""COME BACK"" ""BABY PLEASE"" He ran out and called the police. There was no one living in my apartment but someone definitely had access besides me. 
The investigation revealed a man, Henry, the son of my landlord Olivia, was in a projected relationship with me.

 They showed me his confession on tape. He admitted coming into my apartment every night and everyday with his mother's extra key. He claims we were in love and he had my permission. He drugged his mother's food she left out for me causing my drowsiness and falling asleep so he could come in and watch me sleep, touch my hair, kiss my shoulder. The leftovers I had in the fridge were tested and confirmed.
 I was absolutely, horrified and disgusted. A man, I never knew existed, collected my drain hair, clothes, and trash and practically lived in my apartment for *four months.*

Thanks to everyone for your responses, I have taken a lot of your advice.
I'll just give you all a quick update on what happened after I posted yesterday. She ended up having a nap after sitting in front of the TV for a few hours. I was going to walk our dog, Zeus, but I decided to wait until she woke up just in case she woke up and was confused.


She woke up after a couple of hours and was.....well. Happy. Really, really happy. Almost manic. She woke up full of beans, and smiling like a maniac. I was initially relieved. I asked would she like to come for a walk with Zeus and I and she happily agreed. We set off for our normal walk, and she was extremely energetic, bounding off in front of Zeus and I. Zeus is a Labrador, and although he is a big boy, he's still a pup. We usually just meander along on these walks while he sniffs at everything along the way. But she set a cracking pace and Zeus and I struggled to keep up. 


We got up to this park where we usually let him off his lead for a while as we're trying to train him to not run off on us and to be sociable. It's always been a real task getting him back on the leash though, he never ever comes when he's called. Anyway, we let him off, and he's running around and smelling everything and peeing on anything that stands still long enough. My wife, she's picking flowers and sniffing them, and singing. She gets on the swings at the park and I push her for a bit, as she sings under her breath. I was feeling quite content at this point. Figured she must have just been over tired.


She's swinging vigourously when all of a sudden she comes to a dead halt. She yells, in an almost unfamiliar, masculine voice, ""Zeus! Here!"" and points in front of her feet.


I stood in disbelief as I watched Zeus, the most disobedient rascal of a dog I know, solemnly trot over to where she's pointing, sit in front of her, and stare up into her face. They both sat there for a split second, very still, looking at each other. I picked my jaw up off the floor and asked her ""Um..what the hell! How did you manage that!"" and that seemed to break both their concentration and Zeus shot off like a bat out of hell again, and she started swinging again - ""Oh"" she said, ""I used my mind to call out to him...it's something new I learned..""
She seemed kind of sheepish about it to be honest. I pressed her for more details, but the more questions I asked the more defensive she got. She knows I don't believe that for a second. I'm just happy that Zeus is finally starting to be trained. That's really the only explanation. I asked her to do it again but she refused, so I think we both know it was a fluke.


The rest of the afternoon was....nice. Kind of odd. It's like there's something that's amiss. Like when you walk into your messy bedroom and you can tell that *something* is not how it should be but you can't pin point what.


We talked a bit about the seminar. She said that it was very intense. The days were very long. She said that the premise of the seminar is to get to the root of any emotional upset, to explore the root causes for what's going on in your life. I asked if any hypnosis was used, as suggested by you guys, and she said no. They talked a lot, and were assigned to small groups, and encouraged to open up and explore their ""inner beings"". She said she felt a lot better since attending.
Still, something was not quite right. For instance, we were talking about my sister who lives in another state, and how she had recently got a new job. A few minutes later, my phone rang and it was her. I picked it up and said ""Emma! Speak of the devil..."" and my wife smashed me up the side of the head, causing me to drop the phone and shouted ""Emma is NOT the devil!! How could you say that!!! Emma is NOT THE DEVIL!!"" I told Emma I would call her back and tried to get my wife to calm down. She was very upset at what I had said. She sort of went silent again, and was very still. She seemed rather annoyed at me, but by this point, I was nearing exhaustion myself, so I let her be.

She fell asleep early, about 8pm, on the couch. I covered her with a blanket, and noticed that her eyes are kind of half opened..... I used to have a friend who slept like that at school and I've never noticed it before, I think that in my state of hyper vigilance, I am being overly perceptive of small details.
 
I read more of my original post, and all your comments, and decided to step outside and call our therapist, just to find out more about the seminar, as I knew she was there assisting.

I walked out onto our back porch and lit a cigarette and rang her. She answered on my first ring. What she said has really weirded me out. Only because although she gave me a lot of information, she has raised many more questions, as well as answered them.
 
She said these seminars are more like interactive workshops run by a man named Brian and his wife Linda, who are both self-appointed ""psychotherapists"". She said that there are psychologists such as herself on stand by to assist because sometimes when people are in such a vulnerable state, they may need assistance. She said she has referred a lot of her client's to attend these workshops and has found them to be helpful in most cases.
 
Basically, the course is about discovering your inner self, and using different methods to connect to your inner voice, to find out what the cause of your worries are. She said that it is incredibly demanding and intense. Each session goes for 14 hours with only an hour break. During these sessions, many different activities and topics are explored, including, regression. Apparently Brian does this 3 hour session on the second last day, where he gets everyone to meditate, and be still, and he regresses them back to childhood, or even, in some extreme cases, past lives. Our therapist said, it was so intense that she had to fight from being regressed herself. She did make comment that she had been concerned initially about how my wife would handle that, but that she seemed ""brighter, had a clarity about her"" after this experience. They discussed what my wife had gone back to, in her mind, and the therapist was happy that it hadn't caused her any great distress, but reminded me she couldn't discuss the specifics. She said when she wakes tomorrow I could gently try and open the lines of communication with her and she may explain her ""experience"".
 
I told her about my wife's strange behaviour. She said it is normal to be a little out of sorts after one of these sessions, but nothing major. I don't know if it's just me, but I could sense a tiny bit of alarm in her voice.... I don't know, maybe I imagined it. She said to call her if there's any further problems.
 
I hung up, and as I was putting out my cigarette, I turned to go inside and my wife's standing there staring at me. I jump and say ""Jesus Christ honey you scared me!"" and she replied ""Not as fucking much as I'm going to scare you.""
 
Ummm ok. I had to physically turn her and direct her into the house. In the moonlight she almost looked like a stranger to me. Her long blonde hair was hanging in her face, and her face was fixed in this awful scowl. I figured she must still be pissed at me from before. I put her to bed and she goes back to sleep.
 
And, well, that's where she is now.... she was supposed to be off work today too, but I was meant to go back to my job. But when my alarm went off, I just had this weird feeling that I should stick around and make sure she was ok. I rang in sick for work, and I'm just doing some household jobs, waiting to see if she's better when she wakes up, and googling what regression means, and what these intense emotional exercises can do to someone. Still nothing that convincing though. I dont know. Maybe I'm *too* skeptical. I just don't believe this crap.

The whole thing sounds a bit stupid to me, if I'm honest. But I have to say, it has caused some kind of change in my wife. She is very extreme in her emotions at the moment, and I'm worried, because we both have to go back to work tomorrow, and her work environment is very proper. She is always a perfect employee, and very dedicated to her work. I can't help but feel concerned that she might wake up tomorrow and still be in this....mood. Do you guys know anything about this ""regression""....is it the same as hypnosis? She was adamant she wasn't hypnotised, but it sounds like it to me!!



EDIT: Ok now I'm getting really freaked out. I went to check on her and she was talking and singing her sleep. I can't quit work out what song she's singing I've never heard it before. But she's saying something about being someone called Azara or something??? It's really fucking unnerving it doesn't even sound like her. Ill try and get a recording and see if you guys can shed some light. 


EDIT TWO: Ok I managed to record a bit of it...she's singing but I don't know what, has anyone heard this before????????? Ignore the TV in the background I was watching it in the lounge room to drown her out, and it was really unnerving when I turned it off and all I could hear was her.

floydnimrod,21,,25,1rhxtb,,113,"I'd just come from church for some reason. I'm not sure why I'd gone into the church, but it was the weirdest service I'd ever been too. Everybody was there. It was a packed house. Rich people, poor people, criminals, middle class folk. It was all people who didn't normally go to church. I looked into the coat room as I walked in, and some guy was snorting cocaine on this little counter top. Right in a church. I was like, what the hell? I've never see that.

I sat in a pew, and looked up. There was no minister. They were just playing a movie of an old church service on the screen. Some little old lady was playing a hymn on an organ, and the minister was applauding her. She seemed happy. But the audience was restless, not really paying attention, not sitting down, just kind of wandering around, talking to everybody. 

And then I saw a woman I used to know, someone I worked with years ago. I went to sit down next to her, and she sort of jumped on my lap and hugged me, saying she was so glad to see me. I wasn't sure if she was sad, or drunk, or terrified, or just lonely, but she whispered in my ear, offering me sex, saying she's always wanted me, ever since she'd known me. I sort of pushed her off my lap, thinking this was hardly the place for that kind of cheap pick-up. And then I got up and walked out. There wasn't really a church service going on anyway, I don't even think it was Sunday.

And then for some reason, I was in a car with this old lady. I don't even know who it was, or why I was with her. She was old like my grandma Freddie, but it wasn't her. We were driving down the street. She was driving too slow because she was kind of lost. I don't think I was in Winnipeg I was on a large street, almost the size of Portage with several lanes. But they all seemed to be deserted, like very early on a Sunday morning. I'm not sure if it was early in the morning or near sunset, but the sun was low in the sky. I think it was late in the day. The streets were mostly clear though.

The lady pulled over and for some reason she got out of the car. I think she was going to ask somebody for directions. I looked at the GPS thing she had on her dashboard, and suddenly the direction went all fuzzy and scrambled, like the satellite was confused, or just no longer there. And then the whole sky got this weird greenish tint to it for about ten seconds. It basically turned green instead of blue, but only for a moment, and then it was back to normal. Everybody stopped and looked up.

I was still in the car, but I leaned forward and looked out the window. The sun was over in the west, low in the sky. And I saw what looked like a second moon fly over the sky in a direction that was diagonal to the sun's normal path. It was huge. And my stomach got queasy for a moment. It made your stomach sick because it was so big, it actually pulled on you with its own gravity, like the moon pulls on the tides, but much bigger, and everything inside you just got tugged around.

But it went straight across the sky, without hitting. When I realized how close it was, though, I knew it was gonna hit somewhere, probably on the other side of the world. The gravity of the earth pulled it in, and it sling-shotted around to the other side somewhere. I jumped out of the car and grabbed the old lady's arm.

""Come on! We have to find shelter! It's gonna hit!"" 

We just abandoned the car in the street, and I dragged her toward a nearby fire station, or hydro office, or whatever it was. I'm not sure which it was, but there were large utility trucks, with lifts on them. It was also deserted for some reason, except for two guys loading one of the trucks. We banged on the doors, but it was locked up. We ran from door to door trying to get in, but everything was locked. 

And then I felt a great rumble under my feet. It nearly knocked me down. I've never been in an earthquake, so I don't know what it's like, but it felt like the entire planet shivered. Car alarms started going off in every direction and I heard a weird sound like gravel tumbling down a hillside, except there were no hills. I think it was pieces falling off houses in all directions. We were able to stay on our feet though. 

A few moments later, the sky in the north went dark. If I assume the sun was setting in the west, and the meteor or asteroid or whatever flew over the sky in a north-west to south-east direction, then it was north the black came from. And I mean the entire sky. Like a wall of blackness, smoke and ash suddenly filling the view from the ground to the upper atmosphere, from west to east as far as you could see, in one huge wall of black cloud. And it was coming toward us. Well, sort of going towards everyone, everywhere, I guess. It came over the horizon like an charging army, fast and steady, advancing.

""It hit on the other side of the world somewhere! Come on! we have to get indoors! We won't be able to breathe!""

The air started turning yellow. Ash started raining down, and bits of rock and debris from the blast, where ever it hit. I took a deep breath and held it as I was running. I could already smell a weird burning rock smell, like sulphur, like burnt matches, but more metallic. 

Me and the lady finally got into some doors, but it was just a little foyer. We ran in and shut the doors behind us. The inside doors were locked. But it was somewhere to hide. There was a fire alarm. I pulled it, not really knowing why I was bothering. But I was sort of in a panic and not thinking straight. The sign said, In Case of Emergency, so I pulled it. The alarm went off, and we looked out the window. The yellow air turned brown, and then dark red. Then everything went black. The black cloud fell over the whole sky with a clattering rumble that sounded like it was raining gravel instead of water. And all light went out of the world.

The world as we knew it was over. Even if we survived, life as we know it would never be the same. We'd be set back 10,000 years, reduced to hunter gatherers again, living out of caves. If we survived the impact that is. I honestly don't think anybody would have survived the shockwave. Something with that much gravity hitting the earth would pretty much end the story for everybody.

Charlies_friend,20,,9,1rhapg,,79,"A friend of mine posted a story here not too long ago, and he was pretty well received by your wonderful community, so I decided to create an account to share mine.


When I was a little girl, about nine years old, my family purchased a small ranch in western Kansas. My father had just gotten out of the Army, and I suppose after seven years of trotting around the world, and spending two of those years in active combat zones, my dad just wanted to go somewhere the world would leave him alone. He couldn't have found a better location for this purpose; anyone who's ever followed Interstate 70 westward through that area knows, there isn't much between Topeka and Denver.

I still remember the day we (my mom, dad, older sister and I) moved into that old ranch house. It had been built in the early 1900's, and being something of a history buff, I was pretty excited to live in a house that had stood through prohibition, the depression, both world wars, and everything since. The house itself sat at the bottom of a small incline from the main road, backed literally into a hill. This setup meant the back half of the home sat underground, buried in the hillside. Outside the house was a little grassy yard area, and across this yard was an old barn. We didn't have any horses, but my dad held a particular love for classic cars, and he turned that barn into an amateur autoshop where he worked refurbishing old cars from the junk yard in his spare time.

My sister and I were given seperate but adjoining rooms upstairs, while my parents took the master bedroom (oddly) on the first floor. My sister and I's rooms opened onto a sort of landing that looked out over the living room and kitchen, and the stairs led down from there.

It was only our second or third night in the house, that I began to notice some strange things occurring. I was unable to sleep one night, and I laid awake in bed long after I heard my parents and sister go to bed. The house was incredibly quiet, both from being in the middle of a very isolated area, and by virtue of being half buried. Just as I was reaching the half-sleep state...........SLAM! I heard a door downstairs slam shut. At first I tried convincing myself I had just dreamed it, but I couldn't make myself believe that. And the next thing I heard chilled me to my core. I heard footsteps coming up the stairway. I could tell from the sound that the individual must be wearing shoes, so it probably wasn't my parents coming up to check on me. I heard the steps reach the top of the stairs, and then begin down the landing. I was frozen with fear when I heard them arrive outside my door, pause for a moment, and then continue on. When the stranger was apparently in front of my sisters room, he paused again, and again he continued. He reached the far end of the landing, and then turned around and came back the way he came. He continued for what seemed like an eternity, pacing around outside my sister and I's rooms. I finally worked up some nine-year-old courage and crawled to the door. I could still hear footsteps coming from just outside. I waited until he was moving away from me, and I was between him and the stairs, planning on making a mad dash for my parents room when his back was turned. I barely cracked open the door and looked out, and saw....nothing. The footsteps had stopped, and the whole house was empty, and still. I was confused, and afraid, but even then I knew if I ran to my parents they would think I was nuts. So I slid a chair in front of my door and crept into bed. A minute later the footsteps started again, back and forth, all along the landing. Eventually, they lulled me to sleep. 

I didn't mention the noises that night to anyone, fearful of my parents thinking I was a whacko, and of being made fun of by my sister. But, over the next few weeks, everyone in my family began to notice strange happenings on our ranch. Objects moved on their own. Small things would disappear for days, only to be returned exactly where they'd gone missing from. It was what I guess you'd call typical poltergeist activity; nothing harmful or malevolent, just noises here and there and odds and ends moving around. And practically every night I heard those footsteps outside my room. 

My family eventually began referring to this entity as ""Charlie"". He seemed to be a harmless ghost, and sometimes downright helpful. Occasionally my parents would wake early in the morning for work, only to find a freshly brewed pot of coffee waiting in the kitchen. The coffee maker had no automatic timer. Sometimes when one of us had misplaced something, like car keys or the like, we'd search the house frantically only to turn around and find what we'd been searching for laying on the ground behind us. And sometimes Charlie would slam a door, or walk around loudly, or turn a sink on, seemingly just to let us know he was there. And always, those footsteps at night.

Charlie always seemed particularly active in my dad's auto shop. My dad would occasionally find car parts he'd been working on had been tinkered with, despite the fact that he was the only one who ever went in there. Sometimes tools would go missing, only to be returned a short time later. Once my dad came in from his shop one evening as white as a sheet. When we asked what was wrong he just said ""Charlie was walking around out there........Jesus, I thought you all were just hearing things!"". I wasn't sure why Charlie loved that shop so much, but incidentally, that was where I caught my first sight of him. It was a Saturday, and my Dad was hard at work putting together an old Chevy Fleetline. My mom mad him a sandwich as a working lunch, and asked me to take it to him. I eased open the barn door, and saw my dad seated at his work bench, his back to me. And I saw another man, next to the car, also out of my dad's field of vision. He was about 5'8"", with dark hair and eyes. He was dressed in what looked like typical 1930's clothing; black slacks, a pinstripe vest over a grey work shirt, and topped off by a brown ""paper boy"" hat, cocked to one side. He looked right at me for a second, a big, mischievous grin on his face, and then he simply disappeared. I didn't even realized I was still holding my dad's sandwich and continued to stare at the spot Charlie had stood until my dad snapped me back to reality.

So passed the next few months. My family was happy on our little haunted ranch, Charlie seemed happy enough to share the space with us, and life was good. And his nightly vigil outside my room began to seem almost comforting. One night in late November, however, I learned just how utterly terrifying Charlie could be.

My dad had some kind of dinner event for work in Topeka, almost two hours away, and since my Sister was almost 16 by then, and there was virtually no crime in our rural area, my parents figured we would do fine by ourselves until they returned the next morning. Of course, to my sister and I, it meant we could stay up as late as we wanted, watch scary movies, all the kid stuff you can't do with your parents around. At around midnight, I was in my Sister's room with her watching some movie on her TV, when we heard a loud CRASH from the living room. My first thought was that it was Charlie, playing another prank, by this felt different somehow. Charlie's noises were simply little bumps to remind you he was home. But this noise sounded violent, and angry. Before I could really react, we heard another loud crash, and another. My sister cautiously peeked out of her door, and down into the living room. I swear I saw her go white. She began trembling, and her hand covered her mouth. I peeked around her to see what she saw, and felt y blood run cold. We could just barely see two men, outside our from door. One of them was kicking it in. As we watched, a final smash from this man caused the door jam to give out, and they both entered our home, shining long flashlights all over. My sister and I crawled under her bed, and held each other tight. This was easily the most terrified I have ever felt. 

But as the two men began to go through the living room, another loud crash came from the kitchen. One of the cabinets had opened and slammed shut; a favorite trick of Charlie's. The man who seemed to be leading the show shined his flashlight into the kitchen and shouted ""Is there anyone in here?!?? If you are, you better come out now!! We will find you, and we will FUCK you up!!!!"". My sister and I had to cover our mouths to keep from screaming out loud. At the man's words though, Charlie apparently got angry. We heard another loud crash and a skittering of metal on the floor, as one of our silverware drawers apparently threw itself across the room. I heard one of the men say ""What.......the FUCK?!?!"". And then Charlie decided he was do e fucking around. All at once, every door, window, and cabinet in our home began opening and closing violently, and loudly. Small objects all over the house began to fling themselves into walls, across the floor, even at the intruders. At this point, the one in charge just yelled ""FUCK this"" and turned and ran out, his buddy close behind.

As soon as the men were out of the door, everything stopped, and the house was again silent. It was a long, long time before either my sister or myself finally worked up the courage to move. She had left her cell phone downstairs, and and she needed it to call the police and our parents. She began slowly creeping downstairs to get it, and since there was no way in hell I was being left alone, I followed. As we got to the bottom, I looked into the kitchen, and for just a moment, Charlie was standing there, exactly as I saw him before, with the same grin on his face. A moment later, he was gone.

The police arrived shortly, and my parents not far behind. The cops determined that the disorder in the home was caused by the robbers ransacking the place for valuables, and they must have been scared off by a passing car. Lucky for us. My sister and I didn't even try to tell them what really happened, and within thirty minutes, both men were caught, still fleeing. 

After that night, hearing Charlie's walk around my floor gave me a serene sense of security every night. When he played his little pranks, I would always look for him. And every now and then I would catch just a glimpse of him and smile.

Several years later, when I was a junior in high school, I was working on a school report at the local library. The topic was the history of our town, and I wanted to see if the library had any old news clippings that mentioned my family's ranch. I typed our address on the search bar, and the first result stopped me dead in my tracks. The date of the old article was July 17, 1936, and at the top was a picture of a man, about 5'8"", with dark hair and eyes. It was, unmistakably, Charlie. The title of the article read ""Local Man Murdered While Defending Daughter"". It seems the man we called Charlie was actually named Brian Davis. He had lived alone in the ranch with his only child, a daughter, after losing his wife to a bad case of the Flu. On the night of July 15, the article said, Mr. Davis was returning home from his job as an auto mechanic in town. When he pulled up to the house, he found the door had been forced open. He ran inside, and found a man on top of his daughter. The girl was sobbing, her dress had been ripped open, and the attacker held a knife to her throat. In a moment of sheer instinct, Mr. Davis threw himself at the intruder, tackling him of his daughter, and as he held the attacker, Mr. Davis yelled for the girl to run to the neighbors and call the police. The girl made it the mile and a half to the closest neighbor, who promptly called the sheriff. When deputies arrived, they were able to apprehend the attacker, who had been beaten half to death. Unfortunately, he had stabbed Mr. Davis three times in the chest. Brian Davis died right on our kitchen floor.",Charlie,88,nosleep

childrenofsamhain,9,,5,1rhdoj,,36,"My friend Jaime purchased a new home about six years ago when his wife was pregnant with their first child. Until recently, he lived there with his wife Claire and their two daughters, Sarah and Emily. Sarah is now five years old and Emily is three. Within the first two years living in the house, Jaime said that he never experienced anything out of the ordinary. It wasn't until his daughter Sarah was around two years old, that he started to notice she talked to herself. Jamie thought nothing of it, she was just learning to talk and he figured she was just entertaining herself. 

One afternoon when Claire was out at the grocery store, Jaime overheard his daughter in the upstairs hallway, whispering and giggling. Curious, he asked, ""Sweetie, who are you talking to?"" Sarah replied, 

""The woman standing in the hallway"".

""Is she your imaginary friend?""

""I guess."" 

Amused, he went upstairs to find her staring blankly at a wall, whispering quietly. ""What's your friends name?"" he asked her. 

""Her name is Helen Mary"", she said. 

""And what are you two whispering about?"" 

Sarah looked at him and paused before she piped ""I'm not supposed to tell you."" 

Suddenly the front door opened downstairs, and they heard Claire come through the door. Sarah rushed down the stairs to greet her. Jaime didn't think about that again for a few weeks. 

Over time, the two noticed that Sarah's interactions with ""Helen Mary"" became more frequent, but they attributed this to the fact that they had just given her the news that she was going to be a big sister. 

About two weeks before Claire gave birth to Emily, Jaime was at home alone with Sarah. He heard her playing upstairs, chatting away with her imaginary friend, when suddenly he heard glass breaking. He ran upstairs as quickly as possible to find his daughter standing in the hallway, holding a hammer. She was staring up at the wall of family pictures that were now smashed to pieces. There was glass everywhere. Jaime picked his daughter up and carried her down the stairs. He told her to stay put as he returned to the upstairs hallway to clean up the shattered fragments of their family portraits. When he returned to the living room, he asked her directly, ""Sweetie, why would you smash all of our family pictures?"" 

She looked at him, ""Helen Mary told me to do it.""

When Claire returned home that evening from her girls night with friends, Jaime told her about the incident. The crept up the stairs so as not to wake their daughter, so Claire could view the damage with her own eyes. She gasped silently at the sight. 

When they returned downstairs to the kitchen, they started to discuss possible explanations for her behavior. Suddenly, the color ran out of Claire's face and she looked at Jaime. ""There's no way she could have done that alone.""

""What?""

""There is no way she could have smashed all of those pictures by herself.""

Jaime was confused, ""I told you, I caught her with the hammer. She told me that she did it.""

But it wasn't until his wife said it aloud that it dawned on him, ""But… some of those pictures are almost five feet off the ground. How could she have reached those?""

His mind was racing, ""She must have moved a chair or something.""

She was adamant, ""There are no chairs upstairs that she is strong enough to move without you hearing it, and you would have seen her carry one upstairs, right?""

Jaime was silent. He didn't have an answer. 

They went to bed that night without any answers. The following morning their daughter had little recollection of smashing the pictures and Jamie wrote it off as sleepwalking. Though he didn't have much time to think about it, as two weeks later his second little girl was born.

Emily was two years old in the summer of 2012, and one afternoon, when Claire was at home alone with the girls, she heard Emily alone upstairs, whispering. She called up to her, ""Who you talking to, kiddo?""

""The woman standing in the hallway.""

Claire thought that her Sarah must have told her about her imaginary friend, and that she was simply trying to emulate her big sister. Then she spoke again.

""She doesn't like you, Mommy""

""Why doesn't she like me?"" Claire responded, surprised. 

""I don't know."" 

Suddenly her daughter came bounding down the stairs as if nothing had happened. Even though both Jaime and Claire both found this slightly creepy, nothing about the situation ever felt threatening or malevolent. Until one night last month.

Jaime had put the kids to sleep around eight o'clock in the evening and he and Claire had got into bed soon after. Exhausted, Jaime and his wife fell asleep extremely quickly. Jaime was awoken by the sound of screaming. He was disoriented and had no idea what time it was, but he could tell that it was his wife screaming right next to him. He turned to see what was wrong and saw it. His 3 year old daughter Emily, standing beside the bed, with a hammer in her hand. Blood poured from Claire's forehead. Jamie jumped out of bed and grabbed the hammer out of his daughters hand. He turned to his wife. She had stopped screaming now, and Jaime grabbed a towel from the bathroom and wiped the blood away from her face. She was going to be alright, but she did have a deep cut to her forehead. 

Jaime picked up his daughter and carried her out of the room. He went and checked on Sarah, who had awoken to the screaming but was clearly unharmed. He told her that everything was alright and closed her door. He was standing alone with his daughter in the upstairs hallway, and he finally asked her, ""Emily, why would you hurt Mommy?""

""She told me to, Daddy.""

""Who told you to?"" 

""The woman standing right behind you. She told me to hurt Mommy"" And then Jaime felt a chill run up his spine when his daughter leaned into his ear and whispered, ""And she told me to hurt you too, Daddy.""

I just kept clicking through - that was my greatest vice. I could have let it rest. But with every story, my blood pumped faster, my breath came quicker.

There's nothing like a good scare. Every rush of adrenaline left me wanting more. That next fix got harder to find, took longer. I grew discerning, opinionated, a veteran of the genre. Soon I was writing for myself; days spent clacking the keys and nights spent in marathon research sessions. I was a crow picking through the maggots and gore for that next juicy nibble. I was a man consumed, and like a junkie messiah I wanted to share my high with others.

Everything has a basis in reality. Think about it. Why do the holy men think your soul needs saving? Why do children fear the dark? What's there in the unknown deep, what is it that averts our gaze?

That's why I'm here now. That's why I'm writing to you. I come bringing the ultimate high. All you have to do is believe. Believe in me, in the hellish nightmares that chase after you in your sleep, in the stories you read and the movies you watch. When you believe, the hunt is on.

My stomach is in knots, every heartbeat a hammer blow against my sternum. My hands are shaking. My breath comes in stecatto bursts. I can't hold on much longer. The anticipation is mounting, building to orgasmic frenzy. I found it, the ultimate high. Or rather, it found me. All I had to do was believe. All I have to do is turn around.

It's here. And it hates me.",I couldn't stop.,26,nosleep
lamented_dreams,4,,9,1rgqu8,,13,"I love the dark. I really do.

I don't mean going gothic and pagan and all that, but I do like the dark. I like to sit in my room for hours on end into the night watching videos, researching diseases and the supernatural, and writing stories.

Anyways, I've recently come across a quote from a game called 'Knock Knock'. And let me say, it's utterly terrifying for not just the player, but the watcher too. There's nothing but this overwhelming sense of dread throughout all of the game.

""You thought about it, and now, it is inside."" —Knock Knock

That quote has seemed to have seeped into my brain. Multiple broken theories have been written down in my notebooks and journals and I've seemed to have come to a conclusion.

The mind isn't wrong. Reality is. And, with that, imagination often holds more truth than what we accept.

Think about it. When you were a small child, things like fairytales and horror stories were much more real to your innocent mind. In fact, there is a theory that children have a sixth sense that they gradually lose as they progress into adulthood. Also when you were a child, you thought of monsters and what they would do to you as well as how terrifying they looked.

And when you thought about these things, you didn't want to turn around. Why? Because what if for the slightest moment, you were right? All those lone yellow eyes in the darkness, the sinking feeling of being watched, out of all those times, what if this was the moment you were right? Or moreover what if you were always right and they just didn't want you to know... until now.

Because honestly, we used to think the Earth was flat. Then that it had the sun revolving around us. So what makes us so absolutely sure that we are the only ones out there now?

This is my theory.

I shared with one of my colleagues about two weeks ago and five days later she called me screaming about how there was something in her house. The police showed up and they took her to the hospital. She had three slash marks down her back, resembling that of almost a wolf. She also had multiple bruises on her neck. They said there was no signs of break in and the wrecking of the house was most likely the result of her having a psychotic episode.

This could be true, but I don't like how unsettlingly close it is to when I told her about my theory.

""You thought about it, and now, it is inside.""

This is the phrase that keeps me from imagining creatures. When I went to the hospital to visit her she was curled up in the bed, shaking with her knees up as close to her chest as possible. When I asked her what happened she wouldn't tell me who, only that 'it' got inside. She just had this empty look in her eyes, something very uncommon since she was always so hyper and nice. When I asked how she just said, ""I thought about it, and it came in.""

Keep in mind I never told her about the quote at all. Those were her own words. So this is more than unsettling for me. It may be possible that this 'theory' spooked her enough for all of this to happen, but I don't like the coincidences.

What do you think?",The Theory,22,nosleep
angelcot,3,,2,1rh91p,,11,"Hi /r/nosleep. This is kind of embarrassing to post, but here's a few stories of things that happened to me as a kid. I was a pretty anxious kid, and a lot of weird stuff happened to me. Nothing paranormal, though There's more than just these stories, but I thought I'd at least start with this.

Ever since I was a kid, I've been afraid of windows. That's not saying much, though. I was afraid of just about everything else, too. But growing up, my house was full of big windows. Floor-to-ceiling windows in the family room, two sliding glass doors in the dining room, a huge window that looked out from our kitchen into the front yard. My mom never bought curtains or blinds for any of the windows other than the ones in our bedrooms because she'd get depressed if it were too dark in our house. 

I had light blue curtains in my bedroom that my grandmother sewed for me since my windows were an irregular size. Every night I would pull them closed, then pin them down to the walls with a pushpin so that I wasn't able to see even a sliver of the outside out of the corner of my eye. My bedroom window looked out on the backyard. I remember being so irritated whenever someone would accidentally leave the back porch light on. The light would shine through my light blue curtains and play shadows on my wall. I'd cover my head with my pillow so that I could fall asleep without worrying if I would be able to make out the silhouette of someone trying to peer through my curtains, still pinned to the wall. 

From a young age, I had problems with insomnia. My mom struggled with it, too. I remember my dad telling me stories of when my parents were still married, when my mom would wake him up just to talk because she still wasn't asleep at 4, 5, 6 in the morning. I remembered feeling envious that I didn't have someone to do that to. I listened to books on tape at bedtime to fill the silence. Sometimes I would sneak into my brothers' room and lay on their floor, hoping for sleep to come. Being uncomfortably aware of how their curtains weren't drawn completely closed. 

When I was 10, I moved from my room- which overlooked the backyard- to my brothers' room, and my brothers separated and took over my room, and the office. My new room was at the front of the house. If my curtains were open, someone could easily look in as they walked up the path to our front door. During the day, I didn't mind it. I could watch for my friends or packages from the postman. At night, it made me so anxious I began to develop a habit of vomiting nightly. My mom was sympathetic, but didn't know what to do about it. A year later, I was moved back into my old room, and my older brother moved back into his. I stopped vomiting every night. 

I feel like I had a reason for being so afraid of windows. One night- I must have been about 6 or 7- I was up late, as usual, listening to *Ralph S. Mouse* on tape for the billionth time. I had emptied the glass of water that my mom had gotten for me, so I got up to refill it. I was already wary of windows, so I kept my head down on my way to the kitchen. I'd often see things out of the corner of my eye; something moving, or something that *could* have been the shadow of a human, but would later try to convince myself it was nothing.

Even with my head down, something outside caught my attention. A car, parked in front of my house. I lived at the very bottom of a cul-de-sac, so we didn't have a lot of people drive down our street at night and stop to reorient themselves. The car had its headlights on, and I could tell there was someone sitting in the car. Looking at my house. I don't know if they were looking at me, but my paranoia told me they were. I stood there for a long time, forgetting about my glass of water. I didn't look away. Paralyzed, until my mom came in the kitchen. She'd seen my door was open and wondered what I was doing up. When she noticed the car in front of our house, she quieted and gently pushed me out of the kitchen and back to my bedroom. I noticed the car started to drive away as I was ushered away from the window. 

This staring contest with the person in the car in front of my house happened twice more, although over the course of a few months. Once, they switched their headlights off, and stayed for what might have been 45 minutes. Although my memory might be exaggerating. I still don't understand why I was so afraid of seeing someone in my bedroom window, but how I could fearlessly stare out of the kitchen window at the person in the parked car. Maybe I felt less vulnerable in the kitchen. Maybe I was comforted by the fact that they were so far away. Even though the walk from where they parked was just a few seconds from my front door and the window I was looking out. 

The third and final time I saw the car, the person got out of their car. They were tall, and I could see them standing on the other side of their car but I still wasn't able to make out their face. When they started to walk around their car and- I assume- towards my front door, I scurried back to my bed. 

I never liked sleepovers as a kid. Staying over at a friends house meant laying awake on their floor for hours with nothing to listen to but the sound of their calm breathing. Nothing to look at except for the sliver of their window I could see from behind their curtains. Having friends at my house was just as stressful. Usually we'd sleep in the family room, because it had a TV in it. It also had the floor-to-ceiling windows. Usually I would sneak off to my own room after my friends had fallen asleep, so that I could sleep peacefully away from those big windows. 

When I was about 8 years old, I was having a sleepover with a few of my friends. It was after 10, so my friends were starting to fall asleep. I knew I still had *at least* two or three more hours of being wide awake. I was laying on the couch, swaddled in my blanket. The TV was still on, but I'd turned the volume down for my sleeping friends to something barely audible. Usually, I tried to keep my eyes away from the windows. But that night my cat caught my attention, meowing and hissing at something outside. I cautiously looked out the window, worried about what my cat might have seen out there. Just another cat, skittering in front of the window. Relieved, I looked out at my dark backyard. Was that it? 

There was a man in my backyard, walking around. Even with the distance, I distinctly remember he was frowning. He had his hands in his pockets. I did not know this man. 

I woke up one of my friends, whispering in her ear and telling her there was somebody in the backyard. She stirred quickly, obviously alarmed, and looked outside. She saw him too. I'm not sure if he felt our little eyes on him or what, but he turned to face us. Neither of us made a move; not to lay back down and pretend we were asleep, not even to look at each other, or look away. 

There were a pair of french doors that lead to the back patio in my family room, right in the middle of the wall of windows. The man walked up to the doors and tapped on one of the small window panes. The handle of what looked to be a heavy flashlight hung out of the pocket of his sweatshirt. He smiled at us. Not a deranged smile, not a smile that looked too wide for his face. Just a calm, warm smile. He mouthed something and pointed at the doorknob. I was never very good at reading lips. I stared straight ahead, unblinking, not responding. I could hear my friends' breath, heavy and shaking. 

He spoke, the sound of his voice muffled through the glass, ""Open the door."" A pause, he knit his eyebrows together like he was concerned. ""I'm visiting your parent. Let me in."" 

My heart was beating out of my chest. I was a paranoid enough little kid to not fall for this line. I mustered up every ounce of courage I had in my little, anxious, 8-year-old body, and got up off the couch. For a moment, they man at the door looked relieved. I ran out of the room, screaming for my mom. I could hear my friend call out at me that he was leaving, and the rest of my friends starting to stir. I told my mom what had happened. She turned on all the outside lights and called the police while my step-dad looked out every window for any signs of the man. All of the girls at my sleepover had their moms come over and pick them up. I cried, and stayed the night in my parents bed, although I'm pretty sure I didn't sleep.

In my mom's bathroom, there was a big window that looked out at the sideyard. The glass was distorted, though, so my mom never bothered putting a curtain over it. You couldn't see into the bathroom if you were just passing by the window. If you stopped to press your face against the glass, you could see in or out, but everyone in the house knew not to do that when they were in the sideyard. I remember my mom shrieking one night, running out of the bathroom, saying she'd seen something through the glass. A rat, climbing up the windowsill and staring into the bathroom.

I always liked my mom's shower more than the one in my bathroom. My bathroom didn't have a fan in it, so the whole bathroom would get uncomfortably humid. The shower curtain in my bathroom reminded me too much of that scene from *Psycho*, too, and I'd always shower with the shower curtain pulled open, and I'd get water all over the floor. My mom's shower had a glass door that I liked much more, even if there was that big window I could see clearly from the shower. 

Once when I was 12, I was showering in my mom's bathroom because my parents were out of town. My brothers were home, but were playing video games in the family room. I would keep my head down when I showered in my mom's bathroom. Even if the window's glass was hard to see through, it was still a window, and the shower was the most vulnerable place I could think of being looked at. Every once and a while, I would glance up to quell my growing anxiety. To tell myself *nothing was out there*. 

Cautiously, I looked up to satisfy my anxiety. *Nothing was out there*, I told myself. My gaze met the window. There was a dark figure pressed up against the glass. Through the foggy, wet shower door, I couldn't see anything. All I know was that it was *somebody*. I screamed, and ducked down past the tiles so that whoever was out there, they couldn't see me. A few moments later, I heard my brothers knocking at the door, both of them calling my name and asking if I was ok. I pulled a towel from outside the shower and wrapped myself up before I stood up. Whoever was out there was gone. 

A few weeks later, my friends and I were playing in the side yard. There was a huge tree out there that we liked to climb in, and pretend we were characters from X-Men or Sonic. My friend called my attention to something in the grass, over by the window of my mom's bathroom. A polaroid picture of the distorted glass of the window it lay in front of.  ",Windows.,13,nosleep
Spudz_OCD,6,,6,1rgcw5,,9,"Hey redditors, im new at this so excuse my writing skills

All through my life ive had things happen that i just couldn't explain, i've told a couple of friends but even they don't know what to say.

My story begins when i was a kid about the age of six or seven, we lived in a poor neighbourhood in southern Ireland and had a shithole of a house, i lived in a room with my two brothers (kyle[8-9  at the time], and Dylan[3-4]) and had been for a couple of years so i was used to sharing a room. The first incident occurred after about a year in the house (our street was built on a graveyard) and happenned in our room. it was an ordinary day before it happenned, woke up, ate breakfast, went to school, nothing out of the ordinary. however when i came home from school that day, there was something odd about the house, I couldn't quite tell what it was but it just felt wrong. But being a kid at the time, i thought nothing of it and carried on with my daily routine. after dinner and a shower my mom put us to bed. After my mom turned out the lights and left the room, i began to drift off to sleep. after about an hour and a half of hazy dreams, i was suddenly awoken by a loud crashing sound, kind of like if you dropped a frying pan, i quiclky jumped up my pillow and sat upright in bed. I looked over to Dylan's bed at the other side of the room, he ws still asleep. I began to question if i had actually heard it at all. feeling curious i checked if kyle was awake (we had a bunk-bed, Kyle was on top) as i was climbing the four step ladder, i felt a burst of cold air rush from kyles bed and immediately dropped to the ground, waking up Kyle.
""what are you doing"", he said.
""i heard a noise so i wanted to see if--""
""--sshh"", he stopped me mid sentance, and focused his gaze to the back of the room; The look on his face will be forever imprinted into my mind. I turned around gingerly and what i saw was scary enough to make me cringe even today. I saw a scrawny black figure hunched over Dylan, who was still asleep. But this figure was definately not human; It was at least 7 feet tall, it's head was overpoweringly large compared to it's beyond anorexic body. It's fingers were 6-7 inches long minimum. From what i saw it wore nothing, but it very well could have, as it was late at night and i was still half asleep. Then the image that will haunt me forever; It, whatever it was, turned towards me and Kyle. It just stood there, staring at us for what felt like forever, it then jumped towards us and simply vanished into thin air right before it hit me. I was left lying on the floor and Kyle was wondering if what we had just seen was actually real. I looked at him and back to Dylan's bed, whatever it as, when it jumped it jumped with enough force to push the blanket off the end of Dylan's bed. I looked back towards Kyle, who was already asleep again, and decided to go back to sleep myself, not knowing if what we'd seen that night was just a figment of our imagination or not.
When i woke up the following morning i hesitantly asked my mom and sister if they'd seen or heard anything last night..they didn't. So i questioned kyle about it and he said that he had no idea what i was on about, he had no memory of seeing or hearing anything, he didnt even remember me falling off the bunk ladder.
To this day i still cant quite figure out what happened that night.

My second experience was only four or five years ago, a couple of months after moving to Australia. We were living in a pretty old house at the time so it was a bit creaky and what not. it was a pretty average day when it happenned;I was 14 and I was once again in bed at the time. I was sharing a room with Dylan (10) at the time. Kyle (16) was in a room across the hallway, Jenny (12) was the next door down and my parent's room was at the end of the hallway. It was about 11-12 at night, and we were all just about asleep. My mom and step-father at the time were out exploring the wild clubs of Surfers Paradise, so it ws just us kids. I was almost asleep when i heard slight footsteps coming from the kithcen area. I wondered who it was considering we were all in bed, so i opened the door to check. I headed towards the kitchen, once i reached the living room (about half-way to kitchen from my room) i could see into the kitchen, i slowly emerged from the wall; no one there..weird, i thought, so i headed back to my room, but as soon as i turned around Kyle was standing right in front of me with a knife. I jumped quicker than i'd ever jumped before. Kyle then laughed his head off and went back to bed. I did the same without the laughing.. I was back in my room, now lying in bed realising im too awake to go back to sleep. i just lay there for about five minutes staring at the ceiling untill i heard more footsteps in the kitchen. I called out
""Kyle, go to bed, idiot""
""i am you fuckwit"", he said as he emerged from his room half asleep
""well then who's upstairs?"" i asked
""It's probably just a possum in the attic or something don't worry""
I regretfully closed the door and went back to bed. But as soon as i did, loud heavy footsteps started making their way down the hallway, along with heavy thumping on the walls, they were getting closer and a hell of a lot louder, It sounded like someone was trying to stomp and bash rats out of the walls and floor. It kept coming closer and increasing in volume until it was at the point where it was like gunshots right outside my room. It then stomped right outside my door and my door swung open with extreme noise and force and standing at the door was, i shit you not, the same tall, black scrawny fucked up figure that i saw years ago. I practically shat myself. It stood there for a couple of seconds, but if felts like hours, then started stomping and sprinted towards my moms room. I don't know why but i instantly got up and ran towards the door and looked towards my moms room; nothing there, it vanished again. I dropped to the ground in shock, just as Kyle open his door and screamed ""WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT"" 
""It's back"" ,i said
""What's back?""
""the thing i saw hunched over Dylan""
I stayed up all night that night not wanting to sleep knowing that thing followed us to Australia

My most recent encounter with our old friend was last year. We'd moved into an old complex of houses that had a bit of a history in the crime side of things. We'd been living there for about 6 months and my friend from primary school, Jordan, was now living in the complex too. It was around 5PM and it was just Jordan Kyle and I in the house. I was playing my i-pod at the time, Kyle was in the kitchen and Jordan was behind me. Kyle decided to pick up a coin and throw it at an unsuspecting Jordan, who surprisingly, caught it, and returned fire. but then Jordan moved a little backwards and Kyle threw it further and harder. The coin flew through the air right past my head and stopped rigth in front of Jordans face, IT LITERALLY STOPPED IN MID AIR, it stood still in front of his face for less than a second and then was propelled back towards Kyle with nearly twice the force. We all just stood there speechless, not knowing if that had really just happened. Later that day we were showing a friend what had happened  and were back in the Kitchen messing around with coins to see if it would happen again. When suddenly a ball flew through the air at Kyle, like it had been thrown with force from the stairs leading upstairs. For the second time that day we were utterly speechless and had no idea what to do.
That night after Jordan had left and Kyle went to bed, i was making a late night snack. Dylan was in the living room watching TV and there was nobody else in the house. I finished making the snack and was about to head into the living room when in the corner of my eye, I saw the figure that i had seen twice before glide upstairs; same height, same scrawniness, same long fingers only this time it was a little misty, like a shadow, and it looked right into my eyes as it vanished upstairs.
I am still wondering what the actual fuck that figure is, all i know is that my mother has become a claire-voyant.I know for a fact that there is definately going to be a lot more of this thing which i have nicknamed ""the figure"".

For the time being i will keep an eye out for my little follower and if i see him/her again i will not hesitate to report the time, date, and details of the situation and of course reddit the fuck out of it.
for now redditors, i bid you farewell

the_dark_half,5,,1,1rhyj5,,7,"You know that feeling when you’re all alone and hear your name whispered? Maybe you’ve walked into a room only to suddenly feel a sudden temperature drop? Had things go missing only to re-appear in odd places? Maybe you’re like me and you lie in bed at night, only to feel like someone stroking your hair but when you become fully conscious and turn around, nothing. 
Think you walk through a cobweb or hair falls on your arms or neck and brushes against your skin delicately, tickling you? You check and nothing was there? I’m sure your parents tell you it’s nothing from a young age; perhaps because they themselves are deluded enough to believe that it is their imagination. They probably deep down fear it’s a ghost or apparition. Even they couldn’t know how much worse it really is.  Stop deluding yourself. It’s not a cobweb. It’s not the wind. It’s not nothing. It’s something far more sinister, an insidious force which slowly grows stronger the more you feed it your fear and attention. 

Some of you, I’m sure, will be fortunate enough only to feel cold spots and occasionally hear creaks and footsteps in your house. It’s such a common occurrence that people barely notice it and if they do, it’s the spookiest part of a generic horror movie, because those suits in Hollywood haven’t seen what these creatures are really capable of. If you believe in the paranormal you may experience the whispers of what I can only loosely refer to as their ‘voices’. I’m sure not many of you have had the misfortune to awaken to them standing over your bed, taking the forms of whatever creatures or person your subconscious fears most because it’s real form is so terrifying you’d probably die instantly or become paralysed with fear, a zombie-esque state you’ll never awaken from-and that would ruin their fun too early. If you don’t die instantly, seeing their faces will make your eyes bleed; hearing their voices unrestrained will shatter your ear drums and I’ve heard of cases where insides have been liquefied, skin melting and bleeding seeping out of every pore.

The first time I awoke to one in my room with me, it was after I’d given the footsteps and banging on the walls attention. I had thought it was cool, I even bought a stupid Ouija board and told them it was okay for them to try and talk to me. I had been lying in bed after a night of drinking so I passed off the initial taunts and laughs as nothing more than my intoxicated imagination, until my door slowly opened and in came one large hairy leg, followed by more spindly legs, followed by many eyes and two huge fucking fangs. Yep, a giant spider, bigger than a horse came into my room. I tried to scream, but that just resulted with me hyperventilating, then vomiting all over the floor. It strode in, all beady eyes on me and as it slinked atop my bed I tried to pathetically crawl away, but it held me down with its two front legs, piercing into the flesh of my shoulders as I whimpered like a small animal about to be devoured-which I was.  I felt the sharp pain of its fangs tear through my skin and inject me with poison that made my blood burn. I lay in bed, delirious, desperate, muttering for help. My ears were greeted with a cacophony of voices, screaming horrible things that were so foul that before that night had been unimaginable to me. I passed out shortly after, from fear, blood loss or the venom and awoke a few days later, believing to have all been a dream. I clung to that hope until I stepped outside my bedroom door and found dozens of small animals, birds mostly, wrapped up in what appeared to be spider’s webs, discoloured, drained of their blood and insides. All dead. I ran to the bathroom to throw up and caught sight of myself, dried blood caked on my body and face, puncture wounds all over me and strands of silky web still wrapped around my breasts, my stomach, my legs and in my hair. 

The second night I encountered one of them, they took the form of my uncle. I lived with my uncle for nearly 5 years while my father was travelling almost every week for business. I know my father loved me and desperately needed the money that he had to work from dawn until way after the sun set and had to leave me for long periods. He didn’t know what his brother did to me. That night as I became increasingly aware of the noises in my apartment and the feelings of someone touching me and whispering in my ear, I rolled over to see my uncle grinning at me. He crawled onto the bed and tied me down. I struggled, but when I did he beat me with his belt, like he had started doing when I was eight years old. I fought as hard as I could, tears burning my eyes and sobbing uncontrollably, but he kept cutting away at my clothes with a pocket knife and telling me to be a good girl. The torture that night lasted for many hours, possibly days. I try not to remember it. I thought I had moved on from those childhood years and buried them a few years ago, when my uncle died. This was not the last time the monsters took on forms like this to break me. They’ve only grown stronger with every drop of blood, with every scream and with every hopeless sob I’ve given them.

Their true form will only appear to you in dreams at first because they get to torment you in ways that won’t instantaneously butcher you or drive you insane, yet; they like to take their time with their toys. The dreams for me started after those incidents. I have seen what those beings really look like and…just thinking about it is enough for me to start violently shaking, unable to stop retching. The other day I wasn’t careful and thought about one of them and a stranger had to hold me back as I unconsciously started walking in front of a train. In my dreams, it is pure hell as they have my undivided attention for hours and can do whatever they want to me without my body breaking and bending the way it would in the waking world, but it all feels real. 
Part of me stares at length of rope on my coffee table and considers leaving this torment…but what if when I die, I get sent to their realm, to be their plaything forever? 

It’s not just the occasional brush against my skin, the odd floor creak and the rare moment of ‘is someone calling my name?’ Now I feel them on me at all times, their rough, sharp skin cutting mine, scratching me, violating every single part of my body. Their voices scream and howl at me, maniacally taunting and laughing at my never-ending misery. Even when I shut my eyes, I still see them, their hideous beings beyond any words the human language has to describe them to you. 

Most of you think of those household noises and strange occurrences as the work of ghosts, of spirits. Yes, it is so comforting for humans to believe these presences are the souls of dead people who are just sad and wandering, isn’t it? You want to be able to talk to someone no longer alive; you open your mind and let them in. Don’t. What’s out there isn’t human, it isn’t some person with unfinished business, what’s out there wants you to think that, to get comfortable with inviting it in and letting yourself become aware of it. 

Did you just hear that faint noise outside your window, like a soft breeze carrying a faint whisper? That creak outside your room? That faint sensation on your flesh? I hope not, because now you know what’s really there and they’ve always known about you.",Don't give them attention.,8,nosleep
Rhapsodeyus,1,,0,1rgtyq,,8,"Some may recall a story I posted a few months back, about shadow-like figures who visited me on a mission for knowledge, and afterwards, disappeared like ghosts. For those who do not recall, the story is [Curious Visitors](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l4dv2/curious_visitors/).

If you have not read that, well, you probably haven't missed much, but it will help with the backstory for this one if you do read it.

Done reading? Good, let's continue.

This happened last night, Sunday, November 24th, 2013. I woke up at precisely 4:27 AM, and I know this because I watched my small digital alarm clock on my bedside table flip to 4:27 AM as my eyes opened. I also noticed that my lamp was off (I sleep with the light on for safety reasons, since living with cats can be hazardous). However, I could see my plain, black clock in a pale blueish light.

My brain clicked. ""My laptop is on. I must have left it on and the power went out, so it's running on battery."" Then I remembered, quite clearly, turning it off and closing it before going to bed. That's when I felt a weight at the end of my bed, sitting in front of my laptop.

I sat up, looked, and spotted a shadowy figure sitting in front of my laptop. The NoSleep submission form was up. I coughed, and said quietly, ""You could have asked."" Instead of, say, a sudden spin and a glare from Brarger, as I expected, my visitor vanished instantly.

I didn't expect that, and it startled me thoroughly. My previous visitors would never have been so rude, and certainly would have asked my permission to access my personal computer. I shifted, tossed the covers aside, and moved to the end of the bed, to read what it had written.

I now wish I hadn't.

&gt; *P.S.: Don't trust the*

The message ends there. I suppose I interrupted the agent and he fled.

Whether this is genuine or not, I cannot know. If it is a fake by a rogue agent, then its purpose is unclear, but it is certainly unsettling. If this is a prank, then it's impressively elaborate, yet in poor taste.

But if this is real... Then I'll be on my guard. But I have to wonder... What, or who, were they telling me not to trust?",Interrupted Warnings,8,nosleep
JUVIE_MAKER,2,,1,1rhq9j,,8,"I have a nose for things. No seriously, all my life I’ve had a very strong sense of smell and I don’t mean for the average person. I have an abnormally, freakishly, ridiculously, absurd sense of smell. It’s been that way since I was a kid. Here’s a prime example, when I was about four or five I used to visit my grandmother (god rest her soul) every month in Daytona Beach for the summer. My grandmother was notorious for making the best homemade cakes in the neighborhood. I would always leave my Gran’s house at least ten pounds heavier each summer after gorging myself on her delicious treats. One Saturday, after a day of playing outside (when kids used to play outside!) I instantly smelled the aroma of cake wafting through the air, but something was…..off. There was another smell lingering behind the cake scent. It was kinda tangy, bitter, sorta nutty …just all around unpleasant. Being so young, I couldn’t quite put my finger on what the smell was but I knew I didn’t like it. Then out comes my Gran from the kitchen with a big slice of her freshly made cake on a china plate. She passes the dining room table and spots me standing there with my nose crinkled up in disgust.

Gran:  What’s the matter baby? Come sit at the table and have a slice of cake.

Five year old me: I aint eating that cake, it smells funny!

(Let me just interject for a second.  Now if your family is old school like mine, you know that a child is to NEVER disrespect an elder’s cooking! Especially if that elder is a family member, you just don’t do it! That is unless you want a black eye, ribs broken, missing teeth… you get the picture.)

Gran: Girl, get your hind parts over here and eat this cake before I slap the hell out of you!!

Oh geez…there’s that tone. You know it, you know it well. That angry deep tone that resonates from parents when their truly pissed off. You know… that voice that scares the living shit out of you and gives you’re delicate child-like mind nightmares for a month (or your whole life). Yeah that’s what I was hearing right about then. But still I was adamant. I would not eat that damn cake. That smell! It was just too potent. Now, you might be thinking, what’s the big deal? Surely you’ve smelled worse things than that cake before, which is very true. At that point in my life I’d smelled worse things before (WAY WORSE) but I’d never been subjected to eat those things either. Also, the stench of that pastry….it was just… so very not right. I was only a child but I was still old enough to know right from wrong, and that cake was definitely wrong! Even at that very moment I could taste its bitterness in the back of my mouth. With every inhale it burned and tingled down my throat.

Gran: Come over here and take this plate now!

Okay at this point I knew I was in REAL trouble. Even if my grandmother didn’t kill me, I was pretty sure I was in for the ass whooping of my life! I slowly started to back away from Gran as she moved closer to me with that dreaded cake. Even as she inched towards me that smell seem too magnify. With every step she took it grew more and more intense! “Girl, you better take this cake!” she yelled holding the plate out in front of her. I turned to run but she quickly snatched up my arm before I could get away. “No!” I shouted feverishly trying to pull away from her grip, “I don’t want the cake, granny!!” but my pleas of desperation came to no avail. My grandmother started to tug me towards the kitchen table, her fingers angrily wrapped around my tiny forearm. Suddenly, she yanked me forward making my body jump about two feet in her direction, tilting my face towards hers. She looked down at me with an awful glare. Dark hollow eyes glowered down from Gran’s wrinkled sockets. Her once loving face was now rigid and stiff with a sadistic expression that I had by no means seen before. “You will eat this cake!” She shouted through gritted teeth. “Even if I have to shove it down your throat piece by piece!” 

I had never seen this side to my Gran before. My once sweet, devoted granny had turned into this vicious monster plucked straight out of my worst nightmares. My small frame quaked in fear and tears began to seep from my eyes. I had never known terror like this. My insides loosened and squirmed like jelly making the contents of my bladder empty and leak down my legs. To say I was afraid would be the understatement of the freakin decade! But you know what? There was something else I was more fearful of. Even as I pissed myself in sheer horror from the presence of my devil-like grandmother, there was still something more bloodcurdling, more utterly terrifying than her…that fucking cake! 

“NO!!!!!!!” echoed from my lips in a banshee scream and with all the strength I possessed I juggernauted into my grandmother. My body throttled into her torso head first making a loud solid grunt bellow from the old woman. Her arms flew in the air (letting me go in the same instance) and her vast body collapsed backwards before suddenly….CRACK!
The sound of my grandmother’s head crashing along the rim of her kitchen table splintered throughout the house. Gran thudded to the ground like a sack of potatoes and the plate with the cake she so firmly held onto shattered on the floor. I stared at her lifeless body as blood began to seep through her head and flow on the linoleum. I was still too little to know the true meaning of life and death but I did know for sure that red liquid was not suppose to be running out of her head like that. I bent down and looked into Gran’s half opened eyes. They weren’t black any more. They’d gone back to their normal brown again. Not really knowing what to do I just stared down at the gruesomeness of it all, watching the chunks of yellow cake absorb the blood until each piece was just as red. 

To make a long story short the police were eventually called. My Gran’s weekly bridge game was on that day and a couple of her elder counterparts found her body, and me sitting in a pool of piss and blood staring at it. Needless to say there were lots of screams. Oh, and you’re probably wondering what that smell was, right? I actually didn’t find out until I was well into my teens what exactly it was. I was pouring it into my foster parent’s coffee one morning when it finally hit me…Cyanide. From the smell of it, Gran probably couldn’t have used too much either. Maybe half a teaspoon, give or take; totally undetectable to the average person’s nose…but not to mine. “So that’s what that was, go figure”.  I remember thinking that to myself as I stirred the cyanide into two mugs. My foster parents passed away later on that day, I wish I could say I feel sadness over it but I really don’t.  I was more consumed with thoughts on why my grandmother was trying to kill me? Was it because of what I’d done to Oscar, her cute little Maltese? I mean, if I’d known the oven wasn’t a suitable place to put a dog I might have done things differently. I was only two at the time. Or perhaps it had something to do with what happened with Mommy…that really was unfortunate. I didn’t want to hurt her, but she was an obstacle that just had to be removed. 

But anyways, that’s neither here nor there. I’m an adult now and those days are long behind me. I’m actually on my way to my boyfriend’s…excuse me….ex-boyfriend’s apartment right now. I’m visiting him and that slut he cheated on me with. And guess what? They just had a baby, isn’t that the sweetest thing.  ",A nose for things...,9,nosleep
1234FUCK,7,,4,1rhjmk,,6,"So my uncle has always been into the paranormal and he got me into paranormal investigation, Or ghost hunting to simplify it a few years back. Well I go with him on a lot of them and we do it for free for people who think something paranormal is going on in their houses. I always saw it as a nice little hobby to do on the weekends to blow of some time and I always liked being scared. I mean that’s how I even know about this sub-reddit because I like reading it. And that’s one of the only reasons I knew about what had happened on my last investigation. 


	We got a call from a family out in the middle of the country saying they had begun hearing weird voices when they were each alone but the 16 year old son was the one who had it happen the most. I went through every scenario I could think on the way there, Something was legitimately going on that was paranormal, one of the kids was lying and was fucking with the rest of the family and other such things. Well when we got there we talked with the family and everyone seemed happy except the two children. The son was as I said earlier 16 and the girl was 14, they seemed uneasy looking off into corners and such. I took a note about it but didn’t dwell on it that much. We went around the house marking places we would put cameras and getting the lay out of the house. Once we finished that we went back to our van and started getting ready. After we set up all of our equipment we each got our POV (Point of view) cameras strapped on and started our investigation. My Uncle took the upstairs, our colleague took the first floor, And I went into the basement to do a little investigating of my own. 


I made my way downstairs and grabbed my Walky-talky and radioed my uncle asking if everyone was ready for me to hit the main light breaker. He gave me the go ahead and I flipped the little switch plunging the whole house into darkness I held up the other camera I had with me so I could have a camera move around freely ( plus it had a night vision setting so I could see where I was going.) Well I turned it on and walked slowly to the chair I had placed in the room so I could sit comfortably waiting for something to happen. And after an hour or so of me questioning the darkness.. It answered back.
My instincts kicked in and I put a call in on the radio for everyone to tell me where they were. And everyone was exactly where they said they were supposed to be. My heart froze in my throat from fear but excitement so I stood and asked who I was talking to and I heard a small wispy chuckle before it said softly “You know who I am.” I swallowed hard before continuing to walk around the room and asking questions. It stayed silent for a few questions before I asked why it was here. It chuckled again before I heard a small sound. Like a door knob jiggling and I turned towards it. My camera landed on a door knob sticking out from a sheet that I guess had covered it before. I walked towards it slowly pulling the sheet off to reveal a shabby door about waist height with peeling paint and scratch marks.  I put in a call on the radio telling my uncle and the others I had found something and for them to meet me in the basement. I got no answer back but I assumed they had gotten the message. My uncle did that a lot; he tended to get over excited with these things so I figured he was just trying to get here as fast as possible.  But the paranormal curiosity ran in the family so I reached down and grabbed the knob, it was warm as if someone had been holding it for a longtime. I steadied myself before twisting it and pushing it open. 


I looked through my camera screen as I walked into the door. The atmosphere around me seemed to change instantly, even though all the lights in the house was off it just seemed to be darker and colder in here the basement itself.  I looked around in the room through the screen until I saw a lone chair in the center of the room. I walked forward until I was right next to it and then began looking around more. I jumped a bit at the bright light on my screen until I noticed it was a mirror. It was bolted onto a beam  next to the chair and when I looked to the left I noticed the same thing. I thought it was really strange so I walked around the front of the chair and accidentally kicked something over.  It was loud and then I heard a sound of rushing water. My heart leapt into my throat as I looked down and around looking for the source until my camera came upon a metal bucket slightly rolling with water coming out. I also saw a candle and a small match book and that’s when it hit me. My whole body filled with fear as the realization flooded my head…. This was a “three kings” set up.


 I turned towards the door pointing the camera as I looked through it I saw the door slam and I stopped. My whole body froze from pure terror and it took me a few seconds before I let out a scream for help. After I stopped I heard the soft chuckle come from behind me in the darkness and I just stood there with my eyes closed shaking as I felt a soft breath on the back of my neck I heard a voice.. My voice whisper right into my ear. “ Do you know who I am now?” I stood there for a second before screaming again and then I heard the door bust open and I saw flash lights on me and my uncle asking what was wrong. I just ran from the room to the breaker box and flipped on all the lights. I then sank to the floor looking at him as he sat next to me and asked all that happened. I just held out my camera to him and he took it. Before he watched it he asked me why I didn’t call for back up and I looked at him before telling him that I did. He looked at our colleague before watching the recording.


 After that he asked me if we all went in together would I go back in. I nodded as long as we kept the lights on and we went in. and it was as I thought. It was a set up for “ The three kings.” I shuddered as I turned to my uncle asking if he knew what it was. He didn’t so I explained it to him and I pointed to the bucket “ and it has been used recently. The bucket was full of water. “ My uncle nodded to me and put a wrap on the investigation. We went back home and I have decided to type this up. Tomorrow we will be going and talking to the family about what happened and who had done the three kings in the house.  


I think the three kings set up has something to do with what has been happening at the house. I will update you all on what happens after we talk to them.

OsamaBinHiding,3,,1,1rhxdo,,6,"Last night was like every other night for me. Have dinner on my own in my small, yet cost flat and watch a little bit of TV. Around 9 or 10 o'clock, I start to crack on with some work as I had a university deadline in a couple days time. The minutes started going faster and before I knew it it was 12 o""clock. 

""Where did the time go?"" I thought. It had only felt like a few minutes. However, this was a normal occurrence for me. The world kind of, disappears when I get lost in a train of thought and for the life of me, I can't break out of it.

I had just remembered that I had a seminar early in the morning and suddenly thought ""Fuck, I better try and get some sleep"" 

See, I live in an old building that has been converted into flats in the suburbs of a major city. So it isn't uncommon to hear floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and all the walls are very thin so noises in the middle of the night just tend to go over my head. I wouldn't consider myself someone who doesn't get scared easily but when you're familiar with floorboards creaking in the middle of the night and branches tapping your window - you tend to grow some thick skin.

Last night wasn't like any other night in my flat though. 

As I mentioned earlier, I was alone. My flatmate - let's call him, Evan for the sake of the story, was away celebrating thanksgiving with his family but he's away a lot so I'm used to spending a long period of time on my own. My usual night routine of showering, brushing my teeth and cleaning the kitchen was over and I went into my room to finally rest my head for the night and that was when I first noticed something. My drawers were all pulled open. 

To most people, this is probably nothing - but for me it wasn't normal. I suffer from borderline OCD and everything, especially in my room needs to be in order and I remember waking up and everything was in order. I hadn't left my flat today either. 

""I'm too tired for this shit"" I thought and went to bed. 

It's weird though isn't it? That something like a mattress and a duvet can make you feel so safe, like nothing can hurt you. I remember being a child and I made sure none of my limbs were outside of my bed incase something grabbed me in the middle of the night. Such a feeble piece of furniture can make you feel so safe.

Well, not anymore for me. Last night I heard the usual creaking of the floorboards - no biggy, right? However, as I drew closer to conscientious, I realised that these creaking sounds weren't coming from the surrounding walls and neighbouring flats but they were coming from under my bed.

And that's when I felt the unmistakable sensation of a cold, coarse finger stroking mine over the side of my bed.

TaylorBonaseraSr,0,,2,1rhb2e,,5,"I can explain why I'm so afraid of mirrors, or anything that could reflect light, even a glass door. It's so difficult for me to talk about it sometimes, but other times I feel her pressing me on to tell as many people about her as possible. She broke my mirror the first time, just crashed right through the glass and shattered the glass into a literal hundred pieces. It was such a pain to have to clean all that up. I got at least five cuts. But she didn't care. At the very least she didn't laugh at me or yell at me to clean faster. At least she was nice enough to check herself for that. Anyway, I got my mirror replaced. She didn't break the bathroom mirror again, but she broke the great mirror in the hallway while she was running through it. I don't understand how she did it, it's pressed up right against the wall. She'd have to ram her body sideways. She didn't even have any visible cuts. She told me she was sorry, and that she would try not to do it again. I believed her, and she was true to her word. But soon enough, I hear the crashing again. But this time it's my door. The majority of my glass door has been smashed through, but the weird thing is that the hole is shaped like Quasimodo. No one lives here that has a body shaped like that. The other times I checked her she didn't have any cuts on her, but this time she was bleeding so much from every part of her body that she had to go to the hospital. I had to sit there and watch her, but she couldn't explain what had happened. When the doctor asked, neither could I, because I hadn't been there. It's strange how selective she is; she won't smash into anything except mirrors or glass-looking things. Anywhere there isn't this kind of stuff, nothing bad happens. She tells me that she feels so cold whenever she walks by something like that, and she gets an uncontrollable urge to destroy it. She talks to me about it so often I feel like I'm beginning to share the feeling.

It's starting to unnerve me, and I don't want to live with her anymore. But I can't break the joint liability contract. She told me to cover all the things in the house that could possibly create a reflection, so I did. But I find her desperately tearing off the covers when she thinks I'm not looking.

One day I'd had enough so I decided to take off one of the covers in my room. It couldn't hurt, just for a little while when she couldn't see. She wouldn't notice. But after a minute of reveling in my refreshed reflection, I saw her standing there. So close. She was so ugly. She copied my expression and mocked my horrified face. She followed me here, to my own room. I couldn't turn around. There was no point. I felt a pressure from her on my shoulders so great I couldn't keep a straight posture. She was laughing at me.

But I'd heard that laugh somewhere before. And I'd seen that face before too. It looked so much like my own. She must have heard my thoughts, because she said she told me to never look at her by means of a reflection. I couldn't stand the sight of her face anymore, it was so scary. It'd been such a long time since I'd spent so many minutes just staring at her. I had to take control. So I bashed the bedroom mirror in, balling my bare hands into fists and repeatedly thrashing until I could feel the glass cutting into my skin.

It'd been so long since I'd last done that. Now every time I look, I can see her, feel her, I see her staring at her...our...reflection, through my eyes.",My Blank Mirror,7,nosleep
SeaDweller7,2,,2,1rhilw,,4,"I go to a regular school, its kindergarten to year twelve, so its pretty big. But, my school is an old public school, and the principle is ancient. Me? I am in year twelve, and I’m graduating next year, and my friends said I should share this story with you guys. 

Ok, where to start? Well, at my school we have a pretty serious problem with bullies, and when I say serious I mean it. One year our school was even on the news, but it was pretty traumatic. When I was in year nine, there was this little girl in fifth grade, called Melody. Her and me sort of talked sometimes, as she was a new girl and I was her school buddy (to show her around and stuff) She was a sort of short, curly brown haired, blue eyed and geeky girl. Glasses and all of that stuff, so your stereotypical nerd. Which pretty much was what she was.

After I moved up in to Tenth grade it was pretty clear that she was being bullied. Instead of gossiping or playing with the other girls, she just sort of walked around the school... bouncing a tennis ball and wandering around the grounds of the school. 

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

Then, half way through the year, school was stopped. During lunch they lined us up and called our parents. Sent us home. They just said there was an accident. My mother and father lived in Melbourne and I lived with my uncle and aunty, and they’re pretty laid back and all ‘come home when you feel’ so I stayed at school.

I saw five year six girls with that sort of ‘we know nothing it wasn’t us we didn’t do anything’ look on their face before I saw an ambulance and a white body bag. Out of the end of the body bag stuck out locks of curly brown hair, and the always-screeching birds seemed to sing a sweet tune. A melody.

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

Last week we had a substitute teacher who started screaming at a girl who was outside bouncing her ball after the end of lunch bell had rung. She didn’t realise Melody wouldn’t listen. 

No one knew why the back stairs from German were out of bounds for two months, and why the German teacher quit. No one asked why those five girls we’re stared at my Melody’s sort of... ghost.

I pieced it together. A simple push, a simple tumble. A simple death.

No one cares, all the kids just skip past her, all the laughter swallows up her silence. 

Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

It has been a little over a year since I last wrote - just over a year since the last nightmare.  I was foolish to think I was somehow cured, that, as Dr. Lough suggested, getting it out of my head and into a journal would help.

I read back over my last and only journal entry, as I tried to describe the nightmare.  It is so chaotic and scattered, yet I'm unable to find any other way to convey the details.  That is the terror of the dream at its core - utterly chaotic.  Jerking from one sensation to the next, the hesitant probing of my fingers as they cover the smooth flesh where my eyes should be, to the damp defeat in realizing those fingers have torn away the protective lids in confusion.  All of this, in layers of sleep - waking to the comfort of my mother's figure, only to then know it is just another stage of the dream playing out, with her eerie voice echoing through my body:

""You're connected now.""

Even now, in understanding that my last entry seemed to bleed out through the pages, I'm struggling to form coherent thoughts onto this paper.  Each detail seems to tie into the next, only to fall apart when I try to see the whole.  I wonder what type of clinical association Dr. Lough could make?  Is this what schizophrenia feels like?  I have no way to explain it.  It is as though there is a novelist's grand plot line swirling around my body in paper shreds and each time I reach out I can snatch only a sliver of a scene, unable to ever piece the parts into an understanding.  I'm fairly certain this entry, and perhaps any subsequent entries, will be just as erratic.  I just cannot force these thoughts together.

So much has changed in the last year, it is so hard to recall my state of mind the last time the nightmare came to me.  I have a son now, nearly 6 months old.  We must have just found out Rachel was pregnant around the time I last wrote.  Could that have been a factor in the nightmare returning after years of peace?  Was my mind so overwhelmed with the thought of being a father, the changes to my life, the responsibility, it somehow dredged that old horror back from my subconscious?  I can't help but think it must have played a role.  It has been a blur, so many other things seem to have fallen into place.  Though they are exciting, it seems predetermined, somehow rushed.

Over the last decade I have had a slight obsession with the home I grew up in.  I knew I would live there once again - returning it to ownership in my family - though I never anticipated it would happen so quickly.  Rachel's grandmother died, leaving her an inheritance that allowed us to leap forward several years in our plans together.  It was Christmas Day, the day she died - I guess her last gift to us.  Three months after my son was born, we were moving back into the mountains, back to the walls I had called home as a boy.  

One thing I feel for certain, this home is the source.  The nightmare started here, always took place here, was always fueled here.  I'm beginning to remember things, or have recurrent thoughts I have not had for nearly two decades.  It is as though these things are unlocked from muscle memory as I walk this house.

As a child I would reach the top of the second floor staircase, which opened onto a hallway, always with my head down staring at my feet.  Left, at the end of a long hallway was a guest room.  Large floor to ceiling windows would reflect back a warped view of the person looking down to them.  Right, across a short landing was my bedroom.  I had trained myself to never look left at night - as the small nightlight by my bedroom door would throw twisted shadows onto my reflection in the long guest room windows.  If I would look up, I would become stuck in fear with the reflection.  The windows seemed to pulse with my heartbeat, flexing my body larger then smaller in the glass.  My feet became rooted in place, the black of the windows and the emptiness behind them tunneling out for me.  The nightlight would flicker in then out, each time causing my shape to jump forward, as though I were being pulled down the hallway towards the darkness.  I never remembered breaking loose, turning and walking back to my bedroom and going to sleep.  I would wake up in my bed hours later, staring at my hands, inspecting for blood and knowing I just had the nightmare. 

I learned, I kept my head down and did not look to the left.

Our first night in the home, that muscle memory followed suit.  After turning off the main floor lights, I climbed the staircase.  My son was sleeping against my chest, his arms wrapped around my neck and shoulder.  My head was down as I crested the top step, turning to the right, towards my room which was now his.  As I neared the bedroom door, his forehead left my shoulder.  His back straightened and his arm peeled away from my neck.  I felt his arm extend straight back behind my head.  I didn't need to look at his eyes, I knew.  Those eyes followed his arm to his hand, reaching down the hallway to the windows.  The nightlight flickered as he let out a giggle.  I took the last step into his bedroom and shut the door.

Sunny day in Nevada. Families having lunch outside, fathers teaching their sons how to grill steak, playgrounds
filled with kids. Every year I plan a trip with my son. Nevada has really nice caves in it. When I was little,
my father always took me there and so did his father. I didn't want to break this chain. I told Jake, my son, about that
cave that I used to visit but I did not have enough time to take him there until now. He was still sleeping when
I stepped in his room.
""Honey wake up!"" Jake opened his little eyes and whispered:
""What?""

""We are going to see the cave I told you about!"" he instantly jumped out of his bed and become so excited that
I can't even tell about it. He got dressed and ran to have something to eat. About five minutes later he was screaming
from the garage door.
""Hurry up mom!""

One hour car ride. Not the longest one he ever had. He kept asking me about the place. I just smiled and told him to
be patient. As soon as I parked the car, he blasted out the door and ran to the back of the car to grab two flashlights. 
""You ready?"" I asked him. He obviously was so we started walking towards our destination.
It was dark in there. Darker than anywhere else. Flashlights on.  He just kept pushing forward. Sometimes I couldn't 
even catch up with that little kid. After a sharp left turn I saw him standing there. He found it. The biggest hall 
in the cave. Every wall was shining when the light of our flashlights reached them.
""Beautiful isn't it?""

""It is indeed!"" he answered. He turned his head towards me but it was only q light at a corner 
that he could see. He totally crapped himself. ""Mommy wait for me!"" He started running towards the light 
that he could see. It is a maze down there. - MOM! - he screamed.
""I'm here honey!"" He caught up with me. He just gasped there and started to be a bit relieved as he realized 
that he was not alone in that dark cave again.
""Hey calm down little boy! I'm not leaving you here!"" went closer to him and whispered:  ""Or am I ?

I've been having a lot of bad dreams for the past 3 weeks, but i think this one tops all of them. Anyhow, I dreamt that I lived with my boyfriend in a big house, it was night and we both were sleeping. Suddely i wake up, and I sit up in our bed. I'm fully aware that I'm sleepwalking but I can't stop myself, lay down again or do anything about my actions. I start walking out in a big hallway (this is where the main door is located), then I enter a smaller, much more narrow and dark hallway, and in the end is a small wardrobe-like room which is truly pitch black. This scared me a bit since I am afraid of the dark but I just keep walking, I don't even consider NOT to walk in to the wardrobe. So I find myself inside this pitch black tiny room and I close the door and I lock it. Once I have locked the door i just panic, I'm not afraid but I simply can't stop screaming, I remember the scream so well, it was a true scream of despair, I screamed at the top of my lungs but I still was not scared. I started to bang the door, the walls, everything while screaming and crying as hard as I could. Finally my boyfriend comes to the rescue and the door was open now, he just grabs me and tells me I was sleepwalking and I just said ""I know"" in the sternest voice. He's scared out of his life and crying and I just looks at him like he's crazy and then i just go back to bed like nothing happened.

ephique,0,,0,1rikrx,,4,"I grew up in a small town in Ohio with my mom, dad and big sister. We were a normal family, neither happy nor sad, somewhere in between. I was always interested in music as a kid so I spent most of my time playing piano, practicing guitar or trying my best to write my own songs. It was also some sort of medicine for me; it helped me drift away into my own world when my sister and my mom had disputes. You see, my sister was one of those rebellious teenagers at the time that had to have their own way or the rest of the world had to suffer their unfair ranting. I hated it; I hated hearing her yell at my poor mother.

During a lonesome walk home from school one day I got a call from my dad, making sure that I didn’t have any plans and telling me that I had to come home as fast as possible. My dad never called my cell phone unless he really wanted something so I knew right away something was up. I remember jogging most of the route home, since my dad sounded so serious. It gave me the creeps to say the least.

I jumped over the fence surrounding our villa and paced myself into our house. The kitchen was the first room you’d see upon entering and it was empty so I assumed they were in the living room upstairs. As I was making my way up the stairs I could hear my sister sobbing uncontrollably, something had definitely happened. My dad was standing up as my sister was sitting on the couch, he told me to sit down as well.

I was scared and curious at the same time. Dad and my sister never really spoke or had any arguments since my father didn’t bother caring too much about any of my sisters business, so I could figure out that this wasn’t about my sister. I remember sitting there in dead silence with the exception of my sister shedding tears and trying to keep her crying as quiet as possible. My dad was looking like he had no idea what to do or say, as if he didn’t know how to explain something to me.

Finally, after a long pause my dad made an introduction to whatever I thought this was about at the time. He said: “Your mother…” and then he needed to grasp some air, and he continued: “Your mother has passed away.”

I was eight years old and I couldn’t grasp that concept. I didn’t understand death, or that my mom was eternally gone. I just sat there as I was developing an irrational anger towards god-knows-what, I remember thinking how unfair this was. I do however forgive my dad for telling me so bluntly, he didn’t know what to do and he was in shock at the time.

My sister continued crying, she asked dad how mom died although it was obvious she didn’t actually care to know at that precise moment. She was just being desperate and no one could blame her. I thought it was my sisters fault when I was there, I thought that was why she was crying so much. I didn’t shed a single tear; I kept it all inside. Of course that didn’t mean this incident didn’t haunt me for years, I never stopped thinking about my mother. 

The aftermath of my mother’s death is what has been shaping my life the recent years. My sister was very weak emotionally and it basically drove her insane. My dad had to take her to an actual mental hospital. Something I didn’t even think existed when I was eight. This resulted in that I didn’t get to meet my sister very often, my dad kept telling me she was in a special school for students that wanted a challenge; but I overheard enough conversations to know where she really was. I guess my dad was trying to keep me out of it, and I didn’t blame him. 

I was guessing that my sister wasn’t doing very well at the hospital since we got to see her less and less as years went by, something that troubled me; I hated living in this big villa of ours with just my dad. It felt so dead, and my dad had been more kept to himself after mom died. We didn’t do anything, I literally spent all time at home in my room, making or playing music. Me and my dad didn’t even greet sometimes when I came home from school, it was depressing. My theory for his change in behavior has always been that he blamed himself for my mother’s death, something that I’m about to get into.

You are probably wondering how she died by now, and it’s a legit question to be asking. The best answer I could give you is that I don’t know. My dad has always told me she died of liver-failure but for some reason that has always sounded like a lie to me. It didn’t add up, my mom never had any problems with her liver before and she didn’t drink. I think it was something he made up when I was younger because he assumed I wasn’t mature enough to hear the truth. In addition to this, whenever I asked my dad about this matter he’d get heavily upset. Nowadays I never ask about my mom’s death, nor do I even bring up mom as a topic.

Years went by and I ended up being fourteen. It kept going like I just described, I spent most times in my room playing music as my dad did whatever he was doing on his own in the house. My dad did work, he had the night-time shift at a local bottle factory, I’m not joking, he actually made glass bottles for a living. He had higher ambitions but most of them got crushed when he and my mother got my sister, they had to move and dad basically had no other financial option than to quit the university he was attending at the time and get a quick and close job. You guessed it, the bottle factory.

I was riding my bike home late at night after spending the evening in the school library at one point when I was fourteen. My school was the type that had an after-school library that didn’t close till 11 pm. I didn’t need any of the books or supplies that the library offered; I just studied there sometimes since it felt less depressing than my father and our lonely villa. Either way, I hadn’t seen my sister for two years that night and I was starting to get the idea that I wouldn’t see her again for another two. 

When I arrived at the house the front door was open, “This is odd?” I thought. Upon closer examination I realized that someone had taken the spare key from its hidden spot underneath one of my mother’s old jars. It’s never smart to have a spare key hidden right next to the door, number one mistake people do when it comes to spare keys. It did look like whoever had taken it did suffer a struggle before finding it. The rug outside the door was all muffled up and there were scratches on the door, around the lock. I suspected we had been robbed so I pulled out my cell phone, ready to call the police. 

This is when I heard something coming from inside the house. I was dead scared to say the least, this could have been armed robbers or maybe something worse, I didn’t know. It sounded like someone was grinding furniture against the floor, trying to move it. It was so dark as well, I remember not seeing more than pitch black looking into the open door, technically if someone was in there they would have seen me because of the street lights. I started to slowly pace into the house, walking towards the noise. This is where I had to make a decision, was I going to suddenly turn on the lights in order to reveal whatever was in there or was I going to approach it in the dark? I picked the former. I was just going to switch the lights on when I could see someone strafe into the light coming in through the kitchen window. It was my sister, naked. My entire mindset had to change into a totally different way of dealing with the situation; it took me a good couple of seconds to assume she escaped the hospital. 

I switched on the lights in an instant. She had redecorated the entire kitchen, in the dark. Of course it all looked hideous and random; she didn’t know what the hell she was doing. I remember being in a slight discomfort, I had never seen my sister naked in my entire life. I also hadn’t seen her for a good couple of years at all. She didn’t look very comfortable either, she looked like she didn’t know who I was and was wondering what I was doing there.

I uttered “Linda?” out loud, that was her name. She didn’t respond, she just continued standing there looking at me. “Don’t you remember me, I’m your brother.” I still couldn’t get any feedback out of her; it was as if the wheel wasn’t spinning at all. I wasn’t sure what the protocol here was, not knowing the number to the mental institution or anything I figured I’d try to call dad, before I got to press the call button on my cell phone she uttered: “Don’t call dad.” This is when I realized she couldn’t be completely empty inside after all.

“You don’t want to call dad.” She continued.  I had no idea what to do, I assumed this was part of the reason she was in the mental hospital in the first place. Luckily my dad got home at that point, not coming from a finished shift at work. He had a good five hours at least left, I assumed the hospital had phoned him and told him about the situation. My father ran into the house as fast as he could.

This is when something I didn’t expect happened, he told me to leave. He pointed at the door as if I had no idea how to find my way out of my own house. I asked him where I was supposed to go, he told me to wait in his car. Judging from how serious my dad seemed I didn’t think twice about it, I ran out to the car. As I was sitting in the car I could see my sister walk past the kitchen window a couple of times, I remember how she made no effort to cover her breasts. I had no clue what the two of them were discussing, although I never saw my sister move her lips so I’m guessing my dad did most of the talking. 

After a couple of minutes my dad started to walk to the car, he joined me inside. I remember asking why he didn’t bring Linda with him, “Don’t call her that name!” he shouted in response. I was so confused at this point. Dad started the car and drove me to my only friend’s house; I didn’t see him very often though. I was a lone wolf growing up and I still was at this point, I didn’t really create any friendships. I remember sitting in the car as he ran up the steps to ring my friend’s doorbell, his mother opened in her night dress and looked confused. I assumed my dad made up some emergency story to cover what was going on in order to get me a place to stay overnight. I didn’t even know what was going on to be fair.

Whatever he told them worked, I got to spend the night at my friend’s place. Tim’s place, to be exact. It was pretty awkward I remember, I only saw Tim a couple of times a week and that was when we shared classes in Spanish. We got to be desk-mates because the teacher made up whom to sit next to each semester, so we weren’t very close. 

It was a Friday so there was no school the morning after; I guessed that made it easier for my dad, leaving him the freedom to pick me up whenever he wanted to. He did, but not before giving me enough time to fully experience the awkward breakfast conversations with Tim’s parents, both trying to justify me as Tim’s best friend. I don’t know. Tim didn’t have many friends I guess.

On the way home I asked my dad what was going on the night before and he basically stopped the car and stared at me, as if I was mocking him. I remember how desperate he looked, as if he had no fire left in his heart. He uttered the words: “Do you think I wanted any of this?” as he grabbed his hair in regret. “All I wanted was a normal family with no circumstances, and I’m not blaming you when I’m saying this because frankly you are the only sane member left in this livelihood of ours.” Is what came out of his mouth next. I tried to comfort him, telling him that he had done a good job raising me and what not; I really didn’t have a lot of cards in my deck at this point. I mean my dad was basically losing it.

When we got home he told me that he was sorry, and that I should go up to my room. I did go up to my room but I got to tell you; I was starting to get very anxious about my dad. I really wanted to know what the hell was going on. I spent that night recording some guitar sessions for a song and reading books while listening to some ambient records I had found online, I couldn’t sleep so pulling an all-nighter was my only real option. I was reading “A Brief History of Time” for a science project in school, I was somewhere in the middle section of the book and started to get dry eyes. I figured I’d go downstairs into the kitchen to get myself something to drink when I got shocked upon opening the door to the hallway. I saw my mother standing just outside, looking right at me for a fraction of a second. Had all this hassle from the last couple of days driven me insane? It freaked me out so much that I ended up never getting a drink. 

The image of my mother outside my door haunted me that entire night, I kept thinking about it as I couldn’t sleep. She looked deranged, scared and raw. The shortage of light sources in the hallway made her look like she was from a black and white 50’s movie. I kept begging for the sun to rise up, I even did that thing when you close your eyes and try not to open them because you never know what you’ll see. I might have been fourteen, but I can openly admit that I was dead scared.

It finally came to be morning and I ran downstairs, still not fully opening my eyes while passing the hallway. I remember greeting my dad who was sitting in the kitchen drinking orange juice. I was just about to pour myself a glass when he said: “I think I need help.” While holding the glass of juice as if he wasn’t sure he was going to drink the rest of it. I asked him what he meant and he said that he wasn’t sure, that he had felt very uncomfortable and unstable lately. He also mentioned that he was thinking of joining some people from his work in playing golf, he thought that could give him some relief. I told him that sounded like a pretty good idea, jokingly adding that it’s better than hanging around the house doing nothing. He looked offended when I said that, something I didn’t really understand since he obviously worked all night, so that would justify him sleeping through the days.

I understand that some of you reading this are wondering how the hell I could have been fourteen and still not know how my mother died. Well, it’s hard to explain how uncomfortable of a character my dad was at times, and it felt a bit like I was offending him whenever I had to ask because part of me did actually believe she died of liver-failure. I mean it was possible. Imagine if it was true, and I kept asking my dad as if he lied to me. That’s the type of thoughts I had in my head about the whole thing.

Having that explanation out of the way, I did summon the courage to confront my dad one last time. It was a couple of days after the conversation about my dad picking up golf; I just walked into his room unexpected. A part of me had wanted to do this for a long time because I really never knew what he did in his room; it looked similar to an office which is nothing he’d ever need since he was a labor worker in a bottle factory. He was actually sitting at his desk. Not only that, but the desk was flooded with paper-work of some sort, maybe he had picked up an accounting job for the factory during the day, something he could manage from home. I didn’t ask; I had a big enough question for him as it were.

I dragged out a small chair he had behind the door and figured I’d sit on it. It was somewhat squeaky and not very comfortable, better than standing up anyway. Then I leaned forward and I was just about to ask when he interrupted my train of thought by saying: “You want to know about your sister, and what happened the other night. Don’t you?” This is where I started to play along because he was already looking emotionally hurt, bringing up mom here would have been a car-crash. I told him that I was indeed there to ask about my sister. He took a good pause before he bluntly exclaimed it to me: “Your sister is not right in the head; she’s in a mental hospital.” I couldn’t believe he hadn’t figured out that I would have known this by then. Not wanting to make a scene I just pretended like I didn’t know. He explained the context, telling me that she couldn’t take our mother’s death. A tear started climbing down his cheeks, and then he asked me if there was anything else I wanted to talk about. There was no way I could bring up something as sensitive as my mother at this point so I told him that everything was fine, and then I left the room.

I realized on my way up to my room that my dad was fragile and very close to losing his mind in this problematic family business. I had no idea how I’d ever get the truth about my mother out of him. When I finally had landed on my bed in my room again, the image of my mom started crawling back to me. The grey scaled portrait of her in the hallway, was my mind playing tricks on me? I also had a slight feeling that I remembered it from somewhere. I mean it was my mom but that exact stare and look she had, not only did it frighten me but I swore I had seen it before. 

Night landed again, I hadn’t spoken to my father again that day. I was facing the same obstacle that I had the other night, I was too afraid to go downstairs because I thought I’d see my mother again. We all know you can imagine things in the dark, kids do it all the time. It’s as if your mind fills in the gaps, but that incident the other night was different. I got more scared the more I thought of it and figured that I’d open the door to the darn hallway, and turn on the lights in order to feel slightly safer. I’m not going to lie, I did open that door very slowly but as it turned out; there was no sign of my mother. I turned on the lights and went back into my room.

Still not wanting to go to bed, not only because it was spring break at this point but also because I was a bit scared I figured I’d listen through some of my older songs. I had loads of them; most of which weren’t very good however. I was still learning how to create music and I never really thought of myself as particularly good, especially not at writing my own songs. I guess I was decent at playing other people’s songs. I basically went through my songs in chronological order, it was interesting because was able to hear how much I had improved over the years. 
It took me a good three hours to get past most of my songs, and I was reaching the more recent creations of mine. I heard something in one of the songs that I never had paid any attention to before; it was a slight breeze of white noise in the middle of one of my guitar riffs. Knowing that this wasn’t an overworked track yet, it was made just days ago and I hadn’t gotten around to mastering it yet, I figured I wasn’t going to give it more of a thought. That was until the neurons fired, that track was made the day I couldn’t sleep, the day I saw my mother in the hallway. Being a bit gullible I figured that I’d give it a go using my acoustic headphones. I tried everything. I played the song backwards; I cut out bass, middle frequencies, high frequencies and even listened to individual recordings of the instruments and samples. I couldn’t hear anything suspicious, just that white noise. 

I was a bit disappointed, at the same time relieved. Although that white noise shouldn’t have been there, nothing in my room could have made a noise like that. I didn’t want to over-think the situation, so I ended up hitting the bed. Later that night, as I still had problems sleeping I was laying in bed listening to the same ambient soundtracks that I was using nights before, slowly dozing off to sleep. I hadn’t been asleep for much more than ten minutes when I started to ascend into that state of sleep when you’re in a dream at the same time as real life is somewhat happening to you. I could hear a thumping sound coming from somewhere. Before I knew it I got woken up by a loud bass noise, it sounded like some kind of a technical disorder. I continued lying in bed, trying to figure out if I just dreamt about the noise or if it actually occurred, this is when I heard a much dampened sound coming from the other side of my room. It sounded a lot like someone was trying to get some kind of sound device to work. It got quieter and quieter and when I thought it was about to disappear I could hear a voice; very distorted and unstable speaking in what I believe was Russian. 

It took me a couple of minutes but I finally realized what I thought the sound was coming from, I had left my old amplifier on from when I was playing guitar. I bounced out of bed in order to turn on the lights. I was overlooking the entire room as I hit the switch, for the blink of an eye, just next to the amplifier I saw my mom again; just as the light went on. The same stare, same face, still that black and white filtered look from before. I got so shocked I fell down on the floor, the noise coming from the amplifier stopped in the same instant. I wasn’t sure what to make of this, and I definitely didn’t want to tell my father about what I had seen, knowing he has already thrown one of his kin to a mental hospital. 

I had a lot of sleep to catch up on but unfortunately this wouldn’t let me sleep, I just couldn’t sleep at all. I never believed in ghosts or anything growing up, these two small incidents with my mom being my only experience in what could be categorized into the matter. I thought and assumed I was becoming what my sister had become. Whatever this all meant, and needless to say; I didn’t get any sleep that night either.

I met my father in the kitchen the next day, he was looking a lot better than the last time I had seen him. He kept going on and on about how much he was looking forward to playing golf with his work-crew later that afternoon. I was happy for him; he deserved some time out of the stress. After the conversation about an afternoon of longing for a spot in the shade and waiting for your turn on a grass field he added: “Have you been thinking of your mother lately?” As if he could read my mind. I told him that I was always missing my mother, and that I had indeed thought of her a lot lately. He stated that he thought I had. I had no clue why.  Short after that he left for playing golf.

I kept thinking of why my amplifier was acting up that night, I started recalling a clear memory of turning it off after I was done playing. In fact, I knew I did since the amplifier was connected to an electricity hub that I used to turn off a small lamp I had next to my bed, how could it have been on? I had no idea. 

Since my dad was out of the building I figured I could use this afternoon without his presence to get some answers. I stepped into his room to investigate what he had been doing sitting at that desk of his all those hours. I grabbed a bunch of paperwork and sat myself on the double bed next to his desk, it got me a slight reminder on how he hadn’t gotten rid of the bed he shared with my mother yet. The first paper I started examining looked like a letter of some sort, as if it was a letter inside a legal template of some company. I don’t know how I’d describe it better than that. After further examination I found out it was a letter from my sister sent to our address, I remember wondering why dad wouldn’t show me something like this: 

“Daddy, why didn’t you visit me last weekend. I thought you were coming back, I was waiting for you. I’m sorry if I made a scene, I thought something had happened to you! I ran to you because I wanted answers, no one has answers here. I’ve been getting visits lately, why can’t you come to me at the same time?”

I fixed some grammar and a whole lot of spelling errors for the sake of explaining this to you, my sister had the linguistic abilities of a five year-old in this state. On after-thought I guessed my dad didn’t tell me about letters from my sister since they would inevitably prove that she wasn’t in a special school for people who were after tougher challenges. Although thinking about it, that doesn’t sound ridiculously different than a mental hospital.

The rest of the papers seemed to be a real mixture of work-related things and records of local police-investigations. Why would my father be looking into cases of murder, pedophilia, rape and almost anything you can think of? It wasn’t really my business what he did with his spare time but this was just outright messed up. I knew he had a friend in the police force, that was either the reason he had these or just the tool he used to get them. I didn’t even want to know at the time, I had enough stuff on my mind already and I hadn’t slept in far too long.
I apologize to whoever reading this if it seems that I’m dragging it out with details a bit too much here and there, I’m only taking precautions to make sure that I’m telling it right. If I’m finally going to tell my story I want it to sound right. 

My father never came home after golfing so I assumed he went directly to work, which made complete sense. It was starting to get late into the evening and I had absolutely nothing better to do than to once again sit in my room, I was trying to figure out ideas for new songs on my guitar. This time I wasn’t using the amplifier since I was legitimately scared of the noises occurring again. My amplifier has been known to pick up foreign radio broadcasts before, something that explains the distorted Russian speech last time, I wasn’t worrying about that. I was thinking about my mother showing herself again. Not that I was sure that it had anything to do with the amplifier itself.

Not too long into that night I started feeling sick of being in-doors for so long, and I felt like I could use some kind of fresh air as a vacation from all this unexplained mystery I had been experiencing. I remember being on the sane side of the fence, thinking critically and trying to find solutions, not marking everything as if it was a conspiracy from hell. I figured I’d take my bike down to a local gas station, not more than ten minutes from my house; I wanted some chips, candy and maybe a couple cans of soda. 

I scrambled together some change I found in my room and took off; I got there faster than I thought I would. It wasn’t cold outside either; it was a pretty smooth night. After grabbing some generic brand of chips, Skittles and a couple cans of coke I paid for it and left. I didn’t spend much time in the store, but apparently enough time to get my bike stolen. With no bike, feeling like a stupid idiot for not locking it I had to walk home. 

Something out of the ordinary happened after this, and I wasn’t even sure if I was seeing things at first. I was walking on this huge open road; I guess you could say it was somewhat of a country road. It was tied together with the forest behind our house. It was the type of road that didn’t have any traffic other than truck drivers, passing once every couple of hours at night. I didn’t want to believe my eyes at this point but I saw my sister standing alone wearing what you’d imagine someone coming from a mental hospital would wear. I assumed she was looking for me; she was definitely staring at me. 

I continued walking, not necessarily fearing my sister. It somehow still felt as if I had a bond with her, that she would never have done anything to hurt me. As I approached her she didn’t give me any response what so ever, she was just staring at me in a light-blue scrub-coat, looking lifeless. I had reached talking-distance; I couldn’t believe this was happening. It felt surreal, like one of those scenarios you can’t be prepared for in real life. She had started to shake a bit, I couldn’t tell if she was freezing or if she was nervous. I asked her if she was looking for me out there, and if she had escaped the hospital. She didn’t respond. I got the notion that she was slightly scared of me, as if I was a threat to her. 

After a short gap of silence I noticed that she was holding something behind her back. I got a bit worried that she had some kind of a weapon, or a blunt object to swing at me so I stepped back when I spotted it. She started to slowly bring it forth, it was a plastic bag. From the way she was holding it I could tell it wasn’t heavy, or dangerous for that matter. I withdrew the step back I took earlier and tried to peer down into the bag, then she started to stretch it out to me: “I took this from your house the other day, I’m sorry. I think this belongs to you. Jonathan.” 

I do realize that I never told you my name, it is indeed Jonathan. I was slightly astonished that she had remembered my name even; she seemed to be so out of it. I remember grabbing the plastic bag, she wouldn’t let go of it too lightly either, it was as if she still wanted it. After I had gotten whatever was in the bag we shared another brief moment of silence, she wouldn’t stop staring into my eyes during these. Then she told me to never mention any of this to our dad. Shortly after she started walking towards the forest; as if she knew where she was heading. 

I saw the headlights of a car coming straight at me and my sister, whoever was in this car was driving way ahead of the speed limit. I noticed when it started to get closer to us that it was my dad’s car, acting on impulse I threw myself into a nearby ditch, as I got to witness my dad chasing after my sister. I didn’t even know if I wanted him to catch her or not, she was purposely running away from him. He dragged her into his car and they both drove away, heading the direction he was originally going. This was the second time she had successfully escaped this mental hospital, and how the hell did my sister make it so far both times? Something wasn’t right, I knew from when I was younger that the hospital wasn’t anywhere close to where we lived since my dad sometimes was gone for ten hours upon visiting her. Of course at the time it was supposedly a special school, but that doesn’t change the logic of it. He never brought me with him whenever he visited my sister, since he kept me in the dark about the whole hospital thing.

I ran the rest of the way home, trying not to drop anything; I still had all the items I bought at the gas station. I wanted to make sure that I could get home before my dad did; I had no clue whenever he would get back, and not wanting him to find out whatever was in the bag my sister gave me. I couldn’t spot my dad’s car in the driveway so I felt relieved as I stepped into the house. I didn’t bother putting my drinks in the fridge or anything, I made my way back to my room as fast as I could. I don’t really know why but I locked the door after me, as if there was something to fear. I sat myself on the bed with all the lights in the entire room switched on. I made sure to put all the bags with snacks in them aside; as I was getting ready to dig into whatever my sister ran into the night to give me. 

I never really thought of something until now, and that is how my sister could have found me. It must have been a coincidence, or she had been following me for a while; knowing she couldn’t approach me in the store. I don’t know.

I looked into the bag, it seemed to be random belongings from the drawers in our living room, and maybe some stuff from one of the cupboards we had in the kitchen. After sorting out stuff that had no relevance what so ever, for example there was a roll of tape in there. I planned to spend more time on the more interesting items. The first thing I picked up was a small collection of family photos, most being after mom died. The next thing I could grab was a couple of rocks; they weren’t even dry, I guessed she must have gotten those just before she passed me the bag. There was only one thing left in the bag, an usb-stick. 

I took the stick out and threw away the bag. Then I started looking at the photos as I was trying to reason why she would have taken any of these from our house. The only thing that somewhat made sense is that a couple of them were from when she wasn’t sent to the hospital yet, but it was pretty much pending already. In fact, most of these photos took place a couple of weeks after our mother passed away. On one of them it’s my sister showing off her prom dress she was planning on wearing, she actually wasn’t acting too badly the first couple of weeks. I guess she didn’t process our mother’s death until later or something. Another photo is of dad’s old car, he had to sell it in order to compensate for our family’s financial depression from when we lost the main income our family had, my mother’s candle business. He loved that damn car with his entire heart; we even used to joke about how mom was jealous of the car. 

There were more photos but I stopped going through them when I realized a couple of them had a handwritten marking of the letter “x” behind them. It noticed this when I was flipping them as I was trying to get them all to be facing me. I sorted the photos with no marking away and started to focus more on the ones with the marking. I figured my sister must have had done this, for what reason I was about to find out. I kept staring at the first picture; it was the one I told you about earlier, the one of my father’s old car. It was a Pontiac from the early 80’s and it must have cost him a fortune. I never had any particular memories of the car; I remember it spending most of its time in our garage.

I kept looking at the photograph and the more I stared at it the more I started to wonder why my dad hadn’t use the car more, he obviously loved it. The photo was taken for an ad in the newspaper, for selling it of course. I was just about to put the sad photo away when I caught a glimpse of my mother sitting in the backseat. It wasn’t very clear and she seemed somewhat transparent. She had the same drained-out appearance and blank stare that she had from when I saw her in the hallway outside my room, and this was taken after her death. I couldn’t believe what I was looking at. I remember dropping the photo out of shock; so many thoughts started circling inside of my head.

dinofinger,0,,1,1rie11,,1,"    17^th May 2007.
I followed my dad went to Grandma's house. My cousin who lives with grandma, had a suspicion that something had happen to Aunt L &gt; *Her initial would be appropriate here* &lt; Aunt L was never in her sound mind but she prefer to live alone which is the best option avoiding the troubles she would cause to others. Grandma has a problem of [nagging](https://www.google.com/search?q=nagging&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a) disease which makes more Aunt L better suit live far from her lectures. 

Back again to my cousin, who received a call from Aunt L's neighbour. Her respond was *there was a sudden silent for the past four days*. Aunt L was never a social person who goes anywhere she wants and always out. She prefered to live in her tiny apartment secluded only her herself and herself she enjoys being with. But her neighbour help us to watch for her just in case for anything. So we respond to go and visit her house. My father, my cousin and I, the three of us went together with nothing held us back. 

As we arrive by the door, we knock and knock. From the window we can see noise screen from her small tv at the corner. But there was no sign of her. Somehow her grill lock and the door were changed, the key my cousin brought didn't fit at all. Maybe she doesn't want us to barge in anytime we want. My dad took the liberty to call the locksmith while giving positive thoughts to my cousin that everything was fine. 

30 minutes pass. The locksmith do his magic and opened the door. Such stench came out in full loaded right to our faces. Right in front of the door we can see Aunt L laid still in the toilet facing the floor. A 15 year old me shocked and I just watched her body in strip condition only a towel covered her other half and her faeces was right below her and all over behind her. Yet she is still alive, blinking and gasping.

My dad pull me back allowing my cousin to go in. I can still feel my father clenches my arms so tightly when he saw his sister. He said ""*[I better call the ambulance](http://www.wikihow.com/Call-an-Ambulance)*"", so he did and left. My cousin call me out to help pick her up. But she was too heavy, we can't even push her to the side. So my cousin rinse her with water to clean her off. I was told to took a towel and wipe her face. I could say her face was in a total blankness. 

25 minutes later the ambulance arrive. They took her with a stretcher. Both of us went down to send her off. I can remember certain vision of some neighbours pry on their window looking out what was happening. My dad went together with Aunt L, so left me and my cousin. Soon my mom and sister arrive bringing cleaning equipment. We spent whole 3 hours cleaning her house. Based on what I heard my cousin said ""*The man who always deliver her food got no respond from her for three days. That's when he ask the neighbour if she had gone somewhere. I bet if we were too late, she might have gone by any minute unconscious on the floor*""


    18^th May, 2013
We had her funeral in the day after the day we thought she would died 6 years ago. Funny the coincidence of the date just *one day after* we laughed. My cousin gave a speech said she was a fighter. Indeed she was. I think her life is better after that 17^th May living in the retirement home. She was more happier than before she was a shut-in.

echoes007,4,,2,1rhee9,,2,"I’ve always been a non-religious person. I was brought up by parents who told me to question everything. To not believe the crap that is forced down our throats daily. But I’ve always felt a whole in my life when it came to that stuff. I went as far as trying LSD and DMT to achieve this “religious experience” we all want, but I never got it. So, after a while, I just gave up and moved on and accepted there is no God, or spiritual experience, or anything that’s real, that will make me see life in a whole new perspective. Naturally, this got me down and depressed a bit. It was then when I started seeing 11:11 everywhere. It started one night when I was doing some heavy drinking and decided to do some coke lines. I remember vividly, my heart stopped, and I remember a sound, like a blender going off in my head. When I forced myself to snap out of what had happened to me, I remember the first thing I looked at was the clock on the cable box. It read 11:11. This stuck with me for a long long time. I felt like some force or spirit was forcing me to look at the clock when it was 11:11 in the morning and 11:11 at night. As if reminding me that it saved my life. This was going on for a while, when I went as far as Googling what it was. Unfortunately, the 11:11 thing was associated to some spiritual stuff, things I thought were bullshit to begin with. But still, 11:11 was always there. Slowly I stopped thinking about it, and my 11:11 experiences were less and less. It wasn’t until last week when I was driving home (I was butt sober) from an event when it started raining. My tires and brakes were messed up and I didn’t get a chance to change them, and besides, it hardly ever rains in this town, so this came as a surprise to me. As I was driving up a hill, I lost control of my car completely on the wet road, and was literally fighting my steering wheel and slamming on my brakes to stop the car, but I couldn’t. This went on for about five seconds until I finally stopped the car in the middle of the road. Again, when I snapped out of my panic mode, the first thing I looked at was the time, and it said 11:11. I’m not one who believes in coincidences, but this has me thinking I have some angel or spiritual entity looking after me. Even though I don’t believe this stuff, there is NO way that could happen. Has anyone else experienced 11:11, or has randomly been “forced” to look at a clock when it’s 11:11? Or is it my brain playing tricks on me because of the LSD/DMT I took? ",11:11,4,nosleep

Who killed his wife and children while he asphyxiates

His doctors with the bloody spinal cord

Bursting through the heavy front doors

He killed everyone on the first floor

Had her parents give him a call

To invite him to dinner, on a cold winter's night

When, in reality, it was egotistical vanity

Looking to seek justice, to seek what's fair

InsanityInABottle,0,,1,1rgw03,,2,"“Extra, Extra! The Piggy killer is at it again!” Yelled the paperboy, holding a darkened paper above his head, screaming the same phrase over again, as if it was no big deal. I walked towards him and asked him “How much?”
“Only ten cents sir.”
“Ha. Must be a pretty good story then.” I said, as I fumbled for a large dime. I handed it into the boy’s hand, it’s gleam bouncing the light of the sun, veiled through the mist of rain into my eyes. I blinked quickly and grabbed the paper, quickly turning from the boy, hearing “How about a tip sir?”
“How about you wipe your ass with the metal I’ve already given you.” I said back to the boy, who furrowed his brow and continued screaming for new customers. As I walked along Hero’s Avenue, I kept the paper open, reading it over again. In large font, shouted “Piggy killer’s new victim!” with a picture of a woman, apparently known by the name of “Jessica Turrow.” She wore a large smile on her face, as she raised a glass of champagne above her head for a toast, I presumed.
	The article read “The psychopath, depicted as a man with a pig’s head on worn over his own face, has struck again. Witnesses described him as large, while wearing a reddened trench coat, then finally, a bib, which read the term KISS THE COOK, slathered neatly against his chest in gore. He had organs and even a human spinal cord attached to his coat and as usual, was found was mist was floating through the air and at dawn. We had identified the victim, through a ring found on the hand of the woman, who had been chopped to pieces and nailed against the side of the church. If you are to spot anyone fitting under the description, contact the police immediately, or you may be his next victim.”
	I laughed as I watched terror shrouding the faces of everybody who grasped a paper in their hands, all walking along the street as automobiles drove recklessly between one another, threading the needle on the two way street, not large enough for two cars to fit on.
	I walked towards the police station, which was cleverly located across the street from a coffee shop, a brothel and a printing office. A police car drove by; it’s loud horn sounding, flashing red and white, reflecting the light from the rain directly into my eyes. I walked into the station, the smell of fresh cigars flooding into my nose. A man screamed from across a large waiting room, looking down at the paper, then looked up and said “Oh. It’s the wonderful Flynn. Of course my dear, come, come.” I walked past him, glaring at his smug face, and then opening the door into my office.
	A man sitting on a chair for those waiting to enter my office abruptly greeted me. He smiled and said, “Well hello sir, I am Dean Osterrietch and believe I have a lead on the notorious killer”
“The pig one?”
“Y- wait, there are more?”
“I believe there are, just they might not like attention as much as our friend here.”
“Well… thanks for informing me of that rather morbid concept, but I have gotten hundreds of pictures of the killer, coming out of his lair.”
	The man pulled out a large portfolio of pictures and dumped them onto my desk, arranging them appropriately. “So, if you look at these pictures, it was for when he first got into the business, holding small weapons, all identifiable, all related to the cutting of meat. Then as you look to the left, these are the later pictures, which are of him coming out, holding bodies on his shoulders, sitting in the back of his eatery and chopping them up, putting them into boxes and looking pleased with himself, all the while in his pig mask. But, he seems to be getting careless. He cam outside, barely slipping on his mask in time for my camera to flash a photo, his face seemed veiled in… something. Something sticky, something gruesome. But if you look closer, you can quite easily see the silhouette of his face. Large, hooked nose, eyes, clouded in blue, teeth, sharpened to perfection and a dripping mouth.”
“Ha. So you’re basically implying that you’ve seen a notorious killer walk in and out of a location multiple times and not even dared to act on it? I beginning to suspect you’re the killer!”
“But that would be silly. Why would a crazy give himself away?”
“I don’t know, why don’t you tell me?”
“I believe this conversation is getting a bit heated. I saw the ad in the paper that I should contact the police and thought I’d tell you where I’ve seen such events. Have you ever seen the abandoned butchery on 1800 Bellcove Street? Well there’s your place. Sir!” said the man as he gathered his pictures and threw them into his bag, which smelled of defecation and nickels. I watched as he slammed the door, then sighed and sat down on my desk, rapidly pressing the keys of my typewriter, updating the information I’ve received from the man.
“Mysterious man visits police station, says he has a lead on the piggy killer. As you all know, the notorious killer has crossed the line now. Enough to even be called a serial killer! What a sick bastard he is.” I continued being as pessimistic as possible, updating the paper, then grabbing my camera as I finished the article. Typing in my name, finishing with my name, saying “Written by: Flynn Covetail.”
	Darkness was beginning to shroud the air, perfect night for the killer to strike in his typical environment. Light rain was spattering against my window, racing down to the bottom of the screening, only to fall against an umbrella below. As I left my office, throwing on my coat, I screamed to the man in the front desk, “Going out to…oh, let’s see...1800 Bellcove Street? If I don’t come back, Phone someone.” I said with a laugh, while walking outside.
	Instantly my boots splashed against the small walkway paved on “Western Lagoon highway” as the frivolously worthless people would say. I walked down towards the street, which was naught but four blocks from here. I passed by Dontell’s Donuts, Redgar’s Rotisserie and Salam’s Spices, all involved in the fattening of desperate cops, as only fattening diners were located near the station, so I developed a theory that every restaurant owner is against us.
	I reached the butcher’s place, which had been looted to hell by the anarchists, who were just a group of thugs that didn’t do shit to overthrow the government. The door had been pried off it’s hinges, yet now it was replaced by a veil of chains, hanging off of rusted hooks attached to the doorframe. Within the butchery, the first thing I noticed was a bed, a homeless man sleeping on it.
	I simply ignored the bum and walked around, searching for anything considered suspicious. I walked through the door, smelling the bum’s shit in the corner and closing my nostrils as well as I could. I looked through the shop, behind the counter I found several rusted knifes, which were corroded to the counter, which was a wooden rotten thing, with three cutting boards lining it, all of which nobody needed. The front of the shop seemed completely normal, but I listened to the bum waking, instantly screaming, “Who’s there! I will kill you if you’re trespassing on my property!” I laughed and screamed to him “I suggest you run out of here, or I may just have to turn you in as a key suspect for the crimes.” I heard the scuffing of his shoes against the floor, running towards me.
	I quickly turned, backing up against the wall, my sidearm pointed at the bum and screamed “GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!” I shot to the side of the man, who quickly bolted for the door, a rat following closely behind him. I sat for a minute, catching my breath, while my vocal chords seemed to scratch against one another in a uncomfortable clunky fashion. As I stood, I felt the hard callused flesh of an arm pressing against the front of my throat and the sudden feeling of something hard hitting the back of my head.








	Ha. Damn fool didn’t even know what he had coming. Shouldn’t have fucked with my grandpa… shouldn’t have yelled. My ears hurt. Are they ringing? Why the FUCK am I here? I thought a conversation to myself as I raised the man into the air, the familiar heaviness of my mask pressing against my face, the pig’s blood leaking down my neck, warming me, keeping the cold away. I looked at my setup, which was simply the back room of a butcher’s shop, a heavy steel door muffling sounds on both sides of the fifty wood wide hallway of a room.
	Blood dripped into wooden bowls I’d gotten from the shop, the bodies of fresh meat hanging from the ceiling. Pigs, cows, chickens, even a few deer, but the most stubborn of prey, the pigs. The sticky cunts hung from the ceiling, their wrists cut, their feet missing, their hands stuffed into their fucking loud mouths. The damned pigs that walked the streets, reading their stories about who? About me! The beautiful man, who is dealing righteousness to the crazies, to the rich. Though they think that they’re so safe in their leather homes, they should be the ones making chairs; their dried hides need to be a part of furniture!
	Oh, what an inventor I will be! But the best part is, nobody looks twice at the photographer. Nobody looks at who’s behind the camera; they only care about the picture! And I am finally the one in the picture! Flynn, the little anus that believed he owned the whole world, because the police were backing him up. NO, NO, NO! YOU ARE MY FUCKING BITCH!
	I whistled a tune of sorrow and greed that humans so openly express. I raise him in the air, catch a hook to his leg and strip him down to his bare neck. This self-conceited asshole needs one thing. A hook curving through the cheek, wrenched from his cheek. He thought I was the killer? NO! THAT IS NOT THE FUCKING WORD!
	Oh! My friend is waking up! Finally a new toy to play with. Oh, what a joy he will be! Oh no! What will I say to him? I guess I’ll just wing it. I guess I’ll just talk to him.  Where will I display this beauty? Ooh! The police station! Mmm, how delectable would that be? To show the pigs that even their weapons can’t defend them from me. THEY ARE GOING TO LOVE ME! I am a hero. I love being a hero and don’t try to talk me out of my heroism! I AM AMAING!








	My eyes slowly opened, to find a man in a pig mask, the rotting dreaded animal seemed to have a grin on it’s face. I was hanging upside down and fuck my leg hurts! Why does my leg hurt? Where the hell am I? “Oh… you’ve awakened!” spouted the pig; it’s squeaky voice ringing through my ears. I screamed, “Help me! Help! HE’S GOING TO KILL ME!” 
“Now that’s not how you treat a guest, is it?”
“Fuck you.”
“Oh… language, language my dear friend. If you even try saying something like that, I will cut off your cock and feed it to my friend Mr.Squeaks over here!”
	I looked to where he was pointing, which was a large column in the room, a decomposing rat nailed to the pole. “Somebody is going to catch you. They know where I am!”
“Oh, I believe they do, if only your little desk friend was there to hear what you had to say!” said the phsyco with a smile. He pointed at the ceiling, which had two hooks on it, chains hanging from them and a headless man, blood dripping in a steady stream of thickness, into a wooden bowl. “Why are you doing this to these people?”
“Okay, okay, story time. Oh yay, stories! FUCK OFF GREG, THIS IS MY TIME TO SHINE!”
	I looked at the pig with doubt, pain shooting up my leg, throbbing slowly into my brain. “SO, let me tell you why I love my job, okay? Okay. So, when I was twelve, I thought, I’m going to take pictures of weddings! I’m going to take pictures of people in love, because everyone else’s happiness, is mine.” He said this, while pinning his right hand against his heart, which contained an extra few layers of flesh, sewed against his own, along with a tattoo, stolen from his victim.
	“Okay, so anyways! What do ya know! I’m doing that now! I am a photographer! I love people being happy. SO, I one day, was at this one glorious wedding, full of lovely people. I had started talking to a woman and a little, oh what is it called? Fetish of mine was developed. As we were in bed, I took out my camera and took shots of my experience and little did I know, I have a few other… kinks. I wrung my hands around her delicate throat, stuck my finger down her throat and felt the vomit shoot from her mouth! I felt the rush as eventually, she started to fuckin’ bleed! WHAT A WHORE! She began to cough up blood, she began to wheeze and it is as these coughs echoed from her throat, landing inside of my mouth as our lips touched, did I realize how wonderful blood tastes. Rich, creamy, delicious, blood, coursing from the fountains of our decapitated stumps. I invented ways of sucking people dry, licking them dry! Well, at first I was only an amateur, but, as I got better! Oh BOY did I start to love my job! Every wedding became a slaughter, every wedding gave me a new friend, because after all, nobody cares about who’s behind the camera! NOBODY GIVES TWO FUCKING SHITS!
	So, pretty boy, I believe it’s time; you… started looking into my eyes, whenever I snap a photo of your beautiful body.” He said this as his hand slid down from my chest, slowly down to my cock, grinning, spittle flying out of his mouth as he coughed, slid a blade against it as chopped it off. I screamed out loud, blood spurting from me and all the smile he smiled, then I fell asleep, never to wake again.

ReiKoroshiya,0,,0,1rgsca,,2,"Here I am and im going to write about some of the things that go on in my life. Sorry for bombarding you with some trivial things and please just hear me out.
how about I start at the beginning that seems easier. Well back in elementary, I was that kid the kid that really no one liked. I had a friend here and there but that's about it. I was basically a social outcast, 
I never really got my work done, I still don't. Note that I was a very, very angry child and no I was not spoiled if that's what your thinking, im the oldest of 3 kids who had been and are growing up in poverty, but my father is very good at managing money which means he is very cheap.
I had shared a room with my younger brother and for some reason I never grew out of the stage where you sleep with your blankets over your head. I had always liked horror even though none of it really scared me even in elementary in the 3rd grade I found an author by the
name of R.L.Stine and I had read tons of his books which remotely captured my interests.
A few of the simple things had scared me, and I most likely have experiences that I have blocked out of my mind, I don't remember much about my childhood at all.
I don't know why I can't but that's just how it is. I do remember bits and pieces though, not anything like birthdays, mind you. Here Ile give some examples, I remember
when I thought my stuffed animal had red eyes, I freaked out a little bit called my parents and my father calmed me down and took it away. Years later I went back and found it, and of course it wasn't scary anymore. Another example
would be when I saw a ""witch"" in my closet, but again my father came in and turned the light on to show me that there was nothing there, I had clearly saw something but it was gone as soon as the light turned back on.
Once he had left and turned the light back of the figure was back again. I remember when my body shot up in bed and I let out a blood curtling scream and my parents rushed into the room
and they had tried to comfort me and to calm me down I was bawling my eyes out while hugging my father he had asked me what had happened and I was just mumbling incoherently 
about it. I can't remember what it was that had freaked me out so badly. Something else that just pokes out at me was when I was lying in bed and I hear talking so I sit up strait in bed and I see my parents right there talking to each other I couldn't understand what they were saying because they were mumbling and I said hey and they say love you simultaneously and I said aww I love you too you guys, I reached out to hug them and they both just vanished and I almost fell out of bed(I got top bunk). Then their are the things that I have learned from my family throughout the years, not much really
they don't seem to want to talk much about when I was younger. I got that I was a horrible child when they brought me to church, and that I would bite and snarl when anyone got within an arms reach of me.
keep in mind I don't remember that about going to church, as a matter of fact I don't remember going to church at all. hmmm.... well skip forward to middle school where I had
actually made friends. I did got in so much trouble in middle school its not even funny. I could barely even go a week without at least one detention. Saturday school and suspensions I had gotten a ton too, now
drugs are prevalent where I live and when I say that drugs were prevalent I truly mean that, but honestly the thought of drugs never really appealed to me well I mean
certain ones that is, the only mind altering substance that I would actually want to do, smoke, drink, etc would be alcohol cause it seems fun and really any hallucinogenic drug and there
is no way I could get ahold of hallucinogenic drugs without paying a ton of money and with my broke ass I can't afford it and because of that im drug free. Not to much
happened in middle school, only a few things I started to get hellish demonic dreams (oh and speaking of dreams I have always been able to feel pain in my dreams so if
say I was to get ran through with a spear or had my flesh pealed off in a dream I would wake up and still feel it, I also talk in my sleep) which sucks ass, The vast 
majority of my dreams became violent and with me being an avid gamer there was usually a sword nearby in my dreams and usually I could and would fight back and be home
free. I enjoyed those violent dreams where I won, even though I would battle hellish creatures and people I wouldn't consider it a nightmare. I got my own room in the basement which was nice, and well my brother he was, how do you put it? 
Gassy so yeah hot air rises and all that. Electronic malfunctions had started occurring, like waking up to my radio playing static, my alarm clock started to malfunction, etc. I remember waking up minutes before my alarm clock 
went off I awoke with a shot of electricity to my left ear. Skip forward to highschool in the 9th grade I found out what creepypasta and scp were it was amazing to find real horror for a change.
I read the hell out of creepypasta's and found some really cool narrators for them, listening to those was very enjoyable I didn't read scps often and I found a very long series called the holders.
Near the end of the year I started to feel a presence in my room which was interesting because it didn't have a bad feeling to it, the only word that comes to mind to describe it would be light if that makes any sense.
Jump forward one more year, I had flunked my freshman year because I don't do my work. On those professional tests that they make you take S.A.T's or some shit I did 
insanely good on those like I should be an A- student overall. Now i reside in alternative ed. Im 15 right now. I declared to my parents that im agnostic instead of
Baptist a few months ago. Anyway that presence in my room i hardly feel it anymore and now there is something more sinister and not just in my room anymore.
That thing I actually saw it, I fucking saw it, it was short like about a foot and a half tall. I went to bed last night and you know how earlier I had said I sleep
with my blankets over my head. Well I was moving around under the covers and I glanced out underneath the covers and there it was just staring at me a few inches away 
from my face I had to resist not to punch it because half of me was saying its just my imagination and the other half says that if its real  then im going to freak the fuck out and well I never did hit it and its creepy as fuck that its been watching me. I tried to calm my breathing as to not alert it to the fact that I have seen it I
think it knows I saw it because I have been getting glances of it all day. It might have seen me and it might be watching me type this.
It is very short and I can never manage to see any features on its face it just looks dark like a shadow its really, really dark, everything distorts when I look at it like my depth perception gets thrown off and space distorts around it.

highchairchildren,3,,1,1rgqmu,,2,"I'm looking for any input. If anyone has had experiences like this, is there a way to stop it?

So this started about two years ago. In the beginning it was just a perpetual bad feeling, like something bad was going to happen all the time.  I was anxious, always alert and never at rest. I hardly slept, primarily keeping myself awake in order to feel safer. 

Then, I started seeing things.

When I say seeings things I don't mean like hallucinations, well not really. I'm not crazy. There were never any voices and there never have been. It was more like a blackout moment in which the worst possible scenario for my environment would play out seemingly right before my eyes. 

Mostly accidents.  It happened once while I was sledding.  The hill was a steep drop and then inclined back up about 20 ft. or so where it met a busy road. Usually people lost momentum and slid back down the hill and came to a rest in the valley but sometimes, people would make it all the way up and hit the metal road block that was put up along the hill. A watched as a kid went down the hill and then it happened. I continued to watch as he went all the way back up the hill and under the metal road block right into the speeding car that was passing by. There was blood everywhere. I snapped back to reality and looked around. Everything was fine. There was no blood, nobody was hurt, just kids sledding around having fun. 

I continued to have random ""visions"" for the entire year. They varied in severity. The worst one left me shaken for a few days afterwards.  I was home babysitting my younger sisters and boiling pot of spaghetti for dinner.  I moved to the sink to strain the pasta and then went back to turn off the electric stove.  My little sister approached me to ask a question and then I had my flash.  As I was seeing it, I grabbed her by her hair and pressed her face into the stove. In that moments I watched as her eyes rolled around in her head and she screamed, begging me to stop.  I snapped back and couldn't speak. I teared up and thought I was going to puke.  I ran to the bathroom, washed my face, sat down on the ground and cried. I had never felt such a mixture of fear and remorse in my life. I got up and reentered the kitchen, finished dinner and continued the night as if nothing happened.  She asked me what was wrong and I played it off as a bout of sickness.  I sat awake for hours that night and I still couldn't come up with a reason for why this kept happening to me.  I asked my mom to see a psychiatrist but unfortunately it was a luxury we simply couldn't afford. 

Then it stopped. As quickly as it came in it left and I had no more of an idea about what it was than I'd had before.  It stayed away for a while. I mean really a long time.  I was vision free for an entire year.

I was prompted to write this because I had another one the other.  The first in over a year but I am scared. I don't want it to start again.  The most recent one was more subtle.  I was shaving in the shower went as I brought the razor up my leg, somehow or another I cut myself and there was blood everywhere.  The tub was washed red with it and there was nothing I could do but stand and watch as it oozed out of my leg and swirled around in the water before going down the drain.  Then I flashed back and it wasn't there. I hadn't even cut myself.

I know this must sound crazy, like some Final Destination bullshit.  I swear to you I wouldn't have posted it if I didn't have hopes that someone could help.  Any input is welcomed.",Can anyone help?,3,nosleep

You might remember my journal entries from last month. Last month, I can't believe it's been that long. Days and weeks run now in an endless loop. Where I am now time doesn't matter. It's a nuisance, it's a hinderance. 

A lot has happened. I just wanted to let those who cared, who reached out to me, know that I am alive. Very much so. And I have met some friends. Real human beings. There is so much I want to tell you. So much I want to explain. But I can't. Not now. 

Just know that the monster under your bed is real. That shadow in the closet exists. And those voices, the voices you hear in the dead of the night are not your imagination. All your life you have been told horror stories. And now you seek them out, on this subreddit. To be entertained, to be thrilled. But these stories exist for a reason. Every story has a truth. A small bit of reality wrapped around trigger words and exaggeration. 

That truth is what lurks in the shadows of your house, just at the corner of your eye. The truth is what is waiting for you when you close your eyes to sleep, hoping for a peaceful night's rest. But nothing is peaceful in the dark. Where the light is eclipsed by the slithering, rotting presence that knows you oh so well. One day you'll know. You will wake up and know. All those stories. All those scary tales. All those fears.

Are real.

This is for ME, I don’t do it for them. But they can’t understand my need. He can’t either. I must make me. Make him understand. How did he get here? I wish I came back. I want him back. WHY WON’T I COME BACK WHY IS HE HERE ARE YOU SORRY ARE YOU SORRY ARE YOU SOR-*

Past this the note is unreadable, spewed with a fluid I can only assume is meant to go on the inside of people. Not that I’d really want to read much more anyways. I already know what happens. Well, not really “know”, but I can feel it. Who wrote it? I can only assume it was my dear Uncle Drewson, if he’s even my uncle. What is this? No clue. A note, obviously, but beyond that speculation reigns. Where did I find this? My new house, in a drawer. Nothing is inherently terrifying about that – Oh, except that it was under the clothing I had already packed there. I just missed it before, I keep telling myself. I half believe it. A few pills later and I’m not worrying about it anymore.

Before this, I didn’t even know I had an Uncle Drewson, let alone that I was to inherit his estate in the event of his untimely, but now enacted, demise. With a heavily estranged family, growing up in between various friends or close relatives passed around by uncaring parents looking to shirk responsibility, one loses track of aunts and uncles. It was in a familiar neighborhood, a spacious three bedroom, so I was in no way eager to turn it down. As a poor, regularly unemployed person I’d been accustomed to sleeping on generous friends floors in the all too often occurrence I couldn’t afford anywhere else. I thought, it’ll all be worth it one day, the day I make it in the world. I can pay all these people back tenfold. “The day I make it”, yeah right. A consistent – and more pressingly, free – living space was a welcome antonym to my recent fortunes. So I was moved in within a couple weeks. Absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened. Till that note seemed to start some kind of vicious domino effect on my life, I was content.

You know when you think back to something embarrassing, stupid, or otherwise shameful act you may have done in your younger, brasher days? Once you recall it, it starts eating away, regret seeping in to every corner of your thoughts, till you would give the world to go back and change it, or at least erase the memory. Imagine that, only you can’t remember what it was you’ve done. It’s simply gone from you. The more you try, the less you realize. The less you realize, the more you regret. The more you regret, the more you try. That’s what’s happening to me, ever since I moved here. But it even goes past that. It’s the sudden feeling you’re being watched from barely out of sight. And at the same time, a crushing loneliness in that feeling. I pop a few more pills. Of course, I’m not being watched. There’s no one else here. If you think you’re being rather clever, figuring this out, oh-no-someone’s-been-in-the-house-with-you-all-along, I was most certainly the only one here. Anyway, this was about the time I found the note. If it was this Drewson, what is he talking about? Who does he want back? What is his need? Do I even want to know the answer to any of these? Insatiable curiosity will ensure I do, personal preference notwithstanding. Putting it all to the back of my mind, I chop up steak for dinner. I like to think of myself as a fairly accomplished chef, particularly where matters of slicing and/or dicing are concerned. I once worked a sushi bar, as a side job to pay the bills, and was quite proud of my ability to launch various morsels into the air and sever them in two with one fell swipe, like you see in commercials. Until the day my knife slipped and nearly skewered a customer’s eyeball. Maybe I’m not quite as proficient as I thought… I grab the bottle of pills and take a few. I don’t really like thinking about that time in my life.

I’m digging through my drawer later, that same drawer, when I stumble upon another discovery. Instead of a clue, it only deepens my mystery. A USB stick is secured to the very back of the board. I carefully remove it, and spend a few minutes simply gawking at my find, my inner curiosity again sparring with my better senses. I think, this will perhaps answer some questions about the note, and hopefully clear up my imaginations conjuring brought on by its conclusion’s implications. As per your previous assumptions, I couldn’t be farther from the truth. I secure the stick in its dock. View files. Two folders: “Reminders” and “Media”. Reminders is empty, media contains one subfolder: “Vids”. I open the folder. Two more: “memories” and “triggers”. Memories is empty. I open triggers. I’m confronted with one video file: shotinthedark.wmv. It’s 0:40 long. I press play.

Before I continue, if you’ll permit me one aside to validate the severity of this. I’m a massive horror movie fan, and I like them brutal. The more blood and guts, the better. I like truly graphic, heart wrenching stuff, and I very rarely squirm at it. Three seconds into shotinthedark.wmv and I rushed over the trash can to puke what felt like my very soul out. The scene I’m immediately confronted with was a man on a chair wearing nothing but an undershirt and briefs. There is a single light source on the chair, but I can faintly make out a figure in the background. Then, without a word, the man’s brains are ejected out his face, accompanied with a thunderous bang. Bone and cartilage spew forth in the foreground. Nearly black red sludge runs down his white undershirt, accompanied with brain matter that had just been crackling with life, likely flooded by fear, but life. I don’t have too much time to process anymore; I’m preoccupied with regurgitating my expertly made steak into the wastebasket. I think, it must be fake, but I know it’s not. I’ve got to tell someone about this, I think, the police, someone. Yeah, I’ll talk to the cops. Then, over my subsiding retching, I hear a familiar voice utter “Are you sorry now?” in the tone of a disappointed parent talking to their disobedient toddler. Something in that voice is chilling. Something… I return my gaze to the computer screen, where the barely visible figure now stands in full view, smiling.

I recognize the smile too.

It’s me, smiling back at myself, gripping a smoking sawed off.

The computer screen goes black. My head spins. I lie down.

youngsterjose42,1,,5,1rge20,,1,"He woke up in the morning like every other day. Yet this day was different; Jordan was going back to school after being expelled last year. He was caught with drugs and his school wanted nothing to do with it. He moved, now resides in york, Pennsylvania and now goes to William Penn High. He moved to a house which was quite old and just had some renovations a while back. The rent was quite cheap so his mother said ""why not?"". I was one of Jordan's first friends, since moving to york he told me things about that house really strange things. He soon moved away a little after I moved away so I have no idea where he is now. If any of you happen to live in york I'm talking about the old burned down house on market street across the street from the kindergarten/daycare. This story takes place about 2 years before the house burned down. 

A month since school started and about two weeks since I started talking to Jordan he invited me over to his house. Jordan said ""cmon dude come and stay the night my moms gone and im pretty sure wont give a shit"". So I thought why not I haven't spent the night at a friends house in a while ""yea sure ill spend the night man"". We went around town skated for a while, went to McDonald's with a few other friends then it came around 10 or maybe 11 everyone was ready to go home and i was ready to just go to a place and chill, play video games, and maybe eat some more. We got to his place, sat down in the living room, and lit up a blunt. Playing grand auto 3, high off our asses, we ordered some pizza. We ate and everything was fine till I felt like heading over to the bathroom. As soon as I opened the door I notice under the sink there was like a small cabinet and the doors slammed shut. I was high so I didn't really questioned it much. I used the bathroom and then as I exit I suddenly hear a giggle coming from under the sink. A child's giggle, as if there was a kid under the sink playing hide'n'seek or something. Again I did not question it because I was high and didn't really wanna bother finding out what made the noise. Jordan passed out on the couch, I went to his room and tried to sleep on his bed. I remember waking up around four in the morning hearing footsteps and a child giggling I'm pretty sure it was a little boy. I couldn't really tell his age but he was young; I would guess around six or seven. He was running around the house and he stopped at the door I did not see him, I only ever got to see his outline. He said "" I'm really happy I got more friends to play with now"". Suddenly after that he vanished faster than I could blink. I didn't sleep for the rest of the night. I had goosebumps for a good 30 to 45 minutes. Eventually I  calmed myself down by eating pizza and watching TV.",Hide 'N' seek,6,nosleep
amandaandbrooke,0,,3,1rgdaq,,0,"One night in early 2012, me and some friends were over at my house having a sleep over. We were watching Toy Story 3 in my downstairs, and we have 2 pillars downstairs to support our house and the framing on a the one behind the couch is loose, so sometimes it snags on clothes and makes a loud noise when it hits the pillar. So, we were close to the end of the movie, and we heard the loose framing hit it like someone pulled it away from the pillar. We all automatically stopped and looked at each other for about a minute, then we got up and ran to my room. We had to go past the pillar to get to my room so it snagged on my blanket and made the snapping noise again, which made everyone go faster. The rest of the night, we all kept hearing footsteps walking around like they were looking for something. It hasn't happened again since that night.",Just a normal night,3,nosleep
Mindlesssavage,4,,8,1rhawv,,0,"I have a Where's Wally book. Well, had. Why? I'll tell you.
So I was just searching for Wally at night like I usually do, and I heard a noise.
It was sort of a scratching noise, scratching with a walking cane maybe.
I went to investigate. I went out of my room and...
Nothing.
Maybe it was just me. I went back to my bedroom door. I saw something written on really drippy red paint.
It said ""Find me if you can"". I thought it was just my little brother Mike painting on the walls again. ""Where was Mike anyway?"", I thought. Then I remembered he was outside playing with our pet dog Molly. ( Don't ask me why he was playing in the dark, because I have no idea).
I went inside my room. That's when I saw it. The book was lying on the ground open. I picked it up. This is what the title said:
""yllaW s'erehW"" Now THIS was weird. I also saw the same Wally picture except his eyes were gone and blood was dripping from them.
It was possessed, I thought. I ran outside to bury it, and I stepped on something. It sounded like it was glass because I heard it shatter.
I looked down.
A pair of broken, black rimmed glasses. I ignored it and ran even faster than before.
I ran to my dog Molly's kennel. I always feel safe when she's with me.
She was whining in the corner. That was typical, though. But wasn't she playing with Mike? I shouted out, ""Mike! Mike! Can you hear me?""
No replies.
I ran to the middle of the yard to bury the book.
I stepped in another thing. It was squishy, and slimy.
I looked down.
Blood. Blood and guts.
And Mike.
Lying on the ground.
Stomach open.
With a walking cane through his heart.
I wanted to cry, but then I saw a little Post-It note on the cane.
A poem.
This is what it said:
""I can run, and I can hide.
Tear you apart from the inside.
Waiting in the darkness, with my cane.
Used to be for children, now insane.
Red and white, in the grey fog.
Running around with my little pet dog.
With my girlfriend Wenda, with her camera,
And an old man with a white beard.
The prisoner who escaped from jail, murdering people with no fail.
That's my gang, with no doubt.
When you're in with me, there's no way out.""
This was way too bad to just BURY. We had to set it on FIRE. Or RIP IT APART. Just destroy it in whatever way I could.
So now in my backyard, a grave for Mike, some burnt and ripped pages, shattered glasses, and a walking cane.
And to this day, I never read another Where's Wally book again.
And every night, I still hear the sound of a scratching walking cane against my bedroom door.
THE END.
