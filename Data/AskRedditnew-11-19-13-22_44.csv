Niichie,0,0,1r18tg,1,So I think me and my girlfriend of four years just split up. It was mutual but I don't know how to feel about it. It was my fault I made bad decisions and acted selfishly most of the time which had lead to a very unhealthy relationship for both of us. I feel like I've just lost the most beautiful thing in the world but I want her to be happy. I've always been a selfish person and this is honestly the first not-selfish thing I've ever done but it honestly feels like I just lost a massive part of myself just now..

waveform,1,0,1r18m4,1,"I had an extremely unusual dream last night (well, as far as I can remember), in which I was mucking about with my dream characters. I was telling them we're all in a dream right now, and they seemed not to know what to say.

I proved it by making them sit down, or spin around, against their will - they were surprised but accepted it. I took them outside and created a rainbow from my hand, saying, ""see?""

Then I took two of them aside and said, ""I want you to try and *remember what happens after I wake up, and tell me if I see you again. Tell me if you continue to think and remember anything, or if you just cease to exist then pop up again. You see, we're very similar - I can't remember what happened before I appeared in my world either! My life could be a dream too, like yours."" And then I woke up.

It's the sort of thing I'd probably do, if I really was ""lucid"" - be very excited, do some stuff and try to find out how this universe works. But one thing bothers me - I didn't have sex. If I was *really* aware I was dreaming, I suspect the first order of the day would be to have sex with five women and a mongoose. Once that's out of the way, sure, have a look around.

So how do I know if this was a lucid dream, or *just a dream about having free will in a dream*?","How do you really know if you've had a lucid dream, as opposed to simply dreaming that you had one?",1

If you think the question is not clear enough here are more specific questions.

* What are the everyday experiences and effects of the economy on the graduate students?
* How do you think the US economy is doing today?
* Did you notice any change in the economy?
* If you did notice the change in the economy did it have any influence on what you are studying right now?
* What are you expectation for the future of the economy?
* If the economy was doing better or worse, would you change what you are studying right now? And what would you expect from the future?
* What are you financial expectation after you are done with graduate college?
* How is the job market for your field?
* Do you expect to find a job based on how the economy is? What financial expectations do you have with the job you might have after graduate college based on how the economy is doing right now?

He thinks I am an idiot and that there's no way anyone would make that mistake.  He claims that ""next"" means the next one in line (which I claim the word ""this"" makes more sense).

My girlfriend was there at the time and when she left I asked him why he really did it and he said to cut weed and to stop the RA (that lives with us) smelling it. He also blocked out the inner bottom part of the room-door to stop the smell from getting out.

I called the police on him when he started arguing with me saying him smoking in the room does not affect my (im very health conscious) and that pissed me off. 

I told my father and mother, and now she's telling me that I should be careful and don't always strive to be the righteous person.

Alisha33,2,0,1r13k2,1,"   Older ladies of Reddit, I would like to pick your brains for a moment. I know it's a bit long so bare with me.

   I have noticed that girls my age (early 20s) tend to people pleasers. We try to positively accommodating to everyone and often apologize for incidences which aren't even our fault. Sure, we turn around and complain about shitty situations to a sympathetic ear but when it comes down to the moment we turn into complete doormats. 
   For example: Late last week I came home from work with a slight headache to the sound of our lovely upstairs neighbors' children running a marathon in circles around their living room, complete with periodic thuds coming down on our ceiling at the end of each sprint that shook the picture frames on our walls. The first thing I thought was ""I should say something"" followed far too quickly with ""Well, it is only 6:30. The kids don't really need to start settling down until about 8.""
Wait, what? I actually though this? They are making my pictures rattle and knocking on my already pounding head and I'm thinking about how I would inconvenience THEIR day by knocking on their door and asking them to tone it down??
It was at that point that I put on my shoes and walked upstairs to politely inform them that they were being a bit to rowdy and brought to their attention the effect it was having on my evening. 
I'm starting to realize that there's a difference between being assertive and being rude, being polite and being walked all over. And I'm beginning to understand that if I don't say something to people like my upstairs neighbors then nobody will. 

So I ask, Is this something that every woman has to contend with as they grow into themselves? How did you come to this realization if ever? And do you think there's something we can do to teach younger girls that it's not being bossy or a bitch if you politely but firmly state your concerns?

Thanks

girl_on_bike,13,3,1r12p0,0,"This is my first Reddit post.  I've heard great things about this community, and I sincerely need your advice/opinions.

3 yrs ago, my then boyfriend and I won a $20k diamond ring in a scavenger hunt. Though we won it equally, he wanted it to be the engagement ring, so he put it in a safety deposit box in his name, then paid the taxes on it (which totaled ~$1,600). (Full disclosure: I entered us into the contest hoping to win and sell the ring to pay off my student loans. When he suggested a future engagement ring, I didn't argue but felt quietly ""off"" about it).  1 year later we broke up, in the most amicable way possible. 

It took me another year to get access to the ring (he was always ""busy""). We agreed to sell it and split it equally, but he put up a lot of road blocks. He would not let me remove it from the safety deposit box unless it was insured, but he wouldn't pay to have it insured, so I paid for it.  I then spent another year marketing the ring, taking it to various jewelers and posting it on various sites to try and sell it for the best price possible. Throughout this process I was transparent and communicative with him, and he was mostly unresponsive.  

On Sunday I sold the ring, and took a picture of the check for his reference.  I told him I'd transfer him 50%, but then he demanded I also pay for half the taxes from 3 years ago.  Obviously after all the hours I put into researching, marketing, and negotiating the sale of this ring, and my cost to insure it, I don't think I should give him cash for taxes he paid 3 years ago, without ever discussing it with me, or showing the paperwork.  It was his choice, because he intended to use it as the engagement ring, but then we broke up.  So people of Reddit, am I being fair?  What would you do in my situation?

I've looked all over the internet for similar cases, but can't find anything for me to compare this to.  Has anyone ever been in a similar situation?  How did you handle it?

 Before you get out the pitchforks hold on a minute, this is a very serious question.

 As a man i've realized one of the greatest flaw of my gender to be loosing control.

 Be it to overwhelming passion in the presence of women.

Or even the pull of pure purpose, to ""Do"", 'Create"" or merely ""Destroy"".

All with a strong emotional link but not on a superficial level, it can be fought and suppressed. In turn changing who/ what we are, our interests and how we live our lives.

1. Financed a new used car (first time in my name) 3 weeks ago and got insurance through the general.
2. Sunday night I was driving in the rain when the back tires slid and I lost control , ended up in a ditch but no injuries.
3. Police say that my back tires were bald on the inside to the point they were showing the wires.
4. I find out that the repairs will be too expensive for me to fix at this moment (estimate $1,500) 
My questions are:
1. Though I did buy the car as is with no guarantee is there anything I can do about the dealership selling me with the tires that bald? (I know it's very unlikely but I like to ask.)
2. Do I have to report the accident to my insurance company if I did no damage to anything besides my car and I want to pay for repairs myself? 
3. Since I won't be able to fix the car for a couple months can I pause my insurance? Will I have to say exactly why I want to pause or suspend insurance?

So I am a senior in high school and this year for the yearbook instead of doing quotes by our pictures we are doing hashtags. I know... a lot of people think its a stupid idea and its because our yearbook teacher is crazy and stupid we are stuck with a stupid idea like this. (I can give you some stories about her if you want reddit, just ask ahaha they are pretty funny) Anyways, as a majority of you can probably relate to, I don't like people at my school, they are all a bunch of selfish, arrogant, retards. (But hey thats highschool) So I was going to say #You'reAllWorthless for my hashtag in the yearbook but that is obviously inappropriate and if its not appropriate then they will change it but the person going through these is not that smart so im sure I can sneak something by her... So, I thought about any good ones and i'm having some trouble so I came to the best website on Earth for smart ass people to help me in finding a good hashtag. Im looking for something that basically says ""screw you school"" but it can be funny, clever, offensive, but most of all i'm looking to shit on this school for 4 years of Hell. Okay guys, let loose.

I am currently a soon-to-be political science student in my early twenties.  I come from a low income family and live in a relatively small rural backwater, but I've always been interested in the idea of making a difference, of being a man of means and measure, of pushing my ideas forward and being the change I want to see in the world.  I'm intelligent, I enjoy talking to people, I embrace responsibility and challenge, I'll work as hard as I need to and do whatever I need to to succeed, and I'm extremely dedicated to my ambition of one day being a Senator and, even after, holding some form of office; presidential aspirations aren't entirely out of the question, even if the odds are stacked against.

The problem, as it turns out, is that grand dreams do not simply happen, and are instead the realization of a vast series of smaller steps.  And it turns out I have very little practical knowledge of those steps and even scarcer knowledge of how to correct that deficiency.  Given the very large population Reddit has, I'm convinced it has someone with personal experience in these matters or who knows someone who does; you're a clever and motivated bunch, and I'm hoping I can learn from your stories.

She sat next to me in a language lab and introduced herself. I didn't think much of her at first. She was plain, I was an ass who could've gotten any girl that I wanted, but she liked talking to me I could tell. I lied a lot at first, too. I wanted her to think that I was more important than I actually was because I was four years older than her. The thing is, I never was good at lying, and maybe she saw through it, but she kept talking to me. We'd walk home from class together every Tuesday and Thursday.

Our first date was to the movies. It was a good time and I found that I could be quite honest with her. I didn't kiss her that night because I was and still am very nervous around girls beneath my exterior. 

The second place we went was to a concert. Things were more forced. We danced. It was much more different than our first date. I was the one being forceful because I was getting impatient waiting for us to make some kind of physical contact. 

She disappeared for a week. She replied to my texts but her response was always that she was busy. I took it as a ""fuck you.""

Our next time walking home togther, she explained that she wasn't looking for a relationship. I told her that I was not either. She then said that she couldn't see me because she still had feelings for her ex, who treated her like shit. But she asked me if we could still be friends. This killed me as I had heard this story so many times but I accepted it and didn't get angry.

The rest of the semester in French class was awkward. She would seldom go to class and when she did she was always distracted by her phone and would sit in the back of the room by herself. Towards the end of the semester, we had a group project. I asked her if she wanted to work with me and two other friends and she said yes. It was around this time that she started warming up to me and talking again, even if it was only about school.

Once the semester was over, she went home to the Midwest, I went home to the East. Our hockey teams were playing each other in the playoffs and we texted back and forth for a full week and a half. It wasn't all banter; at one point she admitted to missing me.

When we returned to school in the Fall, we made plans to meet up but it didn't happen until halfway through October when I ran into her at the gym and she asked me out for a drink. I still don't know if the connotation was friendly or something more.

We met up for drinks - it ended up just being the two of us. We talked and smiled a lot. I found that we could talk about anything, that I could talk about my real opinion with her and she was always interested in what I had to say. The feeling was mutual, as I could not be brought down around her. We made it all the way back to her apartment, where we talked for another two hours about almost anything. We even made plans to throw a party for both of our birthdays together. As comfortable as I was with her, it had been some time since I had kissed or even hugged a girl and my nerves were still on end. Even after breaking the physical barrier, I couldn't do anything more than hug her, just out of plain fear that she didn't want me to kiss her. As I was leaving her apartment, I had the impulse to just go for it, but just as I did, she froze up and I quickly turned it into another hug. 

A few days later, she sent me a text explaining that she has feelings for someone else ""unfortunately"" and that the other night was just supposed to be friendly and she had never intended on inviting me back to her apartment. I tried telling her my feelings about the night but she only responded with ""I just need to know that we are just friends.""

I suggested meeting up to talk things over and she agreed. But four weeks have gone by and we still have not talked face to face. 

Last week, she was participating in a dating auction. She and her friend were volunteering themselves as part of a charity fundraiser event to be purchased by spectators and taken out on a date. Feeling like I had to become a presence in her life again, I had the idea to go. My friends suggested that buying her would be too weird of a gesture, but that buying her friend would send a powerful message. 

So I did it. I went to the auction, saw her there - neither of us said hi even though we weren't far apart - and I bought her friend for $75. She was bought by a guy who she had come with for only $65. 

She didn't have any reaction though. Or if she did, she certainly did not want me to know about it. This was disappointing.

I took her friend out to the movies on Sunday as a follow-up to the date auction. The plan was to make no mention of the girl I liked but to be flirtatious with her friend. The idea was that if her friend talked about me, it would be good for me. 

But the date didn't go as planned. First, her friend made plans with me, i.e. ""we should do this sometime..."" By the end of the date, however, all such talk had ended, even though we hadn't even talked that much during the movie. Her friend knew about my past feelings. She also knew that I wasn't going to make a move on her. It turned out just to be a friendly date. When I asked her out of curiosity if she'd do it again, she said she'd have to think about it, but that she was rooting for me ""back when"" her friend and I had a thing. She also said that her friend is very bad at expressing her feelings. 

Now I'm here, wondering what my next move should be. She has not contacted me. I can't move on from this. I want her but getting to her has been a major life task. My gut and my friends tell me to just forget about her, that I'm wasting time. But every time I see her all anger I feel toward her for keeping me in the dark is vanished. I can't stay angry at her, and I have so much I want to say, but I can't be with her. So that's where I am. My fear is that she's just waiting for this to blow over since she is not good at confronting people with her emotions.

I'm currently dealing with a situation like this, I want to know how much your pets are worth to you. 

I currently work in the field I went to university for, making less money than I feel I deserve. I'm paying back a mountain of student loans, as well as a truck that is needed (live in the country). My dog is in need of a surgery that will cost me the equivalent of about 1.5 months of pay, but is almost sure to help her hip pain and let her live a proper life. 

I've gone to everyone I know, including family, for help. No one will help me - ""it's just a dog"". No, fuckers, it's my best friend. My student loans ate up all my credit, and I am living check to check now while i pay them back. My bank won't loan me money for this, and I'm left in a hard situation. I have to get her a $1800 surgery or put her down.

I know it sounds like nothing to some of you, and if i had the cash flow that some redditors do it is a no brainer. I don't, though, and if i pay for this surgery, there will be a domino effect with the rest of my bills and I just can't let my whole life get ****ed up to pay for this, but I so badly want to. I know reddit frowns upon asking for money, so I won't, but I don't know what I can do. I'm already working two jobs and just scraping by. If i abandon my dog now I would feel like a piece of shit; when i was in a bit of a depression she was the only thing that would come and make me feel better, with no judgement. I'm torn. I wish I could crowdsource this money or find a long lost rich uncle or SOMETHING. I feel so helpless and every day that goes by is making it harder on my dog and me.

PM me if you have any advice, help, stories or anything. I need cheering up as bad as i need money.

Basically their is this guy i met about a year and half ago in school, and we would not speak to each other often. but occasionally say ""Hi"" and talk about our classes . A few weeks ago he mentioned to me that he completed half of our history course and was planning on working towards is sciences, he happens to be always friendly to me.. and so today, we went to a event with our class, and i was sitting alone just waiting for the event to begin once again after lunch break and i caught him stare at me about three times, and then a few minutes later he came to sit next to me, and began telling me that he had just occurred to him that he was the only male in our class that attended the event,and then told me that the reason i have not seen him,in class was because he decided to switch classes in other to get another teacher, and then began asking me what i was planning to study in university and so on. and then when our group arrived he went back to his seat and told me that he would see me later. And then while i was sitting far away from his during the event he told me that i should come sit next to him hence i saved a seat for me . and for the rest of the day... talked to everyone around me.. but did not really tell me anything..unless it was during a group conversation about our school planning team. I was also going down the stairs when the event ended and he told me to go ahead of him and waited for me and anytime we have a conversation he would mention to me how much he likes sciences more than other courses. we are high school seniors.

HarleyGirl89,3,1,1r0sop,2,"Ever hated someone with a passion from the second you met them? Gotten a creepy feeling from someone which turned out to be justified?

I was wondering about this when I remembered something that happened me a few years ago. I went to visit my cousin who had started going out with a new guy. Met up with them at a fast food place and we got to talking. Straight away I didn't like the vibe I was getting from the new boyfriend. He didn't say anything wrong or do anything out of the ordinary but there was just this uncomfortable feeling I got around him. Fast forward about a year. He and my cousin had split up and out of nowhere my cousin gets a phone call around midnight one night from this guy asking if he could come visit her. Thankfully she refuses him. She found out a couple days later that he and his friend had both gotten drunk and had gotten into an argument. Things obviously got heated and this fine, upstanding gentleman decides to bash his friends head in with a rock and left him to die alone. He had phoned my cousin to attempt to get an alibi.

IllegitimateFather,6,2,1r0rtq,2,"I have never committed this story to writing. I am doing it now because I think it should be told.  God help me (its T minus 1 hour and counting b4 I have to be clocked in!!) I have often thought of putting this all down but haven't done it because of the emotional tax that has to be payed recounting it. I haven't yet been able to tell this story without seeing red and getting sad/mad/hateful/suicidal and tearing up  

In '94 I was living with a woman (we will call her A)for a few years when she tells me that she cheated with a person who she didn't really know, and could never locate since he was from another astate and it was a one night stand. She also told me she was pregnant.  I was upset to begin with, but after I cooled down, the thought of her alone with the baby was something I wanted to avoid. I still had deep feelings for her. The baby, regardless of how it arrived, was blameless. I stayed with her every step of the way throughout the pregnancy, all the DR visits, every pre-natal exam. I was there for every second of the delivery. I left only to go to the nursery and see the baby, who I will call D. I fell in love right away.  It didn't matter to me any more that I was not the biological father. I saw a little boy who needed me. 
I remember him lying his incubator in the nursery, I came in and was stroking his little head, whispering to him. He was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. I vowed to him I would be the best dad in the world. I would never leave him, a promose I was forced to break.
I did something I am not proud of and would come back to bite me and almost derail my relationship with my father. I told my famaily that the baby was mine. It was either that, or tell them what happened and get pressured into leaving her or at the very least treating D as an outsider. Im ashamed of this and if I could do it over, I would tell the truth. I did come clean and tell them after the fact that I had lied and why I lied. We had decided to likewise tell D, at least in the beginning, that I was his father.   


We took him back home a few days later.  She had some post postpartum depression issues but I was there and took excellent care of our newborn. After the depression, I just continued to get up at night for feedings and changings. Truth be told, I loved it. I didn't mind. At the time she was going to a local university for nursing degree and I was D's full time care giver during the school year working night time as a temp, doing whatever I could to keep our heads above the water…selling plasma to pay for the diapers was a regular thing. I was right there for every single one of his firsts.  I took him everywhere I went and we were inseparable. He got sick a few times, he had some asthma  as a small child. I was there by his side the entire time in Children's hospital, I never left him until it was time for him to be released. This happened 3 separate times. 
When he was about 5, his mother started acting strangely. She would leave and not come home till later and later and later until she started not coming home for days on end.  She had become involved with some other guy I found out. We wound up separating and I kept our son with me most of the time so he wouldn't get confused while she got her life straightened out. I got an apartment for us and we were doing pretty well until the building caught fire and we lost most everything we had.  A friend took us in, gave us a room, watched my son while I worked.  During this time, I had D-----, his mom came over to visit him once in awhile but for the most part I had him with me.  About the time that A started not coming home, I met a woman I will call K, who had a  daughter named L the same age as D. She would look after D while I went to give plasma or to work , fed us and made sure we were okay. D and L became very close but there was never anything between K and myself until years after I had lost D.  
 
A wound up marrying this person and at that point, she started taking our son more often,  keeping him with her.  She told me that she was living in her Dads house and there was a room for our son, and this was to be his address now. I could still come get him (that lasted for a few weeks) and got harder and harder to do until I was being told to just leave when I came to pick up D. 
I got a summons a few days later to appear at a clinic to undergo paternal testing. I knew what hat meant. I was being dealt our of my little boys life.  A few weeks later, it was a matter of fact I was not  his father. I had no legal footing whatsoever. I got a lawyer and I fought, but in the end, I was not his biological father. I was not married to his mom. The only thing I had was my name on his birth certificate. 
There was one incident that stands out in my mind. I was awarded visitation at the beginning of the legal process. I was also to get D for a special weekend that was planned. I had the court order in my hand as I went to pick up D from A's mom.  I was denied by her mom and so was nto able to get D for the amusement part trip we had planned. 
In the end I lost my son.  The court saw no reason for me to be involved in his life. The last time I saw my son, he was telling me that he had a new dad, and he was supposed to call me by my name and that I was not ""dad"" any more.  ( this was a few weeks before I lost all rights to see him, I had come over to see him on his birthday, he told me he couldn't take the present I brought ( I still have it)  and his mom let me know that his name could be getting changed (he was named after my brother and father). I made the decision to not fight any more. The look on his face, the tone in his voice, his overall confusion about what was happening, all told me that it was time to stop fighting and let the inevitable happen.   
  

My family adored her (before she took D) and  D, My father sent her to Toronto to see Phantom Of The Opera, paid for it all. Threw outlandish Christmas and Birthday parties for D. My brother would make regular trips to town to see us. And even took us up to his house for a weekend. After A and I broke up, my friend  K and I took D and L to my dads for xmas and birthdays.  
  
I cannot convey the feeling of loss. There are no words that comes close to expressing the utter sense of hopelessness. The thought that my little boy needed me but I could not even see him. I was not going to see him grow up. I was never going to hear his voice again. It was as if he had died. I wanted to die. I didn't.  Id like to say that it has gotten easier to live with. It hasn't.  I have thought about him every single day since then. I celebrate his birthday.  He turned 18 this year. It would be nice to talk to him but I don't know where he is. I intentionally made no attempt to locate him since I wanted to stay out of his life so as to not confuse him.  It sure would be nice to talk to 18 year old D , but as for 5 year old D, he is gone forever.  

What did I learn? What was my lesson from this? Tell the truth. To yourself and your family.  Also, if you don't try to be a Good Guy Greg, be a Scumbag Steve or you might find your self a Bad Luck Brian.

truth_hertz,0,0,1r0p0s,3,"I used to work retail during the holidays when I would go home between university terms.  One place I worked was a department store, and one day a family came in with a tag from the mall's ""Giving Tree"" that was set up for needy families.  The tag said that the requestor had a daughter and a son about the same ages as the two kids in the family that was buying the gifts.  I ended up helping the family for over an hour, buying things that the kids would have wanted for themselves; the young girl and boy were consulted at length over what clothes would be nicest, which shoes for the anonymous boy would be most admired, and which handbag the preteen girl would like the best.  The family ended up spending quite a bit of money, all the while talking about how great it would be for the two kids to have some nice things that would make them feel like they fit in at school.

Two days after Christmas I was working the returns desk and happened to get the return of all the lovely gifts that the donors had so carefully picked out.  Even worse, the mother had brought her two children with her to return these items.  The girl, who was twelve according to the tree tag, just stood silently sullen with her arms crossed, but the little boy, who was 8, was struggling to keep his bottom lip from trembling as he put the box containing a cool pair of  Nikes on the counter.  The mother acted disgusted with his lack of control and told him that ""you've known all along we weren't keeping any of this when we need it for bills.""

Because they had a gift receipt, our store policy dictated they could get cash for everything.  The mother was annoyed that the donors had bought a couple of the items on sale, so she wasn't entitled to the full retail price but she returned them anyway.

The looks on the faces of the two children broke my heart, and the attitude of the mother infuriated me.  I am pretty sure that she signed her kids up for this toy drive with the express intention of using it to get cash for herself.

Since then, I have never donated to any of these ""buy gifts for needy families"" schemes, because I don't want to get so emotionally invested in the purchase but be thinking in the back of my mind that I'm just being scammed.

Is there a way to make sure that the kids who don't have much for gifts this holiday season get something that their parents won't take away from them in favor of lining their own pockets?  Or are my options simply ""don't buy, or resign myself if I do""?",Is there a way to donate nice charitable holiday gifts that can't/won't be returned for cash?,3

Now its just getting really bad and I feel terrible living in this environment. I have 3,000 dollars saved up so far and I make around 130 dollars a day with my job.

This is my first time moving out, so I found a nice roommate in another city who said he'll give me a bedroom for 400$ per month.
I'll just be leaving while they're sleeping or whatever since I don't want to deal with any more drama, but the thing is, I have no clue on how to live alone. I live in Canada btw. So here are the questions: 

Do I need any documents (like my birth certificate, or high school diploma) and what if I can't have them since they're with my parents? Can I make new ones? What are essential cards that I need? All I have is my medical card, social security card and a debit card. 

Will earning 130$ a day be enough temporarily? I plan on starting college when I can but I can take a year off to get things straight. 

I don't have a license but I plan on getting one after I get settled in.

I guess that's about it, but any tips + info on living alone would be really really appreciated. I plan on moving out in the next week or so.
