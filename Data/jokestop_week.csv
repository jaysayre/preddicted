They went to her husband and explained what happened, telling him, ""Crazy as this sounds, maybe a little oral sex will do the trick and bring her out of the coma.""

The husband was sceptical, but they assured him that with the curtains closed for privacy, and his co-operation it might just work. He finally agreed and went into his wife's room.

A few minutes passed and then the woman's monitor flat lined, no pulse, no heart beat, alarms ringing, the nurses burst into the room. ""What happened?"" they cried.

fuzzyblackyeti,50,,135,1rgt0e,,386,"So a man is driving home from a buisness trip. He has a pretty low paying job, so obviously he doesn't have the best of cars.

After a few hours of driving, he drives past a monastery. That kind with all the monks.

And holy tits, his car breaks down right in front of the monastery.

Being a man of God, he obviously figures, ""I bet the monks will let me stay with them while my car is repaired."" So he goes to the front gate and knocks on the door. A man in robes answers.
He tells the monk his predicament and the monk, being a monk, lets him stay the night, and even helps with repair costs for his car.

While the business man is sleeping that night, he hears this strange noise.
It just perplexes him, and for the life of him, he can't figure out what it is. He decides when he wakes up in the morning, he'll ask the monks about it.

When he wakes up, he finds the monk who he met when his car first broke down, and asks him, ""Can you tell me what that noise I heard was last night?""

The monk replies, ""I'm sorry, brother. I cannot tell you, for you are not a monk."" The man accepts this. He thanks the monks for their graciousness, and goes about his way when he gets his car back.
3 years later, he is driving on another buisness trip. And wouldn't you know it, his car breaks down in front of the monastery again.

Again, he figures, he can stay the night. And, of course, the monks let him stay and offer him the same help as before.

And once again, during the night, he hears that noise. He has no idea what it could be. He decides to ask the monk once again, with hopes that he would trust him more this time around.
In the morning he meets the monk again, and asks, ""I'm sorry for asking again, but what is that noise!?""

The monk replies, ""I cannot tell you, for you are not a monk.""

The man says, ""Alright! I'll become a monk! What do I need to do!?""

The monk replies, ""I need you to travel the world, and count every blade of grass if you truly wish to become a monk.""

The man swiftly accepts and leaves all of his worldly possessions behind him to travel the world on this mission.

He goes to all corners of the globe counting grass blades.

After 50 years, he comes back to the monastery.
He gives the monk accurate numbers and the monks give him monk-hood.
And obviously, the first thing he wants to do is find out what that noise was. So he asks the head monk.

The head monk beckons him to follow him and he does.
After a few minutes of walking through corridors and rooms, they happen upon a wooden door. 

The man can hear the noise. He gets excited. The head monk hands him a brass key.
He reaches with the key to the lock, and unlocks the door.

There is another door though. This time iron. And the monk hands him an iron key.

This happens again and again.
So many types of doors and keys. Every thing you could imagine. Glass doors, gold doors. Everything

Finally, they get to a door made of solid diamond. The noise is louder than ever. The monk hands the man the final key.

He opens the door and finally sees what has been making the noise.

Realizing her first condition was too easy the woman says to the man, ""I want you to build me a 100-room mansion in New York. As a vacation home, I want a chateau built in the middle of the best wine country in France.""

The king pauses for awhile. He whips out his cell phone and calls some brokers in New York and in France. He looks at the woman, nods his head and says, ""Okay, okay. I build. I build.""

Realizing that she only has one last condition, the secretary knows that she'd better make this a good one. She takes her time to think and finally she gets an idea. A sure-to-work condition. She squints her eyes, looks at the man and says, rather coldly, ""Since I like sex, I want the man I marry to have a 14-inch penis.""

The man becomes distraught. He cups his face with his hands and rests his elbows on the table, all the while muttering to himself. Finally, the king shakes his head, looking really sad, and says to the woman, ""Okay, okay. I cut. I cut.""",Marriage Proposal,111,jokes

A hunter goes into the woods to shoot a bear. He always wanted a bear trophy.

After a few hours of walking through the woods and not finding anything the hunter was about to walk back home, but suddenly he saw a bear. 

Just around 50 meters away. He took his rifle, aimed, and...BANG!

As the smoke got blown away by the wind the hunter looked at the place the bear sleept just a few seconds ago. But...but...where did it go?! OH MY GOD! HE IS GOING TO KILL ME!!! NO...

Suddenly something tapped on the hunters shoulder. The hunter slowly turned around...and there he stood...the mighty bear he was about to shoot...it was big, black and had giant claws on its feet.

The bear said:""Hunter...either you will let me fuck you or I will kill you. Your choice.

The hunter was stunned...a speaking bear? What? He...how did he move that quickly anyways? Why...why does he want to fuck me...

But the hunter quickly managed to rearange his thoughts and said:""Well...I dont want to die...so-"" ""Excellent! Now bend over!"" Interrupted the bear. The hunter did what the bear wanted him to do. He bent over and the bear fucked his ass.

The next day the hunter said to himself:""I am getting that bitch. My anus is still bleeding and I have to kill him before any of my friends find out!"" So he grabs his rifle and leaves! 

Still a little wobbly on his legs he sneaks through the woods. After just a few minutes he finds the bear again. Sleeping at tge same spot as last time. 

So the hunter took his rifle, aimed, and - BANG.

After a few seconds the hunter looked up. But...WHAT?! I HIT THAT BI-""Well...well...hello there hunter."" Said the bear. ""Thats how we meet again"" ""God dammit!"" Said the hunter. ""You know the deal hunter. You will let me fuck you and I will let you live."".

So the hunter bends forward and the bear takes him again. This time even harder than last time.

After hours of torture by the bear the hunter walks back home. 

The next day the hunter gets really mad. He grabs hus rifle and storms out. I WILL KILL THAT SON OF A BITCH! I WILL CUT HIS THROAT! USE HIS SKIN AS A TOWEL!

As he approached the lake he heard some girls laughing and giggling. Fortunately for the girls they saw him force and quickly retreated to the deeper waters. As he noticed them he smiled to himself. There were three gorgeous girls covering themselves - *skinny dippers* he thought to himself. 

""We're not coming out until you leave!"" One of the girls shouted at him.

He frowned and furrowed his brow. ""Honestly, I didn't come down here to see some naked girls or anything of the like. I don't care if you stay in there or leave."" He lifted the bucket slightly. ""I'm just here to feed my pet alligator, Bill."" ",Skinny Dippers,39,jokes

An elderly man walks into a bar holding hands with a beautiful young woman. He is obviously a man of great wealth, as his watch is decked in diamonds and his suit is of Italian make. As the pair sits down, the bartender says “I’m sorry sir, but we don’t serve minors here,” nodding towards the woman. The man retorts “Now hold on just a minute. How would you know if she’s a minor? You haven’t even asked for her ID!” The bartender shrugs and says “she’s clearly a gold digger.”

Two nuns walk into a bar. The first is elderly, and seems to be fully devout. The other is young, blonde, and appears to be new to the convent. 
 “Bartender,” says the elderly nun, “I was wondering if you could settle a little dispute for us. You see, my trainee believes that true holiness can be achieved in a matter of days, rather than with the years on end that I’ve been practicing. One year out of catholic school, and she thinks that she is as holy as me!”
“I’ll tell you what,” replies the bartender, “both of your write down your arguments, and I’ll decide who among you is most holy.”
The sisters begin to write their cases. The elder nun finishes first, and slides her paper toward the bartender. At this point, the blonde sister has pulled out a calculator, and starts to plug away at the buttons.
The bartender reads the first paper aloud. “‘Everyday, for the last 40 years, I’ve woken at dawn for morning prayer. I prepare breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the entire convent, while using any spare hours for reading the texts and scripture. In case that isn’t holy enough, I volunteer on the weekends.’ Good gracious, sister!” Says the bartender, “this is quite exemplary.” 
By now, the young nun has finished and has passed her paper to the bartender.
“All this says is πr^2, r=2… Hold on, is this an equation for the area of a circle?!” exclaims the bartender.
“Oh, sorry,” says the blonde, blushing.
 “It was supposed to be circumference.”

A bartender has been going through a financial rough patch, and hoped that his wife would accommodate for the tough times by letting him try anal. Now, the wife resents her husband, and was appalled by his audacity to ask for such a thing with their marriage on the fritz. She denies his request.
Later in the week, a man walks into the bar and asks the bartender for a prostitute. The bartender is about to send the man on his way, when he gets an idea that would make him some money while simultaneously punishing his wife.
“You see that woman in the corner?” He asks, “Well, she’s one of the best girls we got. You go over to her and take her into the private room. You can do whatever you want with her, no matter how much she resists. It’s all part of the act. After you’re through, come back here and pay full price, $2000.”
The man nods his head excitedly in agreement and walks toward the wife. The bartender watches from afar as the two exchange a few quick words. All of a sudden, he sees the man grab his wife by the arm and pull her into the private room.
The bartender smiles inwardly to himself and thinks “Ha! That’ll teach the bitch to appreciate me. Plus, I’m making a small fortune!”
After about twenty minutes, the wife comes out, alone. She heads over to the bartender with a slight limp.
“Where’s your new friend?” asks the bartender, smiling. “He owes me a little money.”
The wife snickers, pulls her husband in close and whispers in his ear “I let him use the back door,” and walks away.

The Trids, tired of the giant, sent a group led by the community's minister to reason with the giant. But before they could even say one word the giant kicked them down the mountain. The Trids thought maybe this was because the giant was Catholic, so they sent another group, this time led by the local priest. But alas, as they approached, the giant once again kicked them all down the mountain.

The Trids were upset until they thought that perhaps the giant was Jewish. Unfortunately, no Trids were Jewish, so they asked a rabbi of a different community for help. The Rabbi led a group of Trids up the mountain. The giant saw them coming and kicked all of them, except for the Rabbi, down the mountain. The Rabbi, knowing the giant's past, wondered why he alone had not been kicked down the mountain, so he asked the giant. The giant laughed and replied

After a few hours of driving, he drives past a monastery. That kind with all the monks.

And holy tits, his car breaks down right in front of the monastery.

Being a man of God, he obviously figures, ""I bet the monks will let me stay with them while my car is repaired."" So he goes to the front gate and knocks on the door. A man in robes answers.
He tells the monk his predicament and the monk, being a monk, lets him stay the night, and even helps with repair costs for his car.

While the business man is sleeping that night, he hears this strange noise.
It just perplexes him, and for the life of him, he can't figure out what it is. He decides when he wakes up in the morning, he'll ask the monks about it.

When he wakes up, he finds the monk who he met when his car first broke down, and asks him, ""Can you tell me what that noise I heard was last night?""

The monk replies, ""I'm sorry, brother. I cannot tell you, for you are not a monk."" The man accepts this. He thanks the monks for their graciousness, and goes about his way when he gets his car back.
3 years later, he is driving on another buisness trip. And wouldn't you know it, his car breaks down in front of the monastery again.

Again, he figures, he can stay the night. And, of course, the monks let him stay and offer him the same help as before.

And once again, during the night, he hears that noise. He has no idea what it could be. He decides to ask the monk once again, with hopes that he would trust him more this time around.
In the morning he meets the monk again, and asks, ""I'm sorry for asking again, but what is that noise!?""

The monk replies, ""I cannot tell you, for you are not a monk.""

The man says, ""Alright! I'll become a monk! What do I need to do!?""

The monk replies, ""I need you to travel the world, and count every blade of grass if you truly wish to become a monk.""

The man swiftly accepts and leaves all of his worldly possessions behind him to travel the world on this mission.

He goes to all corners of the globe counting grass blades.

After 50 years, he comes back to the monastery.
He gives the monk accurate numbers and the monks give him monk-hood.
And obviously, the first thing he wants to do is find out what that noise was. So he asks the head monk.

The head monk beckons him to follow him and he does.
After a few minutes of walking through corridors and rooms, they happen upon a wooden door. 

The man can hear the noise. He gets excited. The head monk hands him a brass key.
He reaches with the key to the lock, and unlocks the door.

There is another door though. This time iron. And the monk hands him an iron key.

This happens again and again.
So many types of doors and keys. Every thing you could imagine. Glass doors, gold doors. Everything

Finally, they get to a door made of solid diamond. The noise is louder than ever. The monk hands the man the final key.

He opens the door and finally sees what has been making the noise.

Finally God said, ""Cool it. I am going to set up a test that will run two hours and I will judge who does the better job.""

So, Satan and Jesus sat at the keyboards and typed away. They moused, They did spreadsheets, They wrote reports. They sent faxes. They sent e-mail, They sent out e-mail with attachments.

They downloaded, They did some genealogy reports. They made cards. They did every known job

But ten minutes before their time was up, lightning suddenly flashed across the sky, thunder rolled, the rain poured and, of course, the electricity went off.

Satan stared at his blank screen and screamed every curse word known in the underworld. Jesus just sighed.

The electricity finally flickered back on, and each of them restarted their computers. Satan started searching frantically, screaming ""It's gone! It's all gone! I lost everything when the power went out!""

Meanwhile, Jesus quietly started printing out all of his files from the past two hours. Satan observed this and became irate. ""Wait! He cheated, how did he do it?""

God shrugged and said, ""Jesus saves.""

And they're feeling very amorous -
They're doing all sort of things to each other.

Two nuns walk into a bar. The first is elderly, and seems to be fully devout. The other is young, blonde, and appears to be new to the convent. 
 “Bartender,” says the elderly nun, “I was wondering if you could settle a little dispute for us. You see, my trainee believes that true holiness can be achieved in a matter of days, rather than with the years on end that I’ve been practicing. One year out of catholic school, and she thinks that she is as holy as me!”
“I’ll tell you what,” replies the bartender, “both of your write down your arguments, and I’ll decide who among you is most holy.”
The sisters begin to write their cases. The elder nun finishes first, and slides her paper toward the bartender. At this point, the blonde sister has pulled out a calculator, and starts to plug away at the buttons.
The bartender reads the first paper aloud. “‘Everyday, for the last 40 years, I’ve woken at dawn for morning prayer. I prepare breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the entire convent, while using any spare hours for reading the texts and scripture. In case that isn’t holy enough, I volunteer on the weekends.’ Good gracious, sister!” Says the bartender, “this is quite exemplary.” 
By now, the young nun has finished and has passed her paper to the bartender.
“All this says is πr^2, r=2… Hold on, is this an equation for the area of a circle?!” exclaims the bartender.
“Oh, sorry,” says the blonde, blushing.
 “It was supposed to be circumference.”

A bartender has been going through a financial rough patch, and hoped that his wife would accommodate for the tough times by letting him try anal. Now, the wife resents her husband, and was appalled by his audacity to ask for such a thing with their marriage on the fritz. She denies his request.
Later in the week, a man walks into the bar and asks the bartender for a prostitute. The bartender is about to send the man on his way, when he gets an idea that would make him some money while simultaneously punishing his wife.
“You see that woman in the corner?” He asks, “Well, she’s one of the best girls we got. You go over to her and take her into the private room. You can do whatever you want with her, no matter how much she resists. It’s all part of the act. After you’re through, come back here and pay full price, $2000.”
The man nods his head excitedly in agreement and walks toward the wife. The bartender watches from afar as the two exchange a few quick words. All of a sudden, he sees the man grab his wife by the arm and pull her into the private room.
The bartender smiles inwardly to himself and thinks “Ha! That’ll teach the bitch to appreciate me. Plus, I’m making a small fortune!”
After about twenty minutes, the wife comes out, alone. She heads over to the bartender with a slight limp.
“Where’s your new friend?” asks the bartender, smiling. “He owes me a little money.”
The wife snickers, pulls her husband in close and whispers in his ear “I let him use the back door,” and walks away.

""I would like to take out a loan for $100,000"" the frog declares. 

Mr. Paddywack looks at the frog and says ""Since you don't have any credit with this bank you'll need a cosigner.""

""No Problem"" says the frog ""My father is Mick Jagger and he'll cosign the loan for me.""

""Well you'll also need some collateral"" Mr. Paddywack countered.

""Will this work?"" Asks the frog and pulls from his pocket a mishappen Buddha figurine made out of bronze.

""Well maybe. Lets' go ask the bank manager."" Says Paddywack and the two go back to the bank manager where Paddywack explains the situation.

""And so what should I do? I don't even know what this thing is!"" Paddywack tells the bank manager while showing him the Buddha.

The bank manager replies


""It's a knick-knack Paddywhack.

OldSchoolCoolCool,7,,3,1r0beq,,10,"It was the classic ""prisoner in a gulag tells the story of how he got there"" format, and this guy was explaining how he started off as the well-to-do general manager of a factory or something, had his own car, and at some point he made a mocking comment about the government, so he was demoted to mid-level management where he had to take the bus, and he made another disparaging comment so he was demoted to some blue-collar job where he had to ride a bike to work. I think the punchline was something like:

&gt; …and one day I had put my bike alongside a fence and was about to go to work, when a policeman said ""you can't leave your bike here, a parade with government officials is scheduled to go through this street later"", and I replied ""oh it'll be fine, I have a good padlock"", and that's how I got here.

laughoutloud830,2,,7,1rgr73,,11,"Once in a land far, far away there lived a group of people called Trids. The Trids were happy except for a giant that lived on the mountain. The giant would often terrorize the Trids.

The Trids, tired of the giant, sent a group led by the community's minister to reason with the giant. But before they could even say one word the giant kicked them down the mountain. The Trids thought maybe this was because the giant was Catholic, so they sent another group, this time led by the local priest. But alas, as they approached, the giant once again kicked them all down the mountain.

The Trids were upset until they thought that perhaps the giant was Jewish. Unfortunately, no Trids were Jewish, so they asked a rabbi of a different community for help. The Rabbi led a group of Trids up the mountain. The giant saw them coming and kicked all of them, except for the Rabbi, down the mountain. The Rabbi, knowing the giant's past, wondered why he alone had not been kicked down the mountain, so he asked the giant. The giant laughed and replied

""There are three bees stuck in a jar. Two females and one male. The females want to get out of the jar, and the male knows how to get out of the jar. One of the females goes to the male and asks him, 'How do I get out of this thing?' The male bee is very horny and he replies, 'Fuck me and I'll tell you'. Out of desperation, the female bee fucks him and says, 'Now tell me how to get out of this jar.' The male keeps his promise and tells the female bee 'to go round the corner and shoot upwards, the jar lid will pop open.' She complies and does what he said; she goes round the corner and goes up, but she hits the lid so hard that she dies and it lid remains closed.

Now there is one male and female bee. The last female bee is also desperate to get out, so she goes to the male bee and asks him, 'How do I get out of this jar?' The male bee, being very horny says again, 'Fuck me and I'll tell you.' The female, being equally desperate fucks him and he tells her how to get out, 'go round the corner and shoot upwards, the jar lid will pop open'. Same advice he gave to the first bee. The second female bee listens to him and she goes round the corner and shoots upwards, she too hits the lid and falls down and dies.

Now the male bee is remaining alone in the jar. He feels lonely and he knows how to get out of the jar. So he does what he told the female bees: goes round the corner and shoots up. The jar pops open and he leaves.""

At this point, the person you're telling it to would be like, ""How?""

fuzzyblackyeti,50,,137,1rgt0e,,382,"So a man is driving home from a buisness trip. He has a pretty low paying job, so obviously he doesn't have the best of cars.

After a few hours of driving, he drives past a monastery. That kind with all the monks.

And holy tits, his car breaks down right in front of the monastery.

Being a man of God, he obviously figures, ""I bet the monks will let me stay with them while my car is repaired."" So he goes to the front gate and knocks on the door. A man in robes answers.
He tells the monk his predicament and the monk, being a monk, lets him stay the night, and even helps with repair costs for his car.

While the business man is sleeping that night, he hears this strange noise.
It just perplexes him, and for the life of him, he can't figure out what it is. He decides when he wakes up in the morning, he'll ask the monks about it.

When he wakes up, he finds the monk who he met when his car first broke down, and asks him, ""Can you tell me what that noise I heard was last night?""

The monk replies, ""I'm sorry, brother. I cannot tell you, for you are not a monk."" The man accepts this. He thanks the monks for their graciousness, and goes about his way when he gets his car back.
3 years later, he is driving on another buisness trip. And wouldn't you know it, his car breaks down in front of the monastery again.

Again, he figures, he can stay the night. And, of course, the monks let him stay and offer him the same help as before.

And once again, during the night, he hears that noise. He has no idea what it could be. He decides to ask the monk once again, with hopes that he would trust him more this time around.
In the morning he meets the monk again, and asks, ""I'm sorry for asking again, but what is that noise!?""

The monk replies, ""I cannot tell you, for you are not a monk.""

The man says, ""Alright! I'll become a monk! What do I need to do!?""

The monk replies, ""I need you to travel the world, and count every blade of grass if you truly wish to become a monk.""

The man swiftly accepts and leaves all of his worldly possessions behind him to travel the world on this mission.

He goes to all corners of the globe counting grass blades.

After 50 years, he comes back to the monastery.
He gives the monk accurate numbers and the monks give him monk-hood.
And obviously, the first thing he wants to do is find out what that noise was. So he asks the head monk.

The head monk beckons him to follow him and he does.
After a few minutes of walking through corridors and rooms, they happen upon a wooden door. 

The man can hear the noise. He gets excited. The head monk hands him a brass key.
He reaches with the key to the lock, and unlocks the door.

There is another door though. This time iron. And the monk hands him an iron key.

This happens again and again.
So many types of doors and keys. Every thing you could imagine. Glass doors, gold doors. Everything

Finally, they get to a door made of solid diamond. The noise is louder than ever. The monk hands the man the final key.

He opens the door and finally sees what has been making the noise.

Finally God said, ""Cool it. I am going to set up a test that will run two hours and I will judge who does the better job.""

So, Satan and Jesus sat at the keyboards and typed away. They moused, They did spreadsheets, They wrote reports. They sent faxes. They sent e-mail, They sent out e-mail with attachments.

They downloaded, They did some genealogy reports. They made cards. They did every known job

But ten minutes before their time was up, lightning suddenly flashed across the sky, thunder rolled, the rain poured and, of course, the electricity went off.

Satan stared at his blank screen and screamed every curse word known in the underworld. Jesus just sighed.

The electricity finally flickered back on, and each of them restarted their computers. Satan started searching frantically, screaming ""It's gone! It's all gone! I lost everything when the power went out!""

Meanwhile, Jesus quietly started printing out all of his files from the past two hours. Satan observed this and became irate. ""Wait! He cheated, how did he do it?""

The vet tells the farmer that he should try artificial insemination. The farmer doesn't have the slightest idea what this means but, not wanting to display his ignorance, only asks the vet how he will know when the pigs are pregnant. The vet tells him that they will stop standing around and will, instead, lay down and wallow in the mud when they are pregnant. the farmer hangs up and gives it some thought.

He comes to the conclusion that artificial insemination means he has to impregnate the pigs. So, he loads the pigs into his truck, drives them out into the woods, has sex with them all, brings them back and goes to bed. Next morning, he wakes and looks out at the pigs. Seeing that they are all still standing around, he concludes that the first try didn't take effect, and loads them into the truck again. He drives them out to the woods, bangs each pig twice for good measure, brings them back and goes to bed.

Next morning, he wakes to find the pigs still just standing around. ""One more try"", he tells himself, and proceeds to load them up and drive them out to the woods. He spends all day shagging the pigs and, upon returning home, falls listlessly into bed. The next morning, he cannot even raise himself from the bed to look at the pigs.

A hunter goes into the woods to shoot a bear. He always wanted a bear trophy.

After a few hours of walking through the woods and not finding anything the hunter was about to walk back home, but suddenly he saw a bear. 

Just around 50 meters away. He took his rifle, aimed, and...BANG!

As the smoke got blown away by the wind the hunter looked at the place the bear sleept just a few seconds ago. But...but...where did it go?! OH MY GOD! HE IS GOING TO KILL ME!!! NO...

Suddenly something tapped on the hunters shoulder. The hunter slowly turned around...and there he stood...the mighty bear he was about to shoot...it was big, black and had giant claws on its feet.

The bear said:""Hunter...either you will let me fuck you or I will kill you. Your choice.

The hunter was stunned...a speaking bear? What? He...how did he move that quickly anyways? Why...why does he want to fuck me...

But the hunter quickly managed to rearange his thoughts and said:""Well...I dont want to die...so-"" ""Excellent! Now bend over!"" Interrupted the bear. The hunter did what the bear wanted him to do. He bent over and the bear fucked his ass.

The next day the hunter said to himself:""I am getting that bitch. My anus is still bleeding and I have to kill him before any of my friends find out!"" So he grabs his rifle and leaves! 

Still a little wobbly on his legs he sneaks through the woods. After just a few minutes he finds the bear again. Sleeping at tge same spot as last time. 

So the hunter took his rifle, aimed, and - BANG.

After a few seconds the hunter looked up. But...WHAT?! I HIT THAT BI-""Well...well...hello there hunter."" Said the bear. ""Thats how we meet again"" ""God dammit!"" Said the hunter. ""You know the deal hunter. You will let me fuck you and I will let you live."".

So the hunter bends forward and the bear takes him again. This time even harder than last time.

After hours of torture by the bear the hunter walks back home. 

The next day the hunter gets really mad. He grabs hus rifle and storms out. I WILL KILL THAT SON OF A BITCH! I WILL CUT HIS THROAT! USE HIS SKIN AS A TOWEL! 

The hunter runs through the woods. Yelling:""BEAR! WHERE ARE YOU MOTHER-FUCKER! COME HERE YOU SON OF A BITCH!""

Soon enougth he finds the bear. Sleeping. So he grabs his rifle, walks up to him.

An elderly man walks into a bar holding hands with a beautiful young woman. He is obviously a man of great wealth, as his watch is decked in diamonds and his suit is of Italian make. As the pair sits down, the bartender says “I’m sorry sir, but we don’t serve minors here,” nodding towards the woman. The man retorts “Now hold on just a minute. How would you know if she’s a minor? You haven’t even asked for her ID!” The bartender shrugs and says “she’s clearly a gold digger.”

Two nuns walk into a bar. The first is elderly, and seems to be fully devout. The other is young, blonde, and appears to be new to the convent. 
 “Bartender,” says the elderly nun, “I was wondering if you could settle a little dispute for us. You see, my trainee believes that true holiness can be achieved in a matter of days, rather than with the years on end that I’ve been practicing. One year out of catholic school, and she thinks that she is as holy as me!”
“I’ll tell you what,” replies the bartender, “both of your write down your arguments, and I’ll decide who among you is most holy.”
The sisters begin to write their cases. The elder nun finishes first, and slides her paper toward the bartender. At this point, the blonde sister has pulled out a calculator, and starts to plug away at the buttons.
The bartender reads the first paper aloud. “‘Everyday, for the last 40 years, I’ve woken at dawn for morning prayer. I prepare breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the entire convent, while using any spare hours for reading the texts and scripture. In case that isn’t holy enough, I volunteer on the weekends.’ Good gracious, sister!” Says the bartender, “this is quite exemplary.” 
By now, the young nun has finished and has passed her paper to the bartender.
“All this says is πr^2, r=2… Hold on, is this an equation for the area of a circle?!” exclaims the bartender.
“Oh, sorry,” says the blonde, blushing.
 “It was supposed to be circumference.”

A bartender has been going through a financial rough patch, and hoped that his wife would accommodate for the tough times by letting him try anal. Now, the wife resents her husband, and was appalled by his audacity to ask for such a thing with their marriage on the fritz. She denies his request.
Later in the week, a man walks into the bar and asks the bartender for a prostitute. The bartender is about to send the man on his way, when he gets an idea that would make him some money while simultaneously punishing his wife.
“You see that woman in the corner?” He asks, “Well, she’s one of the best girls we got. You go over to her and take her into the private room. You can do whatever you want with her, no matter how much she resists. It’s all part of the act. After you’re through, come back here and pay full price, $2000.”
The man nods his head excitedly in agreement and walks toward the wife. The bartender watches from afar as the two exchange a few quick words. All of a sudden, he sees the man grab his wife by the arm and pull her into the private room.
The bartender smiles inwardly to himself and thinks “Ha! That’ll teach the bitch to appreciate me. Plus, I’m making a small fortune!”
After about twenty minutes, the wife comes out, alone. She heads over to the bartender with a slight limp.
“Where’s your new friend?” asks the bartender, smiling. “He owes me a little money.”
The wife snickers, pulls her husband in close and whispers in his ear “I let him use the back door,” and walks away.

laughoutloud830,2,,7,1rgr73,,11,"Once in a land far, far away there lived a group of people called Trids. The Trids were happy except for a giant that lived on the mountain. The giant would often terrorize the Trids.

The Trids, tired of the giant, sent a group led by the community's minister to reason with the giant. But before they could even say one word the giant kicked them down the mountain. The Trids thought maybe this was because the giant was Catholic, so they sent another group, this time led by the local priest. But alas, as they approached, the giant once again kicked them all down the mountain.

The Trids were upset until they thought that perhaps the giant was Jewish. Unfortunately, no Trids were Jewish, so they asked a rabbi of a different community for help. The Rabbi led a group of Trids up the mountain. The giant saw them coming and kicked all of them, except for the Rabbi, down the mountain. The Rabbi, knowing the giant's past, wondered why he alone had not been kicked down the mountain, so he asked the giant. The giant laughed and replied
