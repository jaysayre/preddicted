After being there a while, they got into the habit of going to the beach every evening to watch the sun go down. One particular evening, the sky was red with beautiful cirrus clouds, the breeze warm and gentle-a perfect night for romance.

As they sat there, the sheep started looking better and better to the man. Soon, he leaned over to the sheep and put his arm around it. But the dog got jealous, growling fiercely until the man took his arm from around the sheep. After that, the three of them continued to enjoy the sunsets together, but there was no more cuddling.
A few weeks passed by and lo and behold, there was another shipwreck. 

The only survivor was a beautiful young woman, the most beautiful woman the man had ever seen. She was badly injured when they rescued her, and they slowly nursed her back to health. When the young maiden was well enough, they introduced her to their evening beach ritual. It was another beautiful evening: red sky, cirrus clouds, a warm and gentle breeze-perfect for a night of romance.

MoralLesson,6,78,1qvop2,160,"There was this male engineer, on a cruise ship in the Caribbean for the first time. It was wonderful, the experience of his life. He was being waited on hand and foot. But, it did not last. A Hurricane came up unexpectedly. The ship went down almost instantly.

The man found himself, he knew not how, swept up on the shore of an island. There was nothing else anywhere to be seen. No people, no supplies, nothing. The man looked around. There were some bananas and coconuts, but that was it. He was desperate, and forlorn, but decided to make the best of it. So for the next four months he ate bananas, drank coconut juice and mostly looked to the sea mightily for a ship to come to his rescue.

One day, as he was lying on the beach stroking his beard and looking for a ship, he spotted movement out of the corner of his eye. Could it be true, was it a ship? No, from around the corner of the island came this row-boat. In it was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen, or at least seen in 4 months. She was tall, tanned, and her blond hair flowing in the sea breeze gave her an almost ethereal quality. She spotted him also as he was waving and yelling and screaming to get her attention. 

She rowed her boat towards him. In disbelief, he asked, ""Where did you come from? How did you get here?"" 

She said, ""I rowed from the other side of the island. I landed on this island when my cruise ship sank."" 

""Amazing"", he said, ""I didn't know anyone else had survived. How many of you are there? Where did you get the row-boat? You must have been really lucky to have a row-boat wash-up with you?"" 

""It is only me"", she said, ""and the row-boat didn't wash up, nothing else did.""

""Well then"", said the man, ""how did you get the row-boat?"" 

""I made the row-boat out of raw material that I found on the island"", replied the woman. ""The oars were whittled from Gum tree branches, I wove the bottom from Palm branches, and the sides and stern came from a Eucalyptus tree""

""But, but,"" asked the man, ""what about tools and hardware, how did you do that?""

""Oh, no problem"", replied the woman, ""on the south side of the island there is a very unusual strata of alluvial rock exposed. I found that If I fired it to a certain temperature in my kiln, it melted into forgeable ductile iron. I used that for tools, and used the tools to make the hardware. But, enough of that,"" she continued. ""Where do you live?"" At last the man was forced to confess that he had been sleeping on the beach. 

""Well, let's row over to my place"", she said. So they both got into the row-boat and left for her side of island. The woman easily rowed them around to a wharf that led to the approach to her place. She tied up the row-boat with a beautifully woven hemp rope. They walked up a stone walk and around a Palm tree, there stood an exquisite bungalow painted in blue and white.

""It's not much"", she said, ""but I call it home. Sit down please, would you like to have a drink?"" 

""No"", said the man, ""one more coconut juice and I will puke.""

""It won't be coconut juice"", the woman replied, ""I have a still, how about a Pina Colada?"" Trying to hide his continued amazement, the man accepted, and they sat down on her couch to talk. After a while, when they had exchanged their stories, the woman asked, ""Tell me, have you always had a beard?"" 

""No"", the man replied, ""I was clean shaven all of my life, and even on the cruise ship.""

""Well if you would like to shave, there is a man's razor upstairs in the cabinet in the bathroom."" So, the man, no longer questioning anything, went upstairs to the bathroom. There in the cabinet was a razor made from a bone handle, two shells honed to a hollow ground edge were fastened on to its end inside of a swivel mechanism. The man shaved, showered and went back down stairs.

""You look great"", said the woman, ""I think I will go up and slip into something more comfortable."" So she did. And, the man continued to sip his Pina Colada. After a short time, the woman returned - this time wearing fig leafs strategically positioned and smelling faintly of gardenia.

""Tell me"", she asked, ""we have both been out here for a very long time with no companionship. You know what I mean. Have you been lonely, is there anything that you really miss? Something that all men and women need? Something that it would be really nice to have right now?""

""Yes there is,"" the man replied, as he moved closer to the woman while fixing a winsome gaze upon her, ""Tell me. Do you happen to have an internet connection; I need to check reddit?”",There was a male engineer on a cruise ship...,238

bachiavelli,5,35,1qvimv,151,"A christian missionary spends a year in a remote African village spreading the gospel.  In that time the tribal chiefs daughter gets pregnant, and eventually has a baby that turns out to be white.

Outraged the chief confronts the missionary.  Being the only white person his daughter had ever met, he accuses him of being the father and betraying his trust.

Calmly the missionary walks with the chief to the edge of the village where some sheep are grazing.

""Chief, there is always an explanation for everything.  For example, you have over one hundred white sheep out there, but in the midst of them all is a single black lamb, and nobody even questions why.  Now look at your situation and try to find understanding in your heart for this strange set of circumstances we now find ourselves in.""

After silently watching the flock of sheep for a few moments the chief replies to the missionary.

""Tell you what.  You keep quiet about that little black lamb out there and I won't say anything about the baby.""",Now that you put it that way...,186

settlers,8,20,1qt5mh,27,"NEW MEXICO CHILI COOK OFF

If you can read this whole story without laughing, then there's no hope for you. I was crying by the end. This is an actual account as relayed to paramedics at a chili cook-off in New Mexico. 


For those of you who have lived in New Mexico, you know how true this is. They actually have a Chili Cook-off about the time Halloween comes around. It takes up a major portion of a parking lot at the Santa Fe Plaza. Judge #3 was an inexperienced Chili taster named Frank, who was visiting from Springfield, IL.


Frank: ""Recently, I was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cook-off. The original person called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table, asking for directions to the Coors Light truck, when the call came in... I was assured by the other two judges (Native New Mexicans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy; and, besides, they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted and became Judge 3.""


Here are the scorecard notes from the event:



CHILI # 1 - MIKE'S MANIAC MONSTER CHILE

Judge # 1 -- A little too heavy on the tomato. Amusing kick.

Judge # 2 -- Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.

Judge # 3 (Frank) -- Holy crap, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway. It took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that's the worst one. These New Mexicans are crazy.



CHILE # 2 - EL RANCHO'S AFTERBURNER CHILE

Judge # 1 -- Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight jalapeno tang..

Judge # 2 -- Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.

Judge # 3 -- Keep this out of the reach of children. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face.



CHILI # 3 - ALFREDO'S FAMOUS BURN DOWN THE BARN CHILI

Judge # 1 -- Excellent firehouse chile. Great kick.

Judge # 2 -- A bit salty, good use of peppers.

Judge # 3 -- Call the EPA. I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now. Get me more beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back, now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting ****-faced from all of the beer.



CHILI # 4 - BUBBA'S BLACK MAGIC

Judge # 1 -- Black bean chile with almost no spice. Disappointing.

Judge # 2 -- Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chile.

Judge # 3 -- I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Is it possible to burn out taste buds? Sally, the beer maid, was standing behind me with fresh refills. This 300 lb. woman is starting to look HOT ... just like this nuclear waste I'm eating! Is chili an aphrodisiac?



CHILE # 5 - LISA'S LEGAL LIP REMOVER

Judge # 1 -- Meaty, strong chili. Jalapeno peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive.

Judge # 2 -- Chili using shredded beef, could use more tomato. Must admit the jalapeno peppers make a strong statement.

Judge # 3 -- My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted, and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from the pitcher. I wonder if I'm burning my lips off. It really ticks me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Screw them.



CHILE # 6 - VARGA'S VERY VEGETARIAN VARIETY

Judge # 1 -- Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spices and peppers.

Judge # 2 -- The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, garlic. Superb.

Judge # 3 -- My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames. I crapped on myself when I farted, and I'm worried it will eat through the chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that Sally. Can't feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe my butt with a snow cone.



CHILE # 7 - SUSAN'S SCREAMING SENSATION CHILI

Judge # 1 -- A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.

Judge # 2 -- Ho hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. **I should take note that I am worried about judge number 3. He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably.

Judge # 3 -- You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a thing. I've lost sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava to match my shirt. At least during the autopsy, they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing. It's too painful. I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole in my stomach.



CHILE # 8 - BIG TOM'S TOENAIL CURLING CHILE

Judge # 1 -- The perfect ending, this is a nice
blend chile. Not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence.

Judge # 2 -- This final entry is a good, balanced chili. Neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge #3 farted, passed out, fell over and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor feller, wonder how he'd have reacted to really hot chili?

brianw824,1,14,1qt4qv,27,"A traveling salesman trying to make a buck was driving through the plains of Nebraska when he decided to stop at a farmhouse coming up on his left.
As he was walking up the driveway toward the front door of the house, a pig with three legs caught his eye. It was just hobbling through the grass.
When the farmer answered the door and asked what he was selling, the salesman first asked about the three legged pig.
""That pig is the most amazing pig in the land, son."" The farmer said
""Last year, our house caught fire when we were all asleep and that pig ran in and woke us all up one by one and saved our lives!""
The salesman was surprised. ""That is one special pig"" He said.
The Farmer replied, ""That's not all. Last summer, that pig jumped into the pond and dragged my drowning son to safety. He would have died.""
The salesman was in disbelief as to how incredible this pig was. ""One question. Why does he have 3 legs, is it from the fire?"" He asked
""No son, ya see, a pig like that you just don't eat all at one time.""",Three legged Pig,41

So the next day the first person came to the gates of heaven. The angel at the gate promptly asked the man to tell him about the day he died.

""Well, for some time now, I thought my wife was having an affair and that each day on her lunch hour she'd bring her lover home to our 25th floor apartment and have sex with him. So today I was going to come home too, and catch them. Well, I got there and busted in, and immediately began searching for this guy. My wife was half-naked and yelling at me as I searched the entire apartment. But, damn it, I couldn't find him! Just when I was about to give up, I happened to glance out onto the balcony and noticed that there was a man hanging off the edge by his fingertips ! The nerve of that guy to think he could hide from me! Well, I ran out there and promptly stomped on his fingers until he fell to the ground. But, wouldn't you know it, he landed in some bushes that broke his fall, and he didn't die. This got me even more enraged so I went back inside to get the first thing I could get my hands on to throw at him, which turned out to be the refrigerator. I unplugged it, pushed it out onto the balcony and heaved it over the side. It plummeted 25 stories and crushed him !

The excitement of the moment was so great that I had a heart attack and died almost instantly.""

The angel sat back and thought for a moment.

Technically, the guy DID have a bad day. So he announced, ""OK, sir, welcome to the kingdom of heaven,"" and let him in. A few seconds later the next guy came up. ""OK, here's the rule. Before I can let you in, I need to hear about the day you died.""

""Sure thing,"" the next man replied. ""But you're not going to believe this. I was out on the balcony of my 26th floor apartment doing my daily exercises when I got a little carried away and accidentally fell over the side! Luckily I was able to catch myself by my fingertips on the balcony directly beneath mine, when, all of a sudden, this crazy man came running out of his apartment and started cussing and stomping on my fingers! Well, of course I fell. I hit some trees and bushes on the way down which broke my fall so I didn't die right away. As I lay there face up on the ground, unable to move and in excruciating pain, I saw the man push his refrigerator, of all things, over the ledge and it fell directly on top of me and killed me ! ""

The angel is quietly laughing to himself as the man finishes his story. ""Very well, "" he announces. ""Welcome to the kingdom of heaven, "" and lets the man enter.

“YOU STUPID REDNECK!” shouted the lawyer, looking with contempt at the redneck in his dirty overalls.

“Now how am I gonna get outa this?” though the redneck to himself. Then he had an idea…

After looking over the impressive, impeccably dressed and dignified city lawyer in his $2,000 navy blue pinstriped suit, carefully knotted red silk tie, starched white shirt, silver cufflinks and black dress shoes polished like mirrors, $1,000 briefcase and hundred dollar haircut, the redneck walked back to his car, got out a bottle, and brought it back.

He handed it to the hotshot and said, “Here, you look pretty shook up. I think you ought to take a nip of this. It’ll steady your nerves….IT’S HOMEMADE…”

The lawyer did, but was so angry about the wreck, he refused to speak. The redneck then said, “You still look a little bit pale. How about another?” And the smug, pompous lawyer took another swallow. After a few minutes, he began to feel the heat of the sun through his wool suit.

Then the redneck said “It’s mighty hot today. Folks ’round here don’t usually wear shoes on a day like those. Why don’t you take off them fancy shoes, and the socks, too?”

The lawyer frowned: “Take off my shoes and socks? Do I LOOK like someone who would walk around barefoot? That’s fine for hicks, but not for a professional like ME! These are $500 shoes!”

But after a few more sips, the redneck asked him again, and then again, and then again, and finally the lawyer, feeling the white lightnin’, let out a laugh and took off his polished shoes and socks.
The redneck picked up the polished shoes and smiled. “Might fancy shoes you got here, boy!” Then the redneck said: “Why don’t you take off that fancy necktie?”

The lawyer said: “My tie!”, but in a minute, the silk tie was dropped on top of the shoes and the socks.

The redneck grinned and held up an extra pair of overalls he found in his pickup. “And that fancy business suit? You look kind of funny standing there barefoot in a suit on a 100 degree day! You can wear these while we figger out what to do about this situation! Just strip that suit off…”

The lawyer tried to give him an arrogant look, but he was feeling the heat of the sun and the liquor. He tried to resist, but…

Off came the jacket of the $2,000 pinstriped suit. Then the starched white shirt and the cufflinks. Finally, the trousers, too, and the lawyer pulled on the overalls.

“Now ain’t that more comfortable?!” said the redneck.

At the urging of the redneck, the lawyer then took another sip, and another, and another.

The suspenders and the cufflinks and the briefcase were all in a heap now, and the lawyer was having a hard time standing up. After another half hour, the lawyer said he was feeling pretty good, and asked the redneck if he didn’t think that he ought to have a little nip, too. Then he realized he couldn’t find the redneck…

“Not me”, the redneck replied, stepping out from behind a tree. The lawyer stared at him in shock, but was now so drunk he couldn’t stand up. The redneck was wearing the lawyer’s suit, shirt and tie, his feet were in the lawyer’s shoes and socks; he was holding his briefcase, shaving with a razor he found in the briefcase and holding the keys to his BMW.

The lawyer mumbled “You look like me! What…. Why… Give me my clothes back! Take off my shoes! My car…What are you….”

But he was so drunk he couldn’t move.

Then he reached over and pulled the Rolex off the lawyer’s wrist and as a final touch, rubbed some dirt into the lawyer’s manicured hands and expensive haircut.

He looked at the formerly well-dressed and dignified lawyer, sitting in the dirt, barefoot in overalls and drunk as a skunk and looking like a true redneck, “I’m waiting for the state trooper.”…",The Lawyer and the Redneck,17

The only survivor was a beautiful young woman, the most beautiful woman the man had ever seen. She was badly injured when they rescued her, and they slowly nursed her back to health. When the young maiden was well enough, they introduced her to their evening beach ritual. It was another beautiful evening: red sky, cirrus clouds, a warm and gentle breeze-perfect for a night of romance.

MoralLesson,6,76,1qvop2,165,"There was this male engineer, on a cruise ship in the Caribbean for the first time. It was wonderful, the experience of his life. He was being waited on hand and foot. But, it did not last. A Hurricane came up unexpectedly. The ship went down almost instantly.

The man found himself, he knew not how, swept up on the shore of an island. There was nothing else anywhere to be seen. No people, no supplies, nothing. The man looked around. There were some bananas and coconuts, but that was it. He was desperate, and forlorn, but decided to make the best of it. So for the next four months he ate bananas, drank coconut juice and mostly looked to the sea mightily for a ship to come to his rescue.

One day, as he was lying on the beach stroking his beard and looking for a ship, he spotted movement out of the corner of his eye. Could it be true, was it a ship? No, from around the corner of the island came this row-boat. In it was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen, or at least seen in 4 months. She was tall, tanned, and her blond hair flowing in the sea breeze gave her an almost ethereal quality. She spotted him also as he was waving and yelling and screaming to get her attention. 

She rowed her boat towards him. In disbelief, he asked, ""Where did you come from? How did you get here?"" 

She said, ""I rowed from the other side of the island. I landed on this island when my cruise ship sank."" 

""Amazing"", he said, ""I didn't know anyone else had survived. How many of you are there? Where did you get the row-boat? You must have been really lucky to have a row-boat wash-up with you?"" 

""It is only me"", she said, ""and the row-boat didn't wash up, nothing else did.""

""Well then"", said the man, ""how did you get the row-boat?"" 

""I made the row-boat out of raw material that I found on the island"", replied the woman. ""The oars were whittled from Gum tree branches, I wove the bottom from Palm branches, and the sides and stern came from a Eucalyptus tree""

""But, but,"" asked the man, ""what about tools and hardware, how did you do that?""

""Oh, no problem"", replied the woman, ""on the south side of the island there is a very unusual strata of alluvial rock exposed. I found that If I fired it to a certain temperature in my kiln, it melted into forgeable ductile iron. I used that for tools, and used the tools to make the hardware. But, enough of that,"" she continued. ""Where do you live?"" At last the man was forced to confess that he had been sleeping on the beach. 

""Well, let's row over to my place"", she said. So they both got into the row-boat and left for her side of island. The woman easily rowed them around to a wharf that led to the approach to her place. She tied up the row-boat with a beautifully woven hemp rope. They walked up a stone walk and around a Palm tree, there stood an exquisite bungalow painted in blue and white.

""It's not much"", she said, ""but I call it home. Sit down please, would you like to have a drink?"" 

""No"", said the man, ""one more coconut juice and I will puke.""

""It won't be coconut juice"", the woman replied, ""I have a still, how about a Pina Colada?"" Trying to hide his continued amazement, the man accepted, and they sat down on her couch to talk. After a while, when they had exchanged their stories, the woman asked, ""Tell me, have you always had a beard?"" 

""No"", the man replied, ""I was clean shaven all of my life, and even on the cruise ship.""

""Well if you would like to shave, there is a man's razor upstairs in the cabinet in the bathroom."" So, the man, no longer questioning anything, went upstairs to the bathroom. There in the cabinet was a razor made from a bone handle, two shells honed to a hollow ground edge were fastened on to its end inside of a swivel mechanism. The man shaved, showered and went back down stairs.

""You look great"", said the woman, ""I think I will go up and slip into something more comfortable."" So she did. And, the man continued to sip his Pina Colada. After a short time, the woman returned - this time wearing fig leafs strategically positioned and smelling faintly of gardenia.
