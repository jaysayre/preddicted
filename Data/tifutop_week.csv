obvithrowaway11,353,,1083,1rcixz,,1529,"So, my friend and I (both college roommates since Freshmen year and we are very open with each other) decided to take a trip up to New York City this weekend. We had planned this trip for a while to go see some friends, go to clubs, get drunk, etc. 

So, last night, we go out to a club and start hanging out with some girls. My friend, this entire time, has been telling me about how he has been holding off from choking the chicken so he could get with a girl. Well, it never happens.

Back at the hotel, we're both decently drunk. Now realize that we only got one bed to share because we were going to spend the extra money. We're both in just boxers and we fall asleep.

I just woke up about 10 minutes ago. My friend is practically spooning me, which is whatever (but it actually woke me up). I feel this weird sensation around my abdomen and balls. So, I'm feeling around, itching a scratch (readjusting) and all of a sudden I feel this slimy substance.

""Oh shit!"" So, I pulled back the blanket to find him with no boxers and both of us are covered in his cum.

What do I do? He's still sleeping!

**TL;DR: Friend and I shared a bed. Friend had a wet dream all over both of us...FUCK!**

TIFUpdate: Friend woke up completely mortified and confused. By this time, I had gotten out of the shower. I explained what happened. We both laughed it off, no homo. He says he owes me big time.

CenturiesChild,127,,438,1rfmey,,1277,"For some completely bizarre reason, I decided to down three cups of coffee and eat a Mcdonalds for my breakfast when I had a dodgy stomach. Afterwards, I felt like going for a walk by a lake up in the fells, so I took my iPod and went. After walking for around an hour, and finding myself in complete isolation, remarkably under-dressed and freezing cold - my stomach started groaning. I panicked. I could feel the turtle head slowly slide out and I was too far from the car, so I decided to run into the forest and take a nature shit. Then it all went to hell. I was sprinting full on 60mph and sweating like a bastard, my foot caught a rock and I flipped over - released my shit in mid air - and landed with a crushing blow directly on my anus, squashing everything. I felt like crying and the smell was horrendous. I got up, gagging at myself, and hobbled off to the car. When I was almost there, a family group of hikers asked me for directions - I had to talk to them, but unfortunately they were the kind of people that come really close up to you when they talk. This added a whole new level of terror, I had to tell a family of hikers which direction the lake was in, all the while red faced, watery eyed and covered in my own shit. I am convinced they smelled me, because the womans face went bright red which made mine go even redder. I got in the car, and drove home in the throes of a psychological breakdown.

Futurames,162,,526,1r2jqb,,1255,"Just a short bit of context. Where I work, we have uniform shirts and I wear mine over another plain t-shirt. Every day when I leave I go to my locker, take off my toolbelt and work shirt and go home, pretty much in that order. 

Well today for some reason, I decided to take off my work shirt before reaching my locker. Then, out of habit, once I reached my locker, my brain demanded that clothing be removed. So, I proceed to take off my regular shirt and am standing there in my bra for a good three and a half seconds before I felt a breeze and realized what I had done. 

This all happened in front of my entire group of male coworkers as well as a bunch of customers. Keep in mind that this is a hardware store so the customer base is largely men. I don't think they all processed exactly what they had just seen.

DontJustStare,358,,375,1r5y5m,,781,"Usually, I don't eat breakfast, but that didn't matter because my crush was working at the cafe this morning rather than tonight, so that meant I was going to buy breakfast. *(Don't ask how I knew he had a morning shift this morning. I'm not a stalker; I'm just ..observant and resourceful.)*

Before I left I was sure to apply a little foundation and mascara; probably the amount of makeup a normal girl would wear. Usually, I don't bother as I am not the spend-forever-getting-ready kinda girl. Although he has always been friendly and nice, he has never done anything to give me the impression that he was interested, yet I always make the effort to look nice whenever I know I will be going to the cafe. (I know, kinda pathetic) 

Business was slow--probably because it had just opened and normal people aren't up so early, so it was basically just us two and his other coworker. I have liked this guy for the longest and we have hardly spoken other than about the food and other short chats, nothing personal, but this morning that finally changed. He initiated a conversation, and we wound up talking for a bit, including plans for this weekend. I was beginning to think he was going to actually ask me out! But then business started to pick up. He asked for my number, so we could talk more later. I played it cool on the outside, but on the inside I was doing a [dance](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lu6b99ng2s1qew6kmo1_500.gif) . 

So, I reach for my bag to get a pen and paper to give him my number since he didn't have his phone on him. Being a little too eager and naturally clumsy, I knocked over my book bag, causing some of the items to fall out. **FUCK ME** Guess what pops out... My fucking dildo.

What can I say? I am a horny girl and it's been 6 months, hence my thirstiness for this guy. I had spent the previous two nights away from home, and I had to rush to pack this morning because I took so long to get ready and prettify myself. In haste, I stuffed whatever I could in the other bags and just so happened to place Sparky in the bag I carry around with the intention of removing it once I got home. 

My eye balls nearly pop out of the sockets in disbelief, and I hurried up and shoved it back in the bag as if that would make him unsee it. I knew it was too late; he undoubtedly saw my 8inch faux cock. *fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck*. 

I expected him to say he had to hurry and get back to work and try to get out of the situation, so I tried to make it less awkward by just telling him, ""Sorry, I don't have any paper. Maybe next time,"" I said in a nervous voice and got out of there. I don't think the situation could have been any more awkward. I just didn't know what to say. My face was down, avoiding eye-contact out of embarrassment most of that time, so I'm not entirely sure how he reacted, but he was probably thinking *WTF, I knew this bitch was weird, but damn*.

I am always cock-blocking myself by being a werido. Well, looks like it's just me and sparky tonight. :( *Forever alone*. 

**TL;DR: My crush for the longest finally gave me the chance to get the D and I cock-blocked myself by dropping my dildo.**


**EDIT:** A couple of points I want to clarify as it seems I was not clear. I do not carry this dildo around on a daily basis. I had brought it with me while I was away from home in a couple of nights. I was rushing to make it to the cafe as well as check out by a certain time, so I just threw my things in my bags. 

*(Sidenote: I clean my dildo before and after each use to prevent UTIs so even if I was carrying it around &amp; ret-ta-go at any time, it would not put me at any risk)*

Also, the cafe he works at is not Starbucks. I took the photo of inside my book bag (listed in a comment below) later that day in Starbucks to *prove* I was not making this up.

Lastly, the dildo came fully out, so it's not like there is a chance he could not have seen it. After it came out, I pretty much avoided eye contact or looking at him at all, so I don't know what he was thinking. 

Now that I have read each comment, it seems like nearly every person is saying the same thing, which is that he doesn't think I'm a weird freak. There is a chance that I may have been over-thinking this situation with my typical skewed, negative perspective. Perhaps, in a few days, I will revisit the cafe without bringing it up and give him my number (I liked this idea more than apologizing as it avoids making it more awkward IMO). I am just terrified of rejection, so I don't know if I will or not. If I do, I will definitely update!

**Update:** It's been a few days, so I don't know if anyone will see this, but in case anyone does, here is an update. 

I went back to the cafe tonight, and he was there (which I figured as he usually works late Sunday nights). However, I didn't give him my number. I was prepared to write my number down on the receipt, so I didn't make it obvious how planned it was by already having it written down...but I chickened out. He just acted so normal, and I didn't know how to bring it up. ""Oh so, did you still want my number?"" I'd sound like a total loser. I started over-thinking it. I didn't even stay and eat what I ordered; I got it to go. I probably won't go back either. I mainly went there to steal glances at him. Oh well. . .

SexxSyrup,206,,250,1rhoin,,713,"**Context:** Happened last week. I teach English abroad and this had been a topic of conversation in a hostel dorm room for several people.

I checked into a hostel, got up to my dorm, and quickly introduced to myself to the other 2 people in the room, lets call them Mary and Sue. Mary was a nice girl from Germany who got to chatting with me. I said hello to Sue, but she pretended not to hear me.

*fast forward*

I start noticing some strange things about Sue: She lit a candle and blew it out again and again. When we finally fall asleep, she starts having night terrors, screaming things like ""DON'T TOUCH ME, GET AWAY FROM ME, NO NO NO,!"" The next morning, Mary tells me that Sue had been crying the whole day before. I start to think she had gone through some abuse recently.

*fast forward*

We're all in the room, she starts to cry again, and I asked, ""Are you okay?"" with no response. I said it again, and oh boy did I make a mistake. She went into this rant about how all English teachers do is rape their children, rape their students, rob their host countries, and neglect to learn the culture or language. She continued to say that if I would like to speak to her, I should speak to her in her native tongue, Finnish (ignoring the irony of conveying this message in perfect English). I was told to stop bullying her, that I denied her the right to lay in her bed, that I couldn't possibly have anything valuable to retort because I'm English (I'm American).

ImAnAsshole12345,128,,91,1r7wkc,,245,"I love my wife more than anything and we have been together for 6 years. We've had our tough times, but they have been very few. 

I've had 4-5 female friends for almost 10-11 years and one since high school. With two, there were romantic feelings when we started talking, but that fizzled out and now it's just casual friendship (ie, how's your mom, the kids, etc). Off and on throughout the years we'd keep in contact via text just to see what's happening in each other's lives. Marriages, kids, buying houses, etc., when something big or a birthday came around a text would be sent off, catch up for a bit, and then back to no word for a year or more. 

When my mom died earlier this year there were two of these friends who were very supportive and I've kept up with them more and more, culminating in exchanging about 700 texts last month during the worst of my so far grief based depression. At this point I haven't been able to seek therapy because of my schedule, but once the semester is over that will happen. Nothing sexual is desired from either one of these friends; both are happily married with kids. In fact the last conversations were about classes, banana bread, and Thanksgiving plans. 

The part where I fucked up is that I never knew how my wife would take me having these female friends (who I haven't seen in over 10 years), so I never told her about them. All the conversations have been unknown to her until yesterday when she noticed a high number of texts on the bill and found the history.

Maleus21,17,,34,1r1h9k,,154,"This actually happened a while back, but I just found this sub, and since all of my friends love this story, I might as well share it with everyone here.

So a while back, my friend and I worked together on 2nd shift. We normally got off work around 10pm, and it was customary for us to stay up late after work, since we didn't need to be in until late afternoon. So this day, my friend asks me to help him get a weight bench he is getting off of craigslist after work. I didn't have anything else going on, so I gladly offered a helping hand. 

The house we were going to was around 45 minutes away, so while getting gas before heading that way, I went in the gas station and picked up a king size Reeses cup and a large Red Bull to give me some energy after work. This was to be my undoing, because little did I know at that time, I am severely lactose intolerant (I never put 2 and 2 together, and didn't have insurance at the time, so I just thought I had stomach issues). 

So on the way there, we are just idly talking, I finish my 4 peanut butter cups and don't think a thing about them. About 15 minutes later, I feel a slight rumble in my stomach, since stomach problems are normal for me at this time, I pass it off, because I know Ill be home within a couple of hours. About 15 minutes later, the rumbling is more intense, and realize that my friends bathroom will probably receive the brunt of my soon to be coming anal assault. A little while later, we are in the person's neighborhood, and I'm starting to think that a gas station on the way home is inevitable. 

Finally we get to dude's house. He is a nice guy, weight bench is in his garage, but unfortunately it is fully assembled (it is one of those huge all in one machines). Well I haven't told my friend about my stomach, and he and the seller are finalizing the deal, then begin talking about how we are going to secure it in the back of my truck. At this point, I am almost in a cold sweat, my ass cheeks are so clenched so tight, you couldn't fit a needle between them. 

We have now finished loading the weight bench, I am giving myself pep talks and saying a prayer for every step I am taking. I do not want to ask a complete stranger whom we just met off of craigslist to use his bathroom obviously, but things are getting bad. That's when it happens... We are exchanging pleasantries, saying thank yous, and about to get in the truck. I am scouring my brain trying to think of the nearest gas station that I saw on the way there, and decide to let a tini-tiny little bitty poot out just to relieve some of the pressure, as my insides feel as though I am about to explode. Well ladies and gents, when you are in that condition, never ever trust a fart.

It broke the ass seal that my cheeks had welded together, and out comes a torrential down-pour of shit. I could feel it coming, I did my best to squeeze my ass together as tight as I could, which ended up resulting in ass cramps along with the spasms of my intestines wanting so desperately to empty, going against every ounce of my soul trying to stop it. The result was excruciating pain, which resulted me kneeling down, screaming in agony. 

Keep in mind, I had not let on to either of these guys that my stomach was even remotely upset, and I'm sure the sweating was mascaraed by the fact that this was taking place during the summer. So to them, it looked as if I just became possessed and began screaming. So now I am kneeling on the ground, my underwear filled up like a babies diaper, my friend is freaking out,  and the guy from craigslist is no doubt regretting every second of this transaction by now.

I slowly stood up, gathered what I could of myself, and kindly asked the seller if I could use his bathroom. His response was simply ""Umm sure dude, in and to the right, last door on the left"". I slowly walked in the house, praying that no small shit nuggets fell out onto their carpet on my way there. After I got in the bathroom, I took a look at the damage, it was irreparable. Now I had to make a decision, walk outside holding underwear, leave a pair of shit pants in his garbage, or option 3. I emptied as much as I could into the toilet, took out my pocket knife, and cut the massive shit stain out of my underwear. This was obviously was a much smaller piece of cloth, which allowed me to wrap it up in a massive amount of toilet paper and stick it in my pocket. I then cleaned my ass as much as possible (I didn't want to shower in his house also, I was already mortified). Put my holy boxers back on, walked outside, went straight to my truck thanking him as I walked by, got in and immediately drove off. Down the street I threw the shit wad out of the window, and began explaining the story to my now laughing so hard he cant breathe friend. 

I asked my friend if the guy had said anything when I went in his house. His reply to my friend ""Its just a hunch, but I think your friend needs to shit"".

This actually occurred a little under two years ago but anyway.

Every year during the long summer holidays my family have a tradition of heading up to go camping on the East coast of the North Island (NZ). The spot where we go is seriously a fairy tale place: a huge bay with golden sweeping sands, constant sunshine, warm water, big waves, few people, reefs to explore, you get the idea. This year I happened to know that there was a girl there I'd met the previous year who was quite into me. As you can imagine, I'm well keen. The morning after we arrive, virtually as soon as I get up, she bounds over and says she's taking me for my first swim, right now. I'm all about it so we head out into the blue to get wet (me hoping other things may get wet later on). I dive into the water and that's where things begin to take a turn for the unexpected.

As soon as I come up I realise the left side of my face is numb and I can't speak. 

Yep, you guessed it. Brain hemorrhage. 

Ended up spending two weeks in hospital, three months off school and two years later I still can't attend school 5 days a week because I get too tired. I haven't had any luck with the ladies since then either, may or may not be related.

N_skrilla,54,,40,1r5npr,,116,"So around this time of year at the organic garden I work at, all of the hottest peppers we've been growing from early in the year have finished ripening, and are ready to be processed. My job in this is to take the dried habaneros and use a small device to grind them into pepper flakes.

Now anyone thats ever eaten a habanero knows that they are one spicy motherfucker of a pepper. Like 100 times more potent than a jalapeno. And to top it off, if you touch one of them with your bare hands, it'll burn like a motherfucker for about an hour.

So as I was making the emptying the flakes into a container, some of the residual powder left over spilled onto the leg of my pants. I thought nothing of it at the time, and just figured I'd wash my pants after I got done with my shift in a few hours.

Well once those few hours had passed, I had totally forgotten about the seemingly minor incident. When I got home and got ready to take a shower, I must have thrown my underwear on top of my pants; right where the habanero powder had set in. After I got out of the shower and put them back on, it took about 5 minutes after for me to realize how badly I fucked up.

The burning set in, as well as the panic. It started off as a dull burning which was uncomfortable but bearable, but just kept elevating for a solid 15 minutes. To give you a good idea of how this felt, just imagine the spiciest thing you've ever eaten in your life, the try to imagine that burning sensation of your gens. Hell, even the ""icy hot to the balls"" challenge didn't hold a candle to this. I immediately ran to the bathroom to try to wash the stuff off, but once it sets in you just have to ride it out. The burning went on for a solid hour before it decided to die down, and all the while I was sweating like hell and trying not to vomit from the shear pain of the whole ordeal.

I have long since abandoned it for more appropriate battery operated devices. I cleaned it up and hid it in the back of a closet. Today I came home from campus and found my younger, autistic brother playing with the bat. He was holding it and stroking the wood and my heart stopped.

I was mortified and tried to ignore that this embarrassing childhood pleasure had resurfaced. But I wasn't gonna let this get to me. It was the end of a long day of school and work and I just wanted to have dinner and relax. Dinner had been eaten without me, so I whip it out of the fridge and into the microwave. Nothing, not even my pleasure bat, was going to keep me from relaxing. What was the worse that could happen? 

My brother obliged Murphy's law. He starts tapping it on the table to a beat set by a rhythmically challenged drummer. This interrupted my mom's favorite show, The Voice. Like one domino toppling another, my mom not enjoying her show upset my dad, who tries his best to afford her those few moments she can enjoy herself (the challenges of having an autistic child).

I'm not sure if he was actually being mindful of his limitations or if he was coming up on needing more medication, but he decides he's not going to leave the couch. 

He calls me over from the dinning room, where I'm still trying to eat, and ask me to hide the bat in his room. I put on my poker face and take the bat. I stride with as much nonchalance as can be mustered, and hide the bat under my parent's bed.

So here I am, trying to keep my composure with my retired dildo bat hidden in my dad's room and it's location not hidden very well from my autistic brother. Needless to say, I no longer have an interest in finishing my dinner. ",TIFU when my autistic brother played with my old masterbation bat.,117,tifu
FreshmanLuck,37,,37,1rbx28,,67,"This is my first semester attending college, which I'm really enjoying so far, with the exception of today's events. Aside from the general ed. stuff, I'm also taking a couple computer science classes which meet in the computer lab. Since the lab is open for students to use before and after classes, it can sometimes be difficult to find a vacant computer until right before a class begins.

Because I tend to be pretty shy I prefer to take the far corner computer which is least visible to the entire room. Since the semester started, I noticed that the same guy, whom I shall refer to as ""The Brony"", is often sitting at my computer right before the class. I call him The Brony because he has a couple different sweatshirts which he alternates and one of them has the rainbow pony character (sorry, I don't watch the show) on it. I've never really talked to him, and he's not in any of my classes. He looks to be in his late twenties or so, about a decade older than most of the other people I see around, even though I sometimes see him in the cafeteria sitting with his much younger looking friends.

One thing I hate about sharing computers is the hygienic aspect. I don't want to seem rude but this guy just never seems clean. Every time I see him at my computer he's sitting there with his thinning, greasy, stringy, untrimmed hair which just sort of hangs over his sweaty forehead and over his thick lens glasses [(which make his eyes appear to bulge out)](http://images.halloweencostumes.com/products/15274/1-1/bug-eye-specs.jpg). He also seems to wear the same clothes many days in a row. Our class meets three times a week and a few weeks I've seen him in the same nasty sweatshirt and sweatpants combo (which begins to accumulate food particles and other debris) all three days. The worst thing is that after he gets up, the chair still smells (like shit), and I'm not sure if it's because he's a bigger dude or because he's not cleaning himself properly. I don't want to know honestly. So I just switch the chair with the next one over, and then switch them again after class to make sure I'm not sitting on his chair.

Today I arrived to a packed computer lab as usual, so I went outside and sat down on some benches between that room and another classroom while I waited until I could get my usual computer back from The Brony. About 5 minutes later, I saw him walk out and proceed to grab the front of his pants to ""adjust"" himself, as though he were in his own private bedroom and not walking down a campus hallway. At the time I didn't think too much of it (except that it's pretty gross to do so in public view), so I grabbed my backpack and went to sit down at my usual spot. After switching the chair, I sat down and logged in with the keyboard. When I finally grabbed the mouse for the first time, I felt something unusual, a moistness along the sides of the mouse. I looked at the mouse and it kind of glistened (though under the florescent lights it was hard to tell). I wasn't sure if it was some kind of sweat or something else, so (stupidly) I slowly brought my fingers to my face and gave them a sniff. I nearly gagged at the unmistakable bleachy stench of semen.

I immediately got up, and walked to the nearest restroom holding my right hand out in front of me like some kind of deformed zombie, all the while mentally trying to remain calm. I stood in front of the sink for about 10 minutes just lathering my hands with soap, and rinsing them, over and over until I finally calmed down. After I dried them they were redder than I've ever seen them, but I finally felt somewhat clean. By the time I got back to class the instructor had begun talking and for the first time in my college life, I had to walk in late.

I didn't sit at my usual computer; I will never sit there again! But I did want to confirm that I wasn't imagining things, so after class I went back to the corner computer, took a plastic bag, placed it over the mouse, and opened the browser history to see if there was anything there. Seemingly endless items from Rule 34, and some furry website called e621.

**TL;DR: Some fat fuck Brony was using our computer lab to jerk himself off to furry porn, leaving cum on the mouse.**

NiceRideMan,4,,11,1r79fs,,59,"Preface: I live in a semi-detached house, so we share our driveway with our neighbors. There's enough room in the driveway for a total of 4 cars. They're a rather sizeable family, so they have 3 cars and pack them all into the driveway. We never did mind because we only have 2 cars, and if they park the 3rd car a little on their lawn and partially in the driveway, we can fit 5 cars. Although I didn't mind, I still found it annoying at times since it was a tight fit leaving me less room to maneuver.

The neighbors are a really nice Muslim family. Most of the reason I didn't mind them squashing 3 cars into the driveway was because they did things for us frequently. Here in Ontario, it snows a lot sometimes. If they saw that our driveway hadn't been cleaned, they'd do it for us a lot of the time. And they'd bring over leftover food from feasts, and it was so fucking good. So over those 10 years, I never said anything about their 3 cars.

Preface over, here's what happened. A couple of days ago I was at university, and my mom texted me saying the neighbor had passed away. Keep in mind this was a large family. There was an 80 year old with his wife, 2 of their kids (Both mid-30s, who had wives and kids of their own.) 10 people total. The 80 year old man passed away because his kidney failed.

When I arrived home that day, one of the deceased man's sons was in the driveway. I walked on over to him and expressed my condolences. OUT OF FUCKING NO WHERE, and I mean in no way did I mean to say this but for whatever reason did, I proceeded to say ""Haha, guess you won't need that [third] car anymore."" Probably something subconscious. Fucking Freudian slip. Needless to say, I felt terribly awkward and just ""Oh man dinner is ready'd"" away.",TIFU my opening my mouth,70,tifu
suppermick,18,,10,1rgvds,,59,"So my good friend is having a small get together at a directors house for her birthday. For context she just turned 21 and this is a director from a theater she interned at, so he's around 40. Super nice house. I agreed to be her DD so she could have her fun. I'm sipping on my only beer, completely sober, and just shooting the shit with everyone. I'm leaning in the doorway, stand up to readjust my weight, and go to lean back on the doorway. 

Except I lean on a top heavy shelf that's completely unsecured.....

The whole shelf starts to tip over. Luckily I had quick reflexes and was able to catch the shelf before it fell over completely, but it wasn't fast enough to keep ALL of his fancy martini glasses and fancy alcohol bottles from sliding off and shattering on the floor (including a random plant). The room falls into dead silence. Everybody stares at the dirt and glass on the floor and nobody knows what to do. Finally somebody gains control and starts cleaning everything up. The director is dead quiet, goes into the other room, and yells ""my GRANDMOTHER gave me those glasses!"" I'm absolutely horrified. I help clean everything up and offer to pay for whatever needs to be replaced. 

I sit down on the couch, mortified. I really want to bail the fuck out and come back later. However I was the birthday girls only ride and she wasn't ready to leave yet. She walks over to the director and gives him a hug, and I hear the tears in his voice. Muffled sobs into the girls shoulder is the only audible noise in the whole house. I stare at the only other person who had just arrived in time for my catastrophe and she gives me a ""don't worry we all fuck up"" look. The birthday girl then decides she wants to watch two fucking episodes of Dr. Who, and all the while the director is in his room, most likely crying, and doesn't come out for the rest of the night. 

When I finally get to leave and drive this girl home, he comes out, shakes my hand, and says ""Thanks for coming""

a_burning_throwaway,12,,11,1r658d,,55,"I work in a research lab, en route to getting my master's degree. It's a biochemical lab, so there's not too much that's very dangerous, and overall it's a pretty relaxed place to work. Despite official policy pretty much nobody wears lab coats or goggles, shorts abound in the summer, and gloves are mainly to keep from contaminating your sample rather than protecting your hands. It can be easy in this environment to sort of forget that safety is still important sometimes. 

Yesterday I got to the lab at 8:30 am and was there until about 8 pm, having had a lot of work to finish up. Most of my days that run that long include a lot of downtime, but on this occasion I was actually doing work for most of it. Tedious, monotonous, soul-crushing work, involving repeated treatments with a base, that left me exhausted and brain-dead at the end of the day.

I leave the lab and breathe a sigh of relief, and take a much-needed urination break before heading home. I enter the washroom, zip down, and grab my donger, as is man's sacred right. Suddenly, I feel a sort of itch. I ignore it and continue as I was, but before long the itch intensifies. And then it transforms into a burning. The burning is gentle at first; it does not remain so. Soon it feels as though a scornful fire elemental is attempting to blow me and I am trying very hard to stay still so as not to piss all over myself, despite the fiery waves of pain that now crash upon my pubic shore.

When it becomes too much to bear, I am thankfully nearly done but still manage to splatter some on my pants as I am forced to let go, doubling over with my pants half-down before I finally recover somewhat from the pain. The supernova heat has die down to a much calmer, smaller nova, and I force the thing back into my pants.

I evidently forgot to wash my hands after working with the base all day. It wasn't that concentrated, so it didn't hurt my hands or anything like that, but as soon as I touched my sensitive wang-flesh it made its wretched presence known. Looking at it once I got home, my dangler was redder than that of the devil himself and covered in delightful blisters. It still hurts like a bitch.

So story is me and my brother are trying for green cards/permanent residencies only my brother didn't come to the US on time so the day earlier, he gets kicked off the flight and is stuck in our home country and is summoned to a court hearing months later.

We look similar and our names are the same EXCEPT for my middle name which is customary (and I use this middle name) and I applied/got the job using this middle name (it didn't matter at the time - every other record was using this middle name except for my foreign passport). One week later after my brother got into this trouble (I didn't know at all about what happened), two guys in suits come up to my cubicle, and ask me my full name - I say yeah, that's me but I go by ""MIDDLE NAME"". Can you come with us please? My boss asks what the hell is going on and the immigration guys tell him I am illegally staying in the US and I will face jail time for using a fake identification. 

I went out kicking and screaming and was stuck in jail for one day until my friend comes by with another friend (lawyer) to sort out the mess. I get released with apologies. BUT that's not the bad part.

So I come back to work and get told that I am fired.

""Overall, you lost the firm two million. Possibly more. I want you back. F***, the entire department wants you back.

I hope we can get drinks again. I'm sorry. Good luck."" I get served a termination letter the following day.

Actually_bi_not_gay,8,,17,1rd8lf,,40,"I had lunch with my mom/dad/grandma just to catch up.  I haven't really had the time to talk with them since I started my professional career.  Lunch went great,  but when I was driving them home,  I decided to stop by a grocer's first to pick up some milk. 

Some of my Ipod is classic rock songs,  which my family members like,  so instead of listening to my radio,  I just played them my Ipod.  

As I said in the title,  my family members are really religious.  They're Hispanic immigrants, they have a picture of the Virgin Mary in every room of the house,  and when they went to school their teachers were nuns,  and priests.  Needless to say they also agree with most of the Catholic church's policies. 

Well,  a few months ago I put a Redditor made song on my Ipod,  the song contained lyrics like ""I always think of guys when I beat my meat"" ,  ""Here's a list of things we like the most, cocks (dicks),  penis (pricks),  anything that's really thick!"",  ""Go to the movie just for Brad Pitt,  mad boners so my jeans don't fit"", ""I'm gay with every boy I see, don't care if they shower,  dirty, or clean"", ""it aint' wrong that I like to touch,  24/7 ain't that much"", and ""one day I saw my daddy in the shower, so I chocked my chicken for half an hour""

It seems that I forgot to delete the song from my Ipod,  and out of all the songs I have on there,  that's the song that played when I quickly went into the store to get some milk.

So only half the people in the spa had their jets working. When one occupant left, this 70 something year old man signalled me to come sit next to him, where the other person had just got up from. The old guy, I'll call him Peter, was a bit familiar. I had seen him at the spa a few times before. I started chatting with Peter. He was rather funny. He kept commenting on the women who were entering the spa. It was funny to me considering his age. We also spoke about other things such as my wife, his wife, his kids etc.
During the chats, when Peter was making and a joke...he would pinch me in the abdominal area. It was a bit strange but just thought, whatever, its probably just a greek gesture etc (Where Im from, we kinda clap hands whilst laughing). This goes on for about 4-5 times. When I told him i was leaving, he asked me to stay for another 5 mins. In my mind, I thought perhaps he is just a lonely man who just wants to chat. I stayed for another 5 and left. 
In the changing room, i realised someone had pinched my tshirt. Was frantically looking for it when peter walked in. He got dressed whilst I doing rounds looking for my shirt. He even assisted me by taking me to the ""lost/found"" area. I decided to just ride my bike topless and gave up looking for the shirt.  As peter was leaving too, we walked out of the complex together. As i went to my bike, Peter asked if i would like to go for a drive. I agreed and really thought that perhaps this guy has something to get off his chest or is depressed etc. Also thought wont hurt to listen to a guys issues/cries for help etc. So i got into his car and he drove to the other side of the car park. He then began talking about porn movies and i was laughing all the while. It was seriously funny that a guy his age was talking about shit like that. he then asked me why all african guys have big dicks. Now, nothing weird here....as we get this question countless times once we venture into those types of conversations. Peter then asked me if i had a big dick. Again, i laughed this off and just kinda said ...normal type. Peter then puts his hand on the back of my neck and my mind started racing. I just thought, well, if i move or reach for my shoelace, he will let go. So i did that and he let go. He then asks me if i had ever had sex with a man. At this point, i was now feeling fucking awkward and now had suspicions. So i categorically/vehemently said no and that I would never do that as I am not that way. He then reached out and pinched my nipple!  At this point I told him i had to leave. He asked if I was sure that i wanted to leave. So I left.

Thing is, I felt dirty when this guy did this. I was actually innocently thinking i'm just chatting with this guy, whilst he obviously had other intentions. I also, through this experience, know what it feels like for the waitresses who have sexual innuendo left right and centre just because they smiled at a male customer etc.

Its taken me a few days to get over this. Im certain he thinks I am playing hard to get as I did not exactly say NO to his advances (I realised it too late).

He pays the escort a few bucks—kinda just gives him a handful. I get up and he takes his time squeezing by. He’s a big big guy, wrap around Gucci shades. He gets settled, mumbling about Grimace, the big purple autistic guy from McDonalds. “You don’t know who Grimace is?” I don’t know how to respond so I give a half chuckle, then realize that he’s on his Bluetooth. He mumbles into in until the moment the plane is airborne. He’s taking up some of my seat, but I don’t say anything. No sense confronting him about something out of his control (in the short run, arguably).  I can hear his music through his Beats By Dre. Fine. I’m washed and pretty drunk so I fall asleep within minutes of take off. 

I wake up after a couple hours. The guy sitting next to me is on his laptop—looks like a music program, FL Studio or something—and even though his screen is tilted down, it’s on full bright. I can easily hear his music through his headphones. I put my headphones on and try to fall back asleep, but between the light and sound coming off of this guy, there’s no chance. I consider saying something but settle on a passive aggressive turn away from him. A half hour passes—nothing. My back is aching and my eyes are clenched shut but I’m wide awake, and getting mad. I’m thinking about calling him out: I would, all calculated, rip off my headphones, turn to him and say “Will you give it a rest?!” He’d either apologize, deferring to my obvious rightness, or say “Hey man I’m just doing my thing/I gotta work/something to this effect,” and I’d snarkily say “Well can you do it without keeping everyone else on the damn plane up?” Yeah, I’m awesome, I’m a hero. I settle on the non-confrontational route and think about asking the attendant for a sleep mask. When I open my eyes, the “call attendant” light it blinking. What happened? Is someone else gonna call this guy out? Does this airplane respond to passive-aggressive thoughts? The attendant comes over to our three-person row and waits for one of us to ask him for something, but no one does. He stands there for a beat, unspeaking, and I shrug at him without taking off my headphones. 

Let me be clear. I didn’t chicken out. I did chicken out. But I didn’t call the guy. I couldn’t just swoop in on someone else’s call.  Maybe something else was going on, something more pressing. Gremlin on the wing, et al. Then I just look like an asshole. Attendant leaves and I follow, ask him for a sleep mask cause the guy next to me has been on his laptop the whole damn flight.

I organize documents, pictures; bury porn that I’d lazily saved straight to my desktop. The guy next to me pushes the attendant button. Well that solves that. Attendant comes over and the guy next to me is unaffected, looking straight ahead, absorbed by his music. I’m not about to help him so I pretend not to see the attendant. He only stays for a couple seconds this time. 

Getting near Philadelphia, tray tables go up. Guy next to me calls the attendant a third time. The light blinks for about five minutes, no doubt while the attendant decides how he’s gonna tell us off. He comes over and launches right into it, I take off my headphones. 

“…third time I’ve been over here…” 

I elbow the guy next to me, kinda hard. He jumps, takes off his Beats and looks up. 

“…even acknowledge me.” 

Guy next to me says “Sorry, I can’t see.” No shit, it’s dark and you’re wearing Gucci shades over half your face. 

“Well what do you want?” 

“Can I get a glass of water, no ice?” 

The attendant already has one in his hand. “Here, take it.” We land. Guy two rows ahead of me asks to help grab his bag from the overhead bin. Guy next to me is doing that awkward half stand of someone trying to join the sovereign people of Aislestandistan, but I’m boxing him in. His head is right in front of the bin I need to open. “Hey, watch your head,” I ask a little too softly, like I do. “Hey excuse me can you watch your head?” People are looking. Guy sitting on the other side of him taps him and he realizes what’s going on, ducks. I grab the guys bag and pass it forward. I ask the same favor of someone sitting two rows behind me. We stand for a few minutes while the uppermiddle class deplane. I do that thing you do when you’re awkwardly close to a group of strangers for an awkwardly long time—my eyes half dart around, half look down at my sweater. Get caught looking at that blonde girl twice. I notice that the guy sitting next to me has a stack of short tubes in his hand, the length of straws and the width of fingers. The hell is that? People clear up and I’m finally about to get off the plane when the guy sitting next to me stands up right in front of me and starts feeling around at the overhead bin across the aisle. A woman behind us sees this and taps me, gesturing towards him “can you…” Can I? Can I what, help him? Why should I help…mother fucker. I am the dumbest person I know.

bahamabananarama,8,,2,1rfdwz,,29,"Throwaway because you'll see.

I was visiting my best friend for the first time in his new shared flat, because he had just moved to another town to study. The flat was designed, so that the doors to all the rooms joined in the small living room together with the doors to the kitchen an the bathroom.
I met his other flatmates and they were all really nice guys.
Of course my friend and I we got really, really drunk that night and decided to go home at about 3:30am, where i passed out on the living room couch. I woke up at about 4:30am standing in the room of one of the flatmates. It was then I noticed, that I had woken up to a loud ""What the FUCK man?!?"" by the flatmate who had jolted out of bed to the lightswitch, which revealed what I had done. I was standing next to his bed in my underwear and had just pissed all over his bedsidetable and the floor.
To make matters worse he had his girlfriend over and they had their NEW Iphones on said table.
At first I thought I was dreaming because I just couldn't comprehend how fucked I was but after a deep breath I noticed that,
unfortunately, I was awake.
I got some paper towels as fast as I could and tried to clean it up, but the flatmate ordered me to get out of his room before I did anymore damage and told me to go back on the couch.
The next morning I was still hoping it all just was a dream but the Iphones in rice proved me wrong. Words can not express how embaressed I was and am to this day I cringe everytime I think of it. I tried to apologize to them the next day, knowing that no words could compensate for that, and gave him some money to take his girlfriend out to dinner (luckily the Iphones weren't damaged otherwise I would have had to have paid a LOT more). I begged them not to spread the story around, not even to my friend (he didn't notice and just slept through the whole thing) although I didn't derserve it.
I get along fine with them now and they really haven't told anybody which I am incredibly grateful for, but my god do I cringe when I think of that night.",TIFU by drunk sleepwalking,31,tifu

ecstatic1,11,,3,1rhz0q,,25,"Little bit of back story:

Girl and I have been friends for going on 4 years now. We've really dragged each other through some shit over that time, failed relationships, a mutual friend's divorce, problems with school and work and life, etc. She's always been there for me when I needed someone to listen, and I've always tried to help her through whatever problems crop up in her life.

Me? I'm a habitual fuck-up when it comes to anything involving emotions or expressing myself, and I tend to repress feelings of frustration and aggression. I think it's a coping mechanism for when I don't feel like I've got control of my life, like I choose not to feel instead of actually confronting the thing that's causing me to feel that way. She's the kind of girl that wears her heart on her sleeve, essentially, and that's a very endearing quality to me because it helps me associate with my own emotions. It's been very helpful over the past 7 or 8 months since I've moved across the country to start a new job. It's lonely here and my friends back home, her especially, have been so supportive and helpful.

Anyway, that bit is important because for about a year now I've been trying to convince myself that I'm not romantically interested in Girl, despite the fact that I've caught myself looking at her in a way that I typically reserve for lovers. And we have fooled around in the past so I didn't think much about it (just hormones, etc.). Last time I was in town (October) we ended up having sex, after which she drove me to the airport and we said our goodbyes. Neither one of us has really mentioned the event, but I've been thinking about her more and more over the past month as I've been helping her deal with school related problems. 

So last night:

I came back from my evening run feeling the worse for wear. I'm trying to train up for a 15k back home this coming Saturday that Girl has asked me to run with her. Fuck me I'm not a runner! But she's worth the effort so here I am pushing myself through cold and rain. Well, I get home and I text her that I want to Facetime and talk a bit. She replies back that she's got a meeting real soon and she can't, but she really wants to talk to me because she's stressed and also that *she wants to tell me about this* **new guy** *she met*. What? Fuck? I thought I had more time!

I was planning on telling her how I felt this weekend, and I think I panicked a little. She caught on that something was amiss and called me up. So there I am, heart pounding, legs tight and fingers numb, looking into the face of a girl who doesn't know the train wreck that's about to crash into her from a thousand miles away.

I play it cool. ""So, I've got a problem I think you can help me out with."" ""Ok, I'll try,"" she says to me with a look on her face like she has more pressing concerns on her mind. And I could tell she wasn't expecting anything, which just made it harder. But I'm already in this far, can't back out now. I go on to tell her that there's this girl I like and I don't know how to tell her how I feel. We go back and forth on some questions, and she figures out pretty quickly that I'm being a coy motherfucker and calls me out. 

""Is it me...?"" Lump in my throat. ""...Maybe?"" *Wry smile and puppy dog eyes*. Silence. Silence grows into awkward pause. Then the next 5 minutes is her looking like she's recovering from a car crash and me desperately trying to explain that I can't help how I feel. ""Maybe I'm just being an idiot,"" I say. ""I didn't want to tell you like this, but I can't help how I feel and I wanted you to know."" And she's obviously distraught, and our conversation keeps getting interrupted as her sister enters and exits her room so the awkwardness only exasperates. Finally I just go and say, ""I can't help the way I feel. *I love you and I can't change that.*"" She looks like a deer in headlights. ""I have to go to my meeting, I'm really sorry I don't know what to say right now..."" Boom. Done. Conversation ends.

And here I am today, wearing my dunce hat and feeling like a total selfish asshole. I've fucked up a lot in my life, Reddit. But last night, I think, was my crowning glory. Please induct me into the Hall of Fucked.

octnoir,7,,5,1rbzx2,,18,"Years ago when I was in college, I had an acting class where we all had to act out a ten minute scene in groups (groups of 4). My team decided to do everything last minute (day before our presentation was due), and since I have a background in filmography, cinematography and do videos on a daily basis, I did the camera work and was responsible for editing.

I use Adobe Premier Pro and the editing was impossible and I have an old machine (the render took bloody hours - it finished right before we had to present the video). Also, just how my camera takes footage and it gets imported into Premier Pro, it is automatically zoomed in 50% (because it has to fit a format) and so I have to manually unzoom each of the clips (I took hundreds and there isn't a multi-select option/automatically make it unzoom). It's really late into the night and I might have skipped a couple of clips.

SO, the video is done rendering JUST as we had to present the video. And because it's college and I had a 100 other things, I just slept through the video and the entire class. 20 minutes later (at the end of class), I am woken up by a very tight slap from my female friend: ""You f***ing a**hole"" and she stormed off. I was like WTF, but the entire class and even the professor were shooting me daggers.

I immediately watch the finished video - effects were fine, cuts are flawless, sounds good, so what's the problem? WELL, it turns out one minute of the finished film was zoomed in of the ten (hundreds of clips I sorted last night were perfectly fine, just two of them were not). AND it just HAPPENED to be zoomed in on my friend's ample and shapely breasts. So imagine this - for one minute you could only see boobs on the screen when there was supposed to be a dramatic dialogue. I immediately put my face into my hands and tried to hope it was all a bad dream. It wasn't.

Aftermath: I had to beg the professor to not give my team a failing grade, and accepted one instead. I had to go to a sexual harassment seminar. Everyone in university thinks I'm a creepy perv AND everyone now knows that my mild mannered, very nice and shy friend has large breasts. She was also my crush and was about to break up with her boyfriend, and showed some interest in me. Now she absolutely hates my guts even after five years. And her boyfriend (now broken up) gave me a very stern lecture about the whole thing.

To this day, NO ONE believes I did this on purpose. I SWEAR I HAD NO IDEA, and I have now switched to Final Cut Pro.

I WILL NEVER USE ADOBE PREMIER PRO EVER AGAIN.

I was ecstatic. It's hard for me to make friends because of my different interests. One of those interests is reading visual novels! (or VNs as I like to call it) So I go in, and ask if that's a VN. It obviously was, so I ask if I could sit down and watch. 

I knew something was wrong when I saw that one of the characters was named ""Twilight."" I was actually really worried when NONE of the characters had Japanese names, because VNs are extremely popular over there, so that's where they all come from. 

I continued to watch and started to notice very slowly what type of club it was, a My Little Pony club. I stayed for a little bit, as to not be rude (for a bit, I mean like 30 seconds). But after that I NOPE-d the FUCK out of there.

I have nothing against people who watch MLP, but I was sad that I wasn't able to find friends...

tl;dr I accidentally go to a MLP club because of my strong interest in visual novels. Life said ""FUCK YOU! Trying to make friends?!?!?!""

l3radrocks,9,,7,1r6lt9,,13,"   To really understand this story, you need to know a little about my school. I live in a metropolitan area in the South. Being in the south, most adults have absolutely zero clue of how computer work or function. That included my Digital Tech teacher. I had planned originally to take computer ed classes my whole high school career, but the was already stopped my freshmen year because my High School forces us to take Health and P.E our freshmen year, and I took Spanish as my second elective. So this year I was naturally excited when I finally got to sign up for my computer class. Growing up, there was never any real adult that could teach me about anything related to computers so I was interested in what I would learn in this class. I hoped that it would be a lot. I was dead wrong. Put quite simply, my teach is an idiot.
   
Now, I usually don’t mind teachers even if I personally don’t like them, but this teacher is fully honestly an idiot, and frankly the whole class is idiotic. A perfect example was our first project. We were charged with choosing parts to build our computer. I thought that this would be an easy A and breezed through it. Here’s the good part, I failed it epically. First of all, she took of TWENTY points for not including a FLOPPY DRIVE. Yes, my teacher still believes that floppy drives are still regularly used.  As I stood there baffled by this, she tells me that she is going to take ANOTHER TWENTY points off for using Pcpartpicker.com instead of an excel spreadsheet, when she explicitly told us that we could do the list any way we wanted. Not wanting to cause a scene, I bit my tongue.
  
 Fast forward an excruciating four months of me correcting her pretty much daily on most things she says about computers. For a week now she has been saying that our next project will involve making a game and programming it ourselves. I dance with joy thinking that I might learn something useful finally, after getting through topics such as “Digital Safety”, and “Good online citizenship”. Well fuck was I wrong. She announces a day later that we will be using Scratch.com. If you aren’t aware of what scratch.com is, it is pretty much a program intended for elementary school kids to teach them how to program. Don’t get me wrong, it’s great but I was expecting something actually interesting. So we weren’t supposed to start this project until next week, but I usually do 2 weeks’ worth work daily in that class, seeing as how it is 99% busy work (She has only stood and lectured us once). So the next day, I get started in the Scratch project. I decide to just make a simple space shooter, a lot like Galactica. Finished in in two days, and it worked perfectly. Had 2 weeks’ worth of work done in 2 days. I was free to sleep and read in that class for 2 whole weeks.

This morning, she starts yelling at the class for playing games and being on sites they aren’t supposed to, and said that she had already written some of us up for playing games; all the whole staring at me with a smirk on her face. Of course, the first thought that pops to mind is that she is going to write me up for playing my own project. I already knew she hated me. There is no question about it, everyone in the class knows it. I tried to no get on her bad side even after floppy drive incident, but it did inevitably happen. I don’t purposely aggravate her, her whole experience in our class is a lot like one of those days when nothing ever goes your way. I don’t mean it to be like that, but it is. 
 
  Now to the inevitable. I spent all day today freaking out whenever they called on the intercom, expecting them to say “Mrs.OP, can we have l3radrocks to the administrative offices please.” To my surprise it never happened. I got home today relieved, thinking that it was another blank threat like she always gives me, or that I was just imagining the whole thing. 
 
  My county has this whole website that you login into with your student ID, and they have online textbooks and your grades posted there. And to my horror, in big bold letters – “This student number has been suspended”. 
   
What my school does whenever you are disciplined for computer incidents, they suspend your student Id and in turn, your computer privileges. Right now I am waiting for the inevitable call tomorrow to the administrative offices, ruining my perfect disciplinary record.

MadameQuiggles,14,,12,1r4chx,,16,"Today when I went to put away the laundry for my mother I found out that she was upset at me because I didn't hear the buzzer go off. I continued to fold the laundry so there wasn't much to get in trouble for, but out of no where my mother starts yelling ""You never do anything unless I get mad or unless it's on your damned computer!"" Wow. Okay, that was totally out of the blue and I know that if I say anything back it will just be wrong, so I just continue and finish folding the clothes and fall back to my bedroom after I'm done. 
""GET YOUR ASS OUT HERE."" .. what did I do now? I continue to walk out in to the kitchen where my mother waits impatiently for me and then screams to sit down at the kitchen table. ""YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING I ASK AND YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ME. YOU ONLY SIT ON YOUR COMPUTER AND PLAY SHITTY GAMES AND WANT TO BE WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING HELPFUL AROUND THE HOUSE ANYMORE. WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO LIVE WITH YOUR GRANDMOTHER AND GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE? I'M FUCKING DONE."" All of this followed by my mother stomping out of the front door and slamming both the main door and the screen door. Unable to really control my tears, seeing as how I was just told how worthless I was and to get the ""fuck out"" of my home... I continued to pick up the glass jar she smashed against the kitchen floor and put away the laundry I was busy with before this ordeal broke out. 

I figured I might as well take this as the time to try to move out. I'm eighteen and in college. My home-life has gone down-hill very fast since my mother had been diagnosed with a specific type of bone cancer. She feels horrible every day and I try my hardest to please her, but I suppose this was the chance I needed to take to have at least a week to calm both of ourselves down until we can talk about a compromise of our feelings. I addressed this idea to my brother and father and both of them told me to do as I felt was best, but of course my father wanted me to stay at home and just ignore it until she was calm. Nearly impossible. 

When my mother got home again I asked in a very nice way if I could spend a few days over at my friends house (this friend had been there through the entire thing and was planning on leaving that day anyways). Mother was very unhappy. ""No. No. Because I said no. No. No, you will not."" Well.. I did anyways because I'm eighteen and I suppose I'll have to learn from my experiences and this will be one of them, whether I made a huge mistake or not. My mother went on another tantrum and started hitting things off of the walls and blurted out ""I'M LEAVING."" slammed the door and left in the truck. I was told to leave everything behind, but we all know we can't survive with nothing. I took whatever I could and had my friend help me pack. I had her mother on the way to help us get to the McDonalds to activate my old WalMart phone online when I realize that I can't do that until the battery's charged. 
*So here I am, sitting at the shitty fast food restaurant at 6:30 PM with no phone or anything really.* I decided to go to my boyfriends, which no one expected, and was able to contact my grandmother. 

I am now sitting at my grandmother's house, which I guess is now my ""home.""  Today was truly my biggest fuck up of my eighteen years on this planet. 

**EDIT:** So I went to try to confront my mother about a possible agreement as to how we could settle our issues and just let things slide back down the pointy slope until we were okay again... That went HORRIBLY. I came back with my grandmother after receiving a text stating my mother was starting to gut out my room (Which had roughly a grand worth of money of electronics, if not more, still inside that I couldn't get in my rushed exit).  My mother was breaking down in tears on the porch when we arrived, which tore me apart, and my grandmother and I tried to talk with her but all we got was that she wasn't over it and she didn't want to talk. I gathered what I could, all of my expensive items and got out. 

After I transported all of my items my grandmother decided it might be a good idea to open up my own bank account; my original one was attached to my father's account. So we went to do that, but had to postpone it due to my lack of ID that I forgot that morning in a scrambled mess to get my items. On the way BACK to the bank, the second time, my grandmother received a text stating that my mother couldn't take it and she just wanted to hug and hold me again. We decided the bank could wait. 

When I got back to the house, I came inside and I told my mother I was there for her and that everything was okay. I comforted her as best as I could and eventually i got out of her that she didn't want me to move out and that she wouldn't scream anymore and that she was sorry for her actions. She for some reason was convinced I wouldn't move back in and told me to take the white car so I could get to college and back every day on my own.. sweet, but I don't think I'd be able to take the car if it was at my grandmothers and I was at home. 

In the end: My mother needed to rest so my grandmother and I fixed supper for everyone and served her what she felt she could eat, she helped me to reactivate my cell phone so I could have a means of communication again, I brought my stuff back over and told my mother that I would stay, but eventually she will have to come to terms that I am not her and I do not see everything she thinks needs to be done every day. And that she couldn't have been so upset over dirt that she would be THAT upset: something else must have been really pulling her down, but I would be there for her.

owlbrowneyes,3,,5,1r9heo,,12,"So there is this coworker I have , she comes in on Sundays.
I work part time so she isn't a big problem , but sometimes she is the reason that I don't even want to go to work. 

Maybe I'm not use to the way she wears her heart on her sleeve. 

Sometimes she is moody , other times she is not. 

A couple weeks ago , I get called up to a register. It's getting pretty busy so I just jump on to the first free one I see. 

This lady comes back from her break and kicks me off. 
I opened the store and that was the register I picked. I came in before her, but you know whatever . It's busy and I'd rather just help take care of the line. I don't really care what register I'm on. The managers have no specifications for those either.

So I jump on to register 7. No one else is on there , I'm assuming they're on their break and won't really care. 

I begin ringing up the customer, and when she hands me a large bill I find there's not enough to give back in less bills. So I call the front-end manager to try and come get me change. 

She doesn't hear me. By now the coworker who was on there comes back. ""Oh no this isn't going to work owlbrowneyes"". 
I try again to call the front-end manager. She hears me. 

But it's too late, the coworker grabs the cash out of my hand in front of the customer and just starts giving it to her. 

I can't get yell at other people who I don't know without needing to cry. Most of my coworkers know that I'm generally not the yelling type.

So I just walk away from the register. Just to calm myself down I walk around the store recovering. 

She's in general rude like this, has an attitude. Maybe it's just the way I perceive her. 

But I couldn't stand it anymore.

So I told my manager. I was actually so upset that I began crying (this was due to other reasons more so than her). And he said he'd talk to the general manager about it as well as the coworker. I'm sort of worried that he mentioned my name. 

She and I talk very rarely but I can't stand being near her when at work. In the past she has been rude before. I can tell she makes subtle jokes about me.

jayond,1,,5,1r9sad,,6,"I got up late after my 2 year old turned off the alarm.  I could not get my eldest son off to school and he didn't feel well so it worked out alright.  I went back to sleep which is unusual for me.  I normally stay up to make sure my wife gets off to work.  So my wife finally got me up about an hour and half before she has to leave for work.  My eldest needed to replace his eyeglasses and I decided since he was home already, we should do it today.  The initial plan was to get my father in law to take us (my sons and me).  That fell through.  I then tried to get my brother in law to help us.  Again, it was a no go.  That should have ended my planning but once I get an idea in my head, I become compulsive.  I need to do it.  My wife should have just told me to go to hell and I would have grumbled for awhile.  But apparently, she loves me and knows how miserable I get when can't do something I think I need to.   So here's where I fucked up her day.  I made the appointment, knowing someone else would come get us later but I don't get things ready quick enough and find shoes for my youngest.  I put him footy pajamas and put clothes over that.  She kept looking for shoes for another five minutes after I got the kids in the car. We finally headed to the eye exam 10 minutes out of the way.  To make matters worse, I couldn't find it.  I called and got directions.  She finally dropped us off.  All the delays caused her to be 15 minutes late and miss her meeting with her supervisor.   That lead to a writeup and will most likely delay her advancement in a company she has been promoted 3 times in her first 6 months.  So effectively, I have destroyed all the hard work she has put in and her chance to get to the next position in next 6 months which she was on track to do.  I feel like shit.

I've always been pretty terrible at writing and reading in general which is why I am a science major (to this day I question how I was admitted into any school).  The reason I suck at writing analytical essays is because I can't analyze text its that simple.  I take everything very literal and don't question anything.  

My paper was only 800 words so its basically not even a college paper.  The same week it was due I had 3 very difficult midterms for my major so I went to my ta and told her how difficult of a week id been having.  I told her I sucked at writing and was very illiterate (I meant literal), she immediately began laughing and I didn't know why.  I explained how I sucked at analyzing stuff and she just kept laughing.  As I was walking out she asked what my major, I said BioPsych and she then said, ""That explains everything!""  

I then went home really confused as to why she had laughed and told my roommates I had said to her that I suck at reading context clues and said I was illiterate, then began laughing and told me that I had basically told her I couldn't read instead of saying literal.

Yesterday we moved the final things out of her old apartment and I needed emotional support, but she was out at ballet for the evening which was okay, I knew how much ballet means to her and I'd never want to take that away from her. 
 This morning she had ballet again, and when she finally got home we talked for a couple minutes. But I come to find out she is sleeping over at her friends to watch the One Direction..7 hour stream. (Wont go into that bit) and everything that's built up over the last few days just burst. Just on Monday we had argued after I said some nasty stuff then too. Before this week we hasn't even argued. 
 This time around I basically told her that it seemed like she doesn't even care about me, and that she only cares about herself (which in hindsight is the furthest thing from the truth). And well, needless to say that hurt her a lot. I also stupidly asked that we stop seeing one another (which, is the last thing I'd ever want). So I called her after we calmed down a bit and I'm trying to apologize over and over, she said she needs time to think...in my past relationships that's never a good sign.
 Normally I wouldn't really care, but this girl I really could see spending my life with. I love her with all of my heart, and I'd go through Hell for her. I don't want to lose her, I don't think I could handle it. Plus I know she has a lot going on as well right now, and that I'm not exactly helping her out much.

*""So they do the homework during class. This upsets me...""*

So, from there I went on auto-pilot. I said:

""Mr. Doe (real name secret), [pause] I must confess. I did just that.""

So he gets up, takes my paper, and tells me:

*""wessles, you were honest, so I will take your paper, but also award you with a 'doing the right thing' award""*

The 'doing the right thing' award, is when they call you out on being a good person. So, at that point, completely forgetting why I told him, I get out a piece of paper, and do my homework again. I finish, class is over (no homwork free-time), and I get my paper back, surprisingly.)

DontJustStare,358,,373,1r5y5m,,784,"Usually, I don't eat breakfast, but that didn't matter because my crush was working at the cafe this morning rather than tonight, so that meant I was going to buy breakfast. *(Don't ask how I knew he had a morning shift this morning. I'm not a stalker; I'm just ..observant and resourceful.)*

Before I left I was sure to apply a little foundation and mascara; probably the amount of makeup a normal girl would wear. Usually, I don't bother as I am not the spend-forever-getting-ready kinda girl. Although he has always been friendly and nice, he has never done anything to give me the impression that he was interested, yet I always make the effort to look nice whenever I know I will be going to the cafe. (I know, kinda pathetic) 

Business was slow--probably because it had just opened and normal people aren't up so early, so it was basically just us two and his other coworker. I have liked this guy for the longest and we have hardly spoken other than about the food and other short chats, nothing personal, but this morning that finally changed. He initiated a conversation, and we wound up talking for a bit, including plans for this weekend. I was beginning to think he was going to actually ask me out! But then business started to pick up. He asked for my number, so we could talk more later. I played it cool on the outside, but on the inside I was doing a [dance](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lu6b99ng2s1qew6kmo1_500.gif) . 

So, I reach for my bag to get a pen and paper to give him my number since he didn't have his phone on him. Being a little too eager and naturally clumsy, I knocked over my book bag, causing some of the items to fall out. **FUCK ME** Guess what pops out... My fucking dildo.

What can I say? I am a horny girl and it's been 6 months, hence my thirstiness for this guy. I had spent the previous two nights away from home, and I had to rush to pack this morning because I took so long to get ready and prettify myself. In haste, I stuffed whatever I could in the other bags and just so happened to place Sparky in the bag I carry around with the intention of removing it once I got home. 

My eye balls nearly pop out of the sockets in disbelief, and I hurried up and shoved it back in the bag as if that would make him unsee it. I knew it was too late; he undoubtedly saw my 8inch faux cock. *fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck*. 

I expected him to say he had to hurry and get back to work and try to get out of the situation, so I tried to make it less awkward by just telling him, ""Sorry, I don't have any paper. Maybe next time,"" I said in a nervous voice and got out of there. I don't think the situation could have been any more awkward. I just didn't know what to say. My face was down, avoiding eye-contact out of embarrassment most of that time, so I'm not entirely sure how he reacted, but he was probably thinking *WTF, I knew this bitch was weird, but damn*.

I am always cock-blocking myself by being a werido. Well, looks like it's just me and sparky tonight. :( *Forever alone*. 

**TL;DR: My crush for the longest finally gave me the chance to get the D and I cock-blocked myself by dropping my dildo.**


**EDIT:** A couple of points I want to clarify as it seems I was not clear. I do not carry this dildo around on a daily basis. I had brought it with me while I was away from home in a couple of nights. I was rushing to make it to the cafe as well as check out by a certain time, so I just threw my things in my bags. 

*(Sidenote: I clean my dildo before and after each use to prevent UTIs so even if I was carrying it around &amp; ret-ta-go at any time, it would not put me at any risk)*

Also, the cafe he works at is not Starbucks. I took the photo of inside my book bag (listed in a comment below) later that day in Starbucks to *prove* I was not making this up.

Lastly, the dildo came fully out, so it's not like there is a chance he could not have seen it. After it came out, I pretty much avoided eye contact or looking at him at all, so I don't know what he was thinking. 

Now that I have read each comment, it seems like nearly every person is saying the same thing, which is that he doesn't think I'm a weird freak. There is a chance that I may have been over-thinking this situation with my typical skewed, negative perspective. Perhaps, in a few days, I will revisit the cafe without bringing it up and give him my number (I liked this idea more than apologizing as it avoids making it more awkward IMO). I am just terrified of rejection, so I don't know if I will or not. If I do, I will definitely update!

I went back to the cafe tonight, and he was there (which I figured as he usually works late Sunday nights). However, I didn't give him my number. I was prepared to write my number down on the receipt, so I didn't make it obvious how planned it was by already having it written down...but I chickened out. He just acted so normal, and I didn't know how to bring it up. ""Oh so, did you still want my number?"" I'd sound like a total loser. I started over-thinking it. I didn't even stay and eat what I ordered; I got it to go. I probably won't go back either. I mainly went there to steal glances at him. Oh well. . .

SexxSyrup,206,,254,1rhoin,,708,"**Context:** Happened last week. I teach English abroad and this had been a topic of conversation in a hostel dorm room for several people.

I checked into a hostel, got up to my dorm, and quickly introduced to myself to the other 2 people in the room, lets call them Mary and Sue. Mary was a nice girl from Germany who got to chatting with me. I said hello to Sue, but she pretended not to hear me.

*fast forward*

I start noticing some strange things about Sue: She lit a candle and blew it out again and again. When we finally fall asleep, she starts having night terrors, screaming things like ""DON'T TOUCH ME, GET AWAY FROM ME, NO NO NO,!"" The next morning, Mary tells me that Sue had been crying the whole day before. I start to think she had gone through some abuse recently.

*fast forward*

We're all in the room, she starts to cry again, and I asked, ""Are you okay?"" with no response. I said it again, and oh boy did I make a mistake. She went into this rant about how all English teachers do is rape their children, rape their students, rob their host countries, and neglect to learn the culture or language. She continued to say that if I would like to speak to her, I should speak to her in her native tongue, Finnish (ignoring the irony of conveying this message in perfect English). I was told to stop bullying her, that I denied her the right to lay in her bed, that I couldn't possibly have anything valuable to retort because I'm English (I'm American).

That night, I feared for my life.

I've had 4-5 female friends for almost 10-11 years and one since high school. With two, there were romantic feelings when we started talking, but that fizzled out and now it's just casual friendship (ie, how's your mom, the kids, etc). Off and on throughout the years we'd keep in contact via text just to see what's happening in each other's lives. Marriages, kids, buying houses, etc., when something big or a birthday came around a text would be sent off, catch up for a bit, and then back to no word for a year or more. 

When my mom died earlier this year there were two of these friends who were very supportive and I've kept up with them more and more, culminating in exchanging about 700 texts last month during the worst of my so far grief based depression. At this point I haven't been able to seek therapy because of my schedule, but once the semester is over that will happen. Nothing sexual is desired from either one of these friends; both are happily married with kids. In fact the last conversations were about classes, banana bread, and Thanksgiving plans. 

The part where I fucked up is that I never knew how my wife would take me having these female friends (who I haven't seen in over 10 years), so I never told her about them. All the conversations have been unknown to her until yesterday when she noticed a high number of texts on the bill and found the history. 

She is absolutely distraught and told me that she has lost trust in me. I know it looks horrible from the outside looking in.

Maleus21,17,,35,1r1h9k,,155,"This actually happened a while back, but I just found this sub, and since all of my friends love this story, I might as well share it with everyone here.

So a while back, my friend and I worked together on 2nd shift. We normally got off work around 10pm, and it was customary for us to stay up late after work, since we didn't need to be in until late afternoon. So this day, my friend asks me to help him get a weight bench he is getting off of craigslist after work. I didn't have anything else going on, so I gladly offered a helping hand. 

The house we were going to was around 45 minutes away, so while getting gas before heading that way, I went in the gas station and picked up a king size Reeses cup and a large Red Bull to give me some energy after work. This was to be my undoing, because little did I know at that time, I am severely lactose intolerant (I never put 2 and 2 together, and didn't have insurance at the time, so I just thought I had stomach issues). 

So on the way there, we are just idly talking, I finish my 4 peanut butter cups and don't think a thing about them. About 15 minutes later, I feel a slight rumble in my stomach, since stomach problems are normal for me at this time, I pass it off, because I know Ill be home within a couple of hours. About 15 minutes later, the rumbling is more intense, and realize that my friends bathroom will probably receive the brunt of my soon to be coming anal assault. A little while later, we are in the person's neighborhood, and I'm starting to think that a gas station on the way home is inevitable. 

Finally we get to dude's house. He is a nice guy, weight bench is in his garage, but unfortunately it is fully assembled (it is one of those huge all in one machines). Well I haven't told my friend about my stomach, and he and the seller are finalizing the deal, then begin talking about how we are going to secure it in the back of my truck. At this point, I am almost in a cold sweat, my ass cheeks are so clenched so tight, you couldn't fit a needle between them. 

We have now finished loading the weight bench, I am giving myself pep talks and saying a prayer for every step I am taking. I do not want to ask a complete stranger whom we just met off of craigslist to use his bathroom obviously, but things are getting bad. That's when it happens... We are exchanging pleasantries, saying thank yous, and about to get in the truck. I am scouring my brain trying to think of the nearest gas station that I saw on the way there, and decide to let a tini-tiny little bitty poot out just to relieve some of the pressure, as my insides feel as though I am about to explode. Well ladies and gents, when you are in that condition, never ever trust a fart.

It broke the ass seal that my cheeks had welded together, and out comes a torrential down-pour of shit. I could feel it coming, I did my best to squeeze my ass together as tight as I could, which ended up resulting in ass cramps along with the spasms of my intestines wanting so desperately to empty, going against every ounce of my soul trying to stop it. The result was excruciating pain, which resulted me kneeling down, screaming in agony. 

Keep in mind, I had not let on to either of these guys that my stomach was even remotely upset, and I'm sure the sweating was mascaraed by the fact that this was taking place during the summer. So to them, it looked as if I just became possessed and began screaming. So now I am kneeling on the ground, my underwear filled up like a babies diaper, my friend is freaking out,  and the guy from craigslist is no doubt regretting every second of this transaction by now.

I slowly stood up, gathered what I could of myself, and kindly asked the seller if I could use his bathroom. His response was simply ""Umm sure dude, in and to the right, last door on the left"". I slowly walked in the house, praying that no small shit nuggets fell out onto their carpet on my way there. After I got in the bathroom, I took a look at the damage, it was irreparable. Now I had to make a decision, walk outside holding underwear, leave a pair of shit pants in his garbage, or option 3. I emptied as much as I could into the toilet, took out my pocket knife, and cut the massive shit stain out of my underwear. This was obviously was a much smaller piece of cloth, which allowed me to wrap it up in a massive amount of toilet paper and stick it in my pocket. I then cleaned my ass as much as possible (I didn't want to shower in his house also, I was already mortified). Put my holy boxers back on, walked outside, went straight to my truck thanking him as I walked by, got in and immediately drove off. Down the street I threw the shit wad out of the window, and began explaining the story to my now laughing so hard he cant breathe friend. 

I asked my friend if the guy had said anything when I went in his house. His reply to my friend ""Its just a hunch, but I think your friend needs to shit"".

This actually occurred a little under two years ago but anyway.

Every year during the long summer holidays my family have a tradition of heading up to go camping on the East coast of the North Island (NZ). The spot where we go is seriously a fairy tale place: a huge bay with golden sweeping sands, constant sunshine, warm water, big waves, few people, reefs to explore, you get the idea. This year I happened to know that there was a girl there I'd met the previous year who was quite into me. As you can imagine, I'm well keen. The morning after we arrive, virtually as soon as I get up, she bounds over and says she's taking me for my first swim, right now. I'm all about it so we head out into the blue to get wet (me hoping other things may get wet later on). I dive into the water and that's where things begin to take a turn for the unexpected.

As soon as I come up I realise the left side of my face is numb and I can't speak. 

Yep, you guessed it. Brain hemorrhage. 

Ended up spending two weeks in hospital, three months off school and two years later I still can't attend school 5 days a week because I get too tired. I haven't had any luck with the ladies since then either, may or may not be related.

N_skrilla,54,,37,1r5npr,,120,"So around this time of year at the organic garden I work at, all of the hottest peppers we've been growing from early in the year have finished ripening, and are ready to be processed. My job in this is to take the dried habaneros and use a small device to grind them into pepper flakes.

Now anyone thats ever eaten a habanero knows that they are one spicy motherfucker of a pepper. Like 100 times more potent than a jalapeno. And to top it off, if you touch one of them with your bare hands, it'll burn like a motherfucker for about an hour.

So as I was making the emptying the flakes into a container, some of the residual powder left over spilled onto the leg of my pants. I thought nothing of it at the time, and just figured I'd wash my pants after I got done with my shift in a few hours.

Well once those few hours had passed, I had totally forgotten about the seemingly minor incident. When I got home and got ready to take a shower, I must have thrown my underwear on top of my pants; right where the habanero powder had set in. After I got out of the shower and put them back on, it took about 5 minutes after for me to realize how badly I fucked up.

The burning set in, as well as the panic. It started off as a dull burning which was uncomfortable but bearable, but just kept elevating for a solid 15 minutes. To give you a good idea of how this felt, just imagine the spiciest thing you've ever eaten in your life, the try to imagine that burning sensation of your gens. Hell, even the ""icy hot to the balls"" challenge didn't hold a candle to this. I immediately ran to the bathroom to try to wash the stuff off, but once it sets in you just have to ride it out. The burning went on for a solid hour before it decided to die down, and all the while I was sweating like hell and trying not to vomit from the shear pain of the whole ordeal.

fatdumbbitch,18,,43,1r40dm,,77,"When I was younger and first becoming familiar with my body I 'played' with a novelty baseball bat. It's a quarter of the size of a real bat and had a smooth finish. I have long since abandoned it for more appropriate battery operated devices. I cleaned it up and hid it in the back of a closet. Today I came home from campus and found my younger, autistic brother playing with the bat. He was holding it and stroking the wood and my heart stopped.

I was mortified and tried to ignore that this embarrassing childhood pleasure had resurfaced. But I wasn't gonna let this get to me. It was the end of a long day of school and work and I just wanted to have dinner and relax. Dinner had been eaten without me, so I whip it out of the fridge and into the microwave. Nothing, not even my pleasure bat, was going to keep me from relaxing. What was the worse that could happen? 

My brother obliged Murphy's law. He starts tapping it on the table to a beat set by a rhythmically challenged drummer. This interrupted my mom's favorite show, The Voice. Like one domino toppling another, my mom not enjoying her show upset my dad, who tries his best to afford her those few moments she can enjoy herself (the challenges of having an autistic child). 

Dad removes the bat from my brother's grasp and hushes any protest from my sibling. Now there's two family members that have touched my makeshift dildo. I was just gonna try and concentrate on my meal. My dad moved to get off the couch and presumably hide the bat. He however needs surgery on his leg, restricting his movement and requiring a certain amount of daily pain pills. I'm not sure if he was actually being mindful of his limitations or if he was coming up on needing more medication, but he decides he's not going to leave the couch. 

He calls me over from the dinning room, where I'm still trying to eat, and ask me to hide the bat in his room. I put on my poker face and take the bat. I stride with as much nonchalance as can be mustered, and hide the bat under my parent's bed.

FreshmanLuck,37,,38,1rbx28,,65,"This is my first semester attending college, which I'm really enjoying so far, with the exception of today's events. Aside from the general ed. stuff, I'm also taking a couple computer science classes which meet in the computer lab. Since the lab is open for students to use before and after classes, it can sometimes be difficult to find a vacant computer until right before a class begins.

Because I tend to be pretty shy I prefer to take the far corner computer which is least visible to the entire room. Since the semester started, I noticed that the same guy, whom I shall refer to as ""The Brony"", is often sitting at my computer right before the class. I call him The Brony because he has a couple different sweatshirts which he alternates and one of them has the rainbow pony character (sorry, I don't watch the show) on it. I've never really talked to him, and he's not in any of my classes. He looks to be in his late twenties or so, about a decade older than most of the other people I see around, even though I sometimes see him in the cafeteria sitting with his much younger looking friends.

One thing I hate about sharing computers is the hygienic aspect. I don't want to seem rude but this guy just never seems clean. Every time I see him at my computer he's sitting there with his thinning, greasy, stringy, untrimmed hair which just sort of hangs over his sweaty forehead and over his thick lens glasses [(which make his eyes appear to bulge out)](http://images.halloweencostumes.com/products/15274/1-1/bug-eye-specs.jpg). He also seems to wear the same clothes many days in a row. Our class meets three times a week and a few weeks I've seen him in the same nasty sweatshirt and sweatpants combo (which begins to accumulate food particles and other debris) all three days. The worst thing is that after he gets up, the chair still smells (like shit), and I'm not sure if it's because he's a bigger dude or because he's not cleaning himself properly. I don't want to know honestly. So I just switch the chair with the next one over, and then switch them again after class to make sure I'm not sitting on his chair.

Today I arrived to a packed computer lab as usual, so I went outside and sat down on some benches between that room and another classroom while I waited until I could get my usual computer back from The Brony. About 5 minutes later, I saw him walk out and proceed to grab the front of his pants to ""adjust"" himself, as though he were in his own private bedroom and not walking down a campus hallway. At the time I didn't think too much of it (except that it's pretty gross to do so in public view), so I grabbed my backpack and went to sit down at my usual spot. After switching the chair, I sat down and logged in with the keyboard. When I finally grabbed the mouse for the first time, I felt something unusual, a moistness along the sides of the mouse. I looked at the mouse and it kind of glistened (though under the florescent lights it was hard to tell). I wasn't sure if it was some kind of sweat or something else, so (stupidly) I slowly brought my fingers to my face and gave them a sniff. I nearly gagged at the unmistakable bleachy stench of semen.

I immediately got up, and walked to the nearest restroom holding my right hand out in front of me like some kind of deformed zombie, all the while mentally trying to remain calm. I stood in front of the sink for about 10 minutes just lathering my hands with soap, and rinsing them, over and over until I finally calmed down. After I dried them they were redder than I've ever seen them, but I finally felt somewhat clean. By the time I got back to class the instructor had begun talking and for the first time in my college life, I had to walk in late.

I didn't sit at my usual computer; I will never sit there again! But I did want to confirm that I wasn't imagining things, so after class I went back to the corner computer, took a plastic bag, placed it over the mouse, and opened the browser history to see if there was anything there.

NiceRideMan,4,,12,1r79fs,,57,"Preface: I live in a semi-detached house, so we share our driveway with our neighbors. There's enough room in the driveway for a total of 4 cars. They're a rather sizeable family, so they have 3 cars and pack them all into the driveway. We never did mind because we only have 2 cars, and if they park the 3rd car a little on their lawn and partially in the driveway, we can fit 5 cars. Although I didn't mind, I still found it annoying at times since it was a tight fit leaving me less room to maneuver.

The neighbors are a really nice Muslim family. Most of the reason I didn't mind them squashing 3 cars into the driveway was because they did things for us frequently. Here in Ontario, it snows a lot sometimes. If they saw that our driveway hadn't been cleaned, they'd do it for us a lot of the time. And they'd bring over leftover food from feasts, and it was so fucking good. So over those 10 years, I never said anything about their 3 cars.

Preface over, here's what happened. A couple of days ago I was at university, and my mom texted me saying the neighbor had passed away. Keep in mind this was a large family. There was an 80 year old with his wife, 2 of their kids (Both mid-30s, who had wives and kids of their own.) 10 people total. The 80 year old man passed away because his kidney failed.

When I arrived home that day, one of the deceased man's sons was in the driveway. I walked on over to him and expressed my condolences. OUT OF FUCKING NO WHERE, and I mean in no way did I mean to say this but for whatever reason did, I proceeded to say ""Haha, guess you won't need that [third] car anymore."" Probably something subconscious. Fucking Freudian slip. Needless to say, I felt terribly awkward and just ""Oh man dinner is ready'd"" away.",TIFU my opening my mouth,69,tifu
suppermick,18,,10,1rgvds,,59,"So my good friend is having a small get together at a directors house for her birthday. For context she just turned 21 and this is a director from a theater she interned at, so he's around 40. Super nice house. I agreed to be her DD so she could have her fun. I'm sipping on my only beer, completely sober, and just shooting the shit with everyone. I'm leaning in the doorway, stand up to readjust my weight, and go to lean back on the doorway. 

Except I lean on a top heavy shelf that's completely unsecured.....

The whole shelf starts to tip over. Luckily I had quick reflexes and was able to catch the shelf before it fell over completely, but it wasn't fast enough to keep ALL of his fancy martini glasses and fancy alcohol bottles from sliding off and shattering on the floor (including a random plant). The room falls into dead silence. Everybody stares at the dirt and glass on the floor and nobody knows what to do. Finally somebody gains control and starts cleaning everything up. The director is dead quiet, goes into the other room, and yells ""my GRANDMOTHER gave me those glasses!"" I'm absolutely horrified. I help clean everything up and offer to pay for whatever needs to be replaced. 

I sit down on the couch, mortified. I really want to bail the fuck out and come back later. However I was the birthday girls only ride and she wasn't ready to leave yet. She walks over to the director and gives him a hug, and I hear the tears in his voice. Muffled sobs into the girls shoulder is the only audible noise in the whole house. I stare at the only other person who had just arrived in time for my catastrophe and she gives me a ""don't worry we all fuck up"" look. The birthday girl then decides she wants to watch two fucking episodes of Dr. Who, and all the while the director is in his room, most likely crying, and doesn't come out for the rest of the night. 

When I finally get to leave and drive this girl home, he comes out, shakes my hand, and says ""Thanks for coming""

a_burning_throwaway,12,,8,1r658d,,59,"I work in a research lab, en route to getting my master's degree. It's a biochemical lab, so there's not too much that's very dangerous, and overall it's a pretty relaxed place to work. Despite official policy pretty much nobody wears lab coats or goggles, shorts abound in the summer, and gloves are mainly to keep from contaminating your sample rather than protecting your hands. It can be easy in this environment to sort of forget that safety is still important sometimes. 

Yesterday I got to the lab at 8:30 am and was there until about 8 pm, having had a lot of work to finish up. Most of my days that run that long include a lot of downtime, but on this occasion I was actually doing work for most of it. Tedious, monotonous, soul-crushing work, involving repeated treatments with a base, that left me exhausted and brain-dead at the end of the day.

I leave the lab and breathe a sigh of relief, and take a much-needed urination break before heading home. I enter the washroom, zip down, and grab my donger, as is man's sacred right. Suddenly, I feel a sort of itch. I ignore it and continue as I was, but before long the itch intensifies. And then it transforms into a burning. The burning is gentle at first; it does not remain so. Soon it feels as though a scornful fire elemental is attempting to blow me and I am trying very hard to stay still so as not to piss all over myself, despite the fiery waves of pain that now crash upon my pubic shore.

When it becomes too much to bear, I am thankfully nearly done but still manage to splatter some on my pants as I am forced to let go, doubling over with my pants half-down before I finally recover somewhat from the pain. The supernova heat has die down to a much calmer, smaller nova, and I force the thing back into my pants.

I evidently forgot to wash my hands after working with the base all day. It wasn't that concentrated, so it didn't hurt my hands or anything like that, but as soon as I touched my sensitive wang-flesh it made its wretched presence known. Looking at it once I got home, my dangler was redder than that of the devil himself and covered in delightful blisters. It still hurts like a bitch.

So story is me and my brother are trying for green cards/permanent residencies only my brother didn't come to the US on time so the day earlier, he gets kicked off the flight and is stuck in our home country and is summoned to a court hearing months later.

We look similar and our names are the same EXCEPT for my middle name which is customary (and I use this middle name) and I applied/got the job using this middle name (it didn't matter at the time - every other record was using this middle name except for my foreign passport). One week later after my brother got into this trouble (I didn't know at all about what happened), two guys in suits come up to my cubicle, and ask me my full name - I say yeah, that's me but I go by ""MIDDLE NAME"". Can you come with us please? My boss asks what the hell is going on and the immigration guys tell him I am illegally staying in the US and I will face jail time for using a fake identification. 

I went out kicking and screaming and was stuck in jail for one day until my friend comes by with another friend (lawyer) to sort out the mess. I get released with apologies. BUT that's not the bad part.

So I come back to work and get told that I am fired. My boss says he wants me back because I'm good, but the head of the firm saw the whole thing along with three rich clients who get spooked by the whole affair. The head was hoping to make a lot of business as these clients were high net worth. They leave, and taking their network and business with them.

""Overall, you lost the firm two million. Possibly more. I want you back. F***, the entire department wants you back. I even explained the whole situation and showed it was all a misunderstanding but she wouldn't listen. All my bosses say you're too much of a risk and you've done enough damage to the firm's reputation. But I can't do anything except give you this recommendation later and these contacts. I hope we can get drinks again. I'm sorry. Good luck."" I get served a termination letter the following day.

Actually_bi_not_gay,8,,17,1rd8lf,,41,"I had lunch with my mom/dad/grandma just to catch up.  I haven't really had the time to talk with them since I started my professional career.  Lunch went great,  but when I was driving them home,  I decided to stop by a grocer's first to pick up some milk. 

Some of my Ipod is classic rock songs,  which my family members like,  so instead of listening to my radio,  I just played them my Ipod.  

As I said in the title,  my family members are really religious.  They're Hispanic immigrants, they have a picture of the Virgin Mary in every room of the house,  and when they went to school their teachers were nuns,  and priests.  Needless to say they also agree with most of the Catholic church's policies. 

Well,  a few months ago I put a Redditor made song on my Ipod,  the song contained lyrics like ""I always think of guys when I beat my meat"" ,  ""Here's a list of things we like the most, cocks (dicks),  penis (pricks),  anything that's really thick!"",  ""Go to the movie just for Brad Pitt,  mad boners so my jeans don't fit"", ""I'm gay with every boy I see, don't care if they shower,  dirty, or clean"", ""it aint' wrong that I like to touch,  24/7 ain't that much"", and ""one day I saw my daddy in the shower, so I chocked my chicken for half an hour""

It seems that I forgot to delete the song from my Ipod,  and out of all the songs I have on there,  that's the song that played when I quickly went into the store to get some milk. 

When I got back to my car they all looked at me with these horrified faces.  Upon entering my car I was bombarded with questions like, ""Jaime,  what is this filth!?""  ,  ""Why did it play us that gay song?""

After looking through my Ipod,  I eventually found a song they were talking about.  I made up some excuse about one of my friends putting it on my Ipod as a joke.

But today, today I had a revelation. Today I said I would do well. 
Only had I not forgotten that something has always got to give.

Anyway. So I'm in Calculus, getting ready to start a quiz when prof asks if anyone has any questions, and I remember that I don't quite remember how to do something. So I promptly raise my hand and begin to try to explain what concept it is exactly that I am not grasping.

dudusan,5,,10,1r3xde,,38,"I occasionally go for a swim during the weekend and always top it off with some time in the spa. Whilst in the spa, I sat on a side that had broken jets. So only half the people in the spa had their jets working. When one occupant left, this 70 something year old man signalled me to come sit next to him, where the other person had just got up from. The old guy, I'll call him Peter, was a bit familiar. I had seen him at the spa a few times before. I started chatting with Peter. He was rather funny. He kept commenting on the women who were entering the spa. It was funny to me considering his age. We also spoke about other things such as my wife, his wife, his kids etc.
During the chats, when Peter was making and a joke...he would pinch me in the abdominal area. It was a bit strange but just thought, whatever, its probably just a greek gesture etc (Where Im from, we kinda clap hands whilst laughing). This goes on for about 4-5 times. When I told him i was leaving, he asked me to stay for another 5 mins. In my mind, I thought perhaps he is just a lonely man who just wants to chat. I stayed for another 5 and left. 
In the changing room, i realised someone had pinched my tshirt. Was frantically looking for it when peter walked in. He got dressed whilst I doing rounds looking for my shirt. He even assisted me by taking me to the ""lost/found"" area. I decided to just ride my bike topless and gave up looking for the shirt.  As peter was leaving too, we walked out of the complex together. As i went to my bike, Peter asked if i would like to go for a drive. I agreed and really thought that perhaps this guy has something to get off his chest or is depressed etc. Also thought wont hurt to listen to a guys issues/cries for help etc. So i got into his car and he drove to the other side of the car park. He then began talking about porn movies and i was laughing all the while. It was seriously funny that a guy his age was talking about shit like that. he then asked me why all african guys have big dicks. Now, nothing weird here....as we get this question countless times once we venture into those types of conversations. Peter then asked me if i had a big dick. Again, i laughed this off and just kinda said ...normal type. Peter then puts his hand on the back of my neck and my mind started racing. I just thought, well, if i move or reach for my shoelace, he will let go. So i did that and he let go. He then asks me if i had ever had sex with a man. At this point, i was now feeling fucking awkward and now had suspicions. So i categorically/vehemently said no and that I would never do that as I am not that way. He then reached out and pinched my nipple!  At this point I told him i had to leave. He asked if I was sure that i wanted to leave. So I left.

Thing is, I felt dirty when this guy did this. I was actually innocently thinking i'm just chatting with this guy, whilst he obviously had other intentions. I also, through this experience, know what it feels like for the waitresses who have sexual innuendo left right and centre just because they smiled at a male customer etc.

Its taken me a few days to get over this. Im certain he thinks I am playing hard to get as I did not exactly say NO to his advances (I realised it too late).

He pays the escort a few bucks—kinda just gives him a handful. I get up and he takes his time squeezing by. He’s a big big guy, wrap around Gucci shades. He gets settled, mumbling about Grimace, the big purple autistic guy from McDonalds. “You don’t know who Grimace is?” I don’t know how to respond so I give a half chuckle, then realize that he’s on his Bluetooth. He mumbles into in until the moment the plane is airborne. He’s taking up some of my seat, but I don’t say anything. No sense confronting him about something out of his control (in the short run, arguably).  I can hear his music through his Beats By Dre. Fine. I’m washed and pretty drunk so I fall asleep within minutes of take off. 

I wake up after a couple hours. The guy sitting next to me is on his laptop—looks like a music program, FL Studio or something—and even though his screen is tilted down, it’s on full bright. I can easily hear his music through his headphones. I put my headphones on and try to fall back asleep, but between the light and sound coming off of this guy, there’s no chance. I consider saying something but settle on a passive aggressive turn away from him. A half hour passes—nothing. My back is aching and my eyes are clenched shut but I’m wide awake, and getting mad. I’m thinking about calling him out: I would, all calculated, rip off my headphones, turn to him and say “Will you give it a rest?!” He’d either apologize, deferring to my obvious rightness, or say “Hey man I’m just doing my thing/I gotta work/something to this effect,” and I’d snarkily say “Well can you do it without keeping everyone else on the damn plane up?” Yeah, I’m awesome, I’m a hero. I settle on the non-confrontational route and think about asking the attendant for a sleep mask. When I open my eyes, the “call attendant” light it blinking. What happened? Is someone else gonna call this guy out? Does this airplane respond to passive-aggressive thoughts? The attendant comes over to our three-person row and waits for one of us to ask him for something, but no one does. He stands there for a beat, unspeaking, and I shrug at him without taking off my headphones. 

Let me be clear. I didn’t chicken out. I did chicken out. But I didn’t call the guy. I couldn’t just swoop in on someone else’s call.  Maybe something else was going on, something more pressing. Gremlin on the wing, et al. Then I just look like an asshole. Attendant leaves and I follow, ask him for a sleep mask cause the guy next to me has been on his laptop the whole damn flight. He tells me there’s only an hour or so until we land. Also we don’t have sleep masks. Fair enough. Head back to my seat and decide to get on my own laptop, with my f.lux lighting set to “candle—super dim.” That’ll show the fucker who’s courteous.  I organize documents, pictures; bury porn that I’d lazily saved straight to my desktop. The guy next to me pushes the attendant button. Well that solves that. Attendant comes over and the guy next to me is unaffected, looking straight ahead, absorbed by his music. I’m not about to help him so I pretend not to see the attendant. He only stays for a couple seconds this time. 

Getting near Philadelphia, tray tables go up. Guy next to me calls the attendant a third time. The light blinks for about five minutes, no doubt while the attendant decides how he’s gonna tell us off. He comes over and launches right into it, I take off my headphones. 

“…third time I’ve been over here…” 

I elbow the guy next to me, kinda hard. He jumps, takes off his Beats and looks up. 

“…even acknowledge me.” 

Guy next to me says “Sorry, I can’t see.” No shit, it’s dark and you’re wearing Gucci shades over half your face. 

“Well what do you want?” 

“Can I get a glass of water, no ice?” 

The attendant already has one in his hand. “Here, take it.” We land. Guy two rows ahead of me asks to help grab his bag from the overhead bin. Guy next to me is doing that awkward half stand of someone trying to join the sovereign people of Aislestandistan, but I’m boxing him in. His head is right in front of the bin I need to open. “Hey, watch your head,” I ask a little too softly, like I do. “Hey excuse me can you watch your head?” People are looking. Guy sitting on the other side of him taps him and he realizes what’s going on, ducks. I grab the guys bag and pass it forward. I ask the same favor of someone sitting two rows behind me. We stand for a few minutes while the uppermiddle class deplane. I do that thing you do when you’re awkwardly close to a group of strangers for an awkwardly long time—my eyes half dart around, half look down at my sweater.

ecstatic1,11,,4,1rhz0q,,24,"Little bit of back story:

Girl and I have been friends for going on 4 years now. We've really dragged each other through some shit over that time, failed relationships, a mutual friend's divorce, problems with school and work and life, etc. She's always been there for me when I needed someone to listen, and I've always tried to help her through whatever problems crop up in her life.

Me? I'm a habitual fuck-up when it comes to anything involving emotions or expressing myself, and I tend to repress feelings of frustration and aggression. I think it's a coping mechanism for when I don't feel like I've got control of my life, like I choose not to feel instead of actually confronting the thing that's causing me to feel that way. She's the kind of girl that wears her heart on her sleeve, essentially, and that's a very endearing quality to me because it helps me associate with my own emotions. It's been very helpful over the past 7 or 8 months since I've moved across the country to start a new job. It's lonely here and my friends back home, her especially, have been so supportive and helpful.

Anyway, that bit is important because for about a year now I've been trying to convince myself that I'm not romantically interested in Girl, despite the fact that I've caught myself looking at her in a way that I typically reserve for lovers. And we have fooled around in the past so I didn't think much about it (just hormones, etc.). Last time I was in town (October) we ended up having sex, after which she drove me to the airport and we said our goodbyes. Neither one of us has really mentioned the event, but I've been thinking about her more and more over the past month as I've been helping her deal with school related problems. 

So last night:

I came back from my evening run feeling the worse for wear. I'm trying to train up for a 15k back home this coming Saturday that Girl has asked me to run with her. Fuck me I'm not a runner! But she's worth the effort so here I am pushing myself through cold and rain. Well, I get home and I text her that I want to Facetime and talk a bit. She replies back that she's got a meeting real soon and she can't, but she really wants to talk to me because she's stressed and also that *she wants to tell me about this* **new guy** *she met*. What? Fuck? I thought I had more time!

I was planning on telling her how I felt this weekend, and I think I panicked a little. She caught on that something was amiss and called me up. So there I am, heart pounding, legs tight and fingers numb, looking into the face of a girl who doesn't know the train wreck that's about to crash into her from a thousand miles away.

I play it cool. ""So, I've got a problem I think you can help me out with."" ""Ok, I'll try,"" she says to me with a look on her face like she has more pressing concerns on her mind. And I could tell she wasn't expecting anything, which just made it harder. But I'm already in this far, can't back out now. I go on to tell her that there's this girl I like and I don't know how to tell her how I feel. We go back and forth on some questions, and she figures out pretty quickly that I'm being a coy motherfucker and calls me out. 

""Is it me...?"" Lump in my throat. ""...Maybe?"" *Wry smile and puppy dog eyes*. Silence. Silence grows into awkward pause. Then the next 5 minutes is her looking like she's recovering from a car crash and me desperately trying to explain that I can't help how I feel. ""Maybe I'm just being an idiot,"" I say. ""I didn't want to tell you like this, but I can't help how I feel and I wanted you to know."" And she's obviously distraught, and our conversation keeps getting interrupted as her sister enters and exits her room so the awkwardness only exasperates. Finally I just go and say, ""I can't help the way I feel. *I love you and I can't change that.*"" She looks like a deer in headlights. ""I have to go to my meeting, I'm really sorry I don't know what to say right now..."" Boom. Done. Conversation ends.

And here I am today, wearing my dunce hat and feeling like a total selfish asshole. I've fucked up a lot in my life, Reddit. But last night, I think, was my crowning glory. Please induct me into the Hall of Fucked.

octnoir,7,,4,1rbzx2,,19,"Years ago when I was in college, I had an acting class where we all had to act out a ten minute scene in groups (groups of 4). My team decided to do everything last minute (day before our presentation was due), and since I have a background in filmography, cinematography and do videos on a daily basis, I did the camera work and was responsible for editing.

I use Adobe Premier Pro and the editing was impossible and I have an old machine (the render took bloody hours - it finished right before we had to present the video). Also, just how my camera takes footage and it gets imported into Premier Pro, it is automatically zoomed in 50% (because it has to fit a format) and so I have to manually unzoom each of the clips (I took hundreds and there isn't a multi-select option/automatically make it unzoom). It's really late into the night and I might have skipped a couple of clips.

SO, the video is done rendering JUST as we had to present the video. And because it's college and I had a 100 other things, I just slept through the video and the entire class. 20 minutes later (at the end of class), I am woken up by a very tight slap from my female friend: ""You f***ing a**hole"" and she stormed off. I was like WTF, but the entire class and even the professor were shooting me daggers.

I immediately watch the finished video - effects were fine, cuts are flawless, sounds good, so what's the problem? WELL, it turns out one minute of the finished film was zoomed in of the ten (hundreds of clips I sorted last night were perfectly fine, just two of them were not). AND it just HAPPENED to be zoomed in on my friend's ample and shapely breasts. So imagine this - for one minute you could only see boobs on the screen when there was supposed to be a dramatic dialogue. I immediately put my face into my hands and tried to hope it was all a bad dream. It wasn't.

Aftermath: I had to beg the professor to not give my team a failing grade, and accepted one instead. I had to go to a sexual harassment seminar. Everyone in university thinks I'm a creepy perv AND everyone now knows that my mild mannered, very nice and shy friend has large breasts. She was also my crush and was about to break up with her boyfriend, and showed some interest in me. Now she absolutely hates my guts even after five years. And her boyfriend (now broken up) gave me a very stern lecture about the whole thing.

To this day, NO ONE believes I did this on purpose. I SWEAR I HAD NO IDEA, and I have now switched to Final Cut Pro.

I WILL NEVER USE ADOBE PREMIER PRO EVER AGAIN.

TLDR: Premier Pro is stupid and zooms in on clips. It zoomed in on my friend (crush)'s ample bosoms during one minute of a scene which I didn't notice due to lack of sleep. To the entire class of hundred students and one strict professor. F*** Premier Pro.",TIFU by making a video zoom in,23,tifu

l3radrocks,9,,6,1r6lt9,,15,"   To really understand this story, you need to know a little about my school. I live in a metropolitan area in the South. Being in the south, most adults have absolutely zero clue of how computer work or function. That included my Digital Tech teacher. I had planned originally to take computer ed classes my whole high school career, but the was already stopped my freshmen year because my High School forces us to take Health and P.E our freshmen year, and I took Spanish as my second elective. So this year I was naturally excited when I finally got to sign up for my computer class. Growing up, there was never any real adult that could teach me about anything related to computers so I was interested in what I would learn in this class. I hoped that it would be a lot. I was dead wrong. Put quite simply, my teach is an idiot.
   
Now, I usually don’t mind teachers even if I personally don’t like them, but this teacher is fully honestly an idiot, and frankly the whole class is idiotic. A perfect example was our first project. We were charged with choosing parts to build our computer. I thought that this would be an easy A and breezed through it. Here’s the good part, I failed it epically. First of all, she took of TWENTY points for not including a FLOPPY DRIVE. Yes, my teacher still believes that floppy drives are still regularly used.  As I stood there baffled by this, she tells me that she is going to take ANOTHER TWENTY points off for using Pcpartpicker.com instead of an excel spreadsheet, when she explicitly told us that we could do the list any way we wanted. Not wanting to cause a scene, I bit my tongue.
  
 Fast forward an excruciating four months of me correcting her pretty much daily on most things she says about computers. For a week now she has been saying that our next project will involve making a game and programming it ourselves. I dance with joy thinking that I might learn something useful finally, after getting through topics such as “Digital Safety”, and “Good online citizenship”. Well fuck was I wrong. She announces a day later that we will be using Scratch.com. If you aren’t aware of what scratch.com is, it is pretty much a program intended for elementary school kids to teach them how to program. Don’t get me wrong, it’s great but I was expecting something actually interesting. So we weren’t supposed to start this project until next week, but I usually do 2 weeks’ worth work daily in that class, seeing as how it is 99% busy work (She has only stood and lectured us once). So the next day, I get started in the Scratch project. I decide to just make a simple space shooter, a lot like Galactica. Finished in in two days, and it worked perfectly. Had 2 weeks’ worth of work done in 2 days. I was free to sleep and read in that class for 2 whole weeks.

This morning, she starts yelling at the class for playing games and being on sites they aren’t supposed to, and said that she had already written some of us up for playing games; all the whole staring at me with a smirk on her face. Of course, the first thought that pops to mind is that she is going to write me up for playing my own project. I already knew she hated me. There is no question about it, everyone in the class knows it. I tried to no get on her bad side even after floppy drive incident, but it did inevitably happen. I don’t purposely aggravate her, her whole experience in our class is a lot like one of those days when nothing ever goes your way. I don’t mean it to be like that, but it is. 
 
  Now to the inevitable. I spent all day today freaking out whenever they called on the intercom, expecting them to say “Mrs.OP, can we have l3radrocks to the administrative offices please.” To my surprise it never happened. I got home today relieved, thinking that it was another blank threat like she always gives me, or that I was just imagining the whole thing. 
 
  My county has this whole website that you login into with your student ID, and they have online textbooks and your grades posted there. And to my horror, in big bold letters – “This student number has been suspended”. 
   
What my school does whenever you are disciplined for computer incidents, they suspend your student Id and in turn, your computer privileges. Right now I am waiting for the inevitable call tomorrow to the administrative offices, ruining my perfect disciplinary record. 

tl;dr - I make a scratch game as a project for my class, and get written up for it.",TIFU by Making a Scratch Game,21,tifu
MadameQuiggles,14,,14,1r4chx,,13,"Today when I went to put away the laundry for my mother I found out that she was upset at me because I didn't hear the buzzer go off. I continued to fold the laundry so there wasn't much to get in trouble for, but out of no where my mother starts yelling ""You never do anything unless I get mad or unless it's on your damned computer!"" Wow. Okay, that was totally out of the blue and I know that if I say anything back it will just be wrong, so I just continue and finish folding the clothes and fall back to my bedroom after I'm done. 
""GET YOUR ASS OUT HERE."" .. what did I do now? I continue to walk out in to the kitchen where my mother waits impatiently for me and then screams to sit down at the kitchen table. ""YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING I ASK AND YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ME. YOU ONLY SIT ON YOUR COMPUTER AND PLAY SHITTY GAMES AND WANT TO BE WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING HELPFUL AROUND THE HOUSE ANYMORE. WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO LIVE WITH YOUR GRANDMOTHER AND GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE? I'M FUCKING DONE."" All of this followed by my mother stomping out of the front door and slamming both the main door and the screen door. Unable to really control my tears, seeing as how I was just told how worthless I was and to get the ""fuck out"" of my home... I continued to pick up the glass jar she smashed against the kitchen floor and put away the laundry I was busy with before this ordeal broke out. 

I figured I might as well take this as the time to try to move out. I'm eighteen and in college. My home-life has gone down-hill very fast since my mother had been diagnosed with a specific type of bone cancer. She feels horrible every day and I try my hardest to please her, but I suppose this was the chance I needed to take to have at least a week to calm both of ourselves down until we can talk about a compromise of our feelings. I addressed this idea to my brother and father and both of them told me to do as I felt was best, but of course my father wanted me to stay at home and just ignore it until she was calm. Nearly impossible. 

When my mother got home again I asked in a very nice way if I could spend a few days over at my friends house (this friend had been there through the entire thing and was planning on leaving that day anyways). Mother was very unhappy. ""No. No. Because I said no. No. No, you will not."" Well.. I did anyways because I'm eighteen and I suppose I'll have to learn from my experiences and this will be one of them, whether I made a huge mistake or not. My mother went on another tantrum and started hitting things off of the walls and blurted out ""I'M LEAVING."" slammed the door and left in the truck. I was told to leave everything behind, but we all know we can't survive with nothing. I took whatever I could and had my friend help me pack. I had her mother on the way to help us get to the McDonalds to activate my old WalMart phone online when I realize that I can't do that until the battery's charged. 
*So here I am, sitting at the shitty fast food restaurant at 6:30 PM with no phone or anything really.* I decided to go to my boyfriends, which no one expected, and was able to contact my grandmother. 

I am now sitting at my grandmother's house, which I guess is now my ""home.""  Today was truly my biggest fuck up of my eighteen years on this planet. 

**EDIT:** So I went to try to confront my mother about a possible agreement as to how we could settle our issues and just let things slide back down the pointy slope until we were okay again... That went HORRIBLY. I came back with my grandmother after receiving a text stating my mother was starting to gut out my room (Which had roughly a grand worth of money of electronics, if not more, still inside that I couldn't get in my rushed exit).  My mother was breaking down in tears on the porch when we arrived, which tore me apart, and my grandmother and I tried to talk with her but all we got was that she wasn't over it and she didn't want to talk. I gathered what I could, all of my expensive items and got out. 

After I transported all of my items my grandmother decided it might be a good idea to open up my own bank account; my original one was attached to my father's account. So we went to do that, but had to postpone it due to my lack of ID that I forgot that morning in a scrambled mess to get my items. On the way BACK to the bank, the second time, my grandmother received a text stating that my mother couldn't take it and she just wanted to hug and hold me again. We decided the bank could wait. 

When I got back to the house, I came inside and I told my mother I was there for her and that everything was okay. I comforted her as best as I could and eventually i got out of her that she didn't want me to move out and that she wouldn't scream anymore and that she was sorry for her actions. She for some reason was convinced I wouldn't move back in and told me to take the white car so I could get to college and back every day on my own.. sweet, but I don't think I'd be able to take the car if it was at my grandmothers and I was at home. 

In the end: My mother needed to rest so my grandmother and I fixed supper for everyone and served her what she felt she could eat, she helped me to reactivate my cell phone so I could have a means of communication again, I brought my stuff back over and told my mother that I would stay, but eventually she will have to come to terms that I am not her and I do not see everything she thinks needs to be done every day. And that she couldn't have been so upset over dirt that she would be THAT upset: something else must have been really pulling her down, but I would be there for her.

Fast forward to today. I am copying about 300GB of data (pictures and stuff mostly) from one drive to another, when I accidentally hit the power switch for my PC with my foot. After powering  back up I notice 2 of my drives are missing from the system overview (2x2TB WD green drives, both of which were pretty full). After a lot of work I have managed to recover about 600GB from one of the drives.

owlbrowneyes,3,,7,1r9heo,,10,"So there is this coworker I have , she comes in on Sundays.
I work part time so she isn't a big problem , but sometimes she is the reason that I don't even want to go to work. 

Maybe I'm not use to the way she wears her heart on her sleeve. 

Sometimes she is moody , other times she is not. 

A couple weeks ago , I get called up to a register. It's getting pretty busy so I just jump on to the first free one I see. 

This lady comes back from her break and kicks me off. 
I opened the store and that was the register I picked. I came in before her, but you know whatever . It's busy and I'd rather just help take care of the line. I don't really care what register I'm on. The managers have no specifications for those either.

So I jump on to register 7. No one else is on there , I'm assuming they're on their break and won't really care. 

I begin ringing up the customer, and when she hands me a large bill I find there's not enough to give back in less bills. So I call the front-end manager to try and come get me change. 

She doesn't hear me. By now the coworker who was on there comes back. ""Oh no this isn't going to work owlbrowneyes"". 
I try again to call the front-end manager. She hears me. 

But it's too late, the coworker grabs the cash out of my hand in front of the customer and just starts giving it to her. 

I can't get yell at other people who I don't know without needing to cry. Most of my coworkers know that I'm generally not the yelling type.

So I just walk away from the register. Just to calm myself down I walk around the store recovering. 

She's in general rude like this, has an attitude. Maybe it's just the way I perceive her. 

But I couldn't stand it anymore.

So I told my manager. I was actually so upset that I began crying (this was due to other reasons more so than her). And he said he'd talk to the general manager about it as well as the coworker. I'm sort of worried that he mentioned my name. 

She and I talk very rarely but I can't stand being near her when at work. In the past she has been rude before. I can tell she makes subtle jokes about me.

Due to an agreement between myself and the prof, i would be able to attend class, read the material and participate in discussion, but not be actually registered for the class at all, even as an auditor.

 This was all going fine until today when i went for advisement. I am due to graduate this December, but found out that I cannot due to a three hour credit shortage in my major field. The kicker is that if I had been registered for the class, everything would have been fine. So, I did actually need the class...

I explained how I sucked at analyzing stuff and she just kept laughing.  As I was walking out she asked what my major, I said BioPsych and she then said, ""That explains everything!""  

I then went home really confused as to why she had laughed and told my roommates I had said to her that I suck at reading context clues and said I was illiterate, then began laughing and told me that I had basically told her I couldn't read instead of saying literal. 

I almost wanted to send her email and apologize for being half stupid but I couldn't get myself to do it.

TL,DR:  Told my ta I was illiterate instead of literal and she didn't correct me.

I grabbed a cup from the counter and started scooping water out of the toilet and into the sink. After a couple minutes of that when the sink was full too, I realized the fucking sink was clogged also! So I started pouring it into the shower. Once the water stopped flowing and I scooped out enough water so that it wouldn't overflow, I took a bunch of toilet paper to try and clean up the flooded floor. After a few minutes of wiping I realized I couldn't even flush the soaked toilet paper down the toilet... So I had this nasty pile of soaking toilet paper sitting on the floor.

Yesterday we moved the final things out of her old apartment and I needed emotional support, but she was out at ballet for the evening which was okay, I knew how much ballet means to her and I'd never want to take that away from her. 
 This morning she had ballet again, and when she finally got home we talked for a couple minutes. But I come to find out she is sleeping over at her friends to watch the One Direction..7 hour stream. (Wont go into that bit) and everything that's built up over the last few days just burst. Just on Monday we had argued after I said some nasty stuff then too. Before this week we hasn't even argued. 
 This time around I basically told her that it seemed like she doesn't even care about me, and that she only cares about herself (which in hindsight is the furthest thing from the truth). And well, needless to say that hurt her a lot. I also stupidly asked that we stop seeing one another (which, is the last thing I'd ever want). So I called her after we calmed down a bit and I'm trying to apologize over and over, she said she needs time to think...in my past relationships that's never a good sign.
 Normally I wouldn't really care, but this girl I really could see spending my life with. I love her with all of my heart, and I'd go through Hell for her. I don't want to lose her, I don't think I could handle it. Plus I know she has a lot going on as well right now, and that I'm not exactly helping her out much.
 Sweetie, if you read this, I want you to be happy, and as much as it hurts to say, if being happy means that you leave me..then that's what I want for you.

So I get out my notebook, look at the board, and see the homework. I decide to start. I am in the back of the classroom; hard to get to. So whenever they came around, I just covered it with the graph paper. I was doing **NONE** of the classwork, just the homework.

So at the end of the class, the teacher says:

*""Every year, someone feels they are just, just too smart for my class.""*

My cheeks redden...

*""So they do the homework during class. This upsets me...""*

I am jumping in my seat.

*""Emily, this year, has decided to be that person.""*

I am relieved as he takes her paper from her. Now she has to do it herself. But then I remember! *I get time to finish my homework in class!* Not enough to do all of it, but what would the teacher say? *""Done already?""*

So, from there I went on auto-pilot. I said:

""Mr. Doe (real name secret), [pause] I must confess. I did just that.""

So he gets up, takes my paper, and tells me:

*""wessles, you were honest, so I will take your paper, but also award you with a 'doing the right thing' award""*

The 'doing the right thing' award, is when they call you out on being a good person. So, at that point, completely forgetting why I told him, I get out a piece of paper, and do my homework again. I finish, class is over (no homwork free-time), and I get my paper back, surprisingly.)

DontJustStare,358,,373,1r5y5m,,784,"Usually, I don't eat breakfast, but that didn't matter because my crush was working at the cafe this morning rather than tonight, so that meant I was going to buy breakfast. *(Don't ask how I knew he had a morning shift this morning. I'm not a stalker; I'm just ..observant and resourceful.)*

Before I left I was sure to apply a little foundation and mascara; probably the amount of makeup a normal girl would wear. Usually, I don't bother as I am not the spend-forever-getting-ready kinda girl. Although he has always been friendly and nice, he has never done anything to give me the impression that he was interested, yet I always make the effort to look nice whenever I know I will be going to the cafe. (I know, kinda pathetic) 

Business was slow--probably because it had just opened and normal people aren't up so early, so it was basically just us two and his other coworker. I have liked this guy for the longest and we have hardly spoken other than about the food and other short chats, nothing personal, but this morning that finally changed. He initiated a conversation, and we wound up talking for a bit, including plans for this weekend. I was beginning to think he was going to actually ask me out! But then business started to pick up. He asked for my number, so we could talk more later. I played it cool on the outside, but on the inside I was doing a [dance](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lu6b99ng2s1qew6kmo1_500.gif) . 

So, I reach for my bag to get a pen and paper to give him my number since he didn't have his phone on him. Being a little too eager and naturally clumsy, I knocked over my book bag, causing some of the items to fall out. **FUCK ME** Guess what pops out... My fucking dildo.

What can I say? I am a horny girl and it's been 6 months, hence my thirstiness for this guy. I had spent the previous two nights away from home, and I had to rush to pack this morning because I took so long to get ready and prettify myself. In haste, I stuffed whatever I could in the other bags and just so happened to place Sparky in the bag I carry around with the intention of removing it once I got home. 

My eye balls nearly pop out of the sockets in disbelief, and I hurried up and shoved it back in the bag as if that would make him unsee it. I knew it was too late; he undoubtedly saw my 8inch faux cock. *fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck*. 

I expected him to say he had to hurry and get back to work and try to get out of the situation, so I tried to make it less awkward by just telling him, ""Sorry, I don't have any paper. Maybe next time,"" I said in a nervous voice and got out of there. I don't think the situation could have been any more awkward. I just didn't know what to say. My face was down, avoiding eye-contact out of embarrassment most of that time, so I'm not entirely sure how he reacted, but he was probably thinking *WTF, I knew this bitch was weird, but damn*.

I am always cock-blocking myself by being a werido. Well, looks like it's just me and sparky tonight. :( *Forever alone*. 

**TL;DR: My crush for the longest finally gave me the chance to get the D and I cock-blocked myself by dropping my dildo.**


**EDIT:** A couple of points I want to clarify as it seems I was not clear. I do not carry this dildo around on a daily basis. I had brought it with me while I was away from home in a couple of nights. I was rushing to make it to the cafe as well as check out by a certain time, so I just threw my things in my bags. 

*(Sidenote: I clean my dildo before and after each use to prevent UTIs so even if I was carrying it around &amp; ret-ta-go at any time, it would not put me at any risk)*

Also, the cafe he works at is not Starbucks. I took the photo of inside my book bag (listed in a comment below) later that day in Starbucks to *prove* I was not making this up.

Lastly, the dildo came fully out, so it's not like there is a chance he could not have seen it. After it came out, I pretty much avoided eye contact or looking at him at all, so I don't know what he was thinking. 

Now that I have read each comment, it seems like nearly every person is saying the same thing, which is that he doesn't think I'm a weird freak. There is a chance that I may have been over-thinking this situation with my typical skewed, negative perspective. Perhaps, in a few days, I will revisit the cafe without bringing it up and give him my number (I liked this idea more than apologizing as it avoids making it more awkward IMO). I am just terrified of rejection, so I don't know if I will or not. If I do, I will definitely update!

I went back to the cafe tonight, and he was there (which I figured as he usually works late Sunday nights). However, I didn't give him my number. I was prepared to write my number down on the receipt, so I didn't make it obvious how planned it was by already having it written down...but I chickened out. He just acted so normal, and I didn't know how to bring it up. ""Oh so, did you still want my number?"" I'd sound like a total loser. I started over-thinking it. I didn't even stay and eat what I ordered; I got it to go. I probably won't go back either. I mainly went there to steal glances at him. Oh well. . .

SexxSyrup,206,,254,1rhoin,,708,"**Context:** Happened last week. I teach English abroad and this had been a topic of conversation in a hostel dorm room for several people.

I checked into a hostel, got up to my dorm, and quickly introduced to myself to the other 2 people in the room, lets call them Mary and Sue. Mary was a nice girl from Germany who got to chatting with me. I said hello to Sue, but she pretended not to hear me.

*fast forward*

I start noticing some strange things about Sue: She lit a candle and blew it out again and again. When we finally fall asleep, she starts having night terrors, screaming things like ""DON'T TOUCH ME, GET AWAY FROM ME, NO NO NO,!"" The next morning, Mary tells me that Sue had been crying the whole day before. I start to think she had gone through some abuse recently.

*fast forward*

We're all in the room, she starts to cry again, and I asked, ""Are you okay?"" with no response. I said it again, and oh boy did I make a mistake. She went into this rant about how all English teachers do is rape their children, rape their students, rob their host countries, and neglect to learn the culture or language. She continued to say that if I would like to speak to her, I should speak to her in her native tongue, Finnish (ignoring the irony of conveying this message in perfect English). I was told to stop bullying her, that I denied her the right to lay in her bed, that I couldn't possibly have anything valuable to retort because I'm English (I'm American).

That night, I feared for my life.

I've had 4-5 female friends for almost 10-11 years and one since high school. With two, there were romantic feelings when we started talking, but that fizzled out and now it's just casual friendship (ie, how's your mom, the kids, etc). Off and on throughout the years we'd keep in contact via text just to see what's happening in each other's lives. Marriages, kids, buying houses, etc., when something big or a birthday came around a text would be sent off, catch up for a bit, and then back to no word for a year or more. 

When my mom died earlier this year there were two of these friends who were very supportive and I've kept up with them more and more, culminating in exchanging about 700 texts last month during the worst of my so far grief based depression. At this point I haven't been able to seek therapy because of my schedule, but once the semester is over that will happen. Nothing sexual is desired from either one of these friends; both are happily married with kids. In fact the last conversations were about classes, banana bread, and Thanksgiving plans. 

The part where I fucked up is that I never knew how my wife would take me having these female friends (who I haven't seen in over 10 years), so I never told her about them. All the conversations have been unknown to her until yesterday when she noticed a high number of texts on the bill and found the history. 

She is absolutely distraught and told me that she has lost trust in me. I know it looks horrible from the outside looking in.

Maleus21,17,,35,1r1h9k,,155,"This actually happened a while back, but I just found this sub, and since all of my friends love this story, I might as well share it with everyone here.

So a while back, my friend and I worked together on 2nd shift. We normally got off work around 10pm, and it was customary for us to stay up late after work, since we didn't need to be in until late afternoon. So this day, my friend asks me to help him get a weight bench he is getting off of craigslist after work. I didn't have anything else going on, so I gladly offered a helping hand. 

The house we were going to was around 45 minutes away, so while getting gas before heading that way, I went in the gas station and picked up a king size Reeses cup and a large Red Bull to give me some energy after work. This was to be my undoing, because little did I know at that time, I am severely lactose intolerant (I never put 2 and 2 together, and didn't have insurance at the time, so I just thought I had stomach issues). 

So on the way there, we are just idly talking, I finish my 4 peanut butter cups and don't think a thing about them. About 15 minutes later, I feel a slight rumble in my stomach, since stomach problems are normal for me at this time, I pass it off, because I know Ill be home within a couple of hours. About 15 minutes later, the rumbling is more intense, and realize that my friends bathroom will probably receive the brunt of my soon to be coming anal assault. A little while later, we are in the person's neighborhood, and I'm starting to think that a gas station on the way home is inevitable. 

Finally we get to dude's house. He is a nice guy, weight bench is in his garage, but unfortunately it is fully assembled (it is one of those huge all in one machines). Well I haven't told my friend about my stomach, and he and the seller are finalizing the deal, then begin talking about how we are going to secure it in the back of my truck. At this point, I am almost in a cold sweat, my ass cheeks are so clenched so tight, you couldn't fit a needle between them. 

We have now finished loading the weight bench, I am giving myself pep talks and saying a prayer for every step I am taking. I do not want to ask a complete stranger whom we just met off of craigslist to use his bathroom obviously, but things are getting bad. That's when it happens... We are exchanging pleasantries, saying thank yous, and about to get in the truck. I am scouring my brain trying to think of the nearest gas station that I saw on the way there, and decide to let a tini-tiny little bitty poot out just to relieve some of the pressure, as my insides feel as though I am about to explode. Well ladies and gents, when you are in that condition, never ever trust a fart.

It broke the ass seal that my cheeks had welded together, and out comes a torrential down-pour of shit. I could feel it coming, I did my best to squeeze my ass together as tight as I could, which ended up resulting in ass cramps along with the spasms of my intestines wanting so desperately to empty, going against every ounce of my soul trying to stop it. The result was excruciating pain, which resulted me kneeling down, screaming in agony. 

Keep in mind, I had not let on to either of these guys that my stomach was even remotely upset, and I'm sure the sweating was mascaraed by the fact that this was taking place during the summer. So to them, it looked as if I just became possessed and began screaming. So now I am kneeling on the ground, my underwear filled up like a babies diaper, my friend is freaking out,  and the guy from craigslist is no doubt regretting every second of this transaction by now.

I slowly stood up, gathered what I could of myself, and kindly asked the seller if I could use his bathroom. His response was simply ""Umm sure dude, in and to the right, last door on the left"". I slowly walked in the house, praying that no small shit nuggets fell out onto their carpet on my way there. After I got in the bathroom, I took a look at the damage, it was irreparable. Now I had to make a decision, walk outside holding underwear, leave a pair of shit pants in his garbage, or option 3. I emptied as much as I could into the toilet, took out my pocket knife, and cut the massive shit stain out of my underwear. This was obviously was a much smaller piece of cloth, which allowed me to wrap it up in a massive amount of toilet paper and stick it in my pocket. I then cleaned my ass as much as possible (I didn't want to shower in his house also, I was already mortified). Put my holy boxers back on, walked outside, went straight to my truck thanking him as I walked by, got in and immediately drove off. Down the street I threw the shit wad out of the window, and began explaining the story to my now laughing so hard he cant breathe friend. 

I asked my friend if the guy had said anything when I went in his house. His reply to my friend ""Its just a hunch, but I think your friend needs to shit"".

This actually occurred a little under two years ago but anyway.

Every year during the long summer holidays my family have a tradition of heading up to go camping on the East coast of the North Island (NZ). The spot where we go is seriously a fairy tale place: a huge bay with golden sweeping sands, constant sunshine, warm water, big waves, few people, reefs to explore, you get the idea. This year I happened to know that there was a girl there I'd met the previous year who was quite into me. As you can imagine, I'm well keen. The morning after we arrive, virtually as soon as I get up, she bounds over and says she's taking me for my first swim, right now. I'm all about it so we head out into the blue to get wet (me hoping other things may get wet later on). I dive into the water and that's where things begin to take a turn for the unexpected.

As soon as I come up I realise the left side of my face is numb and I can't speak. 

Yep, you guessed it. Brain hemorrhage. 

Ended up spending two weeks in hospital, three months off school and two years later I still can't attend school 5 days a week because I get too tired. I haven't had any luck with the ladies since then either, may or may not be related.

N_skrilla,54,,37,1r5npr,,120,"So around this time of year at the organic garden I work at, all of the hottest peppers we've been growing from early in the year have finished ripening, and are ready to be processed. My job in this is to take the dried habaneros and use a small device to grind them into pepper flakes.

Now anyone thats ever eaten a habanero knows that they are one spicy motherfucker of a pepper. Like 100 times more potent than a jalapeno. And to top it off, if you touch one of them with your bare hands, it'll burn like a motherfucker for about an hour.

So as I was making the emptying the flakes into a container, some of the residual powder left over spilled onto the leg of my pants. I thought nothing of it at the time, and just figured I'd wash my pants after I got done with my shift in a few hours.

Well once those few hours had passed, I had totally forgotten about the seemingly minor incident. When I got home and got ready to take a shower, I must have thrown my underwear on top of my pants; right where the habanero powder had set in. After I got out of the shower and put them back on, it took about 5 minutes after for me to realize how badly I fucked up.

The burning set in, as well as the panic. It started off as a dull burning which was uncomfortable but bearable, but just kept elevating for a solid 15 minutes. To give you a good idea of how this felt, just imagine the spiciest thing you've ever eaten in your life, the try to imagine that burning sensation of your gens. Hell, even the ""icy hot to the balls"" challenge didn't hold a candle to this. I immediately ran to the bathroom to try to wash the stuff off, but once it sets in you just have to ride it out. The burning went on for a solid hour before it decided to die down, and all the while I was sweating like hell and trying not to vomit from the shear pain of the whole ordeal.

tl;dr: Got one of the spiciest peppers in the world on my genitals, and I had to ride the pain out for an hour.

fatdumbbitch,18,,43,1r40dm,,77,"When I was younger and first becoming familiar with my body I 'played' with a novelty baseball bat. It's a quarter of the size of a real bat and had a smooth finish. I have long since abandoned it for more appropriate battery operated devices. I cleaned it up and hid it in the back of a closet. Today I came home from campus and found my younger, autistic brother playing with the bat. He was holding it and stroking the wood and my heart stopped.

I was mortified and tried to ignore that this embarrassing childhood pleasure had resurfaced. But I wasn't gonna let this get to me. It was the end of a long day of school and work and I just wanted to have dinner and relax. Dinner had been eaten without me, so I whip it out of the fridge and into the microwave. Nothing, not even my pleasure bat, was going to keep me from relaxing. What was the worse that could happen? 

My brother obliged Murphy's law. He starts tapping it on the table to a beat set by a rhythmically challenged drummer. This interrupted my mom's favorite show, The Voice. Like one domino toppling another, my mom not enjoying her show upset my dad, who tries his best to afford her those few moments she can enjoy herself (the challenges of having an autistic child). 

Dad removes the bat from my brother's grasp and hushes any protest from my sibling. Now there's two family members that have touched my makeshift dildo. I was just gonna try and concentrate on my meal. My dad moved to get off the couch and presumably hide the bat. He however needs surgery on his leg, restricting his movement and requiring a certain amount of daily pain pills. I'm not sure if he was actually being mindful of his limitations or if he was coming up on needing more medication, but he decides he's not going to leave the couch. 

He calls me over from the dinning room, where I'm still trying to eat, and ask me to hide the bat in his room. I put on my poker face and take the bat. I stride with as much nonchalance as can be mustered, and hide the bat under my parent's bed.

FreshmanLuck,37,,38,1rbx28,,65,"This is my first semester attending college, which I'm really enjoying so far, with the exception of today's events. Aside from the general ed. stuff, I'm also taking a couple computer science classes which meet in the computer lab. Since the lab is open for students to use before and after classes, it can sometimes be difficult to find a vacant computer until right before a class begins.

Because I tend to be pretty shy I prefer to take the far corner computer which is least visible to the entire room. Since the semester started, I noticed that the same guy, whom I shall refer to as ""The Brony"", is often sitting at my computer right before the class. I call him The Brony because he has a couple different sweatshirts which he alternates and one of them has the rainbow pony character (sorry, I don't watch the show) on it. I've never really talked to him, and he's not in any of my classes. He looks to be in his late twenties or so, about a decade older than most of the other people I see around, even though I sometimes see him in the cafeteria sitting with his much younger looking friends.

One thing I hate about sharing computers is the hygienic aspect. I don't want to seem rude but this guy just never seems clean. Every time I see him at my computer he's sitting there with his thinning, greasy, stringy, untrimmed hair which just sort of hangs over his sweaty forehead and over his thick lens glasses [(which make his eyes appear to bulge out)](http://images.halloweencostumes.com/products/15274/1-1/bug-eye-specs.jpg). He also seems to wear the same clothes many days in a row. Our class meets three times a week and a few weeks I've seen him in the same nasty sweatshirt and sweatpants combo (which begins to accumulate food particles and other debris) all three days. The worst thing is that after he gets up, the chair still smells (like shit), and I'm not sure if it's because he's a bigger dude or because he's not cleaning himself properly. I don't want to know honestly. So I just switch the chair with the next one over, and then switch them again after class to make sure I'm not sitting on his chair.

Today I arrived to a packed computer lab as usual, so I went outside and sat down on some benches between that room and another classroom while I waited until I could get my usual computer back from The Brony. About 5 minutes later, I saw him walk out and proceed to grab the front of his pants to ""adjust"" himself, as though he were in his own private bedroom and not walking down a campus hallway. At the time I didn't think too much of it (except that it's pretty gross to do so in public view), so I grabbed my backpack and went to sit down at my usual spot. After switching the chair, I sat down and logged in with the keyboard. When I finally grabbed the mouse for the first time, I felt something unusual, a moistness along the sides of the mouse. I looked at the mouse and it kind of glistened (though under the florescent lights it was hard to tell). I wasn't sure if it was some kind of sweat or something else, so (stupidly) I slowly brought my fingers to my face and gave them a sniff. I nearly gagged at the unmistakable bleachy stench of semen.

I immediately got up, and walked to the nearest restroom holding my right hand out in front of me like some kind of deformed zombie, all the while mentally trying to remain calm. I stood in front of the sink for about 10 minutes just lathering my hands with soap, and rinsing them, over and over until I finally calmed down. After I dried them they were redder than I've ever seen them, but I finally felt somewhat clean. By the time I got back to class the instructor had begun talking and for the first time in my college life, I had to walk in late.

I didn't sit at my usual computer; I will never sit there again! But I did want to confirm that I wasn't imagining things, so after class I went back to the corner computer, took a plastic bag, placed it over the mouse, and opened the browser history to see if there was anything there. Seemingly endless items from Rule 34, and some furry website called e621.

NiceRideMan,4,,12,1r79fs,,57,"Preface: I live in a semi-detached house, so we share our driveway with our neighbors. There's enough room in the driveway for a total of 4 cars. They're a rather sizeable family, so they have 3 cars and pack them all into the driveway. We never did mind because we only have 2 cars, and if they park the 3rd car a little on their lawn and partially in the driveway, we can fit 5 cars. Although I didn't mind, I still found it annoying at times since it was a tight fit leaving me less room to maneuver.

The neighbors are a really nice Muslim family. Most of the reason I didn't mind them squashing 3 cars into the driveway was because they did things for us frequently. Here in Ontario, it snows a lot sometimes. If they saw that our driveway hadn't been cleaned, they'd do it for us a lot of the time. And they'd bring over leftover food from feasts, and it was so fucking good. So over those 10 years, I never said anything about their 3 cars.

Preface over, here's what happened. A couple of days ago I was at university, and my mom texted me saying the neighbor had passed away. Keep in mind this was a large family. There was an 80 year old with his wife, 2 of their kids (Both mid-30s, who had wives and kids of their own.) 10 people total. The 80 year old man passed away because his kidney failed.

The director is dead quiet, goes into the other room, and yells ""my GRANDMOTHER gave me those glasses!"" I'm absolutely horrified. I help clean everything up and offer to pay for whatever needs to be replaced. 

I sit down on the couch, mortified. I really want to bail the fuck out and come back later. However I was the birthday girls only ride and she wasn't ready to leave yet. She walks over to the director and gives him a hug, and I hear the tears in his voice. Muffled sobs into the girls shoulder is the only audible noise in the whole house. I stare at the only other person who had just arrived in time for my catastrophe and she gives me a ""don't worry we all fuck up"" look. The birthday girl then decides she wants to watch two fucking episodes of Dr. Who, and all the while the director is in his room, most likely crying, and doesn't come out for the rest of the night. 

When I finally get to leave and drive this girl home, he comes out, shakes my hand, and says ""Thanks for coming""

a_burning_throwaway,12,,8,1r658d,,59,"I work in a research lab, en route to getting my master's degree. It's a biochemical lab, so there's not too much that's very dangerous, and overall it's a pretty relaxed place to work. Despite official policy pretty much nobody wears lab coats or goggles, shorts abound in the summer, and gloves are mainly to keep from contaminating your sample rather than protecting your hands. It can be easy in this environment to sort of forget that safety is still important sometimes. 

Yesterday I got to the lab at 8:30 am and was there until about 8 pm, having had a lot of work to finish up. Most of my days that run that long include a lot of downtime, but on this occasion I was actually doing work for most of it. Tedious, monotonous, soul-crushing work, involving repeated treatments with a base, that left me exhausted and brain-dead at the end of the day.

I leave the lab and breathe a sigh of relief, and take a much-needed urination break before heading home. I enter the washroom, zip down, and grab my donger, as is man's sacred right. Suddenly, I feel a sort of itch. I ignore it and continue as I was, but before long the itch intensifies. And then it transforms into a burning. The burning is gentle at first; it does not remain so. Soon it feels as though a scornful fire elemental is attempting to blow me and I am trying very hard to stay still so as not to piss all over myself, despite the fiery waves of pain that now crash upon my pubic shore.

When it becomes too much to bear, I am thankfully nearly done but still manage to splatter some on my pants as I am forced to let go, doubling over with my pants half-down before I finally recover somewhat from the pain. The supernova heat has die down to a much calmer, smaller nova, and I force the thing back into my pants.

I evidently forgot to wash my hands after working with the base all day. It wasn't that concentrated, so it didn't hurt my hands or anything like that, but as soon as I touched my sensitive wang-flesh it made its wretched presence known. Looking at it once I got home, my dangler was redder than that of the devil himself and covered in delightful blisters. It still hurts like a bitch.

So story is me and my brother are trying for green cards/permanent residencies only my brother didn't come to the US on time so the day earlier, he gets kicked off the flight and is stuck in our home country and is summoned to a court hearing months later.

We look similar and our names are the same EXCEPT for my middle name which is customary (and I use this middle name) and I applied/got the job using this middle name (it didn't matter at the time - every other record was using this middle name except for my foreign passport). One week later after my brother got into this trouble (I didn't know at all about what happened), two guys in suits come up to my cubicle, and ask me my full name - I say yeah, that's me but I go by ""MIDDLE NAME"". Can you come with us please? My boss asks what the hell is going on and the immigration guys tell him I am illegally staying in the US and I will face jail time for using a fake identification. 

I went out kicking and screaming and was stuck in jail for one day until my friend comes by with another friend (lawyer) to sort out the mess. I get released with apologies. BUT that's not the bad part.

So I come back to work and get told that I am fired. My boss says he wants me back because I'm good, but the head of the firm saw the whole thing along with three rich clients who get spooked by the whole affair. The head was hoping to make a lot of business as these clients were high net worth. They leave, and taking their network and business with them.

""Overall, you lost the firm two million. Possibly more. I want you back. F***, the entire department wants you back. I even explained the whole situation and showed it was all a misunderstanding but she wouldn't listen. All my bosses say you're too much of a risk and you've done enough damage to the firm's reputation. But I can't do anything except give you this recommendation later and these contacts. I hope we can get drinks again. I'm sorry. Good luck."" I get served a termination letter the following day.

Actually_bi_not_gay,8,,17,1rd8lf,,41,"I had lunch with my mom/dad/grandma just to catch up.  I haven't really had the time to talk with them since I started my professional career.  Lunch went great,  but when I was driving them home,  I decided to stop by a grocer's first to pick up some milk. 

Some of my Ipod is classic rock songs,  which my family members like,  so instead of listening to my radio,  I just played them my Ipod.  

As I said in the title,  my family members are really religious.  They're Hispanic immigrants, they have a picture of the Virgin Mary in every room of the house,  and when they went to school their teachers were nuns,  and priests.  Needless to say they also agree with most of the Catholic church's policies. 

Well,  a few months ago I put a Redditor made song on my Ipod,  the song contained lyrics like ""I always think of guys when I beat my meat"" ,  ""Here's a list of things we like the most, cocks (dicks),  penis (pricks),  anything that's really thick!"",  ""Go to the movie just for Brad Pitt,  mad boners so my jeans don't fit"", ""I'm gay with every boy I see, don't care if they shower,  dirty, or clean"", ""it aint' wrong that I like to touch,  24/7 ain't that much"", and ""one day I saw my daddy in the shower, so I chocked my chicken for half an hour""

It seems that I forgot to delete the song from my Ipod,  and out of all the songs I have on there,  that's the song that played when I quickly went into the store to get some milk. 

When I got back to my car they all looked at me with these horrified faces.  Upon entering my car I was bombarded with questions like, ""Jaime,  what is this filth!?""  ,  ""Why did it play us that gay song?""

After looking through my Ipod,  I eventually found a song they were talking about.  I made up some excuse about one of my friends putting it on my Ipod as a joke.

dudusan,5,,10,1r3xde,,38,"I occasionally go for a swim during the weekend and always top it off with some time in the spa. Whilst in the spa, I sat on a side that had broken jets. So only half the people in the spa had their jets working. When one occupant left, this 70 something year old man signalled me to come sit next to him, where the other person had just got up from. The old guy, I'll call him Peter, was a bit familiar. I had seen him at the spa a few times before. I started chatting with Peter. He was rather funny. He kept commenting on the women who were entering the spa. It was funny to me considering his age. We also spoke about other things such as my wife, his wife, his kids etc.
During the chats, when Peter was making and a joke...he would pinch me in the abdominal area. It was a bit strange but just thought, whatever, its probably just a greek gesture etc (Where Im from, we kinda clap hands whilst laughing). This goes on for about 4-5 times. When I told him i was leaving, he asked me to stay for another 5 mins. In my mind, I thought perhaps he is just a lonely man who just wants to chat. I stayed for another 5 and left. 
In the changing room, i realised someone had pinched my tshirt. Was frantically looking for it when peter walked in. He got dressed whilst I doing rounds looking for my shirt. He even assisted me by taking me to the ""lost/found"" area. I decided to just ride my bike topless and gave up looking for the shirt.  As peter was leaving too, we walked out of the complex together. As i went to my bike, Peter asked if i would like to go for a drive. I agreed and really thought that perhaps this guy has something to get off his chest or is depressed etc. Also thought wont hurt to listen to a guys issues/cries for help etc. So i got into his car and he drove to the other side of the car park. He then began talking about porn movies and i was laughing all the while. It was seriously funny that a guy his age was talking about shit like that. he then asked me why all african guys have big dicks. Now, nothing weird here....as we get this question countless times once we venture into those types of conversations. Peter then asked me if i had a big dick. Again, i laughed this off and just kinda said ...normal type. Peter then puts his hand on the back of my neck and my mind started racing. I just thought, well, if i move or reach for my shoelace, he will let go. So i did that and he let go. He then asks me if i had ever had sex with a man. At this point, i was now feeling fucking awkward and now had suspicions. So i categorically/vehemently said no and that I would never do that as I am not that way. He then reached out and pinched my nipple!  At this point I told him i had to leave. He asked if I was sure that i wanted to leave. So I left.

Thing is, I felt dirty when this guy did this. I was actually innocently thinking i'm just chatting with this guy, whilst he obviously had other intentions. I also, through this experience, know what it feels like for the waitresses who have sexual innuendo left right and centre just because they smiled at a male customer etc.

Its taken me a few days to get over this. Im certain he thinks I am playing hard to get as I did not exactly say NO to his advances (I realised it too late).

He pays the escort a few bucks—kinda just gives him a handful. I get up and he takes his time squeezing by. He’s a big big guy, wrap around Gucci shades. He gets settled, mumbling about Grimace, the big purple autistic guy from McDonalds. “You don’t know who Grimace is?” I don’t know how to respond so I give a half chuckle, then realize that he’s on his Bluetooth. He mumbles into in until the moment the plane is airborne. He’s taking up some of my seat, but I don’t say anything. No sense confronting him about something out of his control (in the short run, arguably).  I can hear his music through his Beats By Dre. Fine. I’m washed and pretty drunk so I fall asleep within minutes of take off. 

I wake up after a couple hours. The guy sitting next to me is on his laptop—looks like a music program, FL Studio or something—and even though his screen is tilted down, it’s on full bright. I can easily hear his music through his headphones. I put my headphones on and try to fall back asleep, but between the light and sound coming off of this guy, there’s no chance. I consider saying something but settle on a passive aggressive turn away from him. A half hour passes—nothing. My back is aching and my eyes are clenched shut but I’m wide awake, and getting mad. I’m thinking about calling him out: I would, all calculated, rip off my headphones, turn to him and say “Will you give it a rest?!” He’d either apologize, deferring to my obvious rightness, or say “Hey man I’m just doing my thing/I gotta work/something to this effect,” and I’d snarkily say “Well can you do it without keeping everyone else on the damn plane up?” Yeah, I’m awesome, I’m a hero. I settle on the non-confrontational route and think about asking the attendant for a sleep mask. When I open my eyes, the “call attendant” light it blinking. What happened? Is someone else gonna call this guy out? Does this airplane respond to passive-aggressive thoughts? The attendant comes over to our three-person row and waits for one of us to ask him for something, but no one does. He stands there for a beat, unspeaking, and I shrug at him without taking off my headphones. 

Let me be clear. I didn’t chicken out. I did chicken out. But I didn’t call the guy. I couldn’t just swoop in on someone else’s call.  Maybe something else was going on, something more pressing. Gremlin on the wing, et al. Then I just look like an asshole. Attendant leaves and I follow, ask him for a sleep mask cause the guy next to me has been on his laptop the whole damn flight. He tells me there’s only an hour or so until we land. Also we don’t have sleep masks. Fair enough.

He only stays for a couple seconds this time. 

Getting near Philadelphia, tray tables go up. Guy next to me calls the attendant a third time. The light blinks for about five minutes, no doubt while the attendant decides how he’s gonna tell us off. He comes over and launches right into it, I take off my headphones.

I elbow the guy next to me, kinda hard. He jumps, takes off his Beats and looks up. 

“…even acknowledge me.” 

Guy next to me says “Sorry, I can’t see.” No shit, it’s dark and you’re wearing Gucci shades over half your face. 

“Well what do you want?” 

“Can I get a glass of water, no ice?” 

The attendant already has one in his hand. “Here, take it.” We land. Guy two rows ahead of me asks to help grab his bag from the overhead bin. Guy next to me is doing that awkward half stand of someone trying to join the sovereign people of Aislestandistan, but I’m boxing him in. His head is right in front of the bin I need to open. “Hey, watch your head,” I ask a little too softly, like I do. “Hey excuse me can you watch your head?” People are looking. Guy sitting on the other side of him taps him and he realizes what’s going on, ducks. I grab the guys bag and pass it forward. I ask the same favor of someone sitting two rows behind me. We stand for a few minutes while the uppermiddle class deplane. I do that thing you do when you’re awkwardly close to a group of strangers for an awkwardly long time—my eyes half dart around, half look down at my sweater.

I was visiting my best friend for the first time in his new shared flat, because he had just moved to another town to study. The flat was designed, so that the doors to all the rooms joined in the small living room together with the doors to the kitchen an the bathroom.
I met his other flatmates and they were all really nice guys.

Sat in my room (no one was home), spit in a gatorade bottle for a little while, and didnt really like it so flushed it down the toilet and rinsed my mouth out.

So me and my girlfriend are in my room, and we start fooling around, getting kinda horny. She puts her hand in my boxers, so I return the favour.

Mum is at the door. Fuck. The doorknob is turning. Shit. In she comes! 

Luckily, I'm wearing a really baggy hoodie, so covered up my junk quick enough to hide my dignity. It's a nice soft hoodie, and I learned it feels nice on your shaft. 

Nice enough to finish the job. Now I'm fucking cumming and mum is in the room asking about dinner. 

As I said earlier, this was my first time getting sucked off, so as you guys can imagine I was exploding at this stage. Mum didn't notice though, and I thought I was safe.

I plugged in my computer and opened the picture. I couldnt figure out how to put on fullscreen so my friend said ""press the button in the middle"" which turned out to be the slideshowbutton...

Apparently i uploaded the picture in the same folder as my bongpics and suddenly my bong was covering the 2x2 meter screen. My whole class knows that im a stoner so they all burst out like ""AAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAhAh"". Great way to start a presentation.

ecstatic1,11,,4,1rhz0q,,24,"Little bit of back story:

Girl and I have been friends for going on 4 years now. We've really dragged each other through some shit over that time, failed relationships, a mutual friend's divorce, problems with school and work and life, etc. She's always been there for me when I needed someone to listen, and I've always tried to help her through whatever problems crop up in her life.

Me? I'm a habitual fuck-up when it comes to anything involving emotions or expressing myself, and I tend to repress feelings of frustration and aggression. I think it's a coping mechanism for when I don't feel like I've got control of my life, like I choose not to feel instead of actually confronting the thing that's causing me to feel that way. She's the kind of girl that wears her heart on her sleeve, essentially, and that's a very endearing quality to me because it helps me associate with my own emotions. It's been very helpful over the past 7 or 8 months since I've moved across the country to start a new job. It's lonely here and my friends back home, her especially, have been so supportive and helpful.

Anyway, that bit is important because for about a year now I've been trying to convince myself that I'm not romantically interested in Girl, despite the fact that I've caught myself looking at her in a way that I typically reserve for lovers. And we have fooled around in the past so I didn't think much about it (just hormones, etc.). Last time I was in town (October) we ended up having sex, after which she drove me to the airport and we said our goodbyes. Neither one of us has really mentioned the event, but I've been thinking about her more and more over the past month as I've been helping her deal with school related problems. 

So last night:

I came back from my evening run feeling the worse for wear. I'm trying to train up for a 15k back home this coming Saturday that Girl has asked me to run with her. Fuck me I'm not a runner! But she's worth the effort so here I am pushing myself through cold and rain. Well, I get home and I text her that I want to Facetime and talk a bit. She replies back that she's got a meeting real soon and she can't, but she really wants to talk to me because she's stressed and also that *she wants to tell me about this* **new guy** *she met*. What? Fuck? I thought I had more time!

I was planning on telling her how I felt this weekend, and I think I panicked a little. She caught on that something was amiss and called me up. So there I am, heart pounding, legs tight and fingers numb, looking into the face of a girl who doesn't know the train wreck that's about to crash into her from a thousand miles away.

I play it cool. ""So, I've got a problem I think you can help me out with."" ""Ok, I'll try,"" she says to me with a look on her face like she has more pressing concerns on her mind. And I could tell she wasn't expecting anything, which just made it harder. But I'm already in this far, can't back out now. I go on to tell her that there's this girl I like and I don't know how to tell her how I feel. We go back and forth on some questions, and she figures out pretty quickly that I'm being a coy motherfucker and calls me out. 

""Is it me...?"" Lump in my throat. ""...Maybe?"" *Wry smile and puppy dog eyes*. Silence. Silence grows into awkward pause. Then the next 5 minutes is her looking like she's recovering from a car crash and me desperately trying to explain that I can't help how I feel. ""Maybe I'm just being an idiot,"" I say. ""I didn't want to tell you like this, but I can't help how I feel and I wanted you to know."" And she's obviously distraught, and our conversation keeps getting interrupted as her sister enters and exits her room so the awkwardness only exasperates. Finally I just go and say, ""I can't help the way I feel. *I love you and I can't change that.*"" She looks like a deer in headlights. ""I have to go to my meeting, I'm really sorry I don't know what to say right now..."" Boom. Done. Conversation ends.

And here I am today, wearing my dunce hat and feeling like a total selfish asshole. I've fucked up a lot in my life, Reddit. But last night, I think, was my crowning glory. Please induct me into the Hall of Fucked.

So it was a great Saturday night and I was at an anime convention preparing for the midnight rave with a couple friends  (this was last night) and we did so by having a LOT of Bacardi...

octnoir,7,,4,1rbzx2,,19,"Years ago when I was in college, I had an acting class where we all had to act out a ten minute scene in groups (groups of 4). My team decided to do everything last minute (day before our presentation was due), and since I have a background in filmography, cinematography and do videos on a daily basis, I did the camera work and was responsible for editing.

I use Adobe Premier Pro and the editing was impossible and I have an old machine (the render took bloody hours - it finished right before we had to present the video). Also, just how my camera takes footage and it gets imported into Premier Pro, it is automatically zoomed in 50% (because it has to fit a format) and so I have to manually unzoom each of the clips (I took hundreds and there isn't a multi-select option/automatically make it unzoom). It's really late into the night and I might have skipped a couple of clips.

SO, the video is done rendering JUST as we had to present the video. And because it's college and I had a 100 other things, I just slept through the video and the entire class. 20 minutes later (at the end of class), I am woken up by a very tight slap from my female friend: ""You f***ing a**hole"" and she stormed off. I was like WTF, but the entire class and even the professor were shooting me daggers.

I immediately watch the finished video - effects were fine, cuts are flawless, sounds good, so what's the problem? WELL, it turns out one minute of the finished film was zoomed in of the ten (hundreds of clips I sorted last night were perfectly fine, just two of them were not). AND it just HAPPENED to be zoomed in on my friend's ample and shapely breasts. So imagine this - for one minute you could only see boobs on the screen when there was supposed to be a dramatic dialogue. I immediately put my face into my hands and tried to hope it was all a bad dream. It wasn't.

Aftermath: I had to beg the professor to not give my team a failing grade, and accepted one instead. I had to go to a sexual harassment seminar. Everyone in university thinks I'm a creepy perv AND everyone now knows that my mild mannered, very nice and shy friend has large breasts. She was also my crush and was about to break up with her boyfriend, and showed some interest in me. Now she absolutely hates my guts even after five years. And her boyfriend (now broken up) gave me a very stern lecture about the whole thing.

To this day, NO ONE believes I did this on purpose. I SWEAR I HAD NO IDEA, and I have now switched to Final Cut Pro.

I WILL NEVER USE ADOBE PREMIER PRO EVER AGAIN.

TLDR: Premier Pro is stupid and zooms in on clips. It zoomed in on my friend (crush)'s ample bosoms during one minute of a scene which I didn't notice due to lack of sleep. To the entire class of hundred students and one strict professor. F*** Premier Pro.",TIFU by making a video zoom in,23,tifu

l3radrocks,9,,6,1r6lt9,,15,"   To really understand this story, you need to know a little about my school. I live in a metropolitan area in the South. Being in the south, most adults have absolutely zero clue of how computer work or function. That included my Digital Tech teacher. I had planned originally to take computer ed classes my whole high school career, but the was already stopped my freshmen year because my High School forces us to take Health and P.E our freshmen year, and I took Spanish as my second elective. So this year I was naturally excited when I finally got to sign up for my computer class. Growing up, there was never any real adult that could teach me about anything related to computers so I was interested in what I would learn in this class. I hoped that it would be a lot. I was dead wrong. Put quite simply, my teach is an idiot.
   
Now, I usually don’t mind teachers even if I personally don’t like them, but this teacher is fully honestly an idiot, and frankly the whole class is idiotic. A perfect example was our first project. We were charged with choosing parts to build our computer. I thought that this would be an easy A and breezed through it. Here’s the good part, I failed it epically. First of all, she took of TWENTY points for not including a FLOPPY DRIVE. Yes, my teacher still believes that floppy drives are still regularly used.  As I stood there baffled by this, she tells me that she is going to take ANOTHER TWENTY points off for using Pcpartpicker.com instead of an excel spreadsheet, when she explicitly told us that we could do the list any way we wanted. Not wanting to cause a scene, I bit my tongue.
  
 Fast forward an excruciating four months of me correcting her pretty much daily on most things she says about computers. For a week now she has been saying that our next project will involve making a game and programming it ourselves. I dance with joy thinking that I might learn something useful finally, after getting through topics such as “Digital Safety”, and “Good online citizenship”. Well fuck was I wrong. She announces a day later that we will be using Scratch.com. If you aren’t aware of what scratch.com is, it is pretty much a program intended for elementary school kids to teach them how to program. Don’t get me wrong, it’s great but I was expecting something actually interesting. So we weren’t supposed to start this project until next week, but I usually do 2 weeks’ worth work daily in that class, seeing as how it is 99% busy work (She has only stood and lectured us once). So the next day, I get started in the Scratch project. I decide to just make a simple space shooter, a lot like Galactica. Finished in in two days, and it worked perfectly. Had 2 weeks’ worth of work done in 2 days. I was free to sleep and read in that class for 2 whole weeks.

This morning, she starts yelling at the class for playing games and being on sites they aren’t supposed to, and said that she had already written some of us up for playing games; all the whole staring at me with a smirk on her face. Of course, the first thought that pops to mind is that she is going to write me up for playing my own project. I already knew she hated me. There is no question about it, everyone in the class knows it. I tried to no get on her bad side even after floppy drive incident, but it did inevitably happen. I don’t purposely aggravate her, her whole experience in our class is a lot like one of those days when nothing ever goes your way. I don’t mean it to be like that, but it is. 
 
  Now to the inevitable. I spent all day today freaking out whenever they called on the intercom, expecting them to say “Mrs.OP, can we have l3radrocks to the administrative offices please.” To my surprise it never happened. I got home today relieved, thinking that it was another blank threat like she always gives me, or that I was just imagining the whole thing. 
 
  My county has this whole website that you login into with your student ID, and they have online textbooks and your grades posted there. And to my horror, in big bold letters – “This student number has been suspended”.

I addressed this idea to my brother and father and both of them told me to do as I felt was best, but of course my father wanted me to stay at home and just ignore it until she was calm. Nearly impossible. 

When my mother got home again I asked in a very nice way if I could spend a few days over at my friends house (this friend had been there through the entire thing and was planning on leaving that day anyways). Mother was very unhappy. ""No. No. Because I said no. No. No, you will not."" Well.. I did anyways because I'm eighteen and I suppose I'll have to learn from my experiences and this will be one of them, whether I made a huge mistake or not. My mother went on another tantrum and started hitting things off of the walls and blurted out ""I'M LEAVING."" slammed the door and left in the truck. I was told to leave everything behind, but we all know we can't survive with nothing. I took whatever I could and had my friend help me pack. I had her mother on the way to help us get to the McDonalds to activate my old WalMart phone online when I realize that I can't do that until the battery's charged. 
*So here I am, sitting at the shitty fast food restaurant at 6:30 PM with no phone or anything really.* I decided to go to my boyfriends, which no one expected, and was able to contact my grandmother. 

I am now sitting at my grandmother's house, which I guess is now my ""home.""  Today was truly my biggest fuck up of my eighteen years on this planet. 

**EDIT:** So I went to try to confront my mother about a possible agreement as to how we could settle our issues and just let things slide back down the pointy slope until we were okay again... That went HORRIBLY. I came back with my grandmother after receiving a text stating my mother was starting to gut out my room (Which had roughly a grand worth of money of electronics, if not more, still inside that I couldn't get in my rushed exit).  My mother was breaking down in tears on the porch when we arrived, which tore me apart, and my grandmother and I tried to talk with her but all we got was that she wasn't over it and she didn't want to talk. I gathered what I could, all of my expensive items and got out. 

After I transported all of my items my grandmother decided it might be a good idea to open up my own bank account; my original one was attached to my father's account. So we went to do that, but had to postpone it due to my lack of ID that I forgot that morning in a scrambled mess to get my items. On the way BACK to the bank, the second time, my grandmother received a text stating that my mother couldn't take it and she just wanted to hug and hold me again. We decided the bank could wait. 

When I got back to the house, I came inside and I told my mother I was there for her and that everything was okay. I comforted her as best as I could and eventually i got out of her that she didn't want me to move out and that she wouldn't scream anymore and that she was sorry for her actions. She for some reason was convinced I wouldn't move back in and told me to take the white car so I could get to college and back every day on my own.. sweet, but I don't think I'd be able to take the car if it was at my grandmothers and I was at home. 

In the end: My mother needed to rest so my grandmother and I fixed supper for everyone and served her what she felt she could eat, she helped me to reactivate my cell phone so I could have a means of communication again, I brought my stuff back over and told my mother that I would stay, but eventually she will have to come to terms that I am not her and I do not see everything she thinks needs to be done every day. And that she couldn't have been so upset over dirt that she would be THAT upset: something else must have been really pulling her down, but I would be there for her.

*So here I am at 10:50 PM posting on Reddit, laying in my own bed, wishing this entire thing would have just never happened.*

Fast forward to today. I am copying about 300GB of data (pictures and stuff mostly) from one drive to another, when I accidentally hit the power switch for my PC with my foot. After powering  back up I notice 2 of my drives are missing from the system overview (2x2TB WD green drives, both of which were pretty full). After a lot of work I have managed to recover about 600GB from one of the drives.

owlbrowneyes,3,,7,1r9heo,,10,"So there is this coworker I have , she comes in on Sundays.
I work part time so she isn't a big problem , but sometimes she is the reason that I don't even want to go to work. 

Maybe I'm not use to the way she wears her heart on her sleeve. 

Sometimes she is moody , other times she is not. 

A couple weeks ago , I get called up to a register. It's getting pretty busy so I just jump on to the first free one I see. 

This lady comes back from her break and kicks me off. 
I opened the store and that was the register I picked. I came in before her, but you know whatever . It's busy and I'd rather just help take care of the line. I don't really care what register I'm on. The managers have no specifications for those either.

So I jump on to register 7. No one else is on there , I'm assuming they're on their break and won't really care. 

I begin ringing up the customer, and when she hands me a large bill I find there's not enough to give back in less bills. So I call the front-end manager to try and come get me change. 

She doesn't hear me. By now the coworker who was on there comes back. ""Oh no this isn't going to work owlbrowneyes"". 
I try again to call the front-end manager. She hears me. 

But it's too late, the coworker grabs the cash out of my hand in front of the customer and just starts giving it to her. 

I can't get yell at other people who I don't know without needing to cry. Most of my coworkers know that I'm generally not the yelling type.

So I just walk away from the register. Just to calm myself down I walk around the store recovering. 

She's in general rude like this, has an attitude. Maybe it's just the way I perceive her. 

But I couldn't stand it anymore.

So I told my manager. I was actually so upset that I began crying (this was due to other reasons more so than her). And he said he'd talk to the general manager about it as well as the coworker. I'm sort of worried that he mentioned my name. 

She and I talk very rarely but I can't stand being near her when at work. In the past she has been rude before. I can tell she makes subtle jokes about me.

phailcakez,7,,1,1r68uz,,11,"the short of it is, I am not officially registered for this class at all. Due to an agreement between myself and the prof, i would be able to attend class, read the material and participate in discussion, but not be actually registered for the class at all, even as an auditor. I didn't need the credits at all, so this would allow me to save some money and still take a class I was interested in and as an added bonus, I didn't have to write any papers.

 This was all going fine until today when i went for advisement. I am due to graduate this December, but found out that I cannot due to a three hour credit shortage in my major field. The kicker is that if I had been registered for the class, everything would have been fine. So, I did actually need the class...

The only reason I didn't think I needed the class was because my advisor and I went over my records this spring and he insisted that everything was good to go and I was on track to graduate with just my registered classes.

But I went ahead anyway and when I flushed the toilet it started filling with water but not draining. I kinda just stood there while the water reached the top and started pouring out onto the floor. I grabbed a cup from the counter and started scooping water out of the toilet and into the sink. After a couple minutes of that when the sink was full too, I realized the fucking sink was clogged also! So I started pouring it into the shower. Once the water stopped flowing and I scooped out enough water so that it wouldn't overflow, I took a bunch of toilet paper to try and clean up the flooded floor. After a few minutes of wiping I realized I couldn't even flush the soaked toilet paper down the toilet... So I had this nasty pile of soaking toilet paper sitting on the floor. So now the sink is full. The toilet is clogged. The shower is all wet. The floor is flooded. And there's a bunch of wet toilet paper on the floor. I kind of managed to clean most of the mess up but I decided to never ever babysit again.

jubjub2184,1,,12,1ravrf,,0,"Today I fucked up by hurting my girlfriend. My grandmother passed away last Saturday and I've been on edge because of it. Yesterday we moved the final things out of her old apartment and I needed emotional support, but she was out at ballet for the evening which was okay, I knew how much ballet means to her and I'd never want to take that away from her. 
 This morning she had ballet again, and when she finally got home we talked for a couple minutes. But I come to find out she is sleeping over at her friends to watch the One Direction..7 hour stream. (Wont go into that bit) and everything that's built up over the last few days just burst. Just on Monday we had argued after I said some nasty stuff then too. Before this week we hasn't even argued. 
 This time around I basically told her that it seemed like she doesn't even care about me, and that she only cares about herself (which in hindsight is the furthest thing from the truth). And well, needless to say that hurt her a lot. I also stupidly asked that we stop seeing one another (which, is the last thing I'd ever want). So I called her after we calmed down a bit and I'm trying to apologize over and over, she said she needs time to think...in my past relationships that's never a good sign.
 Normally I wouldn't really care, but this girl I really could see spending my life with. I love her with all of my heart, and I'd go through Hell for her. I don't want to lose her, I don't think I could handle it. Plus I know she has a lot going on as well right now, and that I'm not exactly helping her out much.
 Sweetie, if you read this, I want you to be happy, and as much as it hurts to say, if being happy means that you leave me..then that's what I want for you. I'm sorry I've been such a shitty person to you the last few days, My grandmother passing is partially why, but I can't put all the blame on that. I fucked up, I said what I said, and I can never take it back.

So I get out my notebook, look at the board, and see the homework. I decide to start. I am in the back of the classroom; hard to get to. So whenever they came around, I just covered it with the graph paper. I was doing **NONE** of the classwork, just the homework.

So at the end of the class, the teacher says:

*""Every year, someone feels they are just, just too smart for my class.""*

My cheeks redden...

*""So they do the homework during class. This upsets me...""*

I am jumping in my seat.

*""Emily, this year, has decided to be that person.""*

I am relieved as he takes her paper from her. Now she has to do it herself. But then I remember! *I get time to finish my homework in class!* Not enough to do all of it, but what would the teacher say? *""Done already?""*

So, from there I went on auto-pilot. I said:

""Mr. Doe (real name secret), [pause] I must confess. I did just that.""

So he gets up, takes my paper, and tells me:

*""wessles, you were honest, so I will take your paper, but also award you with a 'doing the right thing' award""*

The 'doing the right thing' award, is when they call you out on being a good person. So, at that point, completely forgetting why I told him, I get out a piece of paper, and do my homework again. I finish, class is over (no homwork free-time), and I get my paper back, surprisingly.) 

*""I'll give you it back. You did the right thing. Thanks wessles!""*

DontJustStare,358,,373,1r5y5m,,784,"Usually, I don't eat breakfast, but that didn't matter because my crush was working at the cafe this morning rather than tonight, so that meant I was going to buy breakfast. *(Don't ask how I knew he had a morning shift this morning. I'm not a stalker; I'm just ..observant and resourceful.)*

Before I left I was sure to apply a little foundation and mascara; probably the amount of makeup a normal girl would wear. Usually, I don't bother as I am not the spend-forever-getting-ready kinda girl. Although he has always been friendly and nice, he has never done anything to give me the impression that he was interested, yet I always make the effort to look nice whenever I know I will be going to the cafe. (I know, kinda pathetic) 

Business was slow--probably because it had just opened and normal people aren't up so early, so it was basically just us two and his other coworker. I have liked this guy for the longest and we have hardly spoken other than about the food and other short chats, nothing personal, but this morning that finally changed. He initiated a conversation, and we wound up talking for a bit, including plans for this weekend. I was beginning to think he was going to actually ask me out! But then business started to pick up. He asked for my number, so we could talk more later. I played it cool on the outside, but on the inside I was doing a [dance](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lu6b99ng2s1qew6kmo1_500.gif) . 

So, I reach for my bag to get a pen and paper to give him my number since he didn't have his phone on him. Being a little too eager and naturally clumsy, I knocked over my book bag, causing some of the items to fall out. **FUCK ME** Guess what pops out... My fucking dildo.

What can I say? I am a horny girl and it's been 6 months, hence my thirstiness for this guy. I had spent the previous two nights away from home, and I had to rush to pack this morning because I took so long to get ready and prettify myself. In haste, I stuffed whatever I could in the other bags and just so happened to place Sparky in the bag I carry around with the intention of removing it once I got home. 

My eye balls nearly pop out of the sockets in disbelief, and I hurried up and shoved it back in the bag as if that would make him unsee it. I knew it was too late; he undoubtedly saw my 8inch faux cock. *fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck*. 

I expected him to say he had to hurry and get back to work and try to get out of the situation, so I tried to make it less awkward by just telling him, ""Sorry, I don't have any paper. Maybe next time,"" I said in a nervous voice and got out of there. I don't think the situation could have been any more awkward. I just didn't know what to say. My face was down, avoiding eye-contact out of embarrassment most of that time, so I'm not entirely sure how he reacted, but he was probably thinking *WTF, I knew this bitch was weird, but damn*.

I am always cock-blocking myself by being a werido. Well, looks like it's just me and sparky tonight. :( *Forever alone*. 

**TL;DR: My crush for the longest finally gave me the chance to get the D and I cock-blocked myself by dropping my dildo.**


**EDIT:** A couple of points I want to clarify as it seems I was not clear. I do not carry this dildo around on a daily basis. I had brought it with me while I was away from home in a couple of nights. I was rushing to make it to the cafe as well as check out by a certain time, so I just threw my things in my bags. 

*(Sidenote: I clean my dildo before and after each use to prevent UTIs so even if I was carrying it around &amp; ret-ta-go at any time, it would not put me at any risk)*

Also, the cafe he works at is not Starbucks. I took the photo of inside my book bag (listed in a comment below) later that day in Starbucks to *prove* I was not making this up.

Lastly, the dildo came fully out, so it's not like there is a chance he could not have seen it. After it came out, I pretty much avoided eye contact or looking at him at all, so I don't know what he was thinking. 

Now that I have read each comment, it seems like nearly every person is saying the same thing, which is that he doesn't think I'm a weird freak. There is a chance that I may have been over-thinking this situation with my typical skewed, negative perspective. Perhaps, in a few days, I will revisit the cafe without bringing it up and give him my number (I liked this idea more than apologizing as it avoids making it more awkward IMO). I am just terrified of rejection, so I don't know if I will or not. If I do, I will definitely update!

I was prepared to write my number down on the receipt, so I didn't make it obvious how planned it was by already having it written down...but I chickened out. He just acted so normal, and I didn't know how to bring it up. ""Oh so, did you still want my number?"" I'd sound like a total loser. I started over-thinking it. I didn't even stay and eat what I ordered; I got it to go. I probably won't go back either. I mainly went there to steal glances at him. Oh well. . .

We're all in the room, she starts to cry again, and I asked, ""Are you okay?"" with no response. I said it again, and oh boy did I make a mistake. She went into this rant about how all English teachers do is rape their children, rape their students, rob their host countries, and neglect to learn the culture or language. She continued to say that if I would like to speak to her, I should speak to her in her native tongue, Finnish (ignoring the irony of conveying this message in perfect English). I was told to stop bullying her, that I denied her the right to lay in her bed, that I couldn't possibly have anything valuable to retort because I'm English (I'm American).

That night, I feared for my life.

I've had 4-5 female friends for almost 10-11 years and one since high school. With two, there were romantic feelings when we started talking, but that fizzled out and now it's just casual friendship (ie, how's your mom, the kids, etc). Off and on throughout the years we'd keep in contact via text just to see what's happening in each other's lives. Marriages, kids, buying houses, etc., when something big or a birthday came around a text would be sent off, catch up for a bit, and then back to no word for a year or more. 

When my mom died earlier this year there were two of these friends who were very supportive and I've kept up with them more and more, culminating in exchanging about 700 texts last month during the worst of my so far grief based depression. At this point I haven't been able to seek therapy because of my schedule, but once the semester is over that will happen. Nothing sexual is desired from either one of these friends; both are happily married with kids. In fact the last conversations were about classes, banana bread, and Thanksgiving plans. 

The part where I fucked up is that I never knew how my wife would take me having these female friends (who I haven't seen in over 10 years), so I never told her about them. All the conversations have been unknown to her until yesterday when she noticed a high number of texts on the bill and found the history. 

She is absolutely distraught and told me that she has lost trust in me. I know it looks horrible from the outside looking in.

Maleus21,17,,35,1r1h9k,,155,"This actually happened a while back, but I just found this sub, and since all of my friends love this story, I might as well share it with everyone here.

So a while back, my friend and I worked together on 2nd shift. We normally got off work around 10pm, and it was customary for us to stay up late after work, since we didn't need to be in until late afternoon. So this day, my friend asks me to help him get a weight bench he is getting off of craigslist after work. I didn't have anything else going on, so I gladly offered a helping hand. 

The house we were going to was around 45 minutes away, so while getting gas before heading that way, I went in the gas station and picked up a king size Reeses cup and a large Red Bull to give me some energy after work. This was to be my undoing, because little did I know at that time, I am severely lactose intolerant (I never put 2 and 2 together, and didn't have insurance at the time, so I just thought I had stomach issues). 

So on the way there, we are just idly talking, I finish my 4 peanut butter cups and don't think a thing about them. About 15 minutes later, I feel a slight rumble in my stomach, since stomach problems are normal for me at this time, I pass it off, because I know Ill be home within a couple of hours. About 15 minutes later, the rumbling is more intense, and realize that my friends bathroom will probably receive the brunt of my soon to be coming anal assault. A little while later, we are in the person's neighborhood, and I'm starting to think that a gas station on the way home is inevitable. 

Finally we get to dude's house. He is a nice guy, weight bench is in his garage, but unfortunately it is fully assembled (it is one of those huge all in one machines). Well I haven't told my friend about my stomach, and he and the seller are finalizing the deal, then begin talking about how we are going to secure it in the back of my truck. At this point, I am almost in a cold sweat, my ass cheeks are so clenched so tight, you couldn't fit a needle between them. 

We have now finished loading the weight bench, I am giving myself pep talks and saying a prayer for every step I am taking. I do not want to ask a complete stranger whom we just met off of craigslist to use his bathroom obviously, but things are getting bad. That's when it happens... We are exchanging pleasantries, saying thank yous, and about to get in the truck. I am scouring my brain trying to think of the nearest gas station that I saw on the way there, and decide to let a tini-tiny little bitty poot out just to relieve some of the pressure, as my insides feel as though I am about to explode. Well ladies and gents, when you are in that condition, never ever trust a fart.

It broke the ass seal that my cheeks had welded together, and out comes a torrential down-pour of shit. I could feel it coming, I did my best to squeeze my ass together as tight as I could, which ended up resulting in ass cramps along with the spasms of my intestines wanting so desperately to empty, going against every ounce of my soul trying to stop it. The result was excruciating pain, which resulted me kneeling down, screaming in agony. 

Keep in mind, I had not let on to either of these guys that my stomach was even remotely upset, and I'm sure the sweating was mascaraed by the fact that this was taking place during the summer. So to them, it looked as if I just became possessed and began screaming. So now I am kneeling on the ground, my underwear filled up like a babies diaper, my friend is freaking out,  and the guy from craigslist is no doubt regretting every second of this transaction by now.

I slowly stood up, gathered what I could of myself, and kindly asked the seller if I could use his bathroom. His response was simply ""Umm sure dude, in and to the right, last door on the left"". I slowly walked in the house, praying that no small shit nuggets fell out onto their carpet on my way there. After I got in the bathroom, I took a look at the damage, it was irreparable. Now I had to make a decision, walk outside holding underwear, leave a pair of shit pants in his garbage, or option 3. I emptied as much as I could into the toilet, took out my pocket knife, and cut the massive shit stain out of my underwear. This was obviously was a much smaller piece of cloth, which allowed me to wrap it up in a massive amount of toilet paper and stick it in my pocket. I then cleaned my ass as much as possible (I didn't want to shower in his house also, I was already mortified). Put my holy boxers back on, walked outside, went straight to my truck thanking him as I walked by, got in and immediately drove off. Down the street I threw the shit wad out of the window, and began explaining the story to my now laughing so hard he cant breathe friend. 

I asked my friend if the guy had said anything when I went in his house. His reply to my friend ""Its just a hunch, but I think your friend needs to shit"".

This actually occurred a little under two years ago but anyway.

Every year during the long summer holidays my family have a tradition of heading up to go camping on the East coast of the North Island (NZ). The spot where we go is seriously a fairy tale place: a huge bay with golden sweeping sands, constant sunshine, warm water, big waves, few people, reefs to explore, you get the idea. This year I happened to know that there was a girl there I'd met the previous year who was quite into me. As you can imagine, I'm well keen. The morning after we arrive, virtually as soon as I get up, she bounds over and says she's taking me for my first swim, right now. I'm all about it so we head out into the blue to get wet (me hoping other things may get wet later on). I dive into the water and that's where things begin to take a turn for the unexpected.

As soon as I come up I realise the left side of my face is numb and I can't speak. 

Yep, you guessed it. Brain hemorrhage. 

Ended up spending two weeks in hospital, three months off school and two years later I still can't attend school 5 days a week because I get too tired. I haven't had any luck with the ladies since then either, may or may not be related.

N_skrilla,54,,37,1r5npr,,120,"So around this time of year at the organic garden I work at, all of the hottest peppers we've been growing from early in the year have finished ripening, and are ready to be processed. My job in this is to take the dried habaneros and use a small device to grind them into pepper flakes.

Now anyone thats ever eaten a habanero knows that they are one spicy motherfucker of a pepper. Like 100 times more potent than a jalapeno. And to top it off, if you touch one of them with your bare hands, it'll burn like a motherfucker for about an hour.

So as I was making the emptying the flakes into a container, some of the residual powder left over spilled onto the leg of my pants. I thought nothing of it at the time, and just figured I'd wash my pants after I got done with my shift in a few hours.

Well once those few hours had passed, I had totally forgotten about the seemingly minor incident. When I got home and got ready to take a shower, I must have thrown my underwear on top of my pants; right where the habanero powder had set in. After I got out of the shower and put them back on, it took about 5 minutes after for me to realize how badly I fucked up.

The burning set in, as well as the panic. It started off as a dull burning which was uncomfortable but bearable, but just kept elevating for a solid 15 minutes. To give you a good idea of how this felt, just imagine the spiciest thing you've ever eaten in your life, the try to imagine that burning sensation of your gens. Hell, even the ""icy hot to the balls"" challenge didn't hold a candle to this. I immediately ran to the bathroom to try to wash the stuff off, but once it sets in you just have to ride it out. The burning went on for a solid hour before it decided to die down, and all the while I was sweating like hell and trying not to vomit from the shear pain of the whole ordeal.

tl;dr: Got one of the spiciest peppers in the world on my genitals, and I had to ride the pain out for an hour.

fatdumbbitch,18,,43,1r40dm,,77,"When I was younger and first becoming familiar with my body I 'played' with a novelty baseball bat. It's a quarter of the size of a real bat and had a smooth finish. I have long since abandoned it for more appropriate battery operated devices. I cleaned it up and hid it in the back of a closet. Today I came home from campus and found my younger, autistic brother playing with the bat. He was holding it and stroking the wood and my heart stopped.

I was mortified and tried to ignore that this embarrassing childhood pleasure had resurfaced. But I wasn't gonna let this get to me. It was the end of a long day of school and work and I just wanted to have dinner and relax. Dinner had been eaten without me, so I whip it out of the fridge and into the microwave. Nothing, not even my pleasure bat, was going to keep me from relaxing. What was the worse that could happen? 

My brother obliged Murphy's law. He starts tapping it on the table to a beat set by a rhythmically challenged drummer. This interrupted my mom's favorite show, The Voice. Like one domino toppling another, my mom not enjoying her show upset my dad, who tries his best to afford her those few moments she can enjoy herself (the challenges of having an autistic child). 

Dad removes the bat from my brother's grasp and hushes any protest from my sibling. Now there's two family members that have touched my makeshift dildo. I was just gonna try and concentrate on my meal. My dad moved to get off the couch and presumably hide the bat. He however needs surgery on his leg, restricting his movement and requiring a certain amount of daily pain pills. I'm not sure if he was actually being mindful of his limitations or if he was coming up on needing more medication, but he decides he's not going to leave the couch. 

He calls me over from the dinning room, where I'm still trying to eat, and ask me to hide the bat in his room. I put on my poker face and take the bat. I stride with as much nonchalance as can be mustered, and hide the bat under my parent's bed.

So here I am, trying to keep my composure with my retired dildo bat hidden in my dad's room and it's location not hidden very well from my autistic brother.

FreshmanLuck,37,,38,1rbx28,,65,"This is my first semester attending college, which I'm really enjoying so far, with the exception of today's events. Aside from the general ed. stuff, I'm also taking a couple computer science classes which meet in the computer lab. Since the lab is open for students to use before and after classes, it can sometimes be difficult to find a vacant computer until right before a class begins.

Because I tend to be pretty shy I prefer to take the far corner computer which is least visible to the entire room. Since the semester started, I noticed that the same guy, whom I shall refer to as ""The Brony"", is often sitting at my computer right before the class. I call him The Brony because he has a couple different sweatshirts which he alternates and one of them has the rainbow pony character (sorry, I don't watch the show) on it. I've never really talked to him, and he's not in any of my classes. He looks to be in his late twenties or so, about a decade older than most of the other people I see around, even though I sometimes see him in the cafeteria sitting with his much younger looking friends.

One thing I hate about sharing computers is the hygienic aspect. I don't want to seem rude but this guy just never seems clean. Every time I see him at my computer he's sitting there with his thinning, greasy, stringy, untrimmed hair which just sort of hangs over his sweaty forehead and over his thick lens glasses [(which make his eyes appear to bulge out)](http://images.halloweencostumes.com/products/15274/1-1/bug-eye-specs.jpg). He also seems to wear the same clothes many days in a row. Our class meets three times a week and a few weeks I've seen him in the same nasty sweatshirt and sweatpants combo (which begins to accumulate food particles and other debris) all three days. The worst thing is that after he gets up, the chair still smells (like shit), and I'm not sure if it's because he's a bigger dude or because he's not cleaning himself properly. I don't want to know honestly. So I just switch the chair with the next one over, and then switch them again after class to make sure I'm not sitting on his chair.

Today I arrived to a packed computer lab as usual, so I went outside and sat down on some benches between that room and another classroom while I waited until I could get my usual computer back from The Brony. About 5 minutes later, I saw him walk out and proceed to grab the front of his pants to ""adjust"" himself, as though he were in his own private bedroom and not walking down a campus hallway. At the time I didn't think too much of it (except that it's pretty gross to do so in public view), so I grabbed my backpack and went to sit down at my usual spot. After switching the chair, I sat down and logged in with the keyboard. When I finally grabbed the mouse for the first time, I felt something unusual, a moistness along the sides of the mouse. I looked at the mouse and it kind of glistened (though under the florescent lights it was hard to tell). I wasn't sure if it was some kind of sweat or something else, so (stupidly) I slowly brought my fingers to my face and gave them a sniff. I nearly gagged at the unmistakable bleachy stench of semen.

I immediately got up, and walked to the nearest restroom holding my right hand out in front of me like some kind of deformed zombie, all the while mentally trying to remain calm. I stood in front of the sink for about 10 minutes just lathering my hands with soap, and rinsing them, over and over until I finally calmed down. After I dried them they were redder than I've ever seen them, but I finally felt somewhat clean. By the time I got back to class the instructor had begun talking and for the first time in my college life, I had to walk in late.

I didn't sit at my usual computer; I will never sit there again! But I did want to confirm that I wasn't imagining things, so after class I went back to the corner computer, took a plastic bag, placed it over the mouse, and opened the browser history to see if there was anything there. Seemingly endless items from Rule 34, and some furry website called e621.

NiceRideMan,4,,12,1r79fs,,57,"Preface: I live in a semi-detached house, so we share our driveway with our neighbors. There's enough room in the driveway for a total of 4 cars. They're a rather sizeable family, so they have 3 cars and pack them all into the driveway. We never did mind because we only have 2 cars, and if they park the 3rd car a little on their lawn and partially in the driveway, we can fit 5 cars. Although I didn't mind, I still found it annoying at times since it was a tight fit leaving me less room to maneuver.

The neighbors are a really nice Muslim family. Most of the reason I didn't mind them squashing 3 cars into the driveway was because they did things for us frequently. Here in Ontario, it snows a lot sometimes. If they saw that our driveway hadn't been cleaned, they'd do it for us a lot of the time. And they'd bring over leftover food from feasts, and it was so fucking good. So over those 10 years, I never said anything about their 3 cars.

Preface over, here's what happened. A couple of days ago I was at university, and my mom texted me saying the neighbor had passed away. Keep in mind this was a large family. There was an 80 year old with his wife, 2 of their kids (Both mid-30s, who had wives and kids of their own.) 10 people total. The 80 year old man passed away because his kidney failed.

suppermick,18,,10,1rgvds,,59,"So my good friend is having a small get together at a directors house for her birthday. For context she just turned 21 and this is a director from a theater she interned at, so he's around 40. Super nice house. I agreed to be her DD so she could have her fun. I'm sipping on my only beer, completely sober, and just shooting the shit with everyone. I'm leaning in the doorway, stand up to readjust my weight, and go to lean back on the doorway. 

Except I lean on a top heavy shelf that's completely unsecured.....

Luckily I had quick reflexes and was able to catch the shelf before it fell over completely, but it wasn't fast enough to keep ALL of his fancy martini glasses and fancy alcohol bottles from sliding off and shattering on the floor (including a random plant).

It's a biochemical lab, so there's not too much that's very dangerous, and overall it's a pretty relaxed place to work. Despite official policy pretty much nobody wears lab coats or goggles, shorts abound in the summer, and gloves are mainly to keep from contaminating your sample rather than protecting your hands. It can be easy in this environment to sort of forget that safety is still important sometimes. 

Yesterday I got to the lab at 8:30 am and was there until about 8 pm, having had a lot of work to finish up. Most of my days that run that long include a lot of downtime, but on this occasion I was actually doing work for most of it. Tedious, monotonous, soul-crushing work, involving repeated treatments with a base, that left me exhausted and brain-dead at the end of the day.

I leave the lab and breathe a sigh of relief, and take a much-needed urination break before heading home. I enter the washroom, zip down, and grab my donger, as is man's sacred right. Suddenly, I feel a sort of itch. I ignore it and continue as I was, but before long the itch intensifies. And then it transforms into a burning. The burning is gentle at first; it does not remain so. Soon it feels as though a scornful fire elemental is attempting to blow me and I am trying very hard to stay still so as not to piss all over myself, despite the fiery waves of pain that now crash upon my pubic shore.

When it becomes too much to bear, I am thankfully nearly done but still manage to splatter some on my pants as I am forced to let go, doubling over with my pants half-down before I finally recover somewhat from the pain. The supernova heat has die down to a much calmer, smaller nova, and I force the thing back into my pants.

I evidently forgot to wash my hands after working with the base all day. It wasn't that concentrated, so it didn't hurt my hands or anything like that, but as soon as I touched my sensitive wang-flesh it made its wretched presence known.

  I grabbed a can of beer and was planning on watching a movie when I spilled a bit down my sweater. Annoyed at myself because I had to change, I went to take off my tops, not knowing that one of my nipple rings had become tangled in my lace top. I felt the worst pain ever and looked down in horror at the blood pouring from my nipple. Oh Jesus god it hurt so fucking bad!!

octnoir,5,,20,1r3e3g,,52,"So nearly a year ago I was working at a high end investments firm as a new analyst for a month and everything is going fine. I'm dealing with complex derivatives and modeling blah blah blah. 

So story is me and my brother are trying for green cards/permanent residencies only my brother didn't come to the US on time so the day earlier, he gets kicked off the flight and is stuck in our home country and is summoned to a court hearing months later.

We look similar and our names are the same EXCEPT for my middle name which is customary (and I use this middle name) and I applied/got the job using this middle name (it didn't matter at the time - every other record was using this middle name except for my foreign passport). One week later after my brother got into this trouble (I didn't know at all about what happened), two guys in suits come up to my cubicle, and ask me my full name - I say yeah, that's me but I go by ""MIDDLE NAME"". Can you come with us please? My boss asks what the hell is going on and the immigration guys tell him I am illegally staying in the US and I will face jail time for using a fake identification. 

I went out kicking and screaming and was stuck in jail for one day until my friend comes by with another friend (lawyer) to sort out the mess. I get released with apologies. BUT that's not the bad part.

So I come back to work and get told that I am fired. My boss says he wants me back because I'm good, but the head of the firm saw the whole thing along with three rich clients who get spooked by the whole affair. The head was hoping to make a lot of business as these clients were high net worth. They leave, and taking their network and business with them.

""Overall, you lost the firm two million. Possibly more. I want you back. F***, the entire department wants you back. I even explained the whole situation and showed it was all a misunderstanding but she wouldn't listen. All my bosses say you're too much of a risk and you've done enough damage to the firm's reputation. But I can't do anything except give you this recommendation later and these contacts. I hope we can get drinks again. I'm sorry. Good luck."" I get served a termination letter the following day.

Actually_bi_not_gay,8,,17,1rd8lf,,41,"I had lunch with my mom/dad/grandma just to catch up.  I haven't really had the time to talk with them since I started my professional career.  Lunch went great,  but when I was driving them home,  I decided to stop by a grocer's first to pick up some milk. 

Some of my Ipod is classic rock songs,  which my family members like,  so instead of listening to my radio,  I just played them my Ipod.  

As I said in the title,  my family members are really religious.  They're Hispanic immigrants, they have a picture of the Virgin Mary in every room of the house,  and when they went to school their teachers were nuns,  and priests.  Needless to say they also agree with most of the Catholic church's policies. 

Well,  a few months ago I put a Redditor made song on my Ipod,  the song contained lyrics like ""I always think of guys when I beat my meat"" ,  ""Here's a list of things we like the most, cocks (dicks),  penis (pricks),  anything that's really thick!"",  ""Go to the movie just for Brad Pitt,  mad boners so my jeans don't fit"", ""I'm gay with every boy I see, don't care if they shower,  dirty, or clean"", ""it aint' wrong that I like to touch,  24/7 ain't that much"", and ""one day I saw my daddy in the shower, so I chocked my chicken for half an hour""

It seems that I forgot to delete the song from my Ipod,  and out of all the songs I have on there,  that's the song that played when I quickly went into the store to get some milk. 

When I got back to my car they all looked at me with these horrified faces.  Upon entering my car I was bombarded with questions like, ""Jaime,  what is this filth!?""  ,  ""Why did it play us that gay song?""

After looking through my Ipod,  I eventually found a song they were talking about.  I made up some excuse about one of my friends putting it on my Ipod as a joke.

I don't think they believed my excuse. The rest of the car ride to their places was really quite and awkward.","TIFU By Accidentally Playing an Extremely Vlugar, Homoerotic Redditor Made Song to My Extremely Prude, Religious Family",58,tifu

Now, this woman is no fucking joke. Very fuck you personality and extraordinarily obvious when she's judging you.

dudusan,5,,10,1r3xde,,38,"I occasionally go for a swim during the weekend and always top it off with some time in the spa. Whilst in the spa, I sat on a side that had broken jets. So only half the people in the spa had their jets working. When one occupant left, this 70 something year old man signalled me to come sit next to him, where the other person had just got up from. The old guy, I'll call him Peter, was a bit familiar. I had seen him at the spa a few times before. I started chatting with Peter. He was rather funny. He kept commenting on the women who were entering the spa. It was funny to me considering his age. We also spoke about other things such as my wife, his wife, his kids etc.
During the chats, when Peter was making and a joke...he would pinch me in the abdominal area. It was a bit strange but just thought, whatever, its probably just a greek gesture etc (Where Im from, we kinda clap hands whilst laughing). This goes on for about 4-5 times. When I told him i was leaving, he asked me to stay for another 5 mins. In my mind, I thought perhaps he is just a lonely man who just wants to chat. I stayed for another 5 and left. 
In the changing room, i realised someone had pinched my tshirt. Was frantically looking for it when peter walked in. He got dressed whilst I doing rounds looking for my shirt. He even assisted me by taking me to the ""lost/found"" area. I decided to just ride my bike topless and gave up looking for the shirt.  As peter was leaving too, we walked out of the complex together. As i went to my bike, Peter asked if i would like to go for a drive. I agreed and really thought that perhaps this guy has something to get off his chest or is depressed etc. Also thought wont hurt to listen to a guys issues/cries for help etc. So i got into his car and he drove to the other side of the car park. He then began talking about porn movies and i was laughing all the while. It was seriously funny that a guy his age was talking about shit like that. he then asked me why all african guys have big dicks. Now, nothing weird here....as we get this question countless times once we venture into those types of conversations. Peter then asked me if i had a big dick. Again, i laughed this off and just kinda said ...normal type. Peter then puts his hand on the back of my neck and my mind started racing. I just thought, well, if i move or reach for my shoelace, he will let go. So i did that and he let go. He then asks me if i had ever had sex with a man. At this point, i was now feeling fucking awkward and now had suspicions. So i categorically/vehemently said no and that I would never do that as I am not that way. He then reached out and pinched my nipple!  At this point I told him i had to leave. He asked if I was sure that i wanted to leave. So I left.

Thing is, I felt dirty when this guy did this. I was actually innocently thinking i'm just chatting with this guy, whilst he obviously had other intentions. I also, through this experience, know what it feels like for the waitresses who have sexual innuendo left right and centre just because they smiled at a male customer etc.

Its taken me a few days to get over this. Im certain he thinks I am playing hard to get as I did not exactly say NO to his advances (I realised it too late). To him, I got in his car, kept laughing whilst he was pinching me etc and these are signs of someone interested. Im sure I will meet him again at the spa.

He pays the escort a few bucks—kinda just gives him a handful. I get up and he takes his time squeezing by. He’s a big big guy, wrap around Gucci shades. He gets settled, mumbling about Grimace, the big purple autistic guy from McDonalds. “You don’t know who Grimace is?” I don’t know how to respond so I give a half chuckle, then realize that he’s on his Bluetooth. He mumbles into in until the moment the plane is airborne. He’s taking up some of my seat, but I don’t say anything. No sense confronting him about something out of his control (in the short run, arguably).  I can hear his music through his Beats By Dre. Fine. I’m washed and pretty drunk so I fall asleep within minutes of take off. 

I wake up after a couple hours. The guy sitting next to me is on his laptop—looks like a music program, FL Studio or something—and even though his screen is tilted down, it’s on full bright. I can easily hear his music through his headphones. I put my headphones on and try to fall back asleep, but between the light and sound coming off of this guy, there’s no chance. I consider saying something but settle on a passive aggressive turn away from him. A half hour passes—nothing. My back is aching and my eyes are clenched shut but I’m wide awake, and getting mad. I’m thinking about calling him out: I would, all calculated, rip off my headphones, turn to him and say “Will you give it a rest?!” He’d either apologize, deferring to my obvious rightness, or say “Hey man I’m just doing my thing/I gotta work/something to this effect,” and I’d snarkily say “Well can you do it without keeping everyone else on the damn plane up?” Yeah, I’m awesome, I’m a hero. I settle on the non-confrontational route and think about asking the attendant for a sleep mask. When I open my eyes, the “call attendant” light it blinking. What happened? Is someone else gonna call this guy out? Does this airplane respond to passive-aggressive thoughts? The attendant comes over to our three-person row and waits for one of us to ask him for something, but no one does. He stands there for a beat, unspeaking, and I shrug at him without taking off my headphones. 

Let me be clear. I didn’t chicken out. I did chicken out. But I didn’t call the guy. I couldn’t just swoop in on someone else’s call.  Maybe something else was going on, something more pressing. Gremlin on the wing, et al. Then I just look like an asshole. Attendant leaves and I follow, ask him for a sleep mask cause the guy next to me has been on his laptop the whole damn flight. He tells me there’s only an hour or so until we land. Also we don’t have sleep masks. Fair enough. Head back to my seat and decide to get on my own laptop, with my f.lux lighting set to “candle—super dim.” That’ll show the fucker who’s courteous.  I organize documents, pictures; bury porn that I’d lazily saved straight to my desktop. The guy next to me pushes the attendant button. Well that solves that. Attendant comes over and the guy next to me is unaffected, looking straight ahead, absorbed by his music. I’m not about to help him so I pretend not to see the attendant. He only stays for a couple seconds this time. 

Getting near Philadelphia, tray tables go up. Guy next to me calls the attendant a third time. The light blinks for about five minutes, no doubt while the attendant decides how he’s gonna tell us off. He comes over and launches right into it, I take off my headphones. 

“…third time I’ve been over here…” 

I elbow the guy next to me, kinda hard. He jumps, takes off his Beats and looks up. 

“…even acknowledge me.” 

Guy next to me says “Sorry, I can’t see.” No shit, it’s dark and you’re wearing Gucci shades over half your face. 

“Well what do you want?” 

“Can I get a glass of water, no ice?” 

The attendant already has one in his hand. “Here, take it.” We land. Guy two rows ahead of me asks to help grab his bag from the overhead bin. Guy next to me is doing that awkward half stand of someone trying to join the sovereign people of Aislestandistan, but I’m boxing him in. His head is right in front of the bin I need to open. “Hey, watch your head,” I ask a little too softly, like I do. “Hey excuse me can you watch your head?” People are looking. Guy sitting on the other side of him taps him and he realizes what’s going on, ducks. I grab the guys bag and pass it forward. I ask the same favor of someone sitting two rows behind me. We stand for a few minutes while the uppermiddle class deplane. I do that thing you do when you’re awkwardly close to a group of strangers for an awkwardly long time—my eyes half dart around, half look down at my sweater. Get caught looking at that blonde girl twice. I notice that the guy sitting next to me has a stack of short tubes in his hand, the length of straws and the width of fingers. The hell is that? People clear up and I’m finally about to get off the plane when the guy sitting next to me stands up right in front of me and starts feeling around at the overhead bin across the aisle.

I was visiting my best friend for the first time in his new shared flat, because he had just moved to another town to study. The flat was designed, so that the doors to all the rooms joined in the small living room together with the doors to the kitchen an the bathroom.
I met his other flatmates and they were all really nice guys.

unfortunately, I was awake.

I plugged in my computer and opened the picture. I couldnt figure out how to put on fullscreen so my friend said ""press the button in the middle"" which turned out to be the slideshowbutton...

Apparently i uploaded the picture in the same folder as my bongpics and suddenly my bong was covering the 2x2 meter screen. My whole class knows that im a stoner so they all burst out like ""AAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAhAh"". Great way to start a presentation.

I kept my stone(r)face and was like ""woops.."" and changed back picture and started to present (i was in chock and shaked like hell). I was scared as fuck and so ashamed i didnt dare to watch my teachers reaction.

When i was finished i took my laptop and sat down.

As soon as i sat down i asked my friend how our teacher reacted and suddenly i feel a hand on my shoulder. Its my teacher with a smile on his face and he goes like: ""You dont have to worry, my son lives in Amsterdam and i usually visits him."" as gave me a wink (all my mates were talking so they didnt hear him say this). I couldnt believe what i heard and all i can say is i am so happy these kind of people exist.

ecstatic1,11,,4,1rhz0q,,24,"Little bit of back story:

Girl and I have been friends for going on 4 years now. We've really dragged each other through some shit over that time, failed relationships, a mutual friend's divorce, problems with school and work and life, etc. She's always been there for me when I needed someone to listen, and I've always tried to help her through whatever problems crop up in her life.

Me? I'm a habitual fuck-up when it comes to anything involving emotions or expressing myself, and I tend to repress feelings of frustration and aggression. I think it's a coping mechanism for when I don't feel like I've got control of my life, like I choose not to feel instead of actually confronting the thing that's causing me to feel that way. She's the kind of girl that wears her heart on her sleeve, essentially, and that's a very endearing quality to me because it helps me associate with my own emotions. It's been very helpful over the past 7 or 8 months since I've moved across the country to start a new job. It's lonely here and my friends back home, her especially, have been so supportive and helpful.

Anyway, that bit is important because for about a year now I've been trying to convince myself that I'm not romantically interested in Girl, despite the fact that I've caught myself looking at her in a way that I typically reserve for lovers. And we have fooled around in the past so I didn't think much about it (just hormones, etc.). Last time I was in town (October) we ended up having sex, after which she drove me to the airport and we said our goodbyes. Neither one of us has really mentioned the event, but I've been thinking about her more and more over the past month as I've been helping her deal with school related problems. 

So last night:

I came back from my evening run feeling the worse for wear. I'm trying to train up for a 15k back home this coming Saturday that Girl has asked me to run with her. Fuck me I'm not a runner! But she's worth the effort so here I am pushing myself through cold and rain. Well, I get home and I text her that I want to Facetime and talk a bit. She replies back that she's got a meeting real soon and she can't, but she really wants to talk to me because she's stressed and also that *she wants to tell me about this* **new guy** *she met*. What? Fuck? I thought I had more time!

I was planning on telling her how I felt this weekend, and I think I panicked a little. She caught on that something was amiss and called me up. So there I am, heart pounding, legs tight and fingers numb, looking into the face of a girl who doesn't know the train wreck that's about to crash into her from a thousand miles away.

I play it cool. ""So, I've got a problem I think you can help me out with."" ""Ok, I'll try,"" she says to me with a look on her face like she has more pressing concerns on her mind. And I could tell she wasn't expecting anything, which just made it harder. But I'm already in this far, can't back out now. I go on to tell her that there's this girl I like and I don't know how to tell her how I feel. We go back and forth on some questions, and she figures out pretty quickly that I'm being a coy motherfucker and calls me out. 

""Is it me...?"" Lump in my throat. ""...Maybe?"" *Wry smile and puppy dog eyes*. Silence. Silence grows into awkward pause. Then the next 5 minutes is her looking like she's recovering from a car crash and me desperately trying to explain that I can't help how I feel. ""Maybe I'm just being an idiot,"" I say. ""I didn't want to tell you like this, but I can't help how I feel and I wanted you to know."" And she's obviously distraught, and our conversation keeps getting interrupted as her sister enters and exits her room so the awkwardness only exasperates. Finally I just go and say, ""I can't help the way I feel. *I love you and I can't change that.*"" She looks like a deer in headlights. ""I have to go to my meeting, I'm really sorry I don't know what to say right now..."" Boom. Done. Conversation ends.

And here I am today, wearing my dunce hat and feeling like a total selfish asshole. I've fucked up a lot in my life, Reddit. But last night, I think, was my crowning glory. Please induct me into the Hall of Fucked.

LeyfLeyf,10,,8,1rco68,,16,"WARNING: PUKE

So it was a great Saturday night and I was at an anime convention preparing for the midnight rave with a couple friends  (this was last night) and we did so by having a LOT of Bacardi... I was really quite intoxicated but I felt really happy and great! That is until I started dancing really really hard.  And I love dancing, so its not like I was going to conciously sit out! But I ended up doing just that after two songs.. so I sat in the back with a cup of water and I started feeling sick, so I grabbed another cup.  (This was the best idea I had all night) because I puked in said cup until it was generously full.  

So here I am at an anime/gaming rave surrounded by peoples 13-30, shirtless, sweaty, and carying a cup of water, and a cup of puke. I casually walked..no.. stumbled over to the garbage can and threw my drink(s) away.  I got back to my room, hopped in the shower, and proceeded to puke so much burger/bleu cheese that it clogged the drain and I sat crying in a tub full of water and my own meals.

octnoir,7,,4,1rbzx2,,19,"Years ago when I was in college, I had an acting class where we all had to act out a ten minute scene in groups (groups of 4). My team decided to do everything last minute (day before our presentation was due), and since I have a background in filmography, cinematography and do videos on a daily basis, I did the camera work and was responsible for editing.

I use Adobe Premier Pro and the editing was impossible and I have an old machine (the render took bloody hours - it finished right before we had to present the video). Also, just how my camera takes footage and it gets imported into Premier Pro, it is automatically zoomed in 50% (because it has to fit a format) and so I have to manually unzoom each of the clips (I took hundreds and there isn't a multi-select option/automatically make it unzoom). It's really late into the night and I might have skipped a couple of clips.

SO, the video is done rendering JUST as we had to present the video. And because it's college and I had a 100 other things, I just slept through the video and the entire class. 20 minutes later (at the end of class), I am woken up by a very tight slap from my female friend: ""You f***ing a**hole"" and she stormed off. I was like WTF, but the entire class and even the professor were shooting me daggers.

I immediately watch the finished video - effects were fine, cuts are flawless, sounds good, so what's the problem? WELL, it turns out one minute of the finished film was zoomed in of the ten (hundreds of clips I sorted last night were perfectly fine, just two of them were not). AND it just HAPPENED to be zoomed in on my friend's ample and shapely breasts. So imagine this - for one minute you could only see boobs on the screen when there was supposed to be a dramatic dialogue. I immediately put my face into my hands and tried to hope it was all a bad dream. It wasn't.

Aftermath: I had to beg the professor to not give my team a failing grade, and accepted one instead. I had to go to a sexual harassment seminar. Everyone in university thinks I'm a creepy perv AND everyone now knows that my mild mannered, very nice and shy friend has large breasts. She was also my crush and was about to break up with her boyfriend, and showed some interest in me. Now she absolutely hates my guts even after five years. And her boyfriend (now broken up) gave me a very stern lecture about the whole thing.

To this day, NO ONE believes I did this on purpose. I SWEAR I HAD NO IDEA, and I have now switched to Final Cut Pro.

I WILL NEVER USE ADOBE PREMIER PRO EVER AGAIN.

TLDR: Premier Pro is stupid and zooms in on clips. It zoomed in on my friend (crush)'s ample bosoms during one minute of a scene which I didn't notice due to lack of sleep. To the entire class of hundred students and one strict professor. F*** Premier Pro.",TIFU by making a video zoom in,23,tifu

I had just moved into my own apartment and took the opportunity to throw a party. Everything went great for a while untill a friend of mine challenged me to a jumping contest. Fair enough, we were both pretty drunk and i of course accepted. I went first, we were trying to reach my stupidly high up ceiling, no problem. Then he went and things got bad. 
Mid-jump he swings his arms upwards to gain a little more momentum and of course swings directly at my nose! Not just hitting my nose but punching it with a closed fist UPWARDS!

It was luckily far from as painfull as all the shocked faces staring at me would imply (probably due to the alcohol)

Combined with an enzyme solution is shakes and cleans organic material off of instruments before sterilization. Naturally it gets gross and gunky often. We had cleaned it before with bleach so in our infinite wisdom last Thursday we poured some in at the end of the day and left. We had a long weekend so when we came in today it was a rusty festering mess. After draining and rinsing I discovered the metal basket and sides were corroded. Then after filling it up with solution I noticed it was leaking everywhere too. This is a small struggling dental practice and the machine is only 6 months old. They are not cheap. I feel terrible.

l3radrocks,9,,6,1r6lt9,,15,"   To really understand this story, you need to know a little about my school. I live in a metropolitan area in the South. Being in the south, most adults have absolutely zero clue of how computer work or function. That included my Digital Tech teacher. I had planned originally to take computer ed classes my whole high school career, but the was already stopped my freshmen year because my High School forces us to take Health and P.E our freshmen year, and I took Spanish as my second elective. So this year I was naturally excited when I finally got to sign up for my computer class. Growing up, there was never any real adult that could teach me about anything related to computers so I was interested in what I would learn in this class. I hoped that it would be a lot. I was dead wrong. Put quite simply, my teach is an idiot.
   
Now, I usually don’t mind teachers even if I personally don’t like them, but this teacher is fully honestly an idiot, and frankly the whole class is idiotic. A perfect example was our first project. We were charged with choosing parts to build our computer. I thought that this would be an easy A and breezed through it. Here’s the good part, I failed it epically. First of all, she took of TWENTY points for not including a FLOPPY DRIVE. Yes, my teacher still believes that floppy drives are still regularly used.  As I stood there baffled by this, she tells me that she is going to take ANOTHER TWENTY points off for using Pcpartpicker.com instead of an excel spreadsheet, when she explicitly told us that we could do the list any way we wanted. Not wanting to cause a scene, I bit my tongue.
  
 Fast forward an excruciating four months of me correcting her pretty much daily on most things she says about computers. For a week now she has been saying that our next project will involve making a game and programming it ourselves. I dance with joy thinking that I might learn something useful finally, after getting through topics such as “Digital Safety”, and “Good online citizenship”. Well fuck was I wrong. She announces a day later that we will be using Scratch.com. If you aren’t aware of what scratch.com is, it is pretty much a program intended for elementary school kids to teach them how to program. Don’t get me wrong, it’s great but I was expecting something actually interesting. So we weren’t supposed to start this project until next week, but I usually do 2 weeks’ worth work daily in that class, seeing as how it is 99% busy work (She has only stood and lectured us once). So the next day, I get started in the Scratch project. I decide to just make a simple space shooter, a lot like Galactica. Finished in in two days, and it worked perfectly. Had 2 weeks’ worth of work done in 2 days. I was free to sleep and read in that class for 2 whole weeks.

This morning, she starts yelling at the class for playing games and being on sites they aren’t supposed to, and said that she had already written some of us up for playing games; all the whole staring at me with a smirk on her face. Of course, the first thought that pops to mind is that she is going to write me up for playing my own project. I already knew she hated me. There is no question about it, everyone in the class knows it. I tried to no get on her bad side even after floppy drive incident, but it did inevitably happen. I don’t purposely aggravate her, her whole experience in our class is a lot like one of those days when nothing ever goes your way. I don’t mean it to be like that, but it is. 
 
  Now to the inevitable. I spent all day today freaking out whenever they called on the intercom, expecting them to say “Mrs.OP, can we have l3radrocks to the administrative offices please.” To my surprise it never happened. I got home today relieved, thinking that it was another blank threat like she always gives me, or that I was just imagining the whole thing. 
 
  My county has this whole website that you login into with your student ID, and they have online textbooks and your grades posted there. And to my horror, in big bold letters – “This student number has been suspended”. 
   
What my school does whenever you are disciplined for computer incidents, they suspend your student Id and in turn, your computer privileges. Right now I am waiting for the inevitable call tomorrow to the administrative offices, ruining my perfect disciplinary record.

I continued to fold the laundry so there wasn't much to get in trouble for, but out of no where my mother starts yelling ""You never do anything unless I get mad or unless it's on your damned computer!"" Wow. Okay, that was totally out of the blue and I know that if I say anything back it will just be wrong, so I just continue and finish folding the clothes and fall back to my bedroom after I'm done. 
""GET YOUR ASS OUT HERE."" .. what did I do now? I continue to walk out in to the kitchen where my mother waits impatiently for me and then screams to sit down at the kitchen table. ""YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING I ASK AND YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ME. YOU ONLY SIT ON YOUR COMPUTER AND PLAY SHITTY GAMES AND WANT TO BE WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING HELPFUL AROUND THE HOUSE ANYMORE. WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO LIVE WITH YOUR GRANDMOTHER AND GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE? I'M FUCKING DONE.""

Unable to really control my tears, seeing as how I was just told how worthless I was and to get the ""fuck out"" of my home... I continued to pick up the glass jar she smashed against the kitchen floor and put away the laundry I was busy with before this ordeal broke out. 

I figured I might as well take this as the time to try to move out. I'm eighteen and in college. My home-life has gone down-hill very fast since my mother had been diagnosed with a specific type of bone cancer. She feels horrible every day and I try my hardest to please her, but I suppose this was the chance I needed to take to have at least a week to calm both of ourselves down until we can talk about a compromise of our feelings. I addressed this idea to my brother and father and both of them told me to do as I felt was best, but of course my father wanted me to stay at home and just ignore it until she was calm. Nearly impossible. 

When my mother got home again I asked in a very nice way if I could spend a few days over at my friends house (this friend had been there through the entire thing and was planning on leaving that day anyways). Mother was very unhappy. ""No. No. Because I said no. No. No, you will not."" Well.. I did anyways because I'm eighteen and I suppose I'll have to learn from my experiences and this will be one of them, whether I made a huge mistake or not. My mother went on another tantrum and started hitting things off of the walls and blurted out ""I'M LEAVING."" slammed the door and left in the truck. I was told to leave everything behind, but we all know we can't survive with nothing. I took whatever I could and had my friend help me pack. I had her mother on the way to help us get to the McDonalds to activate my old WalMart phone online when I realize that I can't do that until the battery's charged. 
*So here I am, sitting at the shitty fast food restaurant at 6:30 PM with no phone or anything really.* I decided to go to my boyfriends, which no one expected, and was able to contact my grandmother. 

I am now sitting at my grandmother's house, which I guess is now my ""home.""  Today was truly my biggest fuck up of my eighteen years on this planet. 

**EDIT:** So I went to try to confront my mother about a possible agreement as to how we could settle our issues and just let things slide back down the pointy slope until we were okay again... That went HORRIBLY. I came back with my grandmother after receiving a text stating my mother was starting to gut out my room (Which had roughly a grand worth of money of electronics, if not more, still inside that I couldn't get in my rushed exit).  My mother was breaking down in tears on the porch when we arrived, which tore me apart, and my grandmother and I tried to talk with her but all we got was that she wasn't over it and she didn't want to talk. I gathered what I could, all of my expensive items and got out. 

After I transported all of my items my grandmother decided it might be a good idea to open up my own bank account; my original one was attached to my father's account. So we went to do that, but had to postpone it due to my lack of ID that I forgot that morning in a scrambled mess to get my items. On the way BACK to the bank, the second time, my grandmother received a text stating that my mother couldn't take it and she just wanted to hug and hold me again. We decided the bank could wait. 

When I got back to the house, I came inside and I told my mother I was there for her and that everything was okay. I comforted her as best as I could and eventually i got out of her that she didn't want me to move out and that she wouldn't scream anymore and that she was sorry for her actions. She for some reason was convinced I wouldn't move back in and told me to take the white car so I could get to college and back every day on my own.. sweet, but I don't think I'd be able to take the car if it was at my grandmothers and I was at home. 

In the end: My mother needed to rest so my grandmother and I fixed supper for everyone and served her what she felt she could eat, she helped me to reactivate my cell phone so I could have a means of communication again, I brought my stuff back over and told my mother that I would stay, but eventually she will have to come to terms that I am not her and I do not see everything she thinks needs to be done every day.

Fast forward to today. I am copying about 300GB of data (pictures and stuff mostly) from one drive to another, when I accidentally hit the power switch for my PC with my foot. After powering  back up I notice 2 of my drives are missing from the system overview (2x2TB WD green drives, both of which were pretty full). After a lot of work I have managed to recover about 600GB from one of the drives. Still haven't gotten anything good off of the other one yet, although I am still working on it using Recuva and TestDisk.

owlbrowneyes,3,,7,1r9heo,,10,"So there is this coworker I have , she comes in on Sundays.
I work part time so she isn't a big problem , but sometimes she is the reason that I don't even want to go to work. 

Maybe I'm not use to the way she wears her heart on her sleeve. 

Sometimes she is moody , other times she is not. 

A couple weeks ago , I get called up to a register. It's getting pretty busy so I just jump on to the first free one I see. 

This lady comes back from her break and kicks me off. 
I opened the store and that was the register I picked. I came in before her, but you know whatever . It's busy and I'd rather just help take care of the line. I don't really care what register I'm on. The managers have no specifications for those either.

So I jump on to register 7. No one else is on there , I'm assuming they're on their break and won't really care. 

I begin ringing up the customer, and when she hands me a large bill I find there's not enough to give back in less bills. So I call the front-end manager to try and come get me change. 

She doesn't hear me. By now the coworker who was on there comes back. ""Oh no this isn't going to work owlbrowneyes"". 
I try again to call the front-end manager. She hears me. 

But it's too late, the coworker grabs the cash out of my hand in front of the customer and just starts giving it to her. 

I can't get yell at other people who I don't know without needing to cry. Most of my coworkers know that I'm generally not the yelling type.

So I just walk away from the register. Just to calm myself down I walk around the store recovering. 

She's in general rude like this, has an attitude. Maybe it's just the way I perceive her. 

But I couldn't stand it anymore.

So I told my manager. I was actually so upset that I began crying (this was due to other reasons more so than her). And he said he'd talk to the general manager about it as well as the coworker. I'm sort of worried that he mentioned my name. 

She and I talk very rarely but I can't stand being near her when at work. In the past she has been rude before. I can tell she makes subtle jokes about me.

Due to an agreement between myself and the prof, i would be able to attend class, read the material and participate in discussion, but not be actually registered for the class at all, even as an auditor. I didn't need the credits at all, so this would allow me to save some money and still take a class I was interested in and as an added bonus, I didn't have to write any papers.

 This was all going fine until today when i went for advisement. I am due to graduate this December, but found out that I cannot due to a three hour credit shortage in my major field. The kicker is that if I had been registered for the class, everything would have been fine. So, I did actually need the class...

It's a funny sesh with a lot of random conversation until the point where i need to piss. Now we were stoned in a park next to a road, i was tripping balls and couldn't find a place i wanted to piss. So i was walking around, half pissing and then stopping to go look for a better spot. I must've done that about 5 times. Anyway my mates just laughing but i finally find a spot and start pissing. I was so high that my arms were crossed while i was pissing and my friend thought he'd take a funny photo of me high. Out of nowhere i hear ""gotcha"" and i see a big light and my mate grinning with his phone. His face went from smiling, to pure horror within a second.

This morning I was in bed and my girlfriend was in the shower, and as usual she decided to just waltz right into her room. Noticing me in bed, she started off in a shrill harpy 'whyareyoustillinbeditssolate blah blah' bullshit, but I ignored her and turned over. Then she opened the blinds and started tugging on my blankets and shit, like I'm a fucking child.

I sat up a bit, looked at her and said groggily, but still rather sharply ""Stop fucking with me and let me sleep you stupid fucking bitch."" 

She immediately froze and gave me the deer in the headlights look, and then started bawling and ran out of the room. Now my girlfriend is busy consoling her and starring daggers at me.

jubjub2184,1,,12,1ravrf,,0,"Today I fucked up by hurting my girlfriend. My grandmother passed away last Saturday and I've been on edge because of it. Yesterday we moved the final things out of her old apartment and I needed emotional support, but she was out at ballet for the evening which was okay, I knew how much ballet means to her and I'd never want to take that away from her. 
 This morning she had ballet again, and when she finally got home we talked for a couple minutes. But I come to find out she is sleeping over at her friends to watch the One Direction..7 hour stream. (Wont go into that bit) and everything that's built up over the last few days just burst. Just on Monday we had argued after I said some nasty stuff then too. Before this week we hasn't even argued. 
 This time around I basically told her that it seemed like she doesn't even care about me, and that she only cares about herself (which in hindsight is the furthest thing from the truth). And well, needless to say that hurt her a lot. I also stupidly asked that we stop seeing one another (which, is the last thing I'd ever want). So I called her after we calmed down a bit and I'm trying to apologize over and over, she said she needs time to think...in my past relationships that's never a good sign.
 Normally I wouldn't really care, but this girl I really could see spending my life with. I love her with all of my heart, and I'd go through Hell for her. I don't want to lose her, I don't think I could handle it. Plus I know she has a lot going on as well right now, and that I'm not exactly helping her out much.
 Sweetie, if you read this, I want you to be happy, and as much as it hurts to say, if being happy means that you leave me..then that's what I want for you. I'm sorry I've been such a shitty person to you the last few days, My grandmother passing is partially why, but I can't put all the blame on that. I fucked up, I said what I said, and I can never take it back. You're everything I could ever ask for and then so much more, I hope things work out with us, I swear to god if this ever happens again you can leave me the second it does.

wessles,4,,6,1rgwyv,,0,"So, I was in class, and was bored. I know all about this stuffs!

So I get out my notebook, look at the board, and see the homework. I decide to start. I am in the back of the classroom; hard to get to. So whenever they came around, I just covered it with the graph paper. I was doing **NONE** of the classwork, just the homework.

So at the end of the class, the teacher says:

*""Every year, someone feels they are just, just too smart for my class.""*

My cheeks redden...

*""So they do the homework during class. This upsets me...""*

I am jumping in my seat.

*""Emily, this year, has decided to be that person.""*

I am relieved as he takes her paper from her. Now she has to do it herself. But then I remember! *I get time to finish my homework in class!* Not enough to do all of it, but what would the teacher say? *""Done already?""*

So, from there I went on auto-pilot. I said:

""Mr. Doe (real name secret), [pause] I must confess. I did just that.""

So he gets up, takes my paper, and tells me:

*""wessles, you were honest, so I will take your paper, but also award you with a 'doing the right thing' award""*

The 'doing the right thing' award, is when they call you out on being a good person. So, at that point, completely forgetting why I told him, I get out a piece of paper, and do my homework again. I finish, class is over (no homwork free-time), and I get my paper back, surprisingly.) 

*""I'll give you it back. You did the right thing. Thanks wessles!""*

**I just got awarded for being a jerk to the teacher, twice, once without him knowing it.**

What do i do i thought ?  

fuck itttt!!! ill do the the lot right now in the toilet !!!!!!!!  

so i did !!

i did 4 1 gram lines in about 2 miates, then the door started banging with a stewardess telling me to hurry back to my seat....panic , images cop dogs barking at me sniffing my ass hole, then imaginaning the copper asking me to quietly leave the plane..... not me mate am going manomissin tommorrow and fuck all youse stopping me, so i emptyed the rest of the coke into my mouth swilling it in my back and forth through my teeth.  
by this point i nearly collapsd in the toilet as the coke hit my brain from the 4 grams id just smashed up me nose...i was bolloxed..... i quickly dressed my self down an as best i could i kept a straight face as not to let my jaw slide from side to side. i not give the fact away i was absolutely off my face.. as i sat down i looked towards the toilet and saw a stewardess return back with i johny pinched between her fingers talking to her colleges....oh NO !!!! i am double fucked now!!!!!  

i turned to me mate and told him id done all the gear up my ass in the toilet because i was so pranged...their was 15 lads on the trip....all of then in chorus started shout and repeated...

I work 7:30-3:30pm Friday-Sunday at a job where I have to be reachable by phone/at the computer at all times during my shift. On Friday i ordered a medium pizza(8 slices) and some breadsticks(was unaware that they give you at least 10 of them in a medium pizza box) from Papa Johns. I ate 3 slices and 3 breadsticks and put the rest in the fidge.  3:30 rolls around and my coworker shows up to take over for the night shift and i said to him ""I ordered pizza and breadsticks for lunch. If you want some it's in the fridge."" 

Saturday morning i come in and open up shop and think nothing of the leftovers that will be my lunch again today. About 12 i finish up a call and decide to take a break for lunch. When i open the fridge i see A box from Papa Johns. It's the box that the breadsticks come in that still has the soaked look from the butter/garlic stuff that they cover it in that leaked out of the container they put the breaksticks in to put into the pizza box.

DontJustStare,358,,373,1r5y5m,,784,"Usually, I don't eat breakfast, but that didn't matter because my crush was working at the cafe this morning rather than tonight, so that meant I was going to buy breakfast. *(Don't ask how I knew he had a morning shift this morning. I'm not a stalker; I'm just ..observant and resourceful.)*

Before I left I was sure to apply a little foundation and mascara; probably the amount of makeup a normal girl would wear. Usually, I don't bother as I am not the spend-forever-getting-ready kinda girl. Although he has always been friendly and nice, he has never done anything to give me the impression that he was interested, yet I always make the effort to look nice whenever I know I will be going to the cafe. (I know, kinda pathetic) 

Business was slow--probably because it had just opened and normal people aren't up so early, so it was basically just us two and his other coworker. I have liked this guy for the longest and we have hardly spoken other than about the food and other short chats, nothing personal, but this morning that finally changed. He initiated a conversation, and we wound up talking for a bit, including plans for this weekend. I was beginning to think he was going to actually ask me out! But then business started to pick up. He asked for my number, so we could talk more later. I played it cool on the outside, but on the inside I was doing a [dance](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lu6b99ng2s1qew6kmo1_500.gif) . 

So, I reach for my bag to get a pen and paper to give him my number since he didn't have his phone on him. Being a little too eager and naturally clumsy, I knocked over my book bag, causing some of the items to fall out. **FUCK ME** Guess what pops out... My fucking dildo.

What can I say? I am a horny girl and it's been 6 months, hence my thirstiness for this guy. I had spent the previous two nights away from home, and I had to rush to pack this morning because I took so long to get ready and prettify myself. In haste, I stuffed whatever I could in the other bags and just so happened to place Sparky in the bag I carry around with the intention of removing it once I got home. 

My eye balls nearly pop out of the sockets in disbelief, and I hurried up and shoved it back in the bag as if that would make him unsee it. I knew it was too late; he undoubtedly saw my 8inch faux cock. *fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck*. 

I expected him to say he had to hurry and get back to work and try to get out of the situation, so I tried to make it less awkward by just telling him, ""Sorry, I don't have any paper. Maybe next time,"" I said in a nervous voice and got out of there. I don't think the situation could have been any more awkward. I just didn't know what to say. My face was down, avoiding eye-contact out of embarrassment most of that time, so I'm not entirely sure how he reacted, but he was probably thinking *WTF, I knew this bitch was weird, but damn*.

I am always cock-blocking myself by being a werido. Well, looks like it's just me and sparky tonight. :( *Forever alone*. 

**TL;DR: My crush for the longest finally gave me the chance to get the D and I cock-blocked myself by dropping my dildo.**


**EDIT:** A couple of points I want to clarify as it seems I was not clear. I do not carry this dildo around on a daily basis. I had brought it with me while I was away from home in a couple of nights. I was rushing to make it to the cafe as well as check out by a certain time, so I just threw my things in my bags. 

*(Sidenote: I clean my dildo before and after each use to prevent UTIs so even if I was carrying it around &amp; ret-ta-go at any time, it would not put me at any risk)*

Also, the cafe he works at is not Starbucks. I took the photo of inside my book bag (listed in a comment below) later that day in Starbucks to *prove* I was not making this up.

Lastly, the dildo came fully out, so it's not like there is a chance he could not have seen it. After it came out, I pretty much avoided eye contact or looking at him at all, so I don't know what he was thinking. 

Now that I have read each comment, it seems like nearly every person is saying the same thing, which is that he doesn't think I'm a weird freak. There is a chance that I may have been over-thinking this situation with my typical skewed, negative perspective. Perhaps, in a few days, I will revisit the cafe without bringing it up and give him my number (I liked this idea more than apologizing as it avoids making it more awkward IMO). I am just terrified of rejection, so I don't know if I will or not. If I do, I will definitely update!

I was prepared to write my number down on the receipt, so I didn't make it obvious how planned it was by already having it written down...but I chickened out. He just acted so normal, and I didn't know how to bring it up. ""Oh so, did you still want my number?"" I'd sound like a total loser. I started over-thinking it. I didn't even stay and eat what I ordered; I got it to go. I probably won't go back either. I mainly went there to steal glances at him. Oh well. . .

I checked into a hostel, got up to my dorm, and quickly introduced to myself to the other 2 people in the room, lets call them Mary and Sue. Mary was a nice girl from Germany who got to chatting with me. I said hello to Sue, but she pretended not to hear me.

When we finally fall asleep, she starts having night terrors, screaming things like ""DON'T TOUCH ME, GET AWAY FROM ME, NO NO NO,!"" The next morning, Mary tells me that Sue had been crying the whole day before. I start to think she had gone through some abuse recently.

*fast forward*

We're all in the room, she starts to cry again, and I asked, ""Are you okay?"" with no response. I said it again, and oh boy did I make a mistake. She went into this rant about how all English teachers do is rape their children, rape their students, rob their host countries, and neglect to learn the culture or language. She continued to say that if I would like to speak to her, I should speak to her in her native tongue, Finnish (ignoring the irony of conveying this message in perfect English). I was told to stop bullying her, that I denied her the right to lay in her bed, that I couldn't possibly have anything valuable to retort because I'm English (I'm American).

ImAnAsshole12345,128,,90,1r7wkc,,247,"I love my wife more than anything and we have been together for 6 years. We've had our tough times, but they have been very few. 

I've had 4-5 female friends for almost 10-11 years and one since high school. With two, there were romantic feelings when we started talking, but that fizzled out and now it's just casual friendship (ie, how's your mom, the kids, etc). Off and on throughout the years we'd keep in contact via text just to see what's happening in each other's lives. Marriages, kids, buying houses, etc., when something big or a birthday came around a text would be sent off, catch up for a bit, and then back to no word for a year or more. 

When my mom died earlier this year there were two of these friends who were very supportive and I've kept up with them more and more, culminating in exchanging about 700 texts last month during the worst of my so far grief based depression. At this point I haven't been able to seek therapy because of my schedule, but once the semester is over that will happen. Nothing sexual is desired from either one of these friends; both are happily married with kids. In fact the last conversations were about classes, banana bread, and Thanksgiving plans. 

The part where I fucked up is that I never knew how my wife would take me having these female friends (who I haven't seen in over 10 years), so I never told her about them. All the conversations have been unknown to her until yesterday when she noticed a high number of texts on the bill and found the history. 

She is absolutely distraught and told me that she has lost trust in me. I know it looks horrible from the outside looking in. I also know that I should have talked with my wife more about what was bothering me and my depression instead of discussing it with two friends that she never knew about. I didn't sleep last night and the pain that I have caused is eating me alive.

Maleus21,17,,35,1r1h9k,,155,"This actually happened a while back, but I just found this sub, and since all of my friends love this story, I might as well share it with everyone here.

So a while back, my friend and I worked together on 2nd shift. We normally got off work around 10pm, and it was customary for us to stay up late after work, since we didn't need to be in until late afternoon. So this day, my friend asks me to help him get a weight bench he is getting off of craigslist after work. I didn't have anything else going on, so I gladly offered a helping hand. 

The house we were going to was around 45 minutes away, so while getting gas before heading that way, I went in the gas station and picked up a king size Reeses cup and a large Red Bull to give me some energy after work. This was to be my undoing, because little did I know at that time, I am severely lactose intolerant (I never put 2 and 2 together, and didn't have insurance at the time, so I just thought I had stomach issues). 

So on the way there, we are just idly talking, I finish my 4 peanut butter cups and don't think a thing about them. About 15 minutes later, I feel a slight rumble in my stomach, since stomach problems are normal for me at this time, I pass it off, because I know Ill be home within a couple of hours. About 15 minutes later, the rumbling is more intense, and realize that my friends bathroom will probably receive the brunt of my soon to be coming anal assault. A little while later, we are in the person's neighborhood, and I'm starting to think that a gas station on the way home is inevitable. 

Finally we get to dude's house. He is a nice guy, weight bench is in his garage, but unfortunately it is fully assembled (it is one of those huge all in one machines). Well I haven't told my friend about my stomach, and he and the seller are finalizing the deal, then begin talking about how we are going to secure it in the back of my truck. At this point, I am almost in a cold sweat, my ass cheeks are so clenched so tight, you couldn't fit a needle between them. 

We have now finished loading the weight bench, I am giving myself pep talks and saying a prayer for every step I am taking. I do not want to ask a complete stranger whom we just met off of craigslist to use his bathroom obviously, but things are getting bad. That's when it happens... We are exchanging pleasantries, saying thank yous, and about to get in the truck. I am scouring my brain trying to think of the nearest gas station that I saw on the way there, and decide to let a tini-tiny little bitty poot out just to relieve some of the pressure, as my insides feel as though I am about to explode. Well ladies and gents, when you are in that condition, never ever trust a fart.

It broke the ass seal that my cheeks had welded together, and out comes a torrential down-pour of shit. I could feel it coming, I did my best to squeeze my ass together as tight as I could, which ended up resulting in ass cramps along with the spasms of my intestines wanting so desperately to empty, going against every ounce of my soul trying to stop it. The result was excruciating pain, which resulted me kneeling down, screaming in agony. 

Keep in mind, I had not let on to either of these guys that my stomach was even remotely upset, and I'm sure the sweating was mascaraed by the fact that this was taking place during the summer. So to them, it looked as if I just became possessed and began screaming. So now I am kneeling on the ground, my underwear filled up like a babies diaper, my friend is freaking out,  and the guy from craigslist is no doubt regretting every second of this transaction by now.

I slowly stood up, gathered what I could of myself, and kindly asked the seller if I could use his bathroom. His response was simply ""Umm sure dude, in and to the right, last door on the left"". I slowly walked in the house, praying that no small shit nuggets fell out onto their carpet on my way there. After I got in the bathroom, I took a look at the damage, it was irreparable. Now I had to make a decision, walk outside holding underwear, leave a pair of shit pants in his garbage, or option 3. I emptied as much as I could into the toilet, took out my pocket knife, and cut the massive shit stain out of my underwear. This was obviously was a much smaller piece of cloth, which allowed me to wrap it up in a massive amount of toilet paper and stick it in my pocket. I then cleaned my ass as much as possible (I didn't want to shower in his house also, I was already mortified). Put my holy boxers back on, walked outside, went straight to my truck thanking him as I walked by, got in and immediately drove off. Down the street I threw the shit wad out of the window, and began explaining the story to my now laughing so hard he cant breathe friend. 

I asked my friend if the guy had said anything when I went in his house. His reply to my friend ""Its just a hunch, but I think your friend needs to shit"".

This actually occurred a little under two years ago but anyway.

Every year during the long summer holidays my family have a tradition of heading up to go camping on the East coast of the North Island (NZ). The spot where we go is seriously a fairy tale place: a huge bay with golden sweeping sands, constant sunshine, warm water, big waves, few people, reefs to explore, you get the idea. This year I happened to know that there was a girl there I'd met the previous year who was quite into me. As you can imagine, I'm well keen. The morning after we arrive, virtually as soon as I get up, she bounds over and says she's taking me for my first swim, right now. I'm all about it so we head out into the blue to get wet (me hoping other things may get wet later on). I dive into the water and that's where things begin to take a turn for the unexpected.

As soon as I come up I realise the left side of my face is numb and I can't speak. 

Yep, you guessed it. Brain hemorrhage. 

Ended up spending two weeks in hospital, three months off school and two years later I still can't attend school 5 days a week because I get too tired. I haven't had any luck with the ladies since then either, may or may not be related.

N_skrilla,54,,37,1r5npr,,120,"So around this time of year at the organic garden I work at, all of the hottest peppers we've been growing from early in the year have finished ripening, and are ready to be processed. My job in this is to take the dried habaneros and use a small device to grind them into pepper flakes.

Now anyone thats ever eaten a habanero knows that they are one spicy motherfucker of a pepper. Like 100 times more potent than a jalapeno. And to top it off, if you touch one of them with your bare hands, it'll burn like a motherfucker for about an hour.

So as I was making the emptying the flakes into a container, some of the residual powder left over spilled onto the leg of my pants. I thought nothing of it at the time, and just figured I'd wash my pants after I got done with my shift in a few hours.

Well once those few hours had passed, I had totally forgotten about the seemingly minor incident. When I got home and got ready to take a shower, I must have thrown my underwear on top of my pants; right where the habanero powder had set in. After I got out of the shower and put them back on, it took about 5 minutes after for me to realize how badly I fucked up.

The burning set in, as well as the panic. It started off as a dull burning which was uncomfortable but bearable, but just kept elevating for a solid 15 minutes. To give you a good idea of how this felt, just imagine the spiciest thing you've ever eaten in your life, the try to imagine that burning sensation of your gens. Hell, even the ""icy hot to the balls"" challenge didn't hold a candle to this. I immediately ran to the bathroom to try to wash the stuff off, but once it sets in you just have to ride it out. The burning went on for a solid hour before it decided to die down, and all the while I was sweating like hell and trying not to vomit from the shear pain of the whole ordeal.

fatdumbbitch,18,,43,1r40dm,,77,"When I was younger and first becoming familiar with my body I 'played' with a novelty baseball bat. It's a quarter of the size of a real bat and had a smooth finish. I have long since abandoned it for more appropriate battery operated devices. I cleaned it up and hid it in the back of a closet. Today I came home from campus and found my younger, autistic brother playing with the bat. He was holding it and stroking the wood and my heart stopped.

I was mortified and tried to ignore that this embarrassing childhood pleasure had resurfaced. But I wasn't gonna let this get to me. It was the end of a long day of school and work and I just wanted to have dinner and relax. Dinner had been eaten without me, so I whip it out of the fridge and into the microwave. Nothing, not even my pleasure bat, was going to keep me from relaxing. What was the worse that could happen? 

My brother obliged Murphy's law. He starts tapping it on the table to a beat set by a rhythmically challenged drummer. This interrupted my mom's favorite show, The Voice. Like one domino toppling another, my mom not enjoying her show upset my dad, who tries his best to afford her those few moments she can enjoy herself (the challenges of having an autistic child). 

Dad removes the bat from my brother's grasp and hushes any protest from my sibling. Now there's two family members that have touched my makeshift dildo. I was just gonna try and concentrate on my meal. My dad moved to get off the couch and presumably hide the bat. He however needs surgery on his leg, restricting his movement and requiring a certain amount of daily pain pills. I'm not sure if he was actually being mindful of his limitations or if he was coming up on needing more medication, but he decides he's not going to leave the couch. 

He calls me over from the dinning room, where I'm still trying to eat, and ask me to hide the bat in his room. I put on my poker face and take the bat. I stride with as much nonchalance as can be mustered, and hide the bat under my parent's bed.

So here I am, trying to keep my composure with my retired dildo bat hidden in my dad's room and it's location not hidden very well from my autistic brother.

FreshmanLuck,37,,38,1rbx28,,65,"This is my first semester attending college, which I'm really enjoying so far, with the exception of today's events. Aside from the general ed. stuff, I'm also taking a couple computer science classes which meet in the computer lab. Since the lab is open for students to use before and after classes, it can sometimes be difficult to find a vacant computer until right before a class begins.

Because I tend to be pretty shy I prefer to take the far corner computer which is least visible to the entire room. Since the semester started, I noticed that the same guy, whom I shall refer to as ""The Brony"", is often sitting at my computer right before the class. I call him The Brony because he has a couple different sweatshirts which he alternates and one of them has the rainbow pony character (sorry, I don't watch the show) on it. I've never really talked to him, and he's not in any of my classes. He looks to be in his late twenties or so, about a decade older than most of the other people I see around, even though I sometimes see him in the cafeteria sitting with his much younger looking friends.

One thing I hate about sharing computers is the hygienic aspect. I don't want to seem rude but this guy just never seems clean. Every time I see him at my computer he's sitting there with his thinning, greasy, stringy, untrimmed hair which just sort of hangs over his sweaty forehead and over his thick lens glasses [(which make his eyes appear to bulge out)](http://images.halloweencostumes.com/products/15274/1-1/bug-eye-specs.jpg). He also seems to wear the same clothes many days in a row. Our class meets three times a week and a few weeks I've seen him in the same nasty sweatshirt and sweatpants combo (which begins to accumulate food particles and other debris) all three days. The worst thing is that after he gets up, the chair still smells (like shit), and I'm not sure if it's because he's a bigger dude or because he's not cleaning himself properly. I don't want to know honestly. So I just switch the chair with the next one over, and then switch them again after class to make sure I'm not sitting on his chair.

Today I arrived to a packed computer lab as usual, so I went outside and sat down on some benches between that room and another classroom while I waited until I could get my usual computer back from The Brony. About 5 minutes later, I saw him walk out and proceed to grab the front of his pants to ""adjust"" himself, as though he were in his own private bedroom and not walking down a campus hallway. At the time I didn't think too much of it (except that it's pretty gross to do so in public view), so I grabbed my backpack and went to sit down at my usual spot. After switching the chair, I sat down and logged in with the keyboard. When I finally grabbed the mouse for the first time, I felt something unusual, a moistness along the sides of the mouse. I looked at the mouse and it kind of glistened (though under the florescent lights it was hard to tell). I wasn't sure if it was some kind of sweat or something else, so (stupidly) I slowly brought my fingers to my face and gave them a sniff. I nearly gagged at the unmistakable bleachy stench of semen.

I immediately got up, and walked to the nearest restroom holding my right hand out in front of me like some kind of deformed zombie, all the while mentally trying to remain calm. I stood in front of the sink for about 10 minutes just lathering my hands with soap, and rinsing them, over and over until I finally calmed down. After I dried them they were redder than I've ever seen them, but I finally felt somewhat clean. By the time I got back to class the instructor had begun talking and for the first time in my college life, I had to walk in late.

I didn't sit at my usual computer; I will never sit there again! But I did want to confirm that I wasn't imagining things, so after class I went back to the corner computer, took a plastic bag, placed it over the mouse, and opened the browser history to see if there was anything there. Seemingly endless items from Rule 34, and some furry website called e621.

NiceRideMan,4,,12,1r79fs,,57,"Preface: I live in a semi-detached house, so we share our driveway with our neighbors. There's enough room in the driveway for a total of 4 cars. They're a rather sizeable family, so they have 3 cars and pack them all into the driveway. We never did mind because we only have 2 cars, and if they park the 3rd car a little on their lawn and partially in the driveway, we can fit 5 cars. Although I didn't mind, I still found it annoying at times since it was a tight fit leaving me less room to maneuver.

The neighbors are a really nice Muslim family. Most of the reason I didn't mind them squashing 3 cars into the driveway was because they did things for us frequently. Here in Ontario, it snows a lot sometimes. If they saw that our driveway hadn't been cleaned, they'd do it for us a lot of the time. And they'd bring over leftover food from feasts, and it was so fucking good. So over those 10 years, I never said anything about their 3 cars.

Preface over, here's what happened. A couple of days ago I was at university, and my mom texted me saying the neighbor had passed away. Keep in mind this was a large family.

For context she just turned 21 and this is a director from a theater she interned at, so he's around 40. Super nice house. I agreed to be her DD so she could have her fun.

It's a biochemical lab, so there's not too much that's very dangerous, and overall it's a pretty relaxed place to work. Despite official policy pretty much nobody wears lab coats or goggles, shorts abound in the summer, and gloves are mainly to keep from contaminating your sample rather than protecting your hands. It can be easy in this environment to sort of forget that safety is still important sometimes. 

Yesterday I got to the lab at 8:30 am and was there until about 8 pm, having had a lot of work to finish up. Most of my days that run that long include a lot of downtime, but on this occasion I was actually doing work for most of it. Tedious, monotonous, soul-crushing work, involving repeated treatments with a base, that left me exhausted and brain-dead at the end of the day.

I leave the lab and breathe a sigh of relief, and take a much-needed urination break before heading home. I enter the washroom, zip down, and grab my donger, as is man's sacred right. Suddenly, I feel a sort of itch. I ignore it and continue as I was, but before long the itch intensifies. And then it transforms into a burning. The burning is gentle at first; it does not remain so. Soon it feels as though a scornful fire elemental is attempting to blow me and I am trying very hard to stay still so as not to piss all over myself, despite the fiery waves of pain that now crash upon my pubic shore.

When it becomes too much to bear, I am thankfully nearly done but still manage to splatter some on my pants as I am forced to let go, doubling over with my pants half-down before I finally recover somewhat from the pain. The supernova heat has die down to a much calmer, smaller nova, and I force the thing back into my pants.

I evidently forgot to wash my hands after working with the base all day. It wasn't that concentrated, so it didn't hurt my hands or anything like that, but as soon as I touched my sensitive wang-flesh it made its wretched presence known.

As I said in the title,  my family members are really religious.  They're Hispanic immigrants, they have a picture of the Virgin Mary in every room of the house,  and when they went to school their teachers were nuns,  and priests.  Needless to say they also agree with most of the Catholic church's policies. 

Well,  a few months ago I put a Redditor made song on my Ipod,  the song contained lyrics like ""I always think of guys when I beat my meat"" ,  ""Here's a list of things we like the most, cocks (dicks),  penis (pricks),  anything that's really thick!"",  ""Go to the movie just for Brad Pitt,  mad boners so my jeans don't fit"", ""I'm gay with every boy I see, don't care if they shower,  dirty, or clean"", ""it aint' wrong that I like to touch,  24/7 ain't that much"", and ""one day I saw my daddy in the shower, so I chocked my chicken for half an hour""

It seems that I forgot to delete the song from my Ipod,  and out of all the songs I have on there,  that's the song that played when I quickly went into the store to get some milk. 

When I got back to my car they all looked at me with these horrified faces.  Upon entering my car I was bombarded with questions like, ""Jaime,  what is this filth!?""  ,  ""Why did it play us that gay song?""

After looking through my Ipod,  I eventually found a song they were talking about.  I made up some excuse about one of my friends putting it on my Ipod as a joke.

I don't think they believed my excuse. The rest of the car ride to their places was really quite and awkward.","TIFU By Accidentally Playing an Extremely Vlugar, Homoerotic Redditor Made Song to My Extremely Prude, Religious Family",58,tifu

immediatefracture,7,,11,1r2hp9,,40,"Super long story short, shit in my life is a little rough right now. With my horrible inability to deal with large amounts of stress at one time, naturally I started to fall behind on school work a bit. 

But today, today I had a revelation. Today I said I would do well. 
Only had I not forgotten that something has always got to give.

Anyway. So I'm in Calculus, getting ready to start a quiz when prof asks if anyone has any questions, and I remember that I don't quite remember how to do something. So I promptly raise my hand and begin to try to explain what concept it is exactly that I am not grasping. 
Word vomit at it's best. It comes out something like ""I can't.. remember how to do one of the things you assigned last week for homework and and uhhhh I just... can we go over it?""
With which she so rightly responds ""What the hell are you talking about.""

Now, this woman is no fucking joke. Very fuck you personality and extraordinarily obvious when she's judging you.  

So there I am, freeeeeeeeaking out because she's staring into my soul and I can't be at ease really because she's intimidating me and i'm scared, I start to blurt out something along the lines of, ""RIGHT, BUT I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT."" Maybe only, two or three octaves below the frequency only fucking dogs can hear. 

It gets better. 

I hear a light chuckle from someone behind me, as my professor begins to start going over I guess what she could only assume was the issue I had. I get all ashamed and shit, and interrupt her with ""Oh, I get it now."" 
She shoots me a look that could make Jackie Chan shit his pants, and continues reviewing a problem that I had later realized was not the problem I was struggling with at all. 

Failed the quiz anyway, along with any social composure I had before 8am this morning.

I was about to start working on my part, when I notice that I got an email. I check it, and it's my part. I fucked up when I forgot him while we distributed the work load, and now I look like an asshole who played everyone so that he didn't have to do any work.

dudusan,5,,10,1r3xde,,38,"I occasionally go for a swim during the weekend and always top it off with some time in the spa. Whilst in the spa, I sat on a side that had broken jets. So only half the people in the spa had their jets working. When one occupant left, this 70 something year old man signalled me to come sit next to him, where the other person had just got up from. The old guy, I'll call him Peter, was a bit familiar. I had seen him at the spa a few times before. I started chatting with Peter. He was rather funny. He kept commenting on the women who were entering the spa. It was funny to me considering his age. We also spoke about other things such as my wife, his wife, his kids etc.
During the chats, when Peter was making and a joke...he would pinch me in the abdominal area. It was a bit strange but just thought, whatever, its probably just a greek gesture etc (Where Im from, we kinda clap hands whilst laughing). This goes on for about 4-5 times. When I told him i was leaving, he asked me to stay for another 5 mins. In my mind, I thought perhaps he is just a lonely man who just wants to chat. I stayed for another 5 and left. 
In the changing room, i realised someone had pinched my tshirt. Was frantically looking for it when peter walked in. He got dressed whilst I doing rounds looking for my shirt. He even assisted me by taking me to the ""lost/found"" area. I decided to just ride my bike topless and gave up looking for the shirt.  As peter was leaving too, we walked out of the complex together. As i went to my bike, Peter asked if i would like to go for a drive. I agreed and really thought that perhaps this guy has something to get off his chest or is depressed etc. Also thought wont hurt to listen to a guys issues/cries for help etc. So i got into his car and he drove to the other side of the car park. He then began talking about porn movies and i was laughing all the while. It was seriously funny that a guy his age was talking about shit like that. he then asked me why all african guys have big dicks. Now, nothing weird here....as we get this question countless times once we venture into those types of conversations. Peter then asked me if i had a big dick. Again, i laughed this off and just kinda said ...normal type. Peter then puts his hand on the back of my neck and my mind started racing. I just thought, well, if i move or reach for my shoelace, he will let go. So i did that and he let go. He then asks me if i had ever had sex with a man. At this point, i was now feeling fucking awkward and now had suspicions. So i categorically/vehemently said no and that I would never do that as I am not that way. He then reached out and pinched my nipple!  At this point I told him i had to leave. He asked if I was sure that i wanted to leave. So I left.

Thing is, I felt dirty when this guy did this. I was actually innocently thinking i'm just chatting with this guy, whilst he obviously had other intentions. I also, through this experience, know what it feels like for the waitresses who have sexual innuendo left right and centre just because they smiled at a male customer etc.

Its taken me a few days to get over this. Im certain he thinks I am playing hard to get as I did not exactly say NO to his advances (I realised it too late). To him, I got in his car, kept laughing whilst he was pinching me etc and these are signs of someone interested. Im sure I will meet him again at the spa.

whatshalike,7,,15,1r1zh1,,28,"Red Eye from LAX to PHL. The guy sitting next to me arrives, an escort holding his bag. Never seen that before. He pays the escort a few bucks—kinda just gives him a handful. I get up and he takes his time squeezing by. He’s a big big guy, wrap around Gucci shades. He gets settled, mumbling about Grimace, the big purple autistic guy from McDonalds. “You don’t know who Grimace is?” I don’t know how to respond so I give a half chuckle, then realize that he’s on his Bluetooth. He mumbles into in until the moment the plane is airborne. He’s taking up some of my seat, but I don’t say anything. No sense confronting him about something out of his control (in the short run, arguably).  I can hear his music through his Beats By Dre. Fine. I’m washed and pretty drunk so I fall asleep within minutes of take off. 

I wake up after a couple hours. The guy sitting next to me is on his laptop—looks like a music program, FL Studio or something—and even though his screen is tilted down, it’s on full bright. I can easily hear his music through his headphones. I put my headphones on and try to fall back asleep, but between the light and sound coming off of this guy, there’s no chance. I consider saying something but settle on a passive aggressive turn away from him. A half hour passes—nothing. My back is aching and my eyes are clenched shut but I’m wide awake, and getting mad. I’m thinking about calling him out: I would, all calculated, rip off my headphones, turn to him and say “Will you give it a rest?!” He’d either apologize, deferring to my obvious rightness, or say “Hey man I’m just doing my thing/I gotta work/something to this effect,” and I’d snarkily say “Well can you do it without keeping everyone else on the damn plane up?” Yeah, I’m awesome, I’m a hero. I settle on the non-confrontational route and think about asking the attendant for a sleep mask. When I open my eyes, the “call attendant” light it blinking. What happened? Is someone else gonna call this guy out? Does this airplane respond to passive-aggressive thoughts? The attendant comes over to our three-person row and waits for one of us to ask him for something, but no one does. He stands there for a beat, unspeaking, and I shrug at him without taking off my headphones. 

Let me be clear. I didn’t chicken out. I did chicken out. But I didn’t call the guy. I couldn’t just swoop in on someone else’s call.  Maybe something else was going on, something more pressing. Gremlin on the wing, et al. Then I just look like an asshole. Attendant leaves and I follow, ask him for a sleep mask cause the guy next to me has been on his laptop the whole damn flight. He tells me there’s only an hour or so until we land. Also we don’t have sleep masks. Fair enough. Head back to my seat and decide to get on my own laptop, with my f.lux lighting set to “candle—super dim.” That’ll show the fucker who’s courteous.  I organize documents, pictures; bury porn that I’d lazily saved straight to my desktop. The guy next to me pushes the attendant button. Well that solves that. Attendant comes over and the guy next to me is unaffected, looking straight ahead, absorbed by his music. I’m not about to help him so I pretend not to see the attendant. He only stays for a couple seconds this time. 

Getting near Philadelphia, tray tables go up. Guy next to me calls the attendant a third time. The light blinks for about five minutes, no doubt while the attendant decides how he’s gonna tell us off. He comes over and launches right into it, I take off my headphones. 

“…third time I’ve been over here…” 

I elbow the guy next to me, kinda hard. He jumps, takes off his Beats and looks up. 

“…even acknowledge me.” 

Guy next to me says “Sorry, I can’t see.” No shit, it’s dark and you’re wearing Gucci shades over half your face. 

“Well what do you want?” 

“Can I get a glass of water, no ice?” 

The attendant already has one in his hand. “Here, take it.” We land. Guy two rows ahead of me asks to help grab his bag from the overhead bin. Guy next to me is doing that awkward half stand of someone trying to join the sovereign people of Aislestandistan, but I’m boxing him in. His head is right in front of the bin I need to open. “Hey, watch your head,” I ask a little too softly, like I do. “Hey excuse me can you watch your head?” People are looking. Guy sitting on the other side of him taps him and he realizes what’s going on, ducks. I grab the guys bag and pass it forward. I ask the same favor of someone sitting two rows behind me. We stand for a few minutes while the uppermiddle class deplane. I do that thing you do when you’re awkwardly close to a group of strangers for an awkwardly long time—my eyes half dart around, half look down at my sweater. Get caught looking at that blonde girl twice. I notice that the guy sitting next to me has a stack of short tubes in his hand, the length of straws and the width of fingers. The hell is that? People clear up and I’m finally about to get off the plane when the guy sitting next to me stands up right in front of me and starts feeling around at the overhead bin across the aisle. A woman behind us sees this and taps me, gesturing towards him “can you…” Can I? Can I what, help him? Why should I help…mother fucker. I am the dumbest person I know.

I was visiting my best friend for the first time in his new shared flat, because he had just moved to another town to study. The flat was designed, so that the doors to all the rooms joined in the small living room together with the doors to the kitchen an the bathroom.
I met his other flatmates and they were all really nice guys.
Of course my friend and I we got really, really drunk that night and decided to go home at about 3:30am, where i passed out on the living room couch. I woke up at about 4:30am standing in the room of one of the flatmates. It was then I noticed, that I had woken up to a loud ""What the FUCK man?!?"" by the flatmate who had jolted out of bed to the lightswitch, which revealed what I had done. I was standing next to his bed in my underwear and had just pissed all over his bedsidetable and the floor.
To make matters worse he had his girlfriend over and they had their NEW Iphones on said table.
At first I thought I was dreaming because I just couldn't comprehend how fucked I was but after a deep breath I noticed that,
unfortunately, I was awake.
I got some paper towels as fast as I could and tried to clean it up, but the flatmate ordered me to get out of his room before I did anymore damage and told me to go back on the couch.
The next morning I was still hoping it all just was a dream but the Iphones in rice proved me wrong. Words can not express how embaressed I was and am to this day I cringe everytime I think of it. I tried to apologize to them the next day, knowing that no words could compensate for that, and gave him some money to take his girlfriend out to dinner (luckily the Iphones weren't damaged otherwise I would have had to have paid a LOT more). I begged them not to spread the story around, not even to my friend (he didn't notice and just slept through the whole thing) although I didn't derserve it.

ecstatic1,11,,4,1rhz0q,,24,"Little bit of back story:

Girl and I have been friends for going on 4 years now. We've really dragged each other through some shit over that time, failed relationships, a mutual friend's divorce, problems with school and work and life, etc. She's always been there for me when I needed someone to listen, and I've always tried to help her through whatever problems crop up in her life.

Me? I'm a habitual fuck-up when it comes to anything involving emotions or expressing myself, and I tend to repress feelings of frustration and aggression. I think it's a coping mechanism for when I don't feel like I've got control of my life, like I choose not to feel instead of actually confronting the thing that's causing me to feel that way. She's the kind of girl that wears her heart on her sleeve, essentially, and that's a very endearing quality to me because it helps me associate with my own emotions. It's been very helpful over the past 7 or 8 months since I've moved across the country to start a new job. It's lonely here and my friends back home, her especially, have been so supportive and helpful.

Anyway, that bit is important because for about a year now I've been trying to convince myself that I'm not romantically interested in Girl, despite the fact that I've caught myself looking at her in a way that I typically reserve for lovers. And we have fooled around in the past so I didn't think much about it (just hormones, etc.). Last time I was in town (October) we ended up having sex, after which she drove me to the airport and we said our goodbyes. Neither one of us has really mentioned the event, but I've been thinking about her more and more over the past month as I've been helping her deal with school related problems. 

So last night:

I came back from my evening run feeling the worse for wear. I'm trying to train up for a 15k back home this coming Saturday that Girl has asked me to run with her. Fuck me I'm not a runner! But she's worth the effort so here I am pushing myself through cold and rain. Well, I get home and I text her that I want to Facetime and talk a bit. She replies back that she's got a meeting real soon and she can't, but she really wants to talk to me because she's stressed and also that *she wants to tell me about this* **new guy** *she met*. What? Fuck? I thought I had more time!

I was planning on telling her how I felt this weekend, and I think I panicked a little. She caught on that something was amiss and called me up. So there I am, heart pounding, legs tight and fingers numb, looking into the face of a girl who doesn't know the train wreck that's about to crash into her from a thousand miles away.

I play it cool. ""So, I've got a problem I think you can help me out with."" ""Ok, I'll try,"" she says to me with a look on her face like she has more pressing concerns on her mind. And I could tell she wasn't expecting anything, which just made it harder. But I'm already in this far, can't back out now. I go on to tell her that there's this girl I like and I don't know how to tell her how I feel. We go back and forth on some questions, and she figures out pretty quickly that I'm being a coy motherfucker and calls me out. 

""Is it me...?"" Lump in my throat. ""...Maybe?"" *Wry smile and puppy dog eyes*. Silence. Silence grows into awkward pause. Then the next 5 minutes is her looking like she's recovering from a car crash and me desperately trying to explain that I can't help how I feel. ""Maybe I'm just being an idiot,"" I say. ""I didn't want to tell you like this, but I can't help how I feel and I wanted you to know."" And she's obviously distraught, and our conversation keeps getting interrupted as her sister enters and exits her room so the awkwardness only exasperates. Finally I just go and say, ""I can't help the way I feel. *I love you and I can't change that.*"" She looks like a deer in headlights. ""I have to go to my meeting, I'm really sorry I don't know what to say right now..."" Boom. Done. Conversation ends.

And here I am today, wearing my dunce hat and feeling like a total selfish asshole. I've fucked up a lot in my life, Reddit. But last night, I think, was my crowning glory. Please induct me into the Hall of Fucked.

So it was a great Saturday night and I was at an anime convention preparing for the midnight rave with a couple friends  (this was last night) and we did so by having a LOT of Bacardi... I was really quite intoxicated but I felt really happy and great! That is until I started dancing really really hard.  And I love dancing, so its not like I was going to conciously sit out! But I ended up doing just that after two songs.. so I sat in the back with a cup of water and I started feeling sick, so I grabbed another cup.  (This was the best idea I had all night) because I puked in said cup until it was generously full.  

So here I am at an anime/gaming rave surrounded by peoples 13-30, shirtless, sweaty, and carying a cup of water, and a cup of puke. I casually walked..no.. stumbled over to the garbage can and threw my drink(s) away.

octnoir,7,,4,1rbzx2,,19,"Years ago when I was in college, I had an acting class where we all had to act out a ten minute scene in groups (groups of 4). My team decided to do everything last minute (day before our presentation was due), and since I have a background in filmography, cinematography and do videos on a daily basis, I did the camera work and was responsible for editing.

I use Adobe Premier Pro and the editing was impossible and I have an old machine (the render took bloody hours - it finished right before we had to present the video). Also, just how my camera takes footage and it gets imported into Premier Pro, it is automatically zoomed in 50% (because it has to fit a format) and so I have to manually unzoom each of the clips (I took hundreds and there isn't a multi-select option/automatically make it unzoom). It's really late into the night and I might have skipped a couple of clips.

SO, the video is done rendering JUST as we had to present the video. And because it's college and I had a 100 other things, I just slept through the video and the entire class. 20 minutes later (at the end of class), I am woken up by a very tight slap from my female friend: ""You f***ing a**hole"" and she stormed off. I was like WTF, but the entire class and even the professor were shooting me daggers.

I immediately watch the finished video - effects were fine, cuts are flawless, sounds good, so what's the problem? WELL, it turns out one minute of the finished film was zoomed in of the ten (hundreds of clips I sorted last night were perfectly fine, just two of them were not). AND it just HAPPENED to be zoomed in on my friend's ample and shapely breasts. So imagine this - for one minute you could only see boobs on the screen when there was supposed to be a dramatic dialogue. I immediately put my face into my hands and tried to hope it was all a bad dream. It wasn't.

Aftermath: I had to beg the professor to not give my team a failing grade, and accepted one instead. I had to go to a sexual harassment seminar. Everyone in university thinks I'm a creepy perv AND everyone now knows that my mild mannered, very nice and shy friend has large breasts. She was also my crush and was about to break up with her boyfriend, and showed some interest in me. Now she absolutely hates my guts even after five years. And her boyfriend (now broken up) gave me a very stern lecture about the whole thing.

To this day, NO ONE believes I did this on purpose. I SWEAR I HAD NO IDEA, and I have now switched to Final Cut Pro.

I WILL NEVER USE ADOBE PREMIER PRO EVER AGAIN.

TLDR: Premier Pro is stupid and zooms in on clips. It zoomed in on my friend (crush)'s ample bosoms during one minute of a scene which I didn't notice due to lack of sleep. To the entire class of hundred students and one strict professor. F*** Premier Pro.",TIFU by making a video zoom in,23,tifu

I had just moved into my own apartment and took the opportunity to throw a party. Everything went great for a while untill a friend of mine challenged me to a jumping contest. Fair enough, we were both pretty drunk and i of course accepted. I went first, we were trying to reach my stupidly high up ceiling, no problem. Then he went and things got bad. 
Mid-jump he swings his arms upwards to gain a little more momentum and of course swings directly at my nose! Not just hitting my nose but punching it with a closed fist UPWARDS!

It was luckily far from as painfull as all the shocked faces staring at me would imply (probably due to the alcohol)

Combined with an enzyme solution is shakes and cleans organic material off of instruments before sterilization. Naturally it gets gross and gunky often. We had cleaned it before with bleach so in our infinite wisdom last Thursday we poured some in at the end of the day and left. We had a long weekend so when we came in today it was a rusty festering mess. After draining and rinsing I discovered the metal basket and sides were corroded. Then after filling it up with solution I noticed it was leaking everywhere too. This is a small struggling dental practice and the machine is only 6 months old. They are not cheap. I feel terrible.

l3radrocks,9,,6,1r6lt9,,15,"   To really understand this story, you need to know a little about my school. I live in a metropolitan area in the South. Being in the south, most adults have absolutely zero clue of how computer work or function. That included my Digital Tech teacher. I had planned originally to take computer ed classes my whole high school career, but the was already stopped my freshmen year because my High School forces us to take Health and P.E our freshmen year, and I took Spanish as my second elective. So this year I was naturally excited when I finally got to sign up for my computer class. Growing up, there was never any real adult that could teach me about anything related to computers so I was interested in what I would learn in this class. I hoped that it would be a lot. I was dead wrong. Put quite simply, my teach is an idiot.
   
Now, I usually don’t mind teachers even if I personally don’t like them, but this teacher is fully honestly an idiot, and frankly the whole class is idiotic. A perfect example was our first project. We were charged with choosing parts to build our computer. I thought that this would be an easy A and breezed through it. Here’s the good part, I failed it epically. First of all, she took of TWENTY points for not including a FLOPPY DRIVE. Yes, my teacher still believes that floppy drives are still regularly used.  As I stood there baffled by this, she tells me that she is going to take ANOTHER TWENTY points off for using Pcpartpicker.com instead of an excel spreadsheet, when she explicitly told us that we could do the list any way we wanted. Not wanting to cause a scene, I bit my tongue.
  
 Fast forward an excruciating four months of me correcting her pretty much daily on most things she says about computers. For a week now she has been saying that our next project will involve making a game and programming it ourselves. I dance with joy thinking that I might learn something useful finally, after getting through topics such as “Digital Safety”, and “Good online citizenship”. Well fuck was I wrong. She announces a day later that we will be using Scratch.com. If you aren’t aware of what scratch.com is, it is pretty much a program intended for elementary school kids to teach them how to program. Don’t get me wrong, it’s great but I was expecting something actually interesting. So we weren’t supposed to start this project until next week, but I usually do 2 weeks’ worth work daily in that class, seeing as how it is 99% busy work (She has only stood and lectured us once). So the next day, I get started in the Scratch project. I decide to just make a simple space shooter, a lot like Galactica. Finished in in two days, and it worked perfectly. Had 2 weeks’ worth of work done in 2 days. I was free to sleep and read in that class for 2 whole weeks.

This morning, she starts yelling at the class for playing games and being on sites they aren’t supposed to, and said that she had already written some of us up for playing games; all the whole staring at me with a smirk on her face. Of course, the first thought that pops to mind is that she is going to write me up for playing my own project. I already knew she hated me. There is no question about it, everyone in the class knows it. I tried to no get on her bad side even after floppy drive incident, but it did inevitably happen. I don’t purposely aggravate her, her whole experience in our class is a lot like one of those days when nothing ever goes your way. I don’t mean it to be like that, but it is. 
 
  Now to the inevitable. I spent all day today freaking out whenever they called on the intercom, expecting them to say “Mrs.OP, can we have l3radrocks to the administrative offices please.” To my surprise it never happened. I got home today relieved, thinking that it was another blank threat like she always gives me, or that I was just imagining the whole thing. 
 
  My county has this whole website that you login into with your student ID, and they have online textbooks and your grades posted there. And to my horror, in big bold letters – “This student number has been suspended”. 
   
What my school does whenever you are disciplined for computer incidents, they suspend your student Id and in turn, your computer privileges. Right now I am waiting for the inevitable call tomorrow to the administrative offices, ruining my perfect disciplinary record.

I continued to fold the laundry so there wasn't much to get in trouble for, but out of no where my mother starts yelling ""You never do anything unless I get mad or unless it's on your damned computer!"" Wow. Okay, that was totally out of the blue and I know that if I say anything back it will just be wrong, so I just continue and finish folding the clothes and fall back to my bedroom after I'm done. 
""GET YOUR ASS OUT HERE."" .. what did I do now? I continue to walk out in to the kitchen where my mother waits impatiently for me and then screams to sit down at the kitchen table. ""YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING I ASK AND YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ME. YOU ONLY SIT ON YOUR COMPUTER AND PLAY SHITTY GAMES AND WANT TO BE WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING HELPFUL AROUND THE HOUSE ANYMORE. WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO LIVE WITH YOUR GRANDMOTHER AND GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE? I'M FUCKING DONE."" All of this followed by my mother stomping out of the front door and slamming both the main door and the screen door. Unable to really control my tears, seeing as how I was just told how worthless I was and to get the ""fuck out"" of my home... I continued to pick up the glass jar she smashed against the kitchen floor and put away the laundry I was busy with before this ordeal broke out. 

I figured I might as well take this as the time to try to move out. I'm eighteen and in college. My home-life has gone down-hill very fast since my mother had been diagnosed with a specific type of bone cancer. She feels horrible every day and I try my hardest to please her, but I suppose this was the chance I needed to take to have at least a week to calm both of ourselves down until we can talk about a compromise of our feelings. I addressed this idea to my brother and father and both of them told me to do as I felt was best, but of course my father wanted me to stay at home and just ignore it until she was calm. Nearly impossible. 

When my mother got home again I asked in a very nice way if I could spend a few days over at my friends house (this friend had been there through the entire thing and was planning on leaving that day anyways). Mother was very unhappy. ""No. No. Because I said no. No. No, you will not."" Well.. I did anyways because I'm eighteen and I suppose I'll have to learn from my experiences and this will be one of them, whether I made a huge mistake or not. My mother went on another tantrum and started hitting things off of the walls and blurted out ""I'M LEAVING."" slammed the door and left in the truck. I was told to leave everything behind, but we all know we can't survive with nothing. I took whatever I could and had my friend help me pack. I had her mother on the way to help us get to the McDonalds to activate my old WalMart phone online when I realize that I can't do that until the battery's charged. 
*So here I am, sitting at the shitty fast food restaurant at 6:30 PM with no phone or anything really.* I decided to go to my boyfriends, which no one expected, and was able to contact my grandmother. 

I am now sitting at my grandmother's house, which I guess is now my ""home.""  Today was truly my biggest fuck up of my eighteen years on this planet. 

**EDIT:** So I went to try to confront my mother about a possible agreement as to how we could settle our issues and just let things slide back down the pointy slope until we were okay again... That went HORRIBLY. I came back with my grandmother after receiving a text stating my mother was starting to gut out my room (Which had roughly a grand worth of money of electronics, if not more, still inside that I couldn't get in my rushed exit).  My mother was breaking down in tears on the porch when we arrived, which tore me apart, and my grandmother and I tried to talk with her but all we got was that she wasn't over it and she didn't want to talk. I gathered what I could, all of my expensive items and got out. 

After I transported all of my items my grandmother decided it might be a good idea to open up my own bank account; my original one was attached to my father's account. So we went to do that, but had to postpone it due to my lack of ID that I forgot that morning in a scrambled mess to get my items. On the way BACK to the bank, the second time, my grandmother received a text stating that my mother couldn't take it and she just wanted to hug and hold me again. We decided the bank could wait. 

When I got back to the house, I came inside and I told my mother I was there for her and that everything was okay. I comforted her as best as I could and eventually i got out of her that she didn't want me to move out and that she wouldn't scream anymore and that she was sorry for her actions. She for some reason was convinced I wouldn't move back in and told me to take the white car so I could get to college and back every day on my own.. sweet, but I don't think I'd be able to take the car if it was at my grandmothers and I was at home. 

In the end: My mother needed to rest so my grandmother and I fixed supper for everyone and served her what she felt she could eat, she helped me to reactivate my cell phone so I could have a means of communication again, I brought my stuff back over and told my mother that I would stay, but eventually she will have to come to terms that I am not her and I do not see everything she thinks needs to be done every day. And that she couldn't have been so upset over dirt that she would be THAT upset: something else must have been really pulling her down, but I would be there for her.

After a lot of work I have managed to recover about 600GB from one of the drives. Still haven't gotten anything good off of the other one yet, although I am still working on it using Recuva and TestDisk.

Here is a recreation of what happened:

Augenmann,3,,2,1reeeg,,13,"I don't know if this is a Major Fuck-up yet but I decided to post it here anyways.

It starts pretty harmless with me sleeping in my room at around 11:45 AM, when suddenly my sister Comes bursting in, rudely waking me up and yelling: ""Augenmann, get up! Lunch is ready!"" I give her the occasional ""I'll be there in a Minute"" and wait until she leaves to get up. 

(At this Point you gotta know that my Grandma often Cooks at our house and she live upstairs while my dad, my mum, my sister and I use the bottom floor.)

So basically everyone but me was upstairs and already eating and I had to go relief myself in the bathroom. I decided what the heck, I have enough time, I'll take my phone with me. So I'm Standing there with my phone in my Hand, reading stuff on reddit. Suddenly that little fucker decides to slip outta my fingers and go directly for that pee in the toilet. I noticed the slip but it was too late for my dead-snake-Reflexes. It went *sploosh* and all i saw was my phone in a sort of yellow tone. I immediately reach for it in the toilet. Get it out, fucker slips again, falls back in. Second try, get it out for real, flushed, raced to the sink, disassembled it, washed it with water (I mean, it's just been inside the toilet how bad can it be?)
I then proceed to soak it with water, but hey at least it didn't stink anymore. Now I'm sitting here with a wet disassembled phone and I'm totally not gonna try if it works untill I'm sure it's comletely dry again.

owlbrowneyes,3,,7,1r9heo,,10,"So there is this coworker I have , she comes in on Sundays.
I work part time so she isn't a big problem , but sometimes she is the reason that I don't even want to go to work. 

Maybe I'm not use to the way she wears her heart on her sleeve. 

Sometimes she is moody , other times she is not. 

A couple weeks ago , I get called up to a register. It's getting pretty busy so I just jump on to the first free one I see. 

This lady comes back from her break and kicks me off. 
I opened the store and that was the register I picked. I came in before her, but you know whatever . It's busy and I'd rather just help take care of the line. I don't really care what register I'm on. The managers have no specifications for those either.

So I jump on to register 7. No one else is on there , I'm assuming they're on their break and won't really care. 

I begin ringing up the customer, and when she hands me a large bill I find there's not enough to give back in less bills. So I call the front-end manager to try and come get me change. 

She doesn't hear me. By now the coworker who was on there comes back. ""Oh no this isn't going to work owlbrowneyes"". 
I try again to call the front-end manager. She hears me. 

But it's too late, the coworker grabs the cash out of my hand in front of the customer and just starts giving it to her. 

I can't get yell at other people who I don't know without needing to cry. Most of my coworkers know that I'm generally not the yelling type.

So I just walk away from the register. Just to calm myself down I walk around the store recovering. 

She's in general rude like this, has an attitude. Maybe it's just the way I perceive her. 

But I couldn't stand it anymore.

So I told my manager. I was actually so upset that I began crying (this was due to other reasons more so than her). And he said he'd talk to the general manager about it as well as the coworker. I'm sort of worried that he mentioned my name. 

She and I talk very rarely but I can't stand being near her when at work. In the past she has been rude before. I can tell she makes subtle jokes about me. 

I'm sort of nervous to head into work tomorrow.

phailcakez,7,,1,1r68uz,,11,"the short of it is, I am not officially registered for this class at all. Due to an agreement between myself and the prof, i would be able to attend class, read the material and participate in discussion, but not be actually registered for the class at all, even as an auditor. I didn't need the credits at all, so this would allow me to save some money and still take a class I was interested in and as an added bonus, I didn't have to write any papers.

 This was all going fine until today when i went for advisement. I am due to graduate this December, but found out that I cannot due to a three hour credit shortage in my major field. The kicker is that if I had been registered for the class, everything would have been fine. So, I did actually need the class...

The only reason I didn't think I needed the class was because my advisor and I went over my records this spring and he insisted that everything was good to go and I was on track to graduate with just my registered classes.

I don't want to lose her, I don't think I could handle it. Plus I know she has a lot going on as well right now, and that I'm not exactly helping her out much.
 Sweetie, if you read this, I want you to be happy, and as much as it hurts to say, if being happy means that you leave me..then that's what I want for you. I'm sorry I've been such a shitty person to you the last few days, My grandmother passing is partially why, but I can't put all the blame on that. I fucked up, I said what I said, and I can never take it back. You're everything I could ever ask for and then so much more, I hope things work out with us, I swear to god if this ever happens again you can leave me the second it does. 

TL;DR Said mean things, tears were shed, heart hurts, hope we can make this work.",TIFU by hurting my girlfriend.,8,tifu

I scanned and emailed it to them without realizing the actual shipping fee of 9,400 yen was clearly written on it when the shipping fee I had quoted was 28,000 yen. It was a small box so I could tell them packaging cost 5,000 yen but still the total wouldn't add up to the quoted price. I just hope they won't call to ask me about the difference in price.",TIFU by disclosing the actual shipping fee to our customer which was much less then quoted.,2,tifu
wessles,4,,6,1rgwyv,,0,"So, I was in class, and was bored. I know all about this stuffs!

So I get out my notebook, look at the board, and see the homework. I decide to start. I am in the back of the classroom; hard to get to. So whenever they came around, I just covered it with the graph paper. I was doing **NONE** of the classwork, just the homework.

So at the end of the class, the teacher says:

*""Every year, someone feels they are just, just too smart for my class.""*

My cheeks redden...

*""So they do the homework during class. This upsets me...""*

I am jumping in my seat.

*""Emily, this year, has decided to be that person.""*

I am relieved as he takes her paper from her. Now she has to do it herself. But then I remember! *I get time to finish my homework in class!* Not enough to do all of it, but what would the teacher say? *""Done already?""*

So, from there I went on auto-pilot. I said:

""Mr. Doe (real name secret), [pause] I must confess. I did just that.""

So he gets up, takes my paper, and tells me:

*""wessles, you were honest, so I will take your paper, but also award you with a 'doing the right thing' award""*

The 'doing the right thing' award, is when they call you out on being a good person. So, at that point, completely forgetting why I told him, I get out a piece of paper, and do my homework again. I finish, class is over (no homwork free-time), and I get my paper back, surprisingly.) 

*""I'll give you it back. You did the right thing. Thanks wessles!""*

So I am completely happy about what happened, but I realize:

**I just got awarded for being a jerk to the teacher, twice, once without him knowing it.**

I am the biggest jerk in the world...

**TLDR;** **Decided to do homework in class, confess, get an award, and break the rule again under the teachers nose. I get awarded for being a jerk!**","TIFU by being the biggest jerk in the world, and getting an award for it.",2,tifu

dont_buy_me_gold,17,,22,1rdrpx,,0,"hapened a whil back but....  i shoved 6 grams of coke up me shitehole on the plane to ibiza in 2001 four days after september the 11th. so you can imagine the sercurity, i was fukin brickin it. i was so paranoid that when we boarded the plane and just before take off i could feel the fuckin thing popping out. so i decided to go to the toilet and give it a finger back in place... what happened was i shoved it so deep back up their i could nt feel it anymore. this created more paranoia that id over dose or somein if the johny broke. so squeezed and i squeezed till the the bugger popped out again and put it in my pocket. after leaving the toilet a stewadess made an anouncement that a sniffer dog was coming on board to check for bombs........oh my shittin god!!!!!! i thought am really fucked now !!!  
so i took the thing out of my pocket and threw it down the alse of the plane thinking some other cunnt can take this one....... after a few seconds of thought and realisation that if coke was found on the plane no one was going any where... i was not going to be soaking ii in up ibiz. so i raced down the asle quickly grabbed the coke and bombed it back to the fuckin toilet.....  

What do i do i thought ?  

fuck itttt!!! ill do the the lot right now in the toilet !!!!!!!!  

so i did !!

i did 4 1 gram lines in about 2 miates, then the door started banging with a stewardess telling me to hurry back to my seat....panic , images cop dogs barking at me sniffing my ass hole, then imaginaning the copper asking me to quietly leave the plane..... not me mate am going manomissin tommorrow and fuck all youse stopping me, so i emptyed the rest of the coke into my mouth swilling it in my back and forth through my teeth.  
by this point i nearly collapsd in the toilet as the coke hit my brain from the 4 grams id just smashed up me nose...i was bolloxed..... i quickly dressed my self down an as best i could i kept a straight face as not to let my jaw slide from side to side. i not give the fact away i was absolutely off my face.. as i sat down i looked towards the toilet and saw a stewardess return back with i johny pinched between her fingers talking to her colleges....oh NO !!!! i am double fucked now!!!!!  

i turned to me mate and told him id done all the gear up my ass in the toilet because i was so pranged...their was 15 lads on the trip....all of then in chorus started shout and repeated...    

""dannys on a bender , dannys on a bender lalalala lalalalala""  

i sank into my seat an hoped it would go away. lucky the dog did nt sniff a thing and the stewardess just wanted the cunting plane to take off as bad as i did.  

as the plane was in cruise and the trolly food passed around the young girl turned to me and said "" are you ok you look awfully pale"" the lads just roared with laughter.  

i reply ""am just a bad flyer love....."" nothing to do with being absolutely chinged off me face......",tifu by smuglin coke outa leeds......,15,tifu

I work 7:30-3:30pm Friday-Sunday at a job where I have to be reachable by phone/at the computer at all times during my shift. On Friday i ordered a medium pizza(8 slices) and some breadsticks(was unaware that they give you at least 10 of them in a medium pizza box) from Papa Johns. I ate 3 slices and 3 breadsticks and put the rest in the fidge.  3:30 rolls around and my coworker shows up to take over for the night shift and i said to him ""I ordered pizza and breadsticks for lunch. If you want some it's in the fridge."" 

Saturday morning i come in and open up shop and think nothing of the leftovers that will be my lunch again today. About 12 i finish up a call and decide to take a break for lunch. When i open the fridge i see A box from Papa Johns. It's the box that the breadsticks come in that still has the soaked look from the butter/garlic stuff that they cover it in that leaked out of the container they put the breaksticks in to put into the pizza box. I think to myself, ""maybe he just put it all in one box"".

[NO](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJXYMDu6dpY)[PE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvdf5n-zI14)

Fucking prick ate the remaining 5 slices of pizza AND 3 of the breadsticks. WHAT. THE. FUCK. The kicker is that the pizza box was not in any of the trash bins(I put the trash at the curb Friday morning) at our office which means he took the fucking box with him.

I slept with 2 girls in my work, that was fine, they were friends and thought it was funny.
However, last week at a staff night out I slept with one of the staff and she was bitching about this other new member of staff.
Then this next week, i slept with that new member of staff. I hear more to the story. They actually know each other from uni and have never got on.
So in work they started fighting, shouting at each other that they wer going to kick each others c**ts in (to quote).
they have been bitching about each other to all the staff, then tonight they were both taken into the office and spoke to by the manger....


I have never had such an awkward shift.. becuase not only did that happen, but the other two that i slept with were in drinking, so all the memebers of staff id been with were in together and i was like.... :-/
