MouseShank,182,1002,1qzfcz,1852,"This morning, I was using a bathroom in the airport while waiting for my flight to board. I did my business, cleaned up, and turned around to take a look at what I had created. After a moment, I pressed the manual flush button, and instead of flushing, the toilet water began to rise rapidly. When the water level was about 1/2 inch below the rim, it stopped. After a moment of relief, I turned around to leave. As I turned around, I triggered the automatic flush. 

I heard another guy freak out as pieces of poop were riding a tidal wave of toilet water in his direction.

Futurames,161,520,1r2jqb,1229,"Just a short bit of context. Where I work, we have uniform shirts and I wear mine over another plain t-shirt. Every day when I leave I go to my locker, take off my toolbelt and work shirt and go home, pretty much in that order. 

Well today for some reason, I decided to take off my work shirt before reaching my locker. Then, out of habit, once I reached my locker, my brain demanded that clothing be removed. So, I proceed to take off my regular shirt and am standing there in my bra for a good three and a half seconds before I felt a breeze and realized what I had done. 

This all happened in front of my entire group of male coworkers as well as a bunch of customers. Keep in mind that this is a hardware store so the customer base is largely men. I don't think they all processed exactly what they had just seen.

banginchoonz,678,745,1qu6v1,1220,"Context: she and I have a weird friendship where we exchange filthy innuendos and whatnot all the time.

We were at a nightclub last night. She walked up behind me and grabbed my crotch. I don't mean a light squeeze, she full-on went in there.

I, thinking we were just joking, returned the favour, and grabbed her breast.

She freaked the fuck out. She slapped me, and now refuses to speak to me. I immediately apologised, again and again, but she just blanked me. Her friends said 'you pig, you pervert' etc.

Again, I tried to apologise to her, but all she said was 'don't *ever* do that again,' and I've not heard from her since.

**Edit:** Thanks for the support guys (and especially gals.) I know this story reads like something straight out of /r/circlejerk, but it is 100% true.

An update, for those who've asked. We still haven't spoken, and I doubt we will. We live far apart - she lives in the UK, I live in France; I was just back for the weekend to catch up with friends - and so we don't really see each other often. Losing her as a friend means two things: a 80% drop in sexy banter on Facebook, and one less person to see whenever I visit home.

gozenurhole,99,395,1qshu3,1189,"So my boyfriend and I are getting ready to lay down and he tells me to make the bed. (Because I move around a lot in my sleep and mess up the bedding.) The lights are already off and I go to make the bed. As I am moving the covers around, I notice what looks like a small box, a small RING box. My heart stops, and he says ""what IS that?"" I'm all ""I don't know..."" and I pick it up, full of emotions, about to cry. ...It's the charging port to his phone charger. Apparently he thought I was going to propose to him too because he really didn't know what it was. I'm an idiot.

DontJustStare,350,357,1r5y5m,744,"Usually, I don't eat breakfast, but that didn't matter because my crush was working at the cafe this morning rather than tonight, so that meant I was going to buy breakfast. *(Don't ask how I knew he had a morning shift this morning. I'm not a stalker; I'm just ..observant and resourceful.)*

Before I left I was sure to apply a little foundation and mascara; probably the amount of makeup a normal girl would wear. Usually, I don't bother as I am not the spend-forever-getting-ready kinda girl. Although he has always been friendly and nice, he has never done anything to give me the impression that he was interested, yet I always make the effort to look nice whenever I know I will be going to the cafe. (I know, kinda pathetic) 

Business was slow--probably because it had just opened and normal people aren't up so early, so it was basically just us two and his other coworker. I have liked this guy for the longest and we have hardly spoken other than about the food and other short chats, nothing personal, but this morning that finally changed. He initiated a conversation, and we wound up talking for a bit, including plans for this weekend. I was beginning to think he was going to actually ask me out! But then business started to pick up. He asked for my number, so we could talk more later. I played it cool on the outside, but on the inside I was doing a [dance](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lu6b99ng2s1qew6kmo1_500.gif) . 

So, I reach for my bag to get a pen and paper to give him my number since he didn't have his phone on him. Being a little too eager and naturally clumsy, I knocked over my book bag, causing some of the items to fall out. **FUCK ME** Guess what pops out... My fucking dildo.

What can I say? I am a horny girl and it's been 6 months, hence my thirstiness for this guy. I had spent the previous two nights away from home, and I had to rush to pack this morning because I took so long to get ready and prettify myself. In haste, I stuffed whatever I could in the other bags and just so happened to place Sparky in the bag I carry around with the intention of removing it once I got home. 

My eye balls nearly pop out of the sockets in disbelief, and I hurried up and shoved it back in the bag as if that would make him unsee it. I knew it was too late; he undoubtedly saw my 8inch faux cock. *fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck*. 

I expected him to say he had to hurry and get back to work and try to get out of the situation, so I tried to make it less awkward by just telling him, ""Sorry, I don't have any paper. Maybe next time,"" I said in a nervous voice and got out of there. I don't think the situation could have been any more awkward. I just didn't know what to say. My face was down, avoiding eye-contact out of embarrassment most of that time, so I'm not entirely sure how he reacted, but he was probably thinking *WTF, I knew this bitch was weird, but damn*.

I am always cock-blocking myself by being a werido. Well, looks like it's just me and sparky tonight. :( *Forever alone*. 

**TL;DR: My crush for the longest finally gave me the chance to get the D and I cock-blocked myself by dropping my dildo.**


**EDIT:** A couple of points I want to clarify as it seems I was not clear. I do not carry this dildo around on a daily basis. I had brought it with me while I was away from home in a couple of nights. I was rushing to make it to the cafe as well as check out by a certain time, so I just threw my things in my bags. 

*(Sidenote: I clean my dildo before and after each use to prevent UTIs so even if I was carrying it around &amp; ret-ta-go at any time, it would not put me at any risk)*

Also, the cafe he works at is not Starbucks. I took the photo of inside my book bag (listed in a comment below) later that day in Starbucks to *prove* I was not making this up.

Lastly, the dildo came fully out, so it's not like there is a chance he could not have seen it. After it came out, I pretty much avoided eye contact or looking at him at all, so I don't know what he was thinking. 

Now that I have read each comment, it seems like nearly every person is saying the same thing, which is that he doesn't think I'm a weird freak. There is a chance that I may have been over-thinking this situation with my typical skewed, negative perspective. Perhaps, in a few days, I will revisit the cafe without bringing it up and give him my number (I liked this idea more than apologizing as it avoids making it more awkward IMO). I am just terrified of rejection, so I don't know if I will or not. If I do, I will definitely update!

MSciCSI,78,140,1qrzde,486,"So today I was in Costco buying supplies for a family party I was to attend later in the day. I passed by the tyre section of the shop and noticed a beautifully presented case of windscreen wipers. They were good quality ones, Bridgestone, compared to the worn 'imported' eBay ones currently on my car. My current ones were ok, they were a bit noisy but I had no reason to change. I figured I could put something decent on her for once and splurged the £13 ($35) for a set of two. 
I got her home and figured I would fit them right away! This is the point when I remember that life isn't fair and no matter what youre doing you'll be able to find a way to fuck it up. So, the first wiper went on no issue.  I began on the second. It was a bit more difficult to get off but I got there in the end.
I left to get the new wiper. 
There was a light breeze of wind. 
The wiper arm fell back down. 
My windscreen smashed. 

Yeah her £13 upgrade turned into an £80 new windscreen.

poopypoopypoopypoopy,78,78,1qr0a6,179,"^^There ^^will ^^be ^^a ^^TLDR ^^at ^^the ^^bottom ^^^^teehee

I love my ass. It's a ton of fun to play with. You put things in, you take things out, this makes your 'me' time is so much better. As a guy, it's the only way to get in touch with your inner self and I think it's fascinating to say the least.

But today, this was the reason I was mentally preparing a makeshift will. I'm only 18 and I pretty much have nothing to do all day unless I'm working. Obviously if you have the house to yourself, you start to get creative with what you jerk to/with/how. Living at home still trying to get to school or something, I work odd hours. Today I was going to be working 1:30 to 10:00.

I felt particularly kinky today and decided that I wanted to test my colon's absorption ability.

I've gotten drunk once before, and had a beer or two maybe six other times. I clearly don't know how my body handles alcohol very well, let alone unfiltered anus liquor.

But this doesn't cross my mind. I just want to get a bit of a buzz this morning.

Warning: unfiltered ass play ahead
-------------

10:30a I have my shot of vodka in one of those tiny rum bottles and a straw.

I know my plan: create fart, insert bottle and swap fart for shot.

But things aren't perfect. The straw is tearing my asshole a new asshole. It's not that bad though, so I just tough the initial pain out and bend over on my knees and let gravity pull some air in.

Then I replace my straw for the bottle while standing and get back on my knees. Watching my reflection in our full length mirror I shove my ass almost perpendicular to the floor and both legs spread to see the view. I relax my abs and suddenly the bottle is now empty.

Wow. I feel nothing. I expected a little bit of a tingle or burn, but there's nothing. That is, until I take the bottle out. My anus seems to be the only thing that realises what a bad idea this is and screams a signal of pain on contact with the alcohol. Not cool. But whatever; I'm just gonna let the rest of it get absorbed so it won't touch my anus any more! Foolishly I want to jerk something fierce. A small shampoo thing gets to spend quality time with me. In it goes and off I get.

Unfortunately it slips out and a splash of anus burning liquid follows before I clamp shut. It burns. That's not good. ^^Oh. This probably wasn't a great idea. [I'm out.](http://cdn.chud.com/1/1f/295x221px-LL-1f759989_Jerry-Seinfeld-Leaving1.gif)

I'm getting to the toilet and feel the pressure of the leftover makeshift fart coming on. Apparently I took in more air than I thought.

Do you remember the burning of diarrhoea? Only having a shot worth of this is fantastic, because every drip leaving feels like letting satan poke my pink. Followed immediately after is a 20 second fart that feels like heaven. But all is not well in colon town. Head office has noticed a disturbance. An off balance. Some huge negative feedback loop starts the process of removing this foreign substance from my digestive tract, and starts doing some natural laxative shit to me.

Now I'm feeling waves of discomfort as my bowels rustle and shimmy shit at breakneck speeds to the throne. I'm now a hot mess of shit, vodka, and worry.

But the first wave is over and I'm feeling a little off but okay. So I lay down and rest a bit and think about what I've done.

My mind jumps to the idea of liver failure and within seconds I'm googling the symptoms. But I'm pretty much okay. I rest until I'm ready to go to work and for at least another 30 minutes I'm okay.

But the shits start again when I get to work. More gurgles and stuff make me run for the toilet every little while. I also started feeling a bit bloated, making me think that my liver was backing up and being problematic.

To make a long story shorter, a super fart after many mucusy damaged anus poops made me feel on top of the world. For the four hours there, though, I was certain I shocked my liver to failure or something.

Never doing that again.

TL;DR

I like my butt so I put vodka in my butt. My butt didn't like that and shot it and everything in my poop tubes straight out.

Maleus21,17,32,1r1h9k,142,"This actually happened a while back, but I just found this sub, and since all of my friends love this story, I might as well share it with everyone here.

So a while back, my friend and I worked together on 2nd shift. We normally got off work around 10pm, and it was customary for us to stay up late after work, since we didn't need to be in until late afternoon. So this day, my friend asks me to help him get a weight bench he is getting off of craigslist after work. I didn't have anything else going on, so I gladly offered a helping hand. 

The house we were going to was around 45 minutes away, so while getting gas before heading that way, I went in the gas station and picked up a king size Reeses cup and a large Red Bull to give me some energy after work. This was to be my undoing, because little did I know at that time, I am severely lactose intolerant (I never put 2 and 2 together, and didn't have insurance at the time, so I just thought I had stomach issues). 

So on the way there, we are just idly talking, I finish my 4 peanut butter cups and don't think a thing about them. About 15 minutes later, I feel a slight rumble in my stomach, since stomach problems are normal for me at this time, I pass it off, because I know Ill be home within a couple of hours. About 15 minutes later, the rumbling is more intense, and realize that my friends bathroom will probably receive the brunt of my soon to be coming anal assault. A little while later, we are in the person's neighborhood, and I'm starting to think that a gas station on the way home is inevitable. 

Finally we get to dude's house. He is a nice guy, weight bench is in his garage, but unfortunately it is fully assembled (it is one of those huge all in one machines). Well I haven't told my friend about my stomach, and he and the seller are finalizing the deal, then begin talking about how we are going to secure it in the back of my truck. At this point, I am almost in a cold sweat, my ass cheeks are so clenched so tight, you couldn't fit a needle between them. 

We have now finished loading the weight bench, I am giving myself pep talks and saying a prayer for every step I am taking. I do not want to ask a complete stranger whom we just met off of craigslist to use his bathroom obviously, but things are getting bad. That's when it happens... We are exchanging pleasantries, saying thank yous, and about to get in the truck. I am scouring my brain trying to think of the nearest gas station that I saw on the way there, and decide to let a tini-tiny little bitty poot out just to relieve some of the pressure, as my insides feel as though I am about to explode. Well ladies and gents, when you are in that condition, never ever trust a fart.

It broke the ass seal that my cheeks had welded together, and out comes a torrential down-pour of shit. I could feel it coming, I did my best to squeeze my ass together as tight as I could, which ended up resulting in ass cramps along with the spasms of my intestines wanting so desperately to empty, going against every ounce of my soul trying to stop it. The result was excruciating pain, which resulted me kneeling down, screaming in agony. 

Keep in mind, I had not let on to either of these guys that my stomach was even remotely upset, and I'm sure the sweating was mascaraed by the fact that this was taking place during the summer. So to them, it looked as if I just became possessed and began screaming. So now I am kneeling on the ground, my underwear filled up like a babies diaper, my friend is freaking out,  and the guy from craigslist is no doubt regretting every second of this transaction by now.

I slowly stood up, gathered what I could of myself, and kindly asked the seller if I could use his bathroom. His response was simply ""Umm sure dude, in and to the right, last door on the left"". I slowly walked in the house, praying that no small shit nuggets fell out onto their carpet on my way there. After I got in the bathroom, I took a look at the damage, it was irreparable. Now I had to make a decision, walk outside holding underwear, leave a pair of shit pants in his garbage, or option 3. I emptied as much as I could into the toilet, took out my pocket knife, and cut the massive shit stain out of my underwear. This was obviously was a much smaller piece of cloth, which allowed me to wrap it up in a massive amount of toilet paper and stick it in my pocket. I then cleaned my ass as much as possible (I didn't want to shower in his house also, I was already mortified). Put my holy boxers back on, walked outside, went straight to my truck thanking him as I walked by, got in and immediately drove off. Down the street I threw the shit wad out of the window, and began explaining the story to my now laughing so hard he cant breathe friend. 

I asked my friend if the guy had said anything when I went in his house. His reply to my friend ""Its just a hunch, but I think your friend needs to shit"".

This actually occurred a little under two years ago but anyway.

Every year during the long summer holidays my family have a tradition of heading up to go camping on the East coast of the North Island (NZ). The spot where we go is seriously a fairy tale place: a huge bay with golden sweeping sands, constant sunshine, warm water, big waves, few people, reefs to explore, you get the idea. This year I happened to know that there was a girl there I'd met the previous year who was quite into me. As you can imagine, I'm well keen. The morning after we arrive, virtually as soon as I get up, she bounds over and says she's taking me for my first swim, right now. I'm all about it so we head out into the blue to get wet (me hoping other things may get wet later on). I dive into the water and that's where things begin to take a turn for the unexpected.

As soon as I come up I realise the left side of my face is numb and I can't speak. 

Yep, you guessed it. Brain hemorrhage. 

Ended up spending two weeks in hospital, three months off school and two years later I still can't attend school 5 days a week because I get too tired. I haven't had any luck with the ladies since then either, may or may not be related.

After a long time convincing her that I don't have feelings for Katie (which is not completely true, but I would never do anything about it), we made up and went upstairs. In the middle of sex, my dumbass yells out ""Oh Katie!"" I was not even thinking about Katie during sex, it just slipped out.

ImAnAsshole12345,95,43,1r7wkc,124,"I love my wife more than anything and we have been together for 6 years. We've had our tough times, but they have been very few. 

I've had 4-5 female friends for almost 10-11 years and one since high school. With two, there were romantic feelings when we started talking, but that fizzled out and now it's just casual friendship (ie, how's your mom, the kids, etc). Off and on throughout the years we'd keep in contact via text just to see what's happening in each other's lives. Marriages, kids, buying houses, etc., when something big or a birthday came around a text would be sent off, catch up for a bit, and then back to no word for a year or more. 

When my mom died earlier this year there were two of these friends who were very supportive and I've kept up with them more and more, culminating in exchanging about 700 texts last month during the worst of my so far grief based depression. At this point I haven't been able to seek therapy because of my schedule, but once the semester is over that will happen. Nothing sexual is desired from either one of these friends; both are happily married with kids. In fact the last conversations were about classes, banana bread, and Thanksgiving plans. 

The part where I fucked up is that I never knew how my wife would take me having these female friends (who I haven't seen in over 10 years), so I never told her about them. All the conversations have been unknown to her until yesterday when she noticed a high number of texts on the bill and found the history. 

She is absolutely distraught and told me that she has lost trust in me. I know it looks horrible from the outside looking in. I also know that I should have talked with my wife more about what was bothering me and my depression instead of discussing it with two friends that she never knew about.

N_skrilla,51,35,1r5npr,101,"So around this time of year at the organic garden I work at, all of the hottest peppers we've been growing from early in the year have finished ripening, and are ready to be processed. My job in this is to take the dried habaneros and use a small device to grind them into pepper flakes.

Now anyone thats ever eaten a habanero knows that they are one spicy motherfucker of a pepper. Like 100 times more potent than a jalapeno. And to top it off, if you touch one of them with your bare hands, it'll burn like a motherfucker for about an hour.

So as I was making the emptying the flakes into a container, some of the residual powder left over spilled onto the leg of my pants. I thought nothing of it at the time, and just figured I'd wash my pants after I got done with my shift in a few hours.

Well once those few hours had passed, I had totally forgotten about the seemingly minor incident. When I got home and got ready to take a shower, I must have thrown my underwear on top of my pants; right where the habanero powder had set in. After I got out of the shower and put them back on, it took about 5 minutes after for me to realize how badly I fucked up.

The burning set in, as well as the panic. It started off as a dull burning which was uncomfortable but bearable, but just kept elevating for a solid 15 minutes. To give you a good idea of how this felt, just imagine the spiciest thing you've ever eaten in your life, the try to imagine that burning sensation of your gens. Hell, even the ""icy hot to the balls"" challenge didn't hold a candle to this. I immediately ran to the bathroom to try to wash the stuff off, but once it sets in you just have to ride it out. The burning went on for a solid hour before it decided to die down, and all the while I was sweating like hell and trying not to vomit from the shear pain of the whole ordeal.

I don't know what to do you guys. 

Damnit.... 

**TL;DR** : I am at Starbucks and my silent but deadly poot turned out to be a sneaky basTERD. As I get up to go to the bathroom, I realize I started my period in the chair. I am seemingly a mile from the bathroom. I'm still in the chair.

**UPDATE FOR THOSE INTERESTED** : Okay, so just as I was about to get up and I had convinced myself to be mature about it this girl comes and sits RIGHT next to me. She decides to linger around and do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING on Facebook for what seemed like FOR.EV.ER (45minutes or so). There was no way I was getting up and cleaning it up with her RIGHT THERE beside me, so yeah, I just set there (im)patiently and marinated in my juices. 

After she finally got the fuck up--I don't know why I am so mad at her; its not her fault I can't control my bodily functions--I put on my game face to figure out how to do this discreetly as possible. Just as I stand up, this guy decides that he likes what he sees and hits on me. I quickly pulled my jacket down over the stain and tried to reject him as politely and quickly as possible, but he was one of those persistent motherfuckers. Damn me and my v-neck shirts.

After, he left, I walked what seemed like a mile to the bathroom in the still fairly populated cafe. Once I was in the restroom, I discovered somewhat of good news. I actually had not sharted on myself; it was a blood clot (sorry if that's graphic, but at least it's not feces, right?). Thinking back on it, i don't know how I got those two holes mixed up, but my entrance is pretty close to the exit, so yeah.

Moving along, I had just changed book-bags, so no tampons or pads on me, so I decide to improvise, and use a shitload of paper-towels. Then, I stripped down and blow dried my pants. The stain was hardly noticeable anyways since I was wearing black bottoms, but I didn't want to stain any more chairs. 

Then, I grabbed some napkins and soaked them in the leftover water I had from earlier and went to work. It was a pleather type of material, so I managed to get most of the stain out with the help of some hand sanitizer. I like to think I played it off fairly well. For all they knew, I had just spilled some mocha.... I think I can actually show my face in there again.

Everything's going to be okay. Good thing I don't have any friends!

**Last Update (Morning After** : So, I went to Starbucks this morning. It is insanely busy, especially for a Sunday. I figured more people would be at church. Well, guys, I didn't clean it as well as I thought. The wetness from the water and sanitizer must have made it look less noticeable last night because this am, the stain is clearly still red. On a bright side, it was the only seat not taken, so I guess I'll never have to worry about not having a spot to sit down at least.

CryingCarrot,11,27,1qtbxk,90,"Earlier today I was feeling an abnormal amount of foine ^^^^(fineasfuck) so I decided to take a few high quality, classy ass photos. I guess I could probably refer to them as what they truly were, sexting pics. Pictures to be made use of on a later date.. Basically they were going to be the pictures of my butt that I keep on reserve just in case I have a fat day. 

I digress. I uploaded a few to my computer, went to go put them in my secret folder labeled ""Jack-and-Jill.mkv"" and I could not find them. I had no idea where these little digital fuckers went. It was my fault. I know I was responsible but fuck you microsoft. Fuck you Obama. Fuck you whale. They were RIGHT THERE uploading onto my desktop. NOPE not anymore. 

I begin to look through all of my photos. Mind you, there are a shit ton of photos. I am that asshole that takes a camera everywhere. I was stumbling upon some old stuff that got me feeling all nostalgic. I had now forgotten about the search for my ass as I dug deeper into the memories. 

Everything was lovely. Until I found a video of my grandmother's last birthday from last year. I debated whether or not to press play but I couldn't help myself. I watched and cried. I cried and sobbed. My anxiety decided to rear it's ugly head and I felt as if I was going to literally shit emotions. There were so many things happening. I closed all the windows on my computer and laid my head down on my keyboard. 

That's when my roommate/ex boyfriend ^^^^^don't ^^^^^tell ^^^^^me ^^^^^how ^^^^^to ^^^^^live ^^^^^my ^^^^^life walked in to see if I was alright. I looked up at him only to notice his very odd facial expression. It was one of a very very confused man. I started to explain through the sobbing what I just watched as he just sort of.. didn't know what to do I guess... So he slowly just closed my door and left. I composed myself and turn around to see that there is a slideshow of my brand new reserve ass pics taking up my very large screen. Tears still streaming down my face, I stare into my own ass for a moment thinking about what I have done. 

I guess the pictures ended up on my desktop but just took forever to show up. I am still unsure of how this all escalated.  ^My ^^asspics ^^^looked ^^^^pretty ^^^^^great ^^^^^so ^^^^^I've ^^^^^got ^^^^^that ^^^^^going ^^^^^for ^^^^^me.

Somehow, the fence hooked my thong. When I jumped down, it ripped my underwear right out of my pants, but not before I got the mother of all hanging wedgies.

I dropped to the ground. To quote Lonely Island, my butthole was on FIRE. The cooch didn't feel very good either. Basically, everything between my legs = :-(

fatdumbbitch,11,44,1r40dm,64,"When I was younger and first becoming familiar with my body I 'played' with a novelty baseball bat. It's a quarter of the size of a real bat and had a smooth finish. I have long since abandoned it for more appropriate battery operated devices. I cleaned it up and hid it in the back of a closet. Today I came home from campus and found my younger, autistic brother playing with the bat. He was holding it and stroking the wood and my heart stopped.

I was mortified and tried to ignore that this embarrassing childhood pleasure had resurfaced. But I wasn't gonna let this get to me. It was the end of a long day of school and work and I just wanted to have dinner and relax. Dinner had been eaten without me, so I whip it out of the fridge and into the microwave. Nothing, not even my pleasure bat, was going to keep me from relaxing. What was the worse that could happen? 

My brother obliged Murphy's law. He starts tapping it on the table to a beat set by a rhythmically challenged drummer. This interrupted my mom's favorite show, The Voice. Like one domino toppling another, my mom not enjoying her show upset my dad, who tries his best to afford her those few moments she can enjoy herself (the challenges of having an autistic child). 

Dad removes the bat from my brother's grasp and hushes any protest from my sibling. Now there's two family members that have touched my makeshift dildo. I was just gonna try and concentrate on my meal. My dad moved to get off the couch and presumably hide the bat. He however needs surgery on his leg, restricting his movement and requiring a certain amount of daily pain pills. I'm not sure if he was actually being mindful of his limitations or if he was coming up on needing more medication, but he decides he's not going to leave the couch. 

He calls me over from the dinning room, where I'm still trying to eat, and ask me to hide the bat in his room. I put on my poker face and take the bat. I stride with as much nonchalance as can be mustered, and hide the bat under my parent's bed.

So here I am, trying to keep my composure with my retired dildo bat hidden in my dad's room and it's location not hidden very well from my autistic brother. Needless to say, I no longer have an interest in finishing my dinner. ",TIFU when my autistic brother played with my old masterbation bat.,108
drtygrl,14,26,1qv1ss,62,"So, let me just preface this by saying, I'm fine this happens occasionally.

I woke up this morning around 8am, my hubs had said last night he wanted to sleep in this morning so he could stay up later tonight to watch football (Go Chiefs!) so I let him rest while I laid in bed finishing a book I had started and surfing around on Reddit for a bit. When I tried to get up to go pee I had quite a solid case of vertigo and bounced off the wall a few times getting to the toilet. I didn't think anything of it, like I said it happens. Around noon, I wake him up to go get some breakfast and some snack supplies for the game. 

He apparently woke up frisky, so he rolled over and started fingering me. Vertigo be damned, I am not turning down a frisky hubs. I let him continue for a few minutes, enjoying the attention. He sits up to reposition himself and I take that opportunity to give him a little mouth hug. In the process of sitting up too quickly (I know better than to do that when I'm already dizzy, I'm a nurse, yada yada) the room started spinning again. I, not being deterred from wanting to get some morning action, proceeded to go to town on his dick. No problem so far. I start to try to seductively slip off my panties and that's where I fucked up. 

The room spun, I fell over sideways (not sexy) and I ended up with a muscle cramp from the odd way I landed tangled up in my lacy undies. Me being my usual graceful and sexy self ended up in a complete giggle fit, like I was a 12 year old girl. That really was the end my getting any dick this morning.  My husband, god love him, is just watching the Stumbilina Olympics going on by his man bits, hoping I don't flail into him and take him down with me. At this point I have to just give up on getting lucky and just take care of him. At least we both had a good laugh and one of us got off. 

He still hasn't stopped laughing about the scene I made this morning.

So story is me and my brother are trying for green cards/permanent residencies only my brother didn't come to the US on time so the day earlier, he gets kicked off the flight and is stuck in our home country and is summoned to a court hearing months later.

We look similar and our names are the same EXCEPT for my middle name which is customary (and I use this middle name) and I applied/got the job using this middle name (it didn't matter at the time - every other record was using this middle name except for my foreign passport). One week later after my brother got into this trouble (I didn't know at all about what happened), two guys in suits come up to my cubicle, and ask me my full name - I say yeah, that's me but I go by ""MIDDLE NAME"". Can you come with us please? My boss asks what the hell is going on and the immigration guys tell him I am illegally staying in the US and I will face jail time for using a fake identification. 

I went out kicking and screaming and was stuck in jail for one day until my friend comes by with another friend (lawyer) to sort out the mess. I get released with apologies. BUT that's not the bad part.

So I come back to work and get told that I am fired.

I hope we can get drinks again. I'm sorry. Good luck."" I get served a termination letter the following day.

ScorpioEverlast,19,25,1qsyl3,46,"So, there I was just sitting on a bench at my local mall minding my own business. Partaking in one of my favorite hobbies of people-watching.
about 10 minutes in a black prob 17-20 y/o set down not next to me but within conversational distance. After about 5 more minutes, a few of his friends came and chatted with him about Lebron vs Kobe, shoes, weed, ect ect ( typical black guy conversations ). Not 2 minutes after his friends left, he spoke up and asked me: ""Hey man, you wouldn't happen to have change for a $50 would you""? I replied without hesitation: ""IDK, let me check"".  

Now for some background. I usually am pretty quick-minded with situations. I pay attention to my surroundings. I often eves-drop into conversations taking place around me. And usually always keep myself out of precarious situations. BUT NOT TODAY!

I knew I had just cashed my payroll check a few hours ago and kept some cash on me. I knew I had a few $20s but didn't know if I could make the remaining $10. After a quick check in my wallet, I had the money in hand. 2 $20's, a $5, and 5 $1's. We traded bills and immediately I knew the bill wasn't right. The feel was wrong. So instantly placed it up against another bill and it was smaller in dimension. I then checked for the watermarks and there were none to be found. I instantly said to him: ""NO, I believe this bill is fake and I want my money back"". what took place next was a slow but steady escalation right in the middle of a crowded mall. 

He stood up and stated: ""Its not fake, I just got it from a store in change and need to break it to pay a friend back."" I stood up and blocked his progress of walking away. when we both stood up I realized what I was up against. This kid was a good 6 inches taller than me, easily 50lbs on me and at this point, angry that I had confronted/trapped him. 

Now I new that @ this point he was NOT getting out of my presence, NO MATTER WHAT! I also knew that it was his word against mine but that if worse came to worse, that we were or at least should be being recorded via CCTV.  

I again stated: ""this bill is fake and I want my money back NOW and you can walk away or I am calling security"". He then said: ""go ahead, you have the bill. Its your word against mine. You think they are going to believe me because I'm black and you're white?"" At this point I was getting pissed but had to keep my calmness or shit could get out of hand fast!

Immediately I yelled in a stern voice ""SECURITY"". We were within Earshot of the guest services booth thankfully and I know at least a half dozen people were watching at this point. He said: ""Hey man, I just got that. I didn't know it was fake. Let me go get them."" I said, No, its too late. I gave you the chance and you passed"". and Yelled ""SECURITY"" once more.

By this time, he was very nervous and trying numerous times to leave but i had him partially cornered between the bench we where on, a kiosk selling hair supplies, and the wall. I glanced over his shoulder and seen a very large man in a suit walking our way. The gentleman asked: ""what seems to be the issue"" and the kid tried to split once more and I sternly said: ""Do not let him leave!"" 

by this time a few more ""mall cops"" arrived and separated us and got both stories. I repeated what had happened while he still attempted to leave again. The man on the suit told him he was being retained and called for local PD. Not a minute later I repeated the incident to the officer. The officer then spoke with the kid. He obtained the bill from me and looked it over and stated it was def a fake. The kid tried to play dumb not knowing about the water marks and such. 

The officer didn't buy it, obtained the kids ID, spoke on his radio, then asked me how I would like to proceed. I told him that I gave him the option to get out of it and he passed. I asked the officer if he had the right to search the kid. He said NO. I then stated that he could have more bad bills on him. The officer then went back to the kid and asked for consent to search him. Like a scared kid, he said yes. The officer did a quick scan then took his wallet and sure enough. 4 more FAKE $50's! needless to say, the ball is in my court!

The officer immediately arrested the kid and read him his rights! HE was pissed!! cussing and yelling obscenities at me. 

It was at this time that a was flooded with different emotions. Knowing I fucked up by trying to be a good patron. The potential for the situation to end way worse for me. And the overwhelming feeling that I did right by standing my ground and busting this asshole!

I immediately went and got a soda to cure my crazy cotton mouth and left the mall. Now, a few hours later. looking back, The way I handled the situation has given me a great deal of confidence in my ability to handle a situation with a stranger. I do know this feeling could very well one day make things worse for my but for now, I feel great! but I still FUCKED UP!

a_burning_throwaway,11,6,1r658d,45,"I work in a research lab, en route to getting my master's degree. It's a biochemical lab, so there's not too much that's very dangerous, and overall it's a pretty relaxed place to work. Despite official policy pretty much nobody wears lab coats or goggles, shorts abound in the summer, and gloves are mainly to keep from contaminating your sample rather than protecting your hands. It can be easy in this environment to sort of forget that safety is still important sometimes. 

Yesterday I got to the lab at 8:30 am and was there until about 8 pm, having had a lot of work to finish up. Most of my days that run that long include a lot of downtime, but on this occasion I was actually doing work for most of it. Tedious, monotonous, soul-crushing work, involving repeated treatments with a base, that left me exhausted and brain-dead at the end of the day.

I leave the lab and breathe a sigh of relief, and take a much-needed urination break before heading home. I enter the washroom, zip down, and grab my donger, as is man's sacred right. Suddenly, I feel a sort of itch. I ignore it and continue as I was, but before long the itch intensifies. And then it transforms into a burning. The burning is gentle at first; it does not remain so. Soon it feels as though a scornful fire elemental is attempting to blow me and I am trying very hard to stay still so as not to piss all over myself, despite the fiery waves of pain that now crash upon my pubic shore.

When it becomes too much to bear, I am thankfully nearly done but still manage to splatter some on my pants as I am forced to let go, doubling over with my pants half-down before I finally recover somewhat from the pain. The supernova heat has die down to a much calmer, smaller nova, and I force the thing back into my pants.

I evidently forgot to wash my hands after working with the base all day. It wasn't that concentrated, so it didn't hurt my hands or anything like that, but as soon as I touched my sensitive wang-flesh it made its wretched presence known.

BurpleNurple,11,19,1qtvp2,41,"Okay, this was actually last week. But I was too busy fucking up other things to put my initial fuck-up into words.

It was Veterans Day at my school. Each year, we celebrate by inviting any parents/grandparents/great-grandparents/you-get-the-point to come to the ceremony. We sing some dramatic ***fuck yes America*** songs, have a few snotty middle schoolers speak, and give a slideshow on all the most recent wars in which the U.S. has been fighting.

So, the elementary school kids were all getting up from the bleachers to stand in front of us and sing a song. They walked single file behind their teachers. They looked like little ducklings with an insatiable eagerness in their eyes, an eagerness to sing about our country. Just kidding. They were really cute, though.

The kindergarten kids were walking up last, since they are obviously the cutest. Some kept getting distracted by the crowd, stopping to gaze upon the numerous high schoolers staring at them, having to be gently nudged by their teachers to keep walking.

This one girl, though. She was trying to walk in a straight line while simultaneously staring at the scary high schoolers. Needless to say, hilarity ensued. The girl fell RIGHT OVER on her face. I'd say you had to have been there, but I swore in that moment it sounded just like a giant 50-pound pancake belly-flopping into a pool of pure liquefied giggles. Just... FLOP. PLOP. SMACK. That girl went DOWN.

Unfortunately for me, this occurred at a rather unfortunate time: the kids had been walking up to sing while one of said snobby middle schoolers was reading off statistics about WWI. There were graphic pictures on the screen, too.

I started *dying*.

Shit is so much funnier when you're not supposed to be laughing at it, too.

After the initial burst of uncontrollable laughter, I kept snorting little giggles during the subsequent slide on WWII each time I thought about how I wasn't supposed to be laughing about that fucking kid. It sounded like I was giggling over how many casualties we had in WWII. Gah.

NiceRideMan,3,11,1r79fs,41,"Preface: I live in a semi-detached house, so we share our driveway with our neighbors. There's enough room in the driveway for a total of 4 cars. They're a rather sizeable family, so they have 3 cars and pack them all into the driveway. We never did mind because we only have 2 cars, and if they park the 3rd car a little on their lawn and partially in the driveway, we can fit 5 cars. Although I didn't mind, I still found it annoying at times since it was a tight fit leaving me less room to maneuver.

The neighbors are a really nice Muslim family. Most of the reason I didn't mind them squashing 3 cars into the driveway was because they did things for us frequently. Here in Ontario, it snows a lot sometimes. If they saw that our driveway hadn't been cleaned, they'd do it for us a lot of the time. And they'd bring over leftover food from feasts, and it was so fucking good. So over those 10 years, I never said anything about their 3 cars.

Preface over, here's what happened. A couple of days ago I was at university, and my mom texted me saying the neighbor had passed away. Keep in mind this was a large family. There was an 80 year old with his wife, 2 of their kids (Both mid-30s, who had wives and kids of their own.) 10 people total. The 80 year old man passed away because his kidney failed.

I am a guy btw, never put any colour in my hair etc.  Our bartender, basically a fuckbuddy of the barfly, repeatedly told me ""Yeah, yeah, do it.  She's good! She makes a living cutting hair from home."" Finally I give in.  ""Sure, I'm growing out my hair a bit, but you can put a few light highlights in my hair to lighten it up.""

The next day I call her up and arrange to meet her at her place.  I arrive, its a ground level apartment.  She greets me, we go inside.  Filthy carpet, the tv had what I could only imagine a stream of dried jizz dripped down it.  ""Okay"" I think to myself. ""She does this for a living, its all good.""  She takes me to her ""chair"".  It was literally a broken down lawn chair. ""Fuck! I can't even back out of this now."" I sit down, she pulls out a tube of something and a plastic fork.  She gets to work.  My head is feeling heavy at this point.  I reiterate to her that all I wanted was some nice blending in highlights.  ""Oh yeah! I totally understand.  Don't worry! I know what I'm doing!"".  I'm basically shitting myself at this point in time.  She throws a plastic shopping bag on my head and has me sit there.  I start frantically texting my fiancee. ""What the fuck did I do?"" ""Why did I do this?!?""  Finally she comes back.  ""Time to rinse it out!"" We enter her bathroom.  She had me kneel beside her filthy toilet and put my head under the tap in her bathtub.  At this point all I can think of is ""Get this shit off of my head! I don't even care that I'm kneeling beside her disgusting toilet!""  She appraises her job and decides she need to put more bleach or whatever on.  Keep in mind I am yet to see a mirror.  ""Its okay, I'm sure it's..."" I feel more bleach on my head. ""FUCK!"" Okay, bag, rinse, repeat.  She's done! She shows me the final job.  I want to die.

I take off the hat.  She bursts out laughing. ""Who did this to you??? Why did you let it happen??""  We make an emergency appointment with her hairdresser.  I get there, she looks at me, holding back laughter and says ""Did you lose a bet or something?"" followed with ""Wow, she must really hate you.""  She matched my original colour, puts the dye in, we let it sit. 3 times we had to do that as the dye wouldn't hold.

Today my boyfriend came over to hang out and watch TV. Nothing out of the ordinary until things start to get heated. Eventually I decide that I want to give a blowjob. The best way to do it was to unzip and pull it out. I begin to get to work when suddenly I hear a key in the door. Shit. Someone is home and about to walk in on said blowjob. I did the logical thing and try to put it away. I think its in and rush to zip his pants.

But today, today I had a revelation. Today I said I would do well. 
Only had I not forgotten that something has always got to give.

Anyway. So I'm in Calculus, getting ready to start a quiz when prof asks if anyone has any questions, and I remember that I don't quite remember how to do something. So I promptly raise my hand and begin to try to explain what concept it is exactly that I am not grasping. 
Word vomit at it's best. It comes out something like ""I can't.. remember how to do one of the things you assigned last week for homework and and uhhhh I just... can we go over it?""

Now, this woman is no fucking joke. Very fuck you personality and extraordinarily obvious when she's judging you.  

So there I am, freeeeeeeeaking out because she's staring into my soul and I can't be at ease really because she's intimidating me and i'm scared, I start to blurt out something along the lines of, ""RIGHT, BUT I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT.""

dudusan,5,7,1r3xde,37,"I occasionally go for a swim during the weekend and always top it off with some time in the spa. Whilst in the spa, I sat on a side that had broken jets. So only half the people in the spa had their jets working. When one occupant left, this 70 something year old man signalled me to come sit next to him, where the other person had just got up from. The old guy, I'll call him Peter, was a bit familiar. I had seen him at the spa a few times before. I started chatting with Peter. He was rather funny. He kept commenting on the women who were entering the spa. It was funny to me considering his age. We also spoke about other things such as my wife, his wife, his kids etc.
During the chats, when Peter was making and a joke...he would pinch me in the abdominal area. It was a bit strange but just thought, whatever, its probably just a greek gesture etc (Where Im from, we kinda clap hands whilst laughing). This goes on for about 4-5 times. When I told him i was leaving, he asked me to stay for another 5 mins. In my mind, I thought perhaps he is just a lonely man who just wants to chat. I stayed for another 5 and left. 
In the changing room, i realised someone had pinched my tshirt. Was frantically looking for it when peter walked in. He got dressed whilst I doing rounds looking for my shirt. He even assisted me by taking me to the ""lost/found"" area. I decided to just ride my bike topless and gave up looking for the shirt.  As peter was leaving too, we walked out of the complex together. As i went to my bike, Peter asked if i would like to go for a drive. I agreed and really thought that perhaps this guy has something to get off his chest or is depressed etc. Also thought wont hurt to listen to a guys issues/cries for help etc. So i got into his car and he drove to the other side of the car park. He then began talking about porn movies and i was laughing all the while. It was seriously funny that a guy his age was talking about shit like that. he then asked me why all african guys have big dicks. Now, nothing weird here....as we get this question countless times once we venture into those types of conversations. Peter then asked me if i had a big dick. Again, i laughed this off and just kinda said ...normal type. Peter then puts his hand on the back of my neck and my mind started racing. I just thought, well, if i move or reach for my shoelace, he will let go. So i did that and he let go. He then asks me if i had ever had sex with a man. At this point, i was now feeling fucking awkward and now had suspicions. So i categorically/vehemently said no and that I would never do that as I am not that way. He then reached out and pinched my nipple!  At this point I told him i had to leave. He asked if I was sure that i wanted to leave. So I left.

Thing is, I felt dirty when this guy did this. I was actually innocently thinking i'm just chatting with this guy, whilst he obviously had other intentions. I also, through this experience, know what it feels like for the waitresses who have sexual innuendo left right and centre just because they smiled at a male customer etc.

Its taken me a few days to get over this. Im certain he thinks I am playing hard to get as I did not exactly say NO to his advances (I realised it too late). To him, I got in his car, kept laughing whilst he was pinching me etc and these are signs of someone interested. Im sure I will meet him again at the spa.

I think it was about 1 A.M. (maybe 1:30 ish A.M.), and we stumble up the stairs to our new apartment, first thing I go do is take a piss, naturally. As I open the door there she is, just a shirt on, and through my blurred vision, I make out what appears to be something around her waist...her strap-on.

She starts pushing me back into the bed with supernatural strength and pushed me backwards onto the bed and ripped off my jeans, and-fucked me like never before...without any lube. I felt like Jonah Hill (only less fat) in ""This is the End"", now there's usually nothing wrong-but once again, **she didn't use any lube**, no spit either.

After she had her way with me, I lied on that bed, writhing in pain because she treated my ass like no man I've been with (oh, I'm bisexual if you haven't picked that up yet, but I do know of some straight men who let their girlfriends/wives peg them) and at the same time in a ""the best orgasm I've had in my life [*so far*]"" coma.

whatshalike,7,13,1r1zh1,26,"Red Eye from LAX to PHL. The guy sitting next to me arrives, an escort holding his bag. Never seen that before. He pays the escort a few bucks—kinda just gives him a handful. I get up and he takes his time squeezing by. He’s a big big guy, wrap around Gucci shades. He gets settled, mumbling about Grimace, the big purple autistic guy from McDonalds. “You don’t know who Grimace is?” I don’t know how to respond so I give a half chuckle, then realize that he’s on his Bluetooth. He mumbles into in until the moment the plane is airborne. He’s taking up some of my seat, but I don’t say anything. No sense confronting him about something out of his control (in the short run, arguably).  I can hear his music through his Beats By Dre. Fine. I’m washed and pretty drunk so I fall asleep within minutes of take off. 

I wake up after a couple hours. The guy sitting next to me is on his laptop—looks like a music program, FL Studio or something—and even though his screen is tilted down, it’s on full bright. I can easily hear his music through his headphones. I put my headphones on and try to fall back asleep, but between the light and sound coming off of this guy, there’s no chance. I consider saying something but settle on a passive aggressive turn away from him. A half hour passes—nothing. My back is aching and my eyes are clenched shut but I’m wide awake, and getting mad. I’m thinking about calling him out: I would, all calculated, rip off my headphones, turn to him and say “Will you give it a rest?!” He’d either apologize, deferring to my obvious rightness, or say “Hey man I’m just doing my thing/I gotta work/something to this effect,” and I’d snarkily say “Well can you do it without keeping everyone else on the damn plane up?” Yeah, I’m awesome, I’m a hero. I settle on the non-confrontational route and think about asking the attendant for a sleep mask. When I open my eyes, the “call attendant” light it blinking. What happened? Is someone else gonna call this guy out? Does this airplane respond to passive-aggressive thoughts? The attendant comes over to our three-person row and waits for one of us to ask him for something, but no one does. He stands there for a beat, unspeaking, and I shrug at him without taking off my headphones. 

Let me be clear. I didn’t chicken out. I did chicken out. But I didn’t call the guy. I couldn’t just swoop in on someone else’s call.  Maybe something else was going on, something more pressing. Gremlin on the wing, et al. Then I just look like an asshole. Attendant leaves and I follow, ask him for a sleep mask cause the guy next to me has been on his laptop the whole damn flight. He tells me there’s only an hour or so until we land. Also we don’t have sleep masks. Fair enough. Head back to my seat and decide to get on my own laptop, with my f.lux lighting set to “candle—super dim.” That’ll show the fucker who’s courteous.  I organize documents, pictures; bury porn that I’d lazily saved straight to my desktop. The guy next to me pushes the attendant button. Well that solves that. Attendant comes over and the guy next to me is unaffected, looking straight ahead, absorbed by his music. I’m not about to help him so I pretend not to see the attendant. He only stays for a couple seconds this time. 

Getting near Philadelphia, tray tables go up. Guy next to me calls the attendant a third time. The light blinks for about five minutes, no doubt while the attendant decides how he’s gonna tell us off. He comes over and launches right into it, I take off my headphones. 

“…third time I’ve been over here…” 

I elbow the guy next to me, kinda hard. He jumps, takes off his Beats and looks up. 

“…even acknowledge me.” 

Guy next to me says “Sorry, I can’t see.” No shit, it’s dark and you’re wearing Gucci shades over half your face. 

“Well what do you want?” 

“Can I get a glass of water, no ice?” 

The attendant already has one in his hand. “Here, take it.” We land. Guy two rows ahead of me asks to help grab his bag from the overhead bin. Guy next to me is doing that awkward half stand of someone trying to join the sovereign people of Aislestandistan, but I’m boxing him in. His head is right in front of the bin I need to open. “Hey, watch your head,” I ask a little too softly, like I do. “Hey excuse me can you watch your head?” People are looking. Guy sitting on the other side of him taps him and he realizes what’s going on, ducks. I grab the guys bag and pass it forward. I ask the same favor of someone sitting two rows behind me. We stand for a few minutes while the uppermiddle class deplane. I do that thing you do when you’re awkwardly close to a group of strangers for an awkwardly long time—my eyes half dart around, half look down at my sweater. Get caught looking at that blonde girl twice. I notice that the guy sitting next to me has a stack of short tubes in his hand, the length of straws and the width of fingers. The hell is that? People clear up and I’m finally about to get off the plane when the guy sitting next to me stands up right in front of me and starts feeling around at the overhead bin across the aisle. A woman behind us sees this and taps me, gesturing towards him “can you…” Can I? Can I what, help him? Why should I help…mother fucker. I am the dumbest person I know.

Calamitycatji,24,4,1qx5lx,22,"So my bike was already giving me some problems, however since i am not mechanically inclined i had no idea what was wrong with it and figured it would be fine till i got home.

Both of my roommates work at the local head shop thats right on the main strip of my town. On my way home i stopped by the shop to pick up this pipe i had been eyeing for awhile. I parked out back, went in grabbed the pipe, and broke it in with the boys in the basement. 

Fast-foward. Shop's closing and we are all headed out; this is when the trouble starts. The bikes not starting and I have no idea what to do. At this point it's too late to actually call someone, so I decide to just push it in the backdoor and leave it inside for the night. now it's not that i lived in a bad area and was worried about it being stolen, but rather i live in a college town where it wouldn't surprise me for some drunk asshole to just walk by and push it over. Either way the decision was made to push it inside, go on with the night, and figure it out in the morning.

Now, I am not a morning person at all so i just planned on going back to the shop a few hours after they open. This way I had time to sleep in then maybe get some breakfast. 

So i'm at home sleeping and my phone starts ringing and i'll usually silence my phone at least once before I'm actually awake, so it usually takes a few straight calls if you want to get ahold of me first thing in the morning. 

I finally wake up and answer my roommate's call and he is not happy. He starts yelling at me telling me how the whole shop smells like gas and how i needed to get down and clean everything up. The neighboring businesses had already called the gas company and local authorities. I immediately get up and head into town stopping on the way for some supplies. Apparently white vinegar works pretty well on cleaning up  the smell of gas. I arrive at the shop only to realize it wasn't just a little gas and that my entire gas tank has emptied into the store. It took me several hours to get it all cleaned up but we didn't have to deal with any cops. Not having to explain myself or interact with police at all was a huge plus on account of them making me extremely nervous. we basically just played dumb to the other businesses once i had it cleaned up. Saying things like ""oh I don't know but it's definitely going away"" The gas company people sent someone out but that was clearly just to satisfy the other businesses. the guy came checked the electric meters and was on his way. As for the gas less bike i just had a tow truck come pick it up and take it to the repair shop. Needless to say i won't be parking indoors for a bit

tl;dr - motorcycle broke down. parked it in store. gas leaked everywhere. other business though it was a natural gas leak so called authorities",TIFU: by parking my motorcycle inside my friends head shop,26

Mid-jump he swings his arms upwards to gain a little more momentum and of course swings directly at my nose! Not just hitting my nose but punching it with a closed fist UPWARDS!

It was luckily far from as painfull as all the shocked faces staring at me would imply (probably due to the alcohol) 
I ran for the bathroom still bleeding everywhere. When i got to the mirror i saw something i did not recognize, my nose... wonkier than willy himself.
I paniced and did the first thing that came to mind, i grabbed it...
Sharp pains and crunching sounds followed. As the drunken idiot i was, i was also convinced it would stay like that unless i broke it back in place.
So i did and god damn crusty crab that was not fucking pleasant!

We entered the washroom and during this the conversation somehow shifted from football to my 'stache. Keep in mind I was growing it for Movember and it was not a pretty sight, to say the least. Getting a buzz cut just added insult to injury. Then, for some unfathomable reason, I start rambling on about how I looked like a stalker and a rapist because of how a girl who was in the lift with me alone the day before was staring at me as if I were going to do unspeakable things to her. Big mistake. My friends started snickering and giggling. Being the fucktards they are, I thought they were just messing with me. That shoulda been my first clue.

stupid, stupid idea.. reeeeeally stupid idea.
i managed to patch the hole and everything seemed fine after i had let it dry a bit. turned the water on and ""hey would you look at that"" worked great, i thought.

We were getting along well and things were going nicely and I was excited about going with her. She's very attractive and I figured I had a good chance of getting laid. Sorry for being crude but I'm in high school, can you really blame me?

There are five of us; myself, my date, her friend, her gay friend, and her other friend. We start playing Truth or Dare to be as cliche as possible, and my date and I are the only ones doing dares.

So going through the fridge, I spot a pack of bacon.  Being hungry and it being breakfast, I couldn't really say no to bacon.  Within moments I was frying bacon on the stove with nothing on but pajama pants.  Very quickly, I started to get second thoughts but I was already too far in and couldn't back down to my tasty foe. It was just then when a big blob of bacon grease popped up and landed just on the right side of my right nipple. Jesus fucking Christ it felt like ten thousand suns just went supernova all over my nip.  I ended up not wanting to burn the fingertips of my precious gaming fingers and let the searing blob torment my nipple.

MadameQuiggles,14,12,1r4chx,13,"Today when I went to put away the laundry for my mother I found out that she was upset at me because I didn't hear the buzzer go off. I continued to fold the laundry so there wasn't much to get in trouble for, but out of no where my mother starts yelling ""You never do anything unless I get mad or unless it's on your damned computer!"" Wow. Okay, that was totally out of the blue and I know that if I say anything back it will just be wrong, so I just continue and finish folding the clothes and fall back to my bedroom after I'm done. 
""GET YOUR ASS OUT HERE."" .. what did I do now? I continue to walk out in to the kitchen where my mother waits impatiently for me and then screams to sit down at the kitchen table. ""YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING I ASK AND YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ME. YOU ONLY SIT ON YOUR COMPUTER AND PLAY SHITTY GAMES AND WANT TO BE WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING HELPFUL AROUND THE HOUSE ANYMORE. WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO LIVE WITH YOUR GRANDMOTHER AND GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE? I'M FUCKING DONE."" All of this followed by my mother stomping out of the front door and slamming both the main door and the screen door. Unable to really control my tears, seeing as how I was just told how worthless I was and to get the ""fuck out"" of my home... I continued to pick up the glass jar she smashed against the kitchen floor and put away the laundry I was busy with before this ordeal broke out. 

I figured I might as well take this as the time to try to move out. I'm eighteen and in college. My home-life has gone down-hill very fast since my mother had been diagnosed with a specific type of bone cancer. She feels horrible every day and I try my hardest to please her, but I suppose this was the chance I needed to take to have at least a week to calm both of ourselves down until we can talk about a compromise of our feelings. I addressed this idea to my brother and father and both of them told me to do as I felt was best, but of course my father wanted me to stay at home and just ignore it until she was calm. Nearly impossible. 

When my mother got home again I asked in a very nice way if I could spend a few days over at my friends house (this friend had been there through the entire thing and was planning on leaving that day anyways). Mother was very unhappy. ""No. No. Because I said no. No. No, you will not."" Well.. I did anyways because I'm eighteen and I suppose I'll have to learn from my experiences and this will be one of them, whether I made a huge mistake or not. My mother went on another tantrum and started hitting things off of the walls and blurted out ""I'M LEAVING."" slammed the door and left in the truck. I was told to leave everything behind, but we all know we can't survive with nothing. I took whatever I could and had my friend help me pack. I had her mother on the way to help us get to the McDonalds to activate my old WalMart phone online when I realize that I can't do that until the battery's charged. 
*So here I am, sitting at the shitty fast food restaurant at 6:30 PM with no phone or anything really.* I decided to go to my boyfriends, which no one expected, and was able to contact my grandmother. 

I am now sitting at my grandmother's house, which I guess is now my ""home.""  Today was truly my biggest fuck up of my eighteen years on this planet. 

**EDIT:** So I went to try to confront my mother about a possible agreement as to how we could settle our issues and just let things slide back down the pointy slope until we were okay again... That went HORRIBLY. I came back with my grandmother after receiving a text stating my mother was starting to gut out my room (Which had roughly a grand worth of money of electronics, if not more, still inside that I couldn't get in my rushed exit).  My mother was breaking down in tears on the porch when we arrived, which tore me apart, and my grandmother and I tried to talk with her but all we got was that she wasn't over it and she didn't want to talk. I gathered what I could, all of my expensive items and got out. 

After I transported all of my items my grandmother decided it might be a good idea to open up my own bank account; my original one was attached to my father's account. So we went to do that, but had to postpone it due to my lack of ID that I forgot that morning in a scrambled mess to get my items. On the way BACK to the bank, the second time, my grandmother received a text stating that my mother couldn't take it and she just wanted to hug and hold me again. We decided the bank could wait. 

When I got back to the house, I came inside and I told my mother I was there for her and that everything was okay. I comforted her as best as I could and eventually i got out of her that she didn't want me to move out and that she wouldn't scream anymore and that she was sorry for her actions. She for some reason was convinced I wouldn't move back in and told me to take the white car so I could get to college and back every day on my own.. sweet, but I don't think I'd be able to take the car if it was at my grandmothers and I was at home. 

In the end: My mother needed to rest so my grandmother and I fixed supper for everyone and served her what she felt she could eat, she helped me to reactivate my cell phone so I could have a means of communication again, I brought my stuff back over and told my mother that I would stay, but eventually she will have to come to terms that I am not her and I do not see everything she thinks needs to be done every day. And that she couldn't have been so upset over dirt that she would be THAT upset: something else must have been really pulling her down, but I would be there for her.

*So here I am at 10:50 PM posting on Reddit, laying in my own bed, wishing this entire thing would have just never happened.*

phailcakez,5,0,1r68uz,7,"the short of it is, I am not officially registered for this class at all. Due to an agreement between myself and the prof, i would be able to attend class, read the material and participate in discussion, but not be actually registered for the class at all, even as an auditor. I didn't need the credits at all, so this would allow me to save some money and still take a class I was interested in and as an added bonus, I didn't have to write any papers.

 This was all going fine until today when i went for advisement. I am due to graduate this December, but found out that I cannot due to a three hour credit shortage in my major field. The kicker is that if I had been registered for the class, everything would have been fine. So, I did actually need the class...

l3radrocks,7,2,1r6lt9,7,"   To really understand this story, you need to know a little about my school. I live in a metropolitan area in the South. Being in the south, most adults have absolutely zero clue of how computer work or function. That included my Digital Tech teacher. I had planned originally to take computer ed classes my whole high school career, but the was already stopped my freshmen year because my High School forces us to take Health and P.E our freshmen year, and I took Spanish as my second elective. So this year I was naturally excited when I finally got to sign up for my computer class. Growing up, there was never any real adult that could teach me about anything related to computers so I was interested in what I would learn in this class. I hoped that it would be a lot. I was dead wrong. Put quite simply, my teach is an idiot.
   
Now, I usually don’t mind teachers even if I personally don’t like them, but this teacher is fully honestly an idiot, and frankly the whole class is idiotic. A perfect example was our first project. We were charged with choosing parts to build our computer. I thought that this would be an easy A and breezed through it. Here’s the good part, I failed it epically. First of all, she took of TWENTY points for not including a FLOPPY DRIVE. Yes, my teacher still believes that floppy drives are still regularly used.  As I stood there baffled by this, she tells me that she is going to take ANOTHER TWENTY points off for using Pcpartpicker.com instead of an excel spreadsheet, when she explicitly told us that we could do the list any way we wanted. Not wanting to cause a scene, I bit my tongue.
  
 Fast forward an excruciating four months of me correcting her pretty much daily on most things she says about computers. For a week now she has been saying that our next project will involve making a game and programming it ourselves. I dance with joy thinking that I might learn something useful finally, after getting through topics such as “Digital Safety”, and “Good online citizenship”. Well fuck was I wrong. She announces a day later that we will be using Scratch.com. If you aren’t aware of what scratch.com is, it is pretty much a program intended for elementary school kids to teach them how to program. Don’t get me wrong, it’s great but I was expecting something actually interesting. So we weren’t supposed to start this project until next week, but I usually do 2 weeks’ worth work daily in that class, seeing as how it is 99% busy work (She has only stood and lectured us once). So the next day, I get started in the Scratch project. I decide to just make a simple space shooter, a lot like Galactica. Finished in in two days, and it worked perfectly. Had 2 weeks’ worth of work done in 2 days. I was free to sleep and read in that class for 2 whole weeks.

This morning, she starts yelling at the class for playing games and being on sites they aren’t supposed to, and said that she had already written some of us up for playing games; all the whole staring at me with a smirk on her face. Of course, the first thought that pops to mind is that she is going to write me up for playing my own project. I already knew she hated me. There is no question about it, everyone in the class knows it. I tried to no get on her bad side even after floppy drive incident, but it did inevitably happen. I don’t purposely aggravate her, her whole experience in our class is a lot like one of those days when nothing ever goes your way. I don’t mean it to be like that, but it is. 
 
  Now to the inevitable. I spent all day today freaking out whenever they called on the intercom, expecting them to say “Mrs.OP, can we have l3radrocks to the administrative offices please.” To my surprise it never happened. I got home today relieved, thinking that it was another blank threat like she always gives me, or that I was just imagining the whole thing. 
 
  My county has this whole website that you login into with your student ID, and they have online textbooks and your grades posted there. And to my horror, in big bold letters – “This student number has been suspended”. 
   
What my school does whenever you are disciplined for computer incidents, they suspend your student Id and in turn, your computer privileges. Right now I am waiting for the inevitable call tomorrow to the administrative offices, ruining my perfect disciplinary record.

DontJustStare,350,360,1r5y5m,739,"Usually, I don't eat breakfast, but that didn't matter because my crush was working at the cafe this morning rather than tonight, so that meant I was going to buy breakfast. *(Don't ask how I knew he had a morning shift this morning. I'm not a stalker; I'm just ..observant and resourceful.)*

Before I left I was sure to apply a little foundation and mascara; probably the amount of makeup a normal girl would wear. Usually, I don't bother as I am not the spend-forever-getting-ready kinda girl. Although he has always been friendly and nice, he has never done anything to give me the impression that he was interested, yet I always make the effort to look nice whenever I know I will be going to the cafe. (I know, kinda pathetic) 

Business was slow--probably because it had just opened and normal people aren't up so early, so it was basically just us two and his other coworker. I have liked this guy for the longest and we have hardly spoken other than about the food and other short chats, nothing personal, but this morning that finally changed. He initiated a conversation, and we wound up talking for a bit, including plans for this weekend. I was beginning to think he was going to actually ask me out! But then business started to pick up. He asked for my number, so we could talk more later. I played it cool on the outside, but on the inside I was doing a [dance](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lu6b99ng2s1qew6kmo1_500.gif) . 

So, I reach for my bag to get a pen and paper to give him my number since he didn't have his phone on him. Being a little too eager and naturally clumsy, I knocked over my book bag, causing some of the items to fall out. **FUCK ME** Guess what pops out... My fucking dildo.

What can I say? I am a horny girl and it's been 6 months, hence my thirstiness for this guy. I had spent the previous two nights away from home, and I had to rush to pack this morning because I took so long to get ready and prettify myself. In haste, I stuffed whatever I could in the other bags and just so happened to place Sparky in the bag I carry around with the intention of removing it once I got home. 

My eye balls nearly pop out of the sockets in disbelief, and I hurried up and shoved it back in the bag as if that would make him unsee it. I knew it was too late; he undoubtedly saw my 8inch faux cock. *fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck*. 

I expected him to say he had to hurry and get back to work and try to get out of the situation, so I tried to make it less awkward by just telling him, ""Sorry, I don't have any paper. Maybe next time,"" I said in a nervous voice and got out of there. I don't think the situation could have been any more awkward. I just didn't know what to say. My face was down, avoiding eye-contact out of embarrassment most of that time, so I'm not entirely sure how he reacted, but he was probably thinking *WTF, I knew this bitch was weird, but damn*.

I am always cock-blocking myself by being a werido. Well, looks like it's just me and sparky tonight. :( *Forever alone*. 

**TL;DR: My crush for the longest finally gave me the chance to get the D and I cock-blocked myself by dropping my dildo.**


**EDIT:** A couple of points I want to clarify as it seems I was not clear. I do not carry this dildo around on a daily basis. I had brought it with me while I was away from home in a couple of nights. I was rushing to make it to the cafe as well as check out by a certain time, so I just threw my things in my bags. 

*(Sidenote: I clean my dildo before and after each use to prevent UTIs so even if I was carrying it around &amp; ret-ta-go at any time, it would not put me at any risk)*

Also, the cafe he works at is not Starbucks. I took the photo of inside my book bag (listed in a comment below) later that day in Starbucks to *prove* I was not making this up.

Lastly, the dildo came fully out, so it's not like there is a chance he could not have seen it. After it came out, I pretty much avoided eye contact or looking at him at all, so I don't know what he was thinking. 

Now that I have read each comment, it seems like nearly every person is saying the same thing, which is that he doesn't think I'm a weird freak. There is a chance that I may have been over-thinking this situation with my typical skewed, negative perspective. Perhaps, in a few days, I will revisit the cafe without bringing it up and give him my number (I liked this idea more than apologizing as it avoids making it more awkward IMO). I am just terrified of rejection, so I don't know if I will or not. If I do, I will definitely update!

I get up in the morning and go and make some coffee, as we're friends and had known each other for years. So it was OK to help myself.

What had happened was when I went downstairs to get coffee, I left the bedroom door open. The dog went in, into the bin and extracted one of the used condoms...
He then took the condom into the hall and left it at the top of the stairs...

I love my ass. It's a ton of fun to play with. You put things in, you take things out, this makes your 'me' time is so much better. As a guy, it's the only way to get in touch with your inner self and I think it's fascinating to say the least.

But today, this was the reason I was mentally preparing a makeshift will. I'm only 18 and I pretty much have nothing to do all day unless I'm working. Obviously if you have the house to yourself, you start to get creative with what you jerk to/with/how. Living at home still trying to get to school or something, I work odd hours. Today I was going to be working 1:30 to 10:00.

I felt particularly kinky today and decided that I wanted to test my colon's absorption ability.

I've gotten drunk once before, and had a beer or two maybe six other times. I clearly don't know how my body handles alcohol very well, let alone unfiltered anus liquor.

But this doesn't cross my mind. I just want to get a bit of a buzz this morning.

Warning: unfiltered ass play ahead
-------------

10:30a I have my shot of vodka in one of those tiny rum bottles and a straw.

I know my plan: create fart, insert bottle and swap fart for shot.

But things aren't perfect. The straw is tearing my asshole a new asshole. It's not that bad though, so I just tough the initial pain out and bend over on my knees and let gravity pull some air in.

Then I replace my straw for the bottle while standing and get back on my knees. Watching my reflection in our full length mirror I shove my ass almost perpendicular to the floor and both legs spread to see the view. I relax my abs and suddenly the bottle is now empty.

Wow. I feel nothing. I expected a little bit of a tingle or burn, but there's nothing. That is, until I take the bottle out. My anus seems to be the only thing that realises what a bad idea this is and screams a signal of pain on contact with the alcohol. Not cool. But whatever; I'm just gonna let the rest of it get absorbed so it won't touch my anus any more! Foolishly I want to jerk something fierce. A small shampoo thing gets to spend quality time with me. In it goes and off I get.

Unfortunately it slips out and a splash of anus burning liquid follows before I clamp shut. It burns. That's not good. ^^Oh. This probably wasn't a great idea. [I'm out.](http://cdn.chud.com/1/1f/295x221px-LL-1f759989_Jerry-Seinfeld-Leaving1.gif)

I'm getting to the toilet and feel the pressure of the leftover makeshift fart coming on. Apparently I took in more air than I thought.

Do you remember the burning of diarrhoea? Only having a shot worth of this is fantastic, because every drip leaving feels like letting satan poke my pink. Followed immediately after is a 20 second fart that feels like heaven. But all is not well in colon town. Head office has noticed a disturbance. An off balance. Some huge negative feedback loop starts the process of removing this foreign substance from my digestive tract, and starts doing some natural laxative shit to me.

Now I'm feeling waves of discomfort as my bowels rustle and shimmy shit at breakneck speeds to the throne. I'm now a hot mess of shit, vodka, and worry.

But the first wave is over and I'm feeling a little off but okay. So I lay down and rest a bit and think about what I've done.

My mind jumps to the idea of liver failure and within seconds I'm googling the symptoms. But I'm pretty much okay. I rest until I'm ready to go to work and for at least another 30 minutes I'm okay.

But the shits start again when I get to work. More gurgles and stuff make me run for the toilet every little while. I also started feeling a bit bloated, making me think that my liver was backing up and being problematic.

To make a long story shorter, a super fart after many mucusy damaged anus poops made me feel on top of the world. For the four hours there, though, I was certain I shocked my liver to failure or something.

Never doing that again.

Maleus21,17,30,1r1h9k,143,"This actually happened a while back, but I just found this sub, and since all of my friends love this story, I might as well share it with everyone here.

So a while back, my friend and I worked together on 2nd shift. We normally got off work around 10pm, and it was customary for us to stay up late after work, since we didn't need to be in until late afternoon. So this day, my friend asks me to help him get a weight bench he is getting off of craigslist after work. I didn't have anything else going on, so I gladly offered a helping hand. 

The house we were going to was around 45 minutes away, so while getting gas before heading that way, I went in the gas station and picked up a king size Reeses cup and a large Red Bull to give me some energy after work. This was to be my undoing, because little did I know at that time, I am severely lactose intolerant (I never put 2 and 2 together, and didn't have insurance at the time, so I just thought I had stomach issues). 

So on the way there, we are just idly talking, I finish my 4 peanut butter cups and don't think a thing about them. About 15 minutes later, I feel a slight rumble in my stomach, since stomach problems are normal for me at this time, I pass it off, because I know Ill be home within a couple of hours. About 15 minutes later, the rumbling is more intense, and realize that my friends bathroom will probably receive the brunt of my soon to be coming anal assault. A little while later, we are in the person's neighborhood, and I'm starting to think that a gas station on the way home is inevitable. 

Finally we get to dude's house. He is a nice guy, weight bench is in his garage, but unfortunately it is fully assembled (it is one of those huge all in one machines). Well I haven't told my friend about my stomach, and he and the seller are finalizing the deal, then begin talking about how we are going to secure it in the back of my truck. At this point, I am almost in a cold sweat, my ass cheeks are so clenched so tight, you couldn't fit a needle between them. 

We have now finished loading the weight bench, I am giving myself pep talks and saying a prayer for every step I am taking. I do not want to ask a complete stranger whom we just met off of craigslist to use his bathroom obviously, but things are getting bad. That's when it happens... We are exchanging pleasantries, saying thank yous, and about to get in the truck. I am scouring my brain trying to think of the nearest gas station that I saw on the way there, and decide to let a tini-tiny little bitty poot out just to relieve some of the pressure, as my insides feel as though I am about to explode. Well ladies and gents, when you are in that condition, never ever trust a fart.

It broke the ass seal that my cheeks had welded together, and out comes a torrential down-pour of shit. I could feel it coming, I did my best to squeeze my ass together as tight as I could, which ended up resulting in ass cramps along with the spasms of my intestines wanting so desperately to empty, going against every ounce of my soul trying to stop it. The result was excruciating pain, which resulted me kneeling down, screaming in agony. 

Keep in mind, I had not let on to either of these guys that my stomach was even remotely upset, and I'm sure the sweating was mascaraed by the fact that this was taking place during the summer. So to them, it looked as if I just became possessed and began screaming. So now I am kneeling on the ground, my underwear filled up like a babies diaper, my friend is freaking out,  and the guy from craigslist is no doubt regretting every second of this transaction by now.

I slowly stood up, gathered what I could of myself, and kindly asked the seller if I could use his bathroom. His response was simply ""Umm sure dude, in and to the right, last door on the left"". I slowly walked in the house, praying that no small shit nuggets fell out onto their carpet on my way there. After I got in the bathroom, I took a look at the damage, it was irreparable. Now I had to make a decision, walk outside holding underwear, leave a pair of shit pants in his garbage, or option 3. I emptied as much as I could into the toilet, took out my pocket knife, and cut the massive shit stain out of my underwear. This was obviously was a much smaller piece of cloth, which allowed me to wrap it up in a massive amount of toilet paper and stick it in my pocket. I then cleaned my ass as much as possible (I didn't want to shower in his house also, I was already mortified). Put my holy boxers back on, walked outside, went straight to my truck thanking him as I walked by, got in and immediately drove off. Down the street I threw the shit wad out of the window, and began explaining the story to my now laughing so hard he cant breathe friend. 

I asked my friend if the guy had said anything when I went in his house. His reply to my friend ""Its just a hunch, but I think your friend needs to shit"".

ImAnAsshole12345,95,46,1r7wkc,119,"I love my wife more than anything and we have been together for 6 years. We've had our tough times, but they have been very few. 

I've had 4-5 female friends for almost 10-11 years and one since high school. With two, there were romantic feelings when we started talking, but that fizzled out and now it's just casual friendship (ie, how's your mom, the kids, etc). Off and on throughout the years we'd keep in contact via text just to see what's happening in each other's lives. Marriages, kids, buying houses, etc., when something big or a birthday came around a text would be sent off, catch up for a bit, and then back to no word for a year or more. 

When my mom died earlier this year there were two of these friends who were very supportive and I've kept up with them more and more, culminating in exchanging about 700 texts last month during the worst of my so far grief based depression. At this point I haven't been able to seek therapy because of my schedule, but once the semester is over that will happen. Nothing sexual is desired from either one of these friends; both are happily married with kids. In fact the last conversations were about classes, banana bread, and Thanksgiving plans. 

The part where I fucked up is that I never knew how my wife would take me having these female friends (who I haven't seen in over 10 years), so I never told her about them. All the conversations have been unknown to her until yesterday when she noticed a high number of texts on the bill and found the history. 

She is absolutely distraught and told me that she has lost trust in me. I know it looks horrible from the outside looking in. I also know that I should have talked with my wife more about what was bothering me and my depression instead of discussing it with two friends that she never knew about. I didn't sleep last night and the pain that I have caused is eating me alive.

N_skrilla,51,35,1r5npr,102,"So around this time of year at the organic garden I work at, all of the hottest peppers we've been growing from early in the year have finished ripening, and are ready to be processed. My job in this is to take the dried habaneros and use a small device to grind them into pepper flakes.

Now anyone thats ever eaten a habanero knows that they are one spicy motherfucker of a pepper. Like 100 times more potent than a jalapeno. And to top it off, if you touch one of them with your bare hands, it'll burn like a motherfucker for about an hour.

So as I was making the emptying the flakes into a container, some of the residual powder left over spilled onto the leg of my pants. I thought nothing of it at the time, and just figured I'd wash my pants after I got done with my shift in a few hours.

Well once those few hours had passed, I had totally forgotten about the seemingly minor incident. When I got home and got ready to take a shower, I must have thrown my underwear on top of my pants; right where the habanero powder had set in. After I got out of the shower and put them back on, it took about 5 minutes after for me to realize how badly I fucked up.

The burning set in, as well as the panic. It started off as a dull burning which was uncomfortable but bearable, but just kept elevating for a solid 15 minutes. To give you a good idea of how this felt, just imagine the spiciest thing you've ever eaten in your life, the try to imagine that burning sensation of your gens. Hell, even the ""icy hot to the balls"" challenge didn't hold a candle to this. I immediately ran to the bathroom to try to wash the stuff off, but once it sets in you just have to ride it out. The burning went on for a solid hour before it decided to die down, and all the while I was sweating like hell and trying not to vomit from the shear pain of the whole ordeal.

My. 

Gawd. 


This misfortune is more of a what the fuck than a fuck up because it makes no sense why this happened. 

Well, I just tried to ease out what I thought would be a tiny toot. At the worst, I thought it may end up being a silent yet deadly poot. WRONG! It was a little more than air that came out. I'll spare you the details, and leave it up to your imagination. 

I start to freak out in disgust, but I remember that I have to play it cool. Can't let anyone know I just shitted myself. Mind you, I am in Starbucks cafe. I guess I shouldn't have had that extra brownie.

I think to myself that *It's a good thing I wore these black sweats; no one will ever know*. As I get up, I double check to make sure I didn't leave any poop packet stains behind, and to my dismay, I see a VERY NOTICEABLE red circle in the bright yellow love seat I have been sitting in for the past few hours. (I'm sick, so I planned on just chilling here for awhile and torren---I mean buying movies on their internet connection). 

FUCK ME. What do I do!? 

I can't get up. I am surrounded by people. I will die of embarrassment. To make things worst, I happen to be at the most popular starbucks in town, so it's not going to get any better AND I am seated as far as possible from the bathroom. 

The longer I sit here, the longer I am going to leak, not to mention linger in my own crap. 

What really chaps my ass is that it is the MIDDLE OF THE FUCKING MONTH. I should not be having my period. Plus, I am one of the most constipated person you could ever meet. I usually have to lean to the side and rock for a good fifteen minutes in hopes to pass a bowel movement. 

Ain't this some bullshit.

I don't know what to do you guys. 

Damnit.... 

**TL;DR** : I am at Starbucks and my silent but deadly poot turned out to be a sneaky basTERD. As I get up to go to the bathroom, I realize I started my period in the chair. I am seemingly a mile from the bathroom. I'm still in the chair.

**UPDATE FOR THOSE INTERESTED** : Okay, so just as I was about to get up and I had convinced myself to be mature about it this girl comes and sits RIGHT next to me. She decides to linger around and do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING on Facebook for what seemed like FOR.EV.ER (45minutes or so). There was no way I was getting up and cleaning it up with her RIGHT THERE beside me, so yeah, I just set there (im)patiently and marinated in my juices. 

After she finally got the fuck up--I don't know why I am so mad at her; its not her fault I can't control my bodily functions--I put on my game face to figure out how to do this discreetly as possible. Just as I stand up, this guy decides that he likes what he sees and hits on me. I quickly pulled my jacket down over the stain and tried to reject him as politely and quickly as possible, but he was one of those persistent motherfuckers. Damn me and my v-neck shirts.

After, he left, I walked what seemed like a mile to the bathroom in the still fairly populated cafe. Once I was in the restroom, I discovered somewhat of good news. I actually had not sharted on myself; it was a blood clot (sorry if that's graphic, but at least it's not feces, right?). Thinking back on it, i don't know how I got those two holes mixed up, but my entrance is pretty close to the exit, so yeah.

Moving along, I had just changed book-bags, so no tampons or pads on me, so I decide to improvise, and use a shitload of paper-towels. Then, I stripped down and blow dried my pants. The stain was hardly noticeable anyways since I was wearing black bottoms, but I didn't want to stain any more chairs. 

Then, I grabbed some napkins and soaked them in the leftover water I had from earlier and went to work. It was a pleather type of material, so I managed to get most of the stain out with the help of some hand sanitizer. I like to think I played it off fairly well. For all they knew, I had just spilled some mocha.... I think I can actually show my face in there again.

Everything's going to be okay. Good thing I don't have any friends!

**Last Update (Morning After** : So, I went to Starbucks this morning. It is insanely busy, especially for a Sunday. I figured more people would be at church. Well, guys, I didn't clean it as well as I thought. The wetness from the water and sanitizer must have made it look less noticeable last night because this am, the stain is clearly still red. On a bright side, it was the only seat not taken, so I guess I'll never have to worry about not having a spot to sit down at least.

Today I came home from campus and found my younger, autistic brother playing with the bat. He was holding it and stroking the wood and my heart stopped.

I was mortified and tried to ignore that this embarrassing childhood pleasure had resurfaced. But I wasn't gonna let this get to me. It was the end of a long day of school and work and I just wanted to have dinner and relax. Dinner had been eaten without me, so I whip it out of the fridge and into the microwave. Nothing, not even my pleasure bat, was going to keep me from relaxing. What was the worse that could happen?

He calls me over from the dinning room, where I'm still trying to eat, and ask me to hide the bat in his room. I put on my poker face and take the bat. I stride with as much nonchalance as can be mustered, and hide the bat under my parent's bed.

I woke up this morning around 8am, my hubs had said last night he wanted to sleep in this morning so he could stay up later tonight to watch football (Go Chiefs!) so I let him rest while I laid in bed finishing a book I had started and surfing around on Reddit for a bit.

He apparently woke up frisky, so he rolled over and started fingering me. Vertigo be damned, I am not turning down a frisky hubs. I let him continue for a few minutes, enjoying the attention.

DizzyLola,10,12,1qzqqu,43,"Okay so this happened just now, obviously a few minutes after we finished having dinner. My older brother (by only 11 months) was eating lasagne opposite me and blowing on a bit of it on his fork.

This would have been okay, but he was breathing *so loudly*. I waited a few seconds before he took in a deep breath and did it again, me getting more and more pissed. ""It's not that hot!"" I complained to him, resulting with him looking up and saying, ""You try eat a piece from the middle."" 

Y'see Reddit, this is where I fucked up.
Okay, easy challenge, right? 

No. Dear God no. I took a big bite of it right from the middle and began chewing it, maintaining eye contact. I ignored the burning sensation and stopped myself from making any face to show how it didn't burn.

Finally the lava was successfully eaten, I took a drink and excused myself, letting the victory show. 

My tongue is burnt and I'm pretty sure I've killed my tastebuds.

fuzzyblackyeti,4,9,1qy38q,45,"So in my British Literature class today, we were having an online discussion. Our teacher set up an Google Site, and we post about the books we are reading, and he posts different discussions that we comment on and such.

So here I am typing away about how I think I could adapt to living in another part of the world, and a woman comes up to me and asks, quite nicely, “Do you like this better than in class discussions?”

I, for one, don’t really like in class discussion, because I can’t always find the words, and I generally don’t like talking to people in my class because a few of them aren’t very nice or have opposite opinions to mine and I don’t want to start a huge argument.

So I answer, “Yes.”

She then follows up with, “Why?”

A very logical question succeeding my answer.

But, I answer instantly, without thinking, “Because I don’t like talking to people.”

She just walks away awkwardly. I didn’t realize until about 30 seconds after that, “Wow, she thought I meant her. I’m an asshole.”

I felt so bad. But that’s not the final blow of my awkward. Guess who she was guys. Just guess. Too bad you aren’t allowed. It was our superintendent.

ScorpioEverlast,19,24,1qsyl3,47,"So, there I was just sitting on a bench at my local mall minding my own business. Partaking in one of my favorite hobbies of people-watching.
about 10 minutes in a black prob 17-20 y/o set down not next to me but within conversational distance. After about 5 more minutes, a few of his friends came and chatted with him about Lebron vs Kobe, shoes, weed, ect ect ( typical black guy conversations ). Not 2 minutes after his friends left, he spoke up and asked me: ""Hey man, you wouldn't happen to have change for a $50 would you""? I replied without hesitation: ""IDK, let me check"".  

Now for some background. I usually am pretty quick-minded with situations. I pay attention to my surroundings. I often eves-drop into conversations taking place around me. And usually always keep myself out of precarious situations. BUT NOT TODAY!

I knew I had just cashed my payroll check a few hours ago and kept some cash on me. I knew I had a few $20s but didn't know if I could make the remaining $10. After a quick check in my wallet, I had the money in hand. 2 $20's, a $5, and 5 $1's. We traded bills and immediately I knew the bill wasn't right. The feel was wrong. So instantly placed it up against another bill and it was smaller in dimension. I then checked for the watermarks and there were none to be found. I instantly said to him: ""NO, I believe this bill is fake and I want my money back"". what took place next was a slow but steady escalation right in the middle of a crowded mall. 

He stood up and stated: ""Its not fake, I just got it from a store in change and need to break it to pay a friend back."" I stood up and blocked his progress of walking away. when we both stood up I realized what I was up against. This kid was a good 6 inches taller than me, easily 50lbs on me and at this point, angry that I had confronted/trapped him. 

Now I new that @ this point he was NOT getting out of my presence, NO MATTER WHAT! I also knew that it was his word against mine but that if worse came to worse, that we were or at least should be being recorded via CCTV.  

I again stated: ""this bill is fake and I want my money back NOW and you can walk away or I am calling security"". He then said: ""go ahead, you have the bill. Its your word against mine. You think they are going to believe me because I'm black and you're white?"" At this point I was getting pissed but had to keep my calmness or shit could get out of hand fast!

Immediately I yelled in a stern voice ""SECURITY"". We were within Earshot of the guest services booth thankfully and I know at least a half dozen people were watching at this point. He said: ""Hey man, I just got that. I didn't know it was fake. Let me go get them."" I said, No, its too late. I gave you the chance and you passed"". and Yelled ""SECURITY"" once more.

By this time, he was very nervous and trying numerous times to leave but i had him partially cornered between the bench we where on, a kiosk selling hair supplies, and the wall. I glanced over his shoulder and seen a very large man in a suit walking our way. The gentleman asked: ""what seems to be the issue"" and the kid tried to split once more and I sternly said: ""Do not let him leave!"" 

by this time a few more ""mall cops"" arrived and separated us and got both stories. I repeated what had happened while he still attempted to leave again. The man on the suit told him he was being retained and called for local PD. Not a minute later I repeated the incident to the officer. The officer then spoke with the kid. He obtained the bill from me and looked it over and stated it was def a fake. The kid tried to play dumb not knowing about the water marks and such. 

The officer didn't buy it, obtained the kids ID, spoke on his radio, then asked me how I would like to proceed. I told him that I gave him the option to get out of it and he passed. I asked the officer if he had the right to search the kid. He said NO. I then stated that he could have more bad bills on him. The officer then went back to the kid and asked for consent to search him. Like a scared kid, he said yes. The officer did a quick scan then took his wallet and sure enough. 4 more FAKE $50's! needless to say, the ball is in my court!

The officer immediately arrested the kid and read him his rights! HE was pissed!! cussing and yelling obscenities at me. 

It was at this time that a was flooded with different emotions. Knowing I fucked up by trying to be a good patron. The potential for the situation to end way worse for me. And the overwhelming feeling that I did right by standing my ground and busting this asshole!

I immediately went and got a soda to cure my crazy cotton mouth and left the mall. Now, a few hours later. looking back, The way I handled the situation has given me a great deal of confidence in my ability to handle a situation with a stranger. I do know this feeling could very well one day make things worse for my but for now, I feel great! but I still FUCKED UP!

a_burning_throwaway,11,8,1r658d,42,"I work in a research lab, en route to getting my master's degree. It's a biochemical lab, so there's not too much that's very dangerous, and overall it's a pretty relaxed place to work. Despite official policy pretty much nobody wears lab coats or goggles, shorts abound in the summer, and gloves are mainly to keep from contaminating your sample rather than protecting your hands. It can be easy in this environment to sort of forget that safety is still important sometimes. 

Yesterday I got to the lab at 8:30 am and was there until about 8 pm, having had a lot of work to finish up. Most of my days that run that long include a lot of downtime, but on this occasion I was actually doing work for most of it. Tedious, monotonous, soul-crushing work, involving repeated treatments with a base, that left me exhausted and brain-dead at the end of the day.

I leave the lab and breathe a sigh of relief, and take a much-needed urination break before heading home. I enter the washroom, zip down, and grab my donger, as is man's sacred right. Suddenly, I feel a sort of itch. I ignore it and continue as I was, but before long the itch intensifies. And then it transforms into a burning. The burning is gentle at first; it does not remain so. Soon it feels as though a scornful fire elemental is attempting to blow me and I am trying very hard to stay still so as not to piss all over myself, despite the fiery waves of pain that now crash upon my pubic shore.

When it becomes too much to bear, I am thankfully nearly done but still manage to splatter some on my pants as I am forced to let go, doubling over with my pants half-down before I finally recover somewhat from the pain. The supernova heat has die down to a much calmer, smaller nova, and I force the thing back into my pants.

I evidently forgot to wash my hands after working with the base all day. It wasn't that concentrated, so it didn't hurt my hands or anything like that, but as soon as I touched my sensitive wang-flesh it made its wretched presence known. Looking at it once I got home, my dangler was redder than that of the devil himself and covered in delightful blisters. It still hurts like a bitch.

**TL;DR:**

BurpleNurple,11,18,1qtvp2,39,"Okay, this was actually last week. But I was too busy fucking up other things to put my initial fuck-up into words.

It was Veterans Day at my school. Each year, we celebrate by inviting any parents/grandparents/great-grandparents/you-get-the-point to come to the ceremony. We sing some dramatic ***fuck yes America*** songs, have a few snotty middle schoolers speak, and give a slideshow on all the most recent wars in which the U.S. has been fighting.

So, the elementary school kids were all getting up from the bleachers to stand in front of us and sing a song. They walked single file behind their teachers. They looked like little ducklings with an insatiable eagerness in their eyes, an eagerness to sing about our country. Just kidding. They were really cute, though.

The kindergarten kids were walking up last, since they are obviously the cutest. Some kept getting distracted by the crowd, stopping to gaze upon the numerous high schoolers staring at them, having to be gently nudged by their teachers to keep walking.

This one girl, though. She was trying to walk in a straight line while simultaneously staring at the scary high schoolers. Needless to say, hilarity ensued. The girl fell RIGHT OVER on her face. I'd say you had to have been there, but I swore in that moment it sounded just like a giant 50-pound pancake belly-flopping into a pool of pure liquefied giggles. Just... FLOP. PLOP. SMACK. That girl went DOWN.

Unfortunately for me, this occurred at a rather unfortunate time: the kids had been walking up to sing while one of said snobby middle schoolers was reading off statistics about WWI. There were graphic pictures on the screen, too.

I started *dying*.

Shit is so much funnier when you're not supposed to be laughing at it, too.

After the initial burst of uncontrollable laughter, I kept snorting little giggles during the subsequent slide on WWII each time I thought about how I wasn't supposed to be laughing about that fucking kid. It sounded like I was giggling over how many casualties we had in WWII. Gah.

NiceRideMan,3,11,1r79fs,39,"Preface: I live in a semi-detached house, so we share our driveway with our neighbors. There's enough room in the driveway for a total of 4 cars. They're a rather sizeable family, so they have 3 cars and pack them all into the driveway. We never did mind because we only have 2 cars, and if they park the 3rd car a little on their lawn and partially in the driveway, we can fit 5 cars. Although I didn't mind, I still found it annoying at times since it was a tight fit leaving me less room to maneuver.

The neighbors are a really nice Muslim family. Most of the reason I didn't mind them squashing 3 cars into the driveway was because they did things for us frequently. Here in Ontario, it snows a lot sometimes. If they saw that our driveway hadn't been cleaned, they'd do it for us a lot of the time. And they'd bring over leftover food from feasts, and it was so fucking good. So over those 10 years, I never said anything about their 3 cars.

Preface over, here's what happened. A couple of days ago I was at university, and my mom texted me saying the neighbor had passed away. Keep in mind this was a large family. There was an 80 year old with his wife, 2 of their kids (Both mid-30s, who had wives and kids of their own.) 10 people total. The 80 year old man passed away because his kidney failed.

When I arrived home that day, one of the deceased man's sons was in the driveway. I walked on over to him and expressed my condolences. OUT OF FUCKING NO WHERE, and I mean in no way did I mean to say this but for whatever reason did, I proceeded to say ""Haha, guess you won't need that [third] car anymore."" Probably something subconscious. Fucking Freudian slip. Needless to say, I felt terribly awkward and just ""Oh man dinner is ready'd"" away.",TIFU my opening my mouth,50

I am a guy btw, never put any colour in my hair etc.  Our bartender, basically a fuckbuddy of the barfly, repeatedly told me ""Yeah, yeah, do it.  She's good! She makes a living cutting hair from home."" Finally I give in.  ""Sure, I'm growing out my hair a bit, but you can put a few light highlights in my hair to lighten it up.""

The next day I call her up and arrange to meet her at her place.  I arrive, its a ground level apartment.  She greets me, we go inside.  Filthy carpet, the tv had what I could only imagine a stream of dried jizz dripped down it.  ""Okay"" I think to myself. ""She does this for a living, its all good.""  She takes me to her ""chair"".  It was literally a broken down lawn chair. ""Fuck! I can't even back out of this now."" I sit down, she pulls out a tube of something and a plastic fork.  She gets to work.  My head is feeling heavy at this point.  I reiterate to her that all I wanted was some nice blending in highlights.  ""Oh yeah! I totally understand.  Don't worry! I know what I'm doing!"".  I'm basically shitting myself at this point in time.  She throws a plastic shopping bag on my head and has me sit there.  I start frantically texting my fiancee. ""What the fuck did I do?"" ""Why did I do this?!?""  Finally she comes back.  ""Time to rinse it out!"" We enter her bathroom.  She had me kneel beside her filthy toilet and put my head under the tap in her bathtub.  At this point all I can think of is ""Get this shit off of my head! I don't even care that I'm kneeling beside her disgusting toilet!""  She appraises her job and decides she need to put more bleach or whatever on.  Keep in mind I am yet to see a mirror.  ""Its okay, I'm sure it's..."" I feel more bleach on my head. ""FUCK!"" Okay, bag, rinse, repeat.  She's done! She shows me the final job.  I want to die.

I look for the hidden cameras.  No luck, this actually happened, I wasn't on Candid Camera or anything.

I get one block away and call a coworker.  Luckily I had a hat with me.  I ask her to meet me, I need to show her something and I need her to tell me I'm overreacting.  We meet up.  I take off the hat.  She bursts out laughing. ""Who did this to you??? Why did you let it happen??""  We make an emergency appointment with her hairdresser.  I get there, she looks at me, holding back laughter and says ""Did you lose a bet or something?"" followed with ""Wow, she must really hate you.""  She matched my original colour, puts the dye in, we let it sit. 3 times we had to do that as the dye wouldn't hold.  I can't wash my hair for like a month or this will wash out and I'll have a head of fucked up blonde chunks.

Today my boyfriend came over to hang out and watch TV. Nothing out of the ordinary until things start to get heated. Eventually I decide that I want to give a blowjob.

Only had I not forgotten that something has always got to give.

dudusan,5,10,1r3xde,33,"I occasionally go for a swim during the weekend and always top it off with some time in the spa. Whilst in the spa, I sat on a side that had broken jets. So only half the people in the spa had their jets working. When one occupant left, this 70 something year old man signalled me to come sit next to him, where the other person had just got up from. The old guy, I'll call him Peter, was a bit familiar. I had seen him at the spa a few times before. I started chatting with Peter. He was rather funny. He kept commenting on the women who were entering the spa. It was funny to me considering his age. We also spoke about other things such as my wife, his wife, his kids etc.
During the chats, when Peter was making and a joke...he would pinch me in the abdominal area. It was a bit strange but just thought, whatever, its probably just a greek gesture etc (Where Im from, we kinda clap hands whilst laughing). This goes on for about 4-5 times. When I told him i was leaving, he asked me to stay for another 5 mins. In my mind, I thought perhaps he is just a lonely man who just wants to chat. I stayed for another 5 and left. 
In the changing room, i realised someone had pinched my tshirt. Was frantically looking for it when peter walked in. He got dressed whilst I doing rounds looking for my shirt. He even assisted me by taking me to the ""lost/found"" area. I decided to just ride my bike topless and gave up looking for the shirt.  As peter was leaving too, we walked out of the complex together. As i went to my bike, Peter asked if i would like to go for a drive. I agreed and really thought that perhaps this guy has something to get off his chest or is depressed etc. Also thought wont hurt to listen to a guys issues/cries for help etc. So i got into his car and he drove to the other side of the car park. He then began talking about porn movies and i was laughing all the while. It was seriously funny that a guy his age was talking about shit like that. he then asked me why all african guys have big dicks. Now, nothing weird here....as we get this question countless times once we venture into those types of conversations. Peter then asked me if i had a big dick. Again, i laughed this off and just kinda said ...normal type. Peter then puts his hand on the back of my neck and my mind started racing. I just thought, well, if i move or reach for my shoelace, he will let go. So i did that and he let go. He then asks me if i had ever had sex with a man. At this point, i was now feeling fucking awkward and now had suspicions. So i categorically/vehemently said no and that I would never do that as I am not that way. He then reached out and pinched my nipple!  At this point I told him i had to leave. He asked if I was sure that i wanted to leave. So I left.

Thing is, I felt dirty when this guy did this. I was actually innocently thinking i'm just chatting with this guy, whilst he obviously had other intentions. I also, through this experience, know what it feels like for the waitresses who have sexual innuendo left right and centre just because they smiled at a male customer etc.

Its taken me a few days to get over this. Im certain he thinks I am playing hard to get as I did not exactly say NO to his advances (I realised it too late).

I settle on the non-confrontational route and think about asking the attendant for a sleep mask. When I open my eyes, the “call attendant” light it blinking. What happened? Is someone else gonna call this guy out? Does this airplane respond to passive-aggressive thoughts? The attendant comes over to our three-person row and waits for one of us to ask him for something, but no one does. He stands there for a beat, unspeaking, and I shrug at him without taking off my headphones. 

Let me be clear. I didn’t chicken out. I did chicken out. But I didn’t call the guy. I couldn’t just swoop in on someone else’s call.  Maybe something else was going on, something more pressing. Gremlin on the wing, et al. Then I just look like an asshole. Attendant leaves and I follow, ask him for a sleep mask cause the guy next to me has been on his laptop the whole damn flight. He tells me there’s only an hour or so until we land. Also we don’t have sleep masks. Fair enough. Head back to my seat and decide to get on my own laptop, with my f.lux lighting set to “candle—super dim.” That’ll show the fucker who’s courteous.  I organize documents, pictures; bury porn that I’d lazily saved straight to my desktop. The guy next to me pushes the attendant button. Well that solves that. Attendant comes over and the guy next to me is unaffected, looking straight ahead, absorbed by his music. I’m not about to help him so I pretend not to see the attendant. He only stays for a couple seconds this time. 

Getting near Philadelphia, tray tables go up. Guy next to me calls the attendant a third time. The light blinks for about five minutes, no doubt while the attendant decides how he’s gonna tell us off. He comes over and launches right into it, I take off my headphones. 

“…third time I’ve been over here…” 

I elbow the guy next to me, kinda hard. He jumps, takes off his Beats and looks up. 

“…even acknowledge me.” 

Guy next to me says “Sorry, I can’t see.” No shit, it’s dark and you’re wearing Gucci shades over half your face. 

“Well what do you want?” 

“Can I get a glass of water, no ice?” 

The attendant already has one in his hand. “Here, take it.” We land. Guy two rows ahead of me asks to help grab his bag from the overhead bin. Guy next to me is doing that awkward half stand of someone trying to join the sovereign people of Aislestandistan, but I’m boxing him in. His head is right in front of the bin I need to open. “Hey, watch your head,” I ask a little too softly, like I do. “Hey excuse me can you watch your head?” People are looking. Guy sitting on the other side of him taps him and he realizes what’s going on, ducks. I grab the guys bag and pass it forward. I ask the same favor of someone sitting two rows behind me. We stand for a few minutes while the uppermiddle class deplane. I do that thing you do when you’re awkwardly close to a group of strangers for an awkwardly long time—my eyes half dart around, half look down at my sweater. Get caught looking at that blonde girl twice. I notice that the guy sitting next to me has a stack of short tubes in his hand, the length of straws and the width of fingers. The hell is that? People clear up and I’m finally about to get off the plane when the guy sitting next to me stands up right in front of me and starts feeling around at the overhead bin across the aisle. A woman behind us sees this and taps me, gesturing towards him “can you…” Can I? Can I what, help him? Why should I help…mother fucker. I am the dumbest person I know.

Lately, I have been obsessed with reading the top r/nosleep posts of all time. I have a girlfriend who aspires to be a writer and is into horror movies so I figured I would send her one of my favourite series-posts. Let me give you a rundown of how the r/nosleep story goes...

**SPOILERS** Basically, a health care worker is investigating the files of some strange mental patients of a hospital. Among the patients is an anorexic who becomes so desperate for food that she kills a man and eats his brains. Another patient is an ex-student who obsesses over a writing competition that could win her a full ride scholarship, stays up for days on end, and finally has a hallucination which causes her to kill two people. There are also other patients whose stories all come together in the the end to create a huge mind fuck. I recommend it to those who aren't squeamish
**SPOILERS END**

The kicker- my girlfriend is an ex-anorexic, insomniac, full-time student writer...

I have a Nalgene bottle that I usually take, but for some reason I really wanted a styrofoam cup of ice water.  The desks in the classroom are standard college desks, which are pretty small.  Enough room for a laptop or a notebook and textbook, but not much else.  I take notes on my laptop, and decided to set the cup on the edge of my desk.  I'm a pretty careful person, and also kind of overly protective with my electronics (i.e. phone, laptop, game systems), so I knew that *I* wouldn't spill the cup; I didn't take my friend sitting in front of me into account.  He turned around to ask me a quick question, his elbow hit my cup, and I watched in utter horror as water doused my keyboard.  I immediately jumped out of my chair and yelled, ""Shit-fuck!""

My legs hurt, but I was at a high where I felt nothing could stop me physically. We get to the movies, I order the tickets wearing light blue sunglasses at night inside. I felt like the true douche of the room already. I order the tickets and get snacks while my friend went pre-show. I got two large sodas, two medium popcorns and 3 bags of candy. They were suspicious already. My friend and I take out seats at the last row and get ready for the previews. It takes forever, but the movie starts and we couldn't be more pumped. 20 minutes in, we've finished all of our food and are munched out out of our minds. My friend says, ""we need more."" This previous Wednesday, I watched the first half hour of the movie in shitty quality online. I had already seen the part, so I went to get the snacks. I get two more bags of popcorn and smother them in butter. I go back to Theater 16, all the way down the hall and come into the room. For no reason whatsoever, I start doing my Olympic fastwalk up the stairs. But, like before, I couldn't stop myself. Lo and behold, I trip on the stairs, my two popcorn bags so splattering everywhere, and I'm on the floor like a brainless baboon trying to get up. I do, people snicker and chuckle, and I blush, chuckling myself. ""Sorry,"" I whisper. I had nothing else to say. I did the walk of shame out of there and back down the longest hallway known to man. I tell the custodians and they say they'll take care of it. But, they're minimum wage job isn't worth the trouble, so they don't clean it up.

Calamitycatji,24,3,1qx5lx,22,"So my bike was already giving me some problems, however since i am not mechanically inclined i had no idea what was wrong with it and figured it would be fine till i got home.

Both of my roommates work at the local head shop thats right on the main strip of my town. On my way home i stopped by the shop to pick up this pipe i had been eyeing for awhile. I parked out back, went in grabbed the pipe, and broke it in with the boys in the basement. 

Fast-foward. Shop's closing and we are all headed out; this is when the trouble starts. The bikes not starting and I have no idea what to do. At this point it's too late to actually call someone, so I decide to just push it in the backdoor and leave it inside for the night. now it's not that i lived in a bad area and was worried about it being stolen, but rather i live in a college town where it wouldn't surprise me for some drunk asshole to just walk by and push it over. Either way the decision was made to push it inside, go on with the night, and figure it out in the morning.

Now, I am not a morning person at all so i just planned on going back to the shop a few hours after they open. This way I had time to sleep in then maybe get some breakfast. 

So i'm at home sleeping and my phone starts ringing and i'll usually silence my phone at least once before I'm actually awake, so it usually takes a few straight calls if you want to get ahold of me first thing in the morning. 

I finally wake up and answer my roommate's call and he is not happy. He starts yelling at me telling me how the whole shop smells like gas and how i needed to get down and clean everything up. The neighboring businesses had already called the gas company and local authorities. I immediately get up and head into town stopping on the way for some supplies. Apparently white vinegar works pretty well on cleaning up  the smell of gas. I arrive at the shop only to realize it wasn't just a little gas and that my entire gas tank has emptied into the store. It took me several hours to get it all cleaned up but we didn't have to deal with any cops. Not having to explain myself or interact with police at all was a huge plus on account of them making me extremely nervous. we basically just played dumb to the other businesses once i had it cleaned up. Saying things like ""oh I don't know but it's definitely going away"" The gas company people sent someone out but that was clearly just to satisfy the other businesses. the guy came checked the electric meters and was on his way. As for the gas less bike i just had a tow truck come pick it up and take it to the repair shop. Needless to say i won't be parking indoors for a bit

I only had £100 in there, and had some books to buy for school as well as a little left over for a birthday present for my dad. I now have £5 left as I didn't read the website I went on properly, and had been charged an extra £33 for 'service charge' and a free resit if I fail. I'm pretty confident I won't fail.. so i have just wasted £33 which could have been put to much better use elsewhere. I'm an idiot.

l3radrocks,7,1,1r6lt9,8,"   To really understand this story, you need to know a little about my school. I live in a metropolitan area in the South. Being in the south, most adults have absolutely zero clue of how computer work or function. That included my Digital Tech teacher. I had planned originally to take computer ed classes my whole high school career, but the was already stopped my freshmen year because my High School forces us to take Health and P.E our freshmen year, and I took Spanish as my second elective. So this year I was naturally excited when I finally got to sign up for my computer class. Growing up, there was never any real adult that could teach me about anything related to computers so I was interested in what I would learn in this class. I hoped that it would be a lot. I was dead wrong. Put quite simply, my teach is an idiot.
   
Now, I usually don’t mind teachers even if I personally don’t like them, but this teacher is fully honestly an idiot, and frankly the whole class is idiotic. A perfect example was our first project. We were charged with choosing parts to build our computer. I thought that this would be an easy A and breezed through it. Here’s the good part, I failed it epically. First of all, she took of TWENTY points for not including a FLOPPY DRIVE. Yes, my teacher still believes that floppy drives are still regularly used.  As I stood there baffled by this, she tells me that she is going to take ANOTHER TWENTY points off for using Pcpartpicker.com instead of an excel spreadsheet, when she explicitly told us that we could do the list any way we wanted. Not wanting to cause a scene, I bit my tongue.
  
 Fast forward an excruciating four months of me correcting her pretty much daily on most things she says about computers. For a week now she has been saying that our next project will involve making a game and programming it ourselves. I dance with joy thinking that I might learn something useful finally, after getting through topics such as “Digital Safety”, and “Good online citizenship”. Well fuck was I wrong. She announces a day later that we will be using Scratch.com. If you aren’t aware of what scratch.com is, it is pretty much a program intended for elementary school kids to teach them how to program. Don’t get me wrong, it’s great but I was expecting something actually interesting. So we weren’t supposed to start this project until next week, but I usually do 2 weeks’ worth work daily in that class, seeing as how it is 99% busy work (She has only stood and lectured us once). So the next day, I get started in the Scratch project. I decide to just make a simple space shooter, a lot like Galactica. Finished in in two days, and it worked perfectly. Had 2 weeks’ worth of work done in 2 days. I was free to sleep and read in that class for 2 whole weeks.

This morning, she starts yelling at the class for playing games and being on sites they aren’t supposed to, and said that she had already written some of us up for playing games; all the whole staring at me with a smirk on her face. Of course, the first thought that pops to mind is that she is going to write me up for playing my own project. I already knew she hated me. There is no question about it, everyone in the class knows it. I tried to no get on her bad side even after floppy drive incident, but it did inevitably happen. I don’t purposely aggravate her, her whole experience in our class is a lot like one of those days when nothing ever goes your way. I don’t mean it to be like that, but it is. 
 
  Now to the inevitable. I spent all day today freaking out whenever they called on the intercom, expecting them to say “Mrs.OP, can we have l3radrocks to the administrative offices please.” To my surprise it never happened. I got home today relieved, thinking that it was another blank threat like she always gives me, or that I was just imagining the whole thing. 
 
  My county has this whole website that you login into with your student ID, and they have online textbooks and your grades posted there. And to my horror, in big bold letters – “This student number has been suspended”. 
   
What my school does whenever you are disciplined for computer incidents, they suspend your student Id and in turn, your computer privileges. Right now I am waiting for the inevitable call tomorrow to the administrative offices, ruining my perfect disciplinary record. 

tl;dr - I make a scratch game as a project for my class, and get written up for it.",TIFU by Making a Scratch Game,9
youareneo,5,10,1qz9a6,7,"Well the history started with me going to have lunch one day. I was by myself and decided to eat on a new japonese restaurant near home. After eating 5 pounds of food i went to pay my shit and then i met this girl. She was really beautiful and kind. I kept thiking on her after this moment and i thought about going back there and asking her number. 

After 2 days i went back there, i walked directly to the place where she used to work. So i started explaining myself and talking about how nice would it be to know her number. Well this is where the history start to get strange. She said she didnt remember me and i found this very strange since she was extremely open and smiled a lot while we talked. She even gave me some gift from the restaurant. So after i explained myself she just said she was married with the owner of the restaurant. At the time i just knew i asked the wrong girl's number, but at the same time they were really alike. Same skin, same hair, same height. Fuck, even the same face. Welp at the best of the situations they can be sisters. I suck.
