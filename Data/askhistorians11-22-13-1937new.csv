DrakeSaint,0,0,1r5gmx,7,Original posthttpwwwredditcomrhistorycommentsrmsmostrepresentativetribesingermaniaeuropeWas suggested to take my questions here Slavic tribes are only mentioned in Wikipedia as slavs As such I cant tell if there was no representative tribe in this period in Eastern Europe or if theyre as Wiki says too difficult to separate Lets consider postHunnic invasions Migration Period Scandinavia only mentions the Goths as Jutes and Gutes but those are on the baltic peninsula Could Northmen be considered the ancestors of the Norse How influent were the Finnic and eastbaltic tribes in this period I know its kind of difficult to access knowledge since there was too much movement in between Europe in this time But there were tribes which evolved into kingdoms like the Lombards Burgundians and later on the Franks which spearheaded their hegemony In this context how were tribes like the Thuringi or the Thervingi faring They were mentioned after the collapse of Rome but there arent true clues they were extinct Great Britain Damn its hard to locate it politically I understand the main tribes were the Gaels Britons Angles Saxons and Picts But there are indications the Jutes occupied the modern London area right And werent Angles and Saxons considered Britons Its kind of hard for me to understand Scandinavia in this period mainly because the only solid information given is the migration of the Goths How about DenmarkNorway It was occupied by the Jutes Saxons and the Danes but how would you specify which part was occupied by whom There are even reports of Angles in the region by the time There are mentions of tribes like the Nervii the Alamani Marsacii How were they annexeddestroyedGoths Were they ancestors or descendants of the GutesAlso taken from there Is it temporally inaccurate to portray Britain as being occupied at the same time by the Saxons Jutes Picts Britons Angles AND Gaels Is it possible that by sometime in history those tribes were all present in the islands before the AngloSaxonic merge,Most representative tribes in Germania Europe during Early Middle Ages,7

Maklodes,0,2,1r5eym,12,This is a reposthttpwwwredditcomrAskHistorianscommentsncojdidsecularauthoritiesevercommuteorpardon Usually when I read stuff like Friar Merdadipipistrello refused to recant his heretical claim that the fingernail clippings of the Virgin Mary were only substantively sanctified claiming that they were not both substantively and essentially sanctified as per church dogma He was subsequently found guilty of impenitent heresy and relaxed to the secular arm I assume that that means the person in question got burned Was that always the case though In principle the secular authorities could refuse to execute someone guilty in the judgment of the inquisition rightI suppose that the inquisitorial trial in the first place requires a certain amount of acquiescence on the part of the secular arm However I could imagine that a government might agree to allow an inquisitorial investigation on the assumption that the person would be vindicated but things dont go as expectedExample maybe the Kings brotherinlaw is a bishop suspected of heresy The king thinks that his brotherinlaw is probably innocent and that if he refuses to let the inquisition investigate the realm may be placed under interdict and he may be excommunicated The inquisition finds the bishop guilty but then the king refuses to allow an execution anywayThats speculative nonsense though Are there any recorded instances in which the secular arm just tells the Inquistion nope to executing a convicted heretic,repost Did secular authorities ever commute or pardon heretics remanded to them by the Inquisition,14

EbenSquid,1,0,1r14h8,1,Reading most works from the ancient world there is a distinct lack of narrative detail and Im wondering why this was and when the modern narrative detail began to emerge For example in the Odyssey it takes Odysseus perhaps twelve pages to defeat his wifes suitors what should be the climax of the work The author the semimythical bard Homer does not witness this from the perspective of any particular character There are no thoughts of the characters on what is occurring while detailed when it comes to the actual bloodletting the Suitors are no little more than names and genealogies  For example Odysseus sends his son to retrieve more weapons and armor gt Telemakhos did as his father said and went off to the store room where the armor was kept He chose four shields eight spears and four brass helmets with horsehair plumes He brought them with all speed to his father and armed himself first while the stockman and the swineherd also put on their armor and took their places near Odysseus A modern narrative this single paragraph would likely have been twelve pages on its own as Telemakhos rushed from the scene of battle to the hidden storeroom with a side discussion of its being hidden to prevent theft by the suitors his hasty fumble for the equipment his rejection of breastplates for the lack of time to put them on his recruitment of the heretofore unmentioned stockman and previously mentioned swineherd or was it the other way around and finally his return to his father just as Odysseus fires his final arrow  The narratives from antiquity that are not plays appear to be the worst offenders of what any creative writing professor would call telling not showing Why are these works so short on narrative detail  The expense of paper Or lack of previous examples to build on Culture Artistic choiceBonus Are there any prerenaissance works that do read like a modern novel Especially interested in ancient works but I know most of our surviving ancient writings are treatise like Platos  letters like Ciceros  and Plays Uggg Cant stand reading a play Watch it sureDouble Bonus What do you suppose an ancients reaction would be to a modern narrative Say If Doctor Who accidentally dropped his Latin copy of The Game of Thrones Would the be more likely to appreciate our descriptionheavy style where the narrator lives in the head of his characters or would he likely find it too much Edit Spelling,Narrative Detail in the Ancient world,1

SnakeGD,4,0,1qxbtm,2,Im interested in the religious climate during the First Crusade This is a long one and the question is a bit wide but I thought Id pose it in case anyone else was particularly interested at the momentThe last text Ive read has been Thomas Asbridges The First Crusade and in it he suggests more pragmatic compulsions for the European leadership than what might be described as religious zealFrom Asbridges depiction of Bohemond I for instance I have the impression that the crusade was seen as military expedition for this warlike and predatory individual I have a difficult time seeing figures such as Bohemond believing that they were doing the work of God But Im concerned Im oversimplifying or missing the sort of Christianity that existed in his timeIn the same book Asbridge asserts that Saladin had rather cynical or pragmatic reasons for his association with the Caliph rather than genuine religious ones I believe it was Nur alDin who was described in a similar fashion using the guise of religious unity to give credibility to conquest and to secure cooperation and subordination to his own interests while being cheered on as a championThe reason for this question is that Ive seen it claimed offhand that the crusaders were compelled  by a more ingrained religiosity than moderns would be familiar withI know that the ancient Greeks had a relationship with their gods that is alien to me being a modern raised Catholic and an atheist With skeptics like Xenophanes writing freely however I get the impression that there was no dogma and of course there was no church and no pope to create the atmosphere I associate with modern religious belief However while other intellectuals such as Herodotus took a scientific approach to the gods they still seem to have actually believed in them literallySo Im curious as to what the most prominent theories are  whether addressing the common people or the nobles of this time  as to the nature of belief during this period Was it similar to postHomeric Greece in that while deeply ingrained within society the nobility were not exactly motivated or controlled by religious conviction Surely it would be absurd to imagine a Hellenic crusade driven by the command of the gods  they did not seem to command that sort of primacy The question then Did the Catholic Church combine pragmatic goals conveniently but genuinely with their religious convictions Or can it be said that Urban II used the Church and religious belief as a vehicle for his own advancement A complex mix of these things that can be described as the religious climate Did anyone who wasnt a clear fanatic or member of the clergy actually believe they were fighting for penance or for the good of the Abrahamic God as far as we can tell Or were they really interested in the classic promise of plunder or a new start in a new land free of debt or what have you and for the nobility a fresh kingdomOf course I realize that any evidence for I guess you would call this the historiography of the First Crusade is sort of conjectureIm talking about generalizing a feeling of belief and I know thats a bit crazy but Id like to hear opinions on this ,Do we know how genuineearnest religious feelings were for the first crusaders,2

dddm,0,1,1qx59r,3,Ive recently read several articles about the South Sea Company and have found it to be a surprisingly interesting topic  I generally understand the meteoric rise and fall in its stock price but Im not sure if I grasp the thought process behind its initial formationAs I understand the British government had amassed a large amount of debt due to its involvement in the War of Spanish Succession  Similarly to today this debt could be bought and sold by internal and external parties as an investment vehicle  However and this is the issue I dont quite understand it seems that increasing the sale of national debt did not supply adequate cash flow needed to pay soldier salaries etcSo the South Sea Company was formed to provide more liquidity to the British government  National debt was transferred at a loss to stock in the South Sea Company whose value was based solely on the speculation of profits from exclusive trade in South America after the current war ended  Essentially the British government was exchanging long term profits for an increase in present cash flowIs this explanation accurate  I dont really understand why the sale of national debt couldnt provide the needed liquidity  Ive read national debt was considered a safe investment at the time which was one of the initial selling points of South Sea stock,Formation of the South Sea Company,4

UrbisPreturbis,16,25,1qrjqy,79,I wrote a detailed response to a question that was rightly deleted by the someone I hope by the mods because it was a possible flamewar bonanza In any case I thought it might be a useful answer for someone because it is relatively detailed and I put some input into it It deals with why Slavs in todays Republic of MacedoniaFYROM consider themselves Macedonians or rather the process of their national genesisWell there are multiple contested claims to Macedonia as a name as well as a region You have to be more specific what you mean by the name itself Macedonia as a name for a province was really constructed at the same time as national groups in the Balkans emerged  the late th and early th century At the time it was a product of often romantic and sometimes Orientalist visions of mainly local Enlightenment elites and adventurers and travelers from Britain France etc Now while there was an ancient state of Macedon which was Greek speaking in antiquity the origin of todays use of the name has little to do with some type of continuity The Byzantine province of Macedonia for example was in the location of todays central ThracehttpwwwzonucomimagesXTheByzantineEmpireinpng while Thrace was the hinterland of Constantinople So its important to note that the name and the location it was associated with shifted in history There are multiple claims to the name but the most common one emerges from the historical struggle against the Ottoman empire in the late th and early th century Multiethnic but largely Slavic at the time many of them considered themselves Bulgarian revolutionaries sought to overthrow the Ottoman Empire and establish either an independent state or a federation of states regions communes in the region This was the Macedonian Struggle a conflict that pitted both powers at the time external to the region Greeks Bulgarians Serbs and local Ottoman authorities against the revolutionaries It lasted in multiple phases from the s until  extending partially to the Balkan Wars in Different Greater Serbia Greece Bulgaria projects laid claims on an undifferentiated Macedonian territory where ethnic groups saw themselves as hybrid and undetermined For example in the s in the struggle for the establishment of an independent Bulgarian Church the Exarchate which was in many ways a proxy for national struggles it was highly difficult to establish the distinction between Greek and Slavic populations as well not finding space for such diverse groups as Aromanians Muslims Turkish and Slavic speaking Jews Roma etc In this atmosphere the idea of Macedonism separate from these state projects emerged as a contested identity For some it meant the establishment of a Slavic state in the region that would spearhead a large social revolution For others it meant an autonomous Macedonia within the Ottoman Empire that would encompass all faiths and languages This is best viewed in the transformation of the VMRO the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Oganization from a Bulgarian organization to that which would encompass all groupsnationalities The VMROs slogan Macedonia for Macedonians accompanied declarations for the unity of all peoples against Ottoman occupation This organization was also sometimes infiltrated by another organizaiton the Supremists which was based out of Sofia and supported the annexation of Macedonia to Bulgaria VMRO however remained largely independist as well as supported by local Slavs who at the time comprised a large part of the population of todays Greek Macedonia as well They did not exist in a vacuum however as no linguistic group held absolute sway and many people spoke multiple languages in fact sometimes even at home People might speak Greek and Turkish at the shop Aromanian with a fellow merchant Slavic to a peasant or another merchant Greek with one son who studied at a Greek school and Slavic with another who studies at a BulgarianSerbian school Together with that they might now a bit of Ladino to speak with Jews in MonastirBitola and Salonica a bit of French etcSo as you can see Macedonism or the idea that Macedonians were a separate people created out of their struggles against Ottoman domination became an important component in the national narrative of Slavic Macedonians This is why one of the largest parties in Macedonia today has the name VMRODPNE This idea of a regional becoming national identity was further fused with Slavic overtones by the Hellenization of Aegean Macedonia todays Greek Macedonia which accompanied the movement of Anatolian refugees into the region in the s as well as the latter Greek Civil War of the late s which pitted multiethnic communist units against Greek nationalist state units In this sense Aegean Macedonia became firmly Greek or associated with Greek identity particularly with the removal or assimilation of most of the other linguistic groups living there Jews in the Holocaust Muslims in the Population Exchange Slavs and Aromanians in gradual Hellenization etc At the same time Vardar nothern Macedonia which is todays Republic of MacedoniaFYROM became part of Serbia and later Yugoslavia while Pirin eastern Macedonia became part of Bulgaria In RoMFYROM Serbianization policies were largely unsuccessful in the interwar period and partisancommunist struggle countered them by returning to this separate Macedonian identity celebrating the Ilinden uprising by the VMRO etc This identity became indisputably exclusively Slavic by the late s in order for the local population to distinguish themselves from both Serbs and Bulgarians In this process of national genesis Slavic Macedonian identity became deeply separated as a constitutive nationality of the Yugoslav federation and linked to the struggle against Ottoman domination which was then connected to struggles against the Nazi occupation as well With Yugoslav president Titos withdrawal of support for Greek communists in  and the disappearance of possibility of a Balkan federation Macedonian identity was firmly entrenched into the Slavic population Thus a geographic designation in many ways gradually over the course of the late th and the first half of the th century became a specific ethnonational designationI can only speak about the breakup of Yugoslavia briefly because of the nature of this sub but basically when Yugoslavia brokeup this identity became a foundingstone for the FYROMRoM modern political culture Contested by surrounding nationalists Bulgarians Serbs Greeks Slavic politicians and citizens of the state saw this identity and the name associated with it as a useful tool in establishing the new nationstate This is becoming moreandmore of a problem today because of certain changes taking place in the narrative but this is outside the scope of this subredditI firmly recommend this fantastic book by Anastasia Karakasidou Fields of Wheat Hills of Blood Passages to Nationhood in Greek Macedonia Its really a great introductory work to the history of this complex region,Roots of Macedonism as a national ideology  response to deleted question,104

dietTwinkies,6,2,1qptst,3,I recently discovered Dan Carlins Hardcore History series of podcastshttpwwwdancarlincomdispphphh and although he admits he is only an amateur historian he seems to be reasonable and wellresearched in his podcast He always makes it clear that that there are multiple sides to every story and he uses quotes from actual historians and I enjoy listening to himI especially enjoyed his series Wrath of the Khans in which he talks about the rise of the Mongolian Empire He takes great pains to establish a context for the life of Temujin and spends over  hours talking about his rise to power and his conquests as well as the conquests of some of his children One of the things that seems to annoy him are what he calls revisionist historians who try to say that men like Temujin and Alexander the Great werent really so bad and seem to whitewash the blood these men leave in their wake to talk about the great things that happened as a result of their conquestsSo one of the things that really struck me was how he describes the times when the Mongols would supposedly exterminate entire cities He claims that the Mongols would divide the number of citizens in these cities by the number of soldiers and give each soldier the task of kill that many people Carlin does not seem especially critical or skeptical of this fact though he mentions that the Mongols were excellent propagandists I cant remember exactly how many times Carlin says this happens though he assures us it wasnt the normal procedure for the Mongolians to just kill everyone But I have noticed on multiple occasions when Mongolian brutality gets brought up on reddit there are highly voted responses saying that such accusations are bunk and almost certainly impossible and the Mongolians only claimed to do so for propaganda purposesIt seems like an awfully specific topic to research and Im not sure how to do so independently so Im posing this question to you in the hopes to get a little insight Would it have been possible for the Mongolians to do this Do modern historians think there is any truth to the claim that Mongolians ever exterminated the entire populace of major cities Did they ever even come close to doing accomplishing such a feat,What truth is there to the claims that the Mongolians under Ghengis Khan and his sons slaughtered whole cities,5
