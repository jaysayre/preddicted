TeoLolstoy,2,1,1r8z41,2,"I'm currently writing a paper for university in which we analyze metaphors and symbolism in totalitarian Regimes. While doing that I read a lot about the general zeitgeist in the late 19th/early 20th century in Germany. But I get increasingly confused as to how strong the influence of all those ariosophists and occultists really was. I understand that Goodrick-Clark said that the influence to the actual regime was marginal, still Austrian historian Diem says the Thule Society (which was closely associated with Guido von List and Lanz von Liebenfels) that they were responsible for putting in a lot of symbolism into the NS regime, as well as  creating the belief in a prehistoric aryan master race. Still, I read that Hitler himself did not like the ariosophists at all and said they were useless ""wandering priests"". But if Hitler disliked those ariosophists that much, why and how did the Nazis use so much pseudo-germanic symbolism like the Sig-rune (which was, according to my research, just a fictitious work of Guido von List who invented the Armanen-Futhark based upon nothing but ""intuition"") and the Swastika? And why did Hitler himself speak of an Aryan master race while discrediting those who invented its concept?

I am currently writing about the city-states in ancient mesopotamia, Nippur, Lagash, Marad, and such. And I have a hard time wrapping my mind around the distances.

When looking at maps of the archeological sites, I'm stunned at how ""small"" the area seems, especially width-wise. I mean, 200 miles... Some of these cities are merely 20 miles apart or so. How could they be considered different states ? How could they wage war against each other ? They're so close to each other... I just can't think about them in terms of ""different kingdoms, different people"".

Desert is a terrible place to move, I would guess, so it must have been a factor, ""lenghtening"" the distance between rival kingdoms by making travel hard. But can anyone explain it to me clearly ?

What would be the average journey time for a traveller on a mule / dromedary / horse ? And a caravan ? or even someone who's lost they mount ? 

I can easily put an hexagonal grid over the maps with one hexagon representing 10 miles (or less), but knowing how much average ""time"" represents an hexagon would be a tremendous help.

Explain why we chose a certain source and dismissed another, explained how we used one popular website as a spring board to get to an academic website, explain how we distinguish between facts and speculation. 

Rather than just deleting sub-par answers the Mods would post a reply on why they are being deleted 'no source' etc and post a copy of the deleted comment in the reply comment so that the process can be seen. Not for every single one of course, but for a few in each thread. So that people can get the idea. 

And a pre-selected user/mod (to avoid spamming) would post an invitation to come read and participate in these features to the original subreddit the question came from and possibly to related subreddits as well. 

The idea is to get more redditors not only aware of what we do here but to help teach them how they can be involved and prosper.

DrakeSaint,0,0,1r5gmx,7,"[Original post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1r56ms/most_representative_tribes_in_germania_europe/)

Was suggested to take my questions here.

* Slavic tribes are only mentioned in Wikipedia as ""slavs"". As such, I can't tell if there was no representative tribe in this period in Eastern Europe, or if they're, as Wiki says, too difficult to separate.

* Let's consider post-Hunnic invasions; Migration Period. Scandinavia only mentions the Goths as Jutes and Gutes, but those are on the baltic peninsula. Could ""Northmen"" be considered the ancestors of the Norse? How influent were the Finnic and east-baltic tribes in this period?

* I know it's kind of difficult to access knowledge since there was too much movement in between Europe in this time. But there were tribes which evolved into kingdoms, like the Lombards, Burgundians, and later on the Franks, which spearheaded their hegemony. In this context, how were tribes like the Thuringi or the Thervingi faring? They were mentioned after the collapse of Rome, but there aren't true clues they were extinct.

* Great Britain. Damn, it's hard to locate it politically. I understand the main tribes were the Gaels, Britons, Angles, Saxons and Picts. But there are indications the Jutes occupied the modern London area, right? And weren't Angles and Saxons considered Britons?

* It's kind of hard for me to understand Scandinavia in this period, mainly because the only solid information given is the migration of the Goths. How about Denmark/Norway? It was occupied by the Jutes, Saxons and the Danes, but how would you specify which part was occupied by whom? There are even reports of Angles in the region by the time!

* There are mentions of tribes like the Nervii, the Alamani, Marsacii... How were they annexed/destroyed?
Goths. Were they ancestors or descendants of the Gutes?

Also taken from there: Is it temporally inaccurate to portray Britain as being occupied, at the same time, by the Saxons, Jutes, Picts, Britons, Angles AND Gaels? Is it possible that by sometime in history those tribes were all present in the islands, before the Anglo-Saxonic merge?",Most representative tribes in Germania (Europe) during Early Middle Ages?,7

Maklodes,0,2,1r5eym,12,"[(This is a repost)](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1n3coj/did_secular_authorities_ever_commute_or_pardon/) Usually, when I read stuff like ""Friar Merdadipipistrello refused to recant his heretical claim that the fingernail clippings of the Virgin Mary were only substantively sanctified, claiming that they were not both substantively and essentially sanctified as per church dogma. He was subsequently found guilty of impenitent heresy and relaxed to the secular arm,"" I assume that that means the person in question got burned. Was that always the case though? In principle, the secular authorities could refuse to execute someone guilty in the judgment of the inquisition, right?

I suppose that the inquisitorial trial in the first place requires a certain amount of acquiescence on the part of the secular arm. However, I could imagine that a government might agree to allow an inquisitorial investigation on the assumption that the person would be vindicated, but things don't go as expected.

(Example: maybe the King's brother-in-law is a bishop suspected of heresy. The king thinks that his brother-in-law is probably innocent, and that if he refuses to let the inquisition investigate, the realm may be placed under interdict and he may be excommunicated. The inquisition finds the bishop guilty, but then the king refuses to allow an execution anyway.)

Accordingly, the NLF wanted to nationalize all the French industries within Algeria. According to Wikipedia the Soviet Union also provided the NLF with military, technical, and material assistance throughout the war. In the context of the Cold War the United States often attempted to either enact regime change or maintain the colonial system that was in place in order to stop the spread of socialism or communism in numerous countries, even if the threat of a communist movement was weak (French Indochina, Guatemala, Indonesia etc.).

As such, what was the United States' response to the Algerian War? Did the French ask for military or monetary assistance in fighting the NLF? Did the US fear a communist takeover in Algeria? Was the CIA involved in any covert action in Algeria during this period?

I posed the question to my professor who suggested that the United States simply wished to avoid involvement in such a bloody and brutal mess, but that doesn't seem to adequately answer the question as this was not a deterring factor in numerous other instances of US involvement during the Cold War.

Bonus question: Is there any evidence the Soviet Union tempered their involvement in the Algerian War in an effort to avoid alienating the French communist movement? If not, why did they not involve themselves further in the war?

CatoCensorius,3,0,1r1cpj,8,"Any thoughts, disputations, or answers welcome! Very amateur military historian here with a developing interest in WW1.

To me, it seems that most English speaking historians dismiss armored cars in WW1 because they were not capable of performing in the hideously scarred and extremely muddy no-man's land of the Western Front (let alone cross trench works). It may even be that modern 8x8 or 6x6 armored cars would not be able to function in that environment.

On the other fronts in the East - in Russia and the Middle East - warfare remained more mobile throughout the war however and a number of armored cars were used in combat with some success. The Russian civil war featured several hundreds of armored cars according [this book](http://www.ospreypublishing.com/store/Armored-Units-of-the-Russian-Civil-War_9781841765457), of which the most successful were supposedly the [British Austin and Russian Austin Putilov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Armoured_Car). This car seems overall quite similar to the [Rolls-Royce Armoured Car](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Armoured_Car) used in the Middle East during WW1 (and [featured in Lawrence of Arabia](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3umh_artfP0/UTjHsKP7ImI/AAAAAAAAAME/ydqjzaEtPlg/s1600/LOA-armor-car.png)).

Some of the other vehicles in use at this time, like the [Garford-Putilov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garford-Putilov_Armoured_Car) seem to have obviously been even more terrible vehicles.

Looking at these pictures and having read a little in the previously cited book I am struggling to understand why these were the best armored cars available at this late time. Of course, I understand that Russia's industrial capacity was much reduced, especially by a civil war, but I don't understand why nobody else was producing anything better.

Some seemingly obvious issues with the armored cars of the period -

* Low ground clearance.
* High center of weight.
* Body too long.
* Multiple turrets and gun mounts make the vehicle much too heavy and thus under powered.
* **Too few axles.** This interests me the most - Why no 6x4 vehicles? Fewer axles reduces traction to the driving axles (in a vehicle without all wheel drive) and increases weight per axle.

EbenSquid,1,0,1r14h8,1,"Reading most works from the ancient world, there is a distinct lack of narrative detail, and I'm wondering why this was and when the modern narrative detail began to emerge. 

For example, in the Odyssey, it takes Odysseus perhaps twelve pages to defeat his wife's suitors, what should be the climax of the work. The author, the semi-mythical bard Homer, does not witness this from the perspective of any particular character. There are no thoughts of the characters on what is occurring. while ""detailed"" when it comes to the actual bloodletting, the Suitors are no little more than names and genealogies.  

For example, Odysseus sends his son to retrieve more weapons and armor, 

&gt; Telemakhos did as his father said, and went off to the store room where the armor was kept. He chose four shields, eight spears, and four brass helmets with horse-hair plumes. He brought them with all speed to his father, and armed himself first, while the stockman and the swineherd also put on their armor, and took their places near Odysseus. 

A modern narrative, this single paragraph would likely have been twelve pages on its own, as Telemakhos rushed from the scene of battle, to the hidden storeroom (with a side discussion of its being hidden to prevent theft by the suitors), his hasty fumble for the equipment, his rejection of breastplates for the lack of time to put them on, his recruitment of the heretofore unmentioned stockman and previously mentioned swineherd (or was it the other way around?), and finally his return to his father just as Odysseus fires his final arrow.  

The narratives from antiquity (that are not plays) appear to be the worst offenders of what any creative writing professor would call ""telling, not showing"". 

Why are these works so short on narrative detail?  The expense of paper? Or lack of previous examples to build on? Culture? Artistic choice?

Bonus: Are there any pre-renaissance works that do read like a modern novel? Especially interested in ancient works, but I know most of our surviving ancient writings are treatise (like Plato's) , letters (like Cicero's) , and Plays (Uggg. Can't stand reading a play. Watch it, sure.)

Double Bonus: What do you suppose an ancient's reaction would be to a modern narrative? Say, If Doctor Who accidentally dropped his Latin copy of ""The Game of Thrones"". Would the be more likely to appreciate our description-heavy style, where the narrator lives in the head of his characters, or would he likely find it ""too much""?

nobloodyusername,3,4,1r09bw,17,"Recently I stumbled upon a discussion where some people exposed this opinion that Russians are naturally obedient due to some events in their history. Just two characteristic posts:

&gt;In Russia if you wanted to keep your head, you kept your head down in 1917, you kept your head down in 1905, and you kept your head down in 1800's and earlier - deportation to Siberia for being unpleasant to ruling class was a thing for centuries before Russia became Soviet.

&gt;As someone with only naive, cosmetic knowledge in this area, humor me.. but could a lot of it be down to inherited attitudes? Somehow I made it through Anne Applebaum's 28 hour audiobook of Gulag and something that struck me was how the Russian population became trained to keep their heads down and not stand out for fear of being incriminated by others or randomly selected to be thrown into a gulag. And if you learn that demeanor, your kids will too, right? And so on and so forth, down the generations.

Even though I feel that this is just a speculation and you can't really reason like that, I can't formulate why. It's not a question about Russia specifically, I guess this method is employed in many other contexts as well. Perhaps to American blacks and slavery or Germans and nazism/militarism. Probably it doesn't have to be negative/dismissive.

First of all, here are the types of technology I'm talking about (I'm sure the answer to each question will depend on which type):

* Small arms/artillery - machine guns, cannons, shells, mines
* Ships - fire control systems, advancements in speed/armor, aircraft carriers, anti-sub technology
* Submarines - the subs themselves, torpedoes, torpedo computers
* Tanks - fire control systems, advancements in speed/armor
* Aircraft - general design, jet engines
* General technology - radar, atomic weapons, codes/codebreaking, etc

Without further ado:

1. The original question - to what degree did allied nations (both Allies and Axis) share their advancements in the above with each other?
2. Did the degree of sharing differ greatly between nations within the same alliance?  For example, I can see the US/UK exchanging more with each other than with the USSR.  But programs like lend-lease would've given some insight even if it wasn't explicitly shared.

the blog linked isn't mine, it's the blog where the pic was originally posted with the claim, with the helpful source of ""google.com"". 

i'm extremely ignorant and fairly gullible, but i've seen this pic circulating on tumblr for a while now claiming to be of a ""sex ed class in 1929""

there's no real explanation and i did google this although only for a quick minute so i may have missed something extremely obvious. all i saw at a glance though was a bunch of memes and more unsourced tumblr pages.

i guess i'm not only curious as to whether the picture is legit, but since looking at it made me realize that i don't know shit about the history of sex education (especially regarding women) could someone who DOES know something about it in general perhaps tell me where the idea originated from, how it was first begun to be implemented, and what it was like when it began compared to today? how women were involved as opposed to men, and stuff like that? 

i cannot possibly imagine that such a thing could have existed in a classroom format until women had started to get a foothold in education and even then i question it being acceptable in the year 1929 - but i am not a historian and that is just a personal assumption based on my own lack of knowledge. 
my other assumption from what little i know of history is that if a woman received any sex education at all, it was usually from a female figure of an older generation, or in the family at least, but obviously even if the photo linked is not legit, women did at some point become included in receiving formal sex ed. 

so, when did it happen, and how?

SnakeGD09,4,0,1qxbtm,2,"I'm interested in the religious climate during the First Crusade. This is a long one and the question is a bit wide, but I thought I'd pose it in case anyone else was particularly interested at the moment.

The last text I've read has been Thomas Asbridge's *The First Crusade*, and in it he suggests more pragmatic compulsions for the European leadership than what might be described as ""religious zeal"".

From Asbridge's depiction of Bohemond I for instance, I have the impression that the crusade was seen as military expedition for this warlike and predatory individual. I have a difficult time seeing figures such as Bohemond believing that they were doing the ""work of God"". But I'm concerned I'm over-simplifying or missing the sort of Christianity that existed in his time.

In the same book Asbridge asserts that Saladin had rather cynical (or pragmatic) reasons for his association with the Caliph, rather than genuine religious ones. I believe it was Nur al-Din who was described in a similar fashion, using the guise of religious unity to give credibility to conquest and to secure cooperation and subordination to his own interests while being cheered on as a ""champion"".

The reason for this question is that I've seen it claimed offhand that the crusaders were compelled  by a more ingrained religiosity than moderns would be familiar with.

I know that the ancient Greeks had a relationship with their gods that is alien to me (being a modern, raised Catholic and an atheist). With skeptics like Xenophanes writing freely, however, I get the impression that there was no dogma, and of course there was no church and no pope to create the atmosphere I associate with modern religious belief. However while other intellectuals such as Herodotus took a scientific approach to the gods, they still seem to have actually believed in them literally.

So I'm curious as to what the most prominent theories are - whether addressing the common people or the nobles of this time - as to the nature of belief during this period. 

Was it similar to post-Homeric Greece in that, while deeply ingrained within society, the nobility were not exactly motivated or controlled by ""religious conviction""? Surely it would be absurd to imagine a Hellenic crusade driven by the command of the gods - they did not seem to command that sort of primacy. 

The question then: Did the Catholic Church combine pragmatic goals conveniently, but genuinely, with their religious convictions? Or can it be said that Urban II used the Church and religious belief as a vehicle for his own advancement? A complex mix of these things that can be described as the ""religious climate""?

As I understand, the British government had amassed a large amount of debt due to its involvement in the War of Spanish Succession.  Similarly to today, this debt could be bought and sold by internal and external parties as an investment vehicle.  However, and this is the issue I don't quite understand, it seems that increasing the sale of national debt did not supply adequate cash flow needed to pay soldier salaries, etc.

So the South Sea Company was formed to provide more liquidity to the British government.  National debt was transferred, at a loss, to stock in the South Sea Company, whose value was based solely on the speculation of profits from exclusive trade in South America after the current war ended.  Essentially the British government was exchanging long term profits for an increase in present cash flow.

Is this explanation accurate?  I don't really understand why the sale of national debt couldn't provide the needed liquidity.  I've read national debt was considered a safe investment at the time, which was one of the initial selling points of South Sea stock.",Formation of the South Sea Company,4

I studied Classics at high school and have recently been listening to Mike Duncan's and Dan Carlin's podcasts on the history of Rome, and (as many people do) I've developed quite an interest in the late Roman Republic. But there are a few things I don't have entirely clear about how the political system works.

So, there were elections in the public assembly, but it wasn't one-person-one-vote, instead you were arranged into various clans/groups, with the richer classes having more clans (and hence more votes) than the smaller clans, and it was the Censor's role to make sure this all stayed up to date. How did this work in detail? Was it exactly one-vote per clan, with the law passing if a majority of clans voted? Who decided how a clan voted - did they have a democratic vote within their clan? How were the final votes counted - did the leaders of each clan gather in an assembly, vaguely similar to the Westminster system?

Next - what was the role of the Senate exactly? It seems like it's a big thing to bypass the senate and give your laws directly to the people's assembly, but yet this apparently wasn't illegal. Did the Senate actually have no real legislative power, and it was only tradition that required approval of the senate to pass laws?

And: So you have two Consuls, who both have imperium (i.e. power of life and death?), although usually in different portfolios so they don't clash. The Consul is the most powerful position you can get. But there are many instances where the senate ""sent"" a consul off to war. Who actually has the power here? Is it something that's not really established and they're going by tradition rather than recorded law? Does a Consul not actually have supreme authority without senate approval?

Secondly-lastly, what was the role of the tribune-of-the-plebs outside of the veto power, and the laws against being physically assaulted? What duties and privileges did they receive over common citizens? They must have had some power in passing laws beyond being able to veto what they opposed, right?

And finally, how did the First Triumvirate maintain it's power? What prevented them from being outvoted? Was it simply that they maintained a large number of supporters amongst the senate and the people? i.e. it's not so much three people directly ruling everything, but a bit closer to something like being the three leaders of three political parties that have merged?",How did the Roman electoral system work?

How was it decided who would fight on the East versus the west? I have heard (in movies) that the front lines of the east was used as punishment, is this true? Was there special training or any sort of reason behind who fought in the east versus the west or Africa? On that note, did generals ever try to get positions where they thought they would be more successful?

Russian Questions:

1. I had always found the fighting of Russian females fascinating, and I was wondering if anyone could shed light on the subject. It wasn't exactly 50/50, how would they decide which women fought and which didn't? Were women sent to specific devisions/stereotyped for certain roles? I have heard of the Female snipers but I was wondering if this was one famous unit or a trend.

2. I heard a stat that the average lifespan of a Russian soldier in 1941 was one week. Obviously this varied across units, how was it decided who would essentially be canon fodder and who wouldn't? I have heard of the punishment divisions but were there other subsets?

The Ninth certainly shows up later, so in a roundabout way their presence is confirmed, but while the other legions are listed with details that seem to confirm their presence (and sometimes even their interaction with the Ninth), I can't find the sources for those details.

Wikipedia and livius also state that the Legio II Augusta was led by Vespasian, but biographies of Vespasian start long after the invasion, or, in the case of Suetonius, gloss over his involvement, saying that he did fight in so many battles, but failing to mention who he fought with, or what his rank was.

itinerarium,8,5,1qu5ls,10,"I have a buddy from Germany who says that in Germany, people are taught that Charlemagne was something like a ""founding father"" of Germany. When most Americans and British people hear this, their first reaction is to laugh and say that Charlemagne was French--and this idea makes my German buddy pretty angry. So I started doing a bit of research into the question, and the more I read the more complicated the answer became. To sum up my impressions (and grossly oversimplify): the nation of France evolved out of the part of parts of western/central Europe that were heavily under Roman influence, and the nation of Germany evolved out of the parts that were not. Charlemagne himself deliberately toed the line between these two groups, and the Frankish people as a whole were split between the two sides.

So, based on what we can know of the development of French and German national identity, do you think Charlemagne's own identity was more on one side or the other, or exactly in the middle (i.e. in Belgium)? I realize it's often silly for modern nations to ""claim"" a historical figure like that, but I think the idea sometimes has validity. George Washington was an American, whereas John Singleton Copley was perhaps more British, despite having lots of stuff named after him in Boston. Julius Caesar wasn't exactly an Italian in the modern sense, but he's closer to Italy than to any other modern nation. Or is there a better way to ask this question that better respects how historians prefer to view the development of modern European nationalism?

bargainbin69,0,1,1qts17,2,"I understand that this might not be something a historian can answer specifically. And may be based on some preconceived notions. But I'll explain.

Far east cultures seem to generally have a totally collectivist, hierarchical, and legalistic culture. You live in a give and take relationship with everyone else. You are expected to severely honor your parents and worship your ancestors. (I know there isn't one single culture in the east, but you get the idea.) Live by strict codes that have harsh punishments. Most of your life seems to be bound by imperatives and things you owe to society and your family. (and by extension your family owes to society.) This seems like it is something that has been fairly true consistently from the past even up to modern day.

But buddhism on the other hand seems to have a totally opposed ideological basis. Ethics are phrased not as imperatives, but as training one can independently choose to take on in order to facilitate order. The ""goal"" so to speak is personal liberation, which each person is accountable for individually, rather than as a group. And while monasteries internally have legalistic aspects, these are still seen as personal things taken on willingly rather than imperatives.

So these thigns coexisting seems like they should have warped and adapted more into eachother over time, but did not. Why didn't they? Were there any severe discussions as to this?

Text of the post...

&gt;Their name was Elgabalus (born 203 AD, died 222 AD). Ancient historian Cassius Dio's 80'th book in his history of Rome, written in about 229AD, makes for some interesting reading, even though Cassius Dio is quite transphobic. It is hard to tell whether this is legitimate history as these descriptions may have been lies created by Elgabalus' enemies (Elgabalus was assassinated), regardless, if there is some truth to what is written Elgabalus may have been one of the first trans* world leaders. Here's the link if you want to have a read yourself http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/80*.html

&gt;Many passages assert Elgabalus' desire to be referred to as female 

&gt;"" ""My Lord Emperor, Hail!"" he bent his neck so as to assume a ravishing feminine pose, and turning his eyes upon him with a melting gaze, answered without any hesitation: ""Call me not Lord, for I am a Lady."""" Dio Cassius 80:16

&gt;These passages suggest Elgabalus had gender dysphoria and desired to have SRS and facial hair removal

&gt;""He carried his lewdness to such a point that he asked the physicians to contrive a woman's vagina in his body by means of an incision, promising them large sums for doing so.""-Dio Cassius 80:16

&gt;""He had planned, indeed, to cut off his genitals altogether, but that desire was prompted solely by his effeminacy"" Dio Cassius 80:11

&gt;""Once, indeed, he shaved his chin and held a festival to mark the event; but after that he had the hairs plucked out, so as to look more like a woman.""-Dio Cassius 80:14

&gt;Elgabalus married a cis male partner 

&gt;""The husband of this ""woman"" was Hierocles, a Carian slave "" Dio Cassius 80:15

JCAPS766,0,4,1qsl1m,3,"I'm back again looking for help here for my Modern Russia class.  We are broadly tasked this time with writing an argumentative essay on the Cold War up to the end of the Khrushschev Era.

I'm beholden to the idea that the Cold War was a clash of Russian/Soviet and American exceptionalism.  Both states saw themselves as annointed by destiny to be the world's liberators and the guardians of all that is good, righteous, and politically just.  I attribute this to my studies at my university with a Professor Greg Carleton (in case that rings any bells), who led a course on the competing ethos and mythologies of the US and Russia.

I think that the point I'm trying to argue in my paper is that regardless of the pleasantries exchanged between the two countries during Khrushchev's early tenure, and regardless of the events that had a hand in ending these pleasantries, the animosity and hostile trajectory of the Cold War could not have been derailed by the Khrushchev thaw because the US and the USSR were fundamentally beholden to rivalry as a result of their clashing ideas of their own exceptionalism.

To put this question in perspective, when Khrushchev declared to an assembly of Western diplomats that ""Whether you like it or not, history is on our side. We will dig you in!"" what was the political, historical, and other context of the time that informed this statement?  What about the state of the US-Soviet relationship and the state of Soviet politics made Khrushchev so certain that Moscow was fated to emerge triumphant?

The Commander of the MC's army is this huge crazy guy with plate armor. (He's literally crazy, war has gotten to him and he just isn't all there.)

(I realize this stretches credulity, but this particular character is a bit larger than life.)

I'm wondering what kind of weapon he could be using to fight and kill a cavalryman. Yes, this is a fantasy and it doesn't HAVE to be realistic, but I'm doing my level best to construct something that is close enough to reality that the players will be able to use their knowledge of medieval warcraft to play the game more effectively, so I want it to at least be sort-of-possible.

Despite quite a bit of research, I can't figure out how an on-foot soldier would be able to kill a cavalryman. I just haven't read any accounts of it.

I am undertaking research for a work of fiction; it's actually set in the future but I want it to have strong foundations in history and other disciplines and make it a well-informed work.

This may be a question better posted on r/military or similar subreddits but I think the knowledge of the military history experts on this sub is better for what I am looking for. 

I'd like to post questions about the plausibility of a 'conventional', in the crudest sense, or non-nuclear assault on the NORAD facilities in and around Cheyenne mountain, Colorado, including Peterson AFB. The belligerent could be the conventional forces of the USSR during the later Cold War (the issue of whether an invasion of the contiguous U.S. was plausible or not we'll keep separate for here and now), the contemporary armed forces of the Russian Federation or the Chinese PLA. What I'm also exploring is the possibility of a domestic enemy, a guerrilla or 'standing' army of one party in a hypothetical civil war, attacking the facilities with the goal of capturing them. The issue of nuclear weapons command is actually not a major priority in the latter; the goal of the assaulting force would be to capture the base in its own right.

This obviously presents a lot of variables so please forgive me for the number of directions this could take. I have done my own research into the base, its history and the security measures that were in place during the Cold War, the 1989-2001 period and as they exist contemporaneously; however, the reality or absurdity of staging a conventional land battle around the mountain and the base is not something which figures much in the research. I am aware of other fiction that has placed 'capturing Cheyenne' as the backbone of major plots (Stargate, Terminator universe, etc) but I would like to see what the reality would be like if attempted by non sci-fi parties, including historical actors. I should specify - this would not be a terrorist attack but a military operation with the goal of taking control of the mountain complex.

Presume that the belligerents have access to mobile infantry, armor, artillery and at least minimal air support but no WMD.

Now, while there was an ancient state of ""Macedon"" which was Greek speaking in antiquity, the origin of today's use of the name has little to do with some type of continuity. The Byzantine province of Macedonia, for example, was [in the location of today's central Thrace](http://www.zonu.com/images/0X0/2009-12-23-11463/The-Byzantine-Empire-in-1045.png), while Thrace was the hinterland of Constantinople. So it's important to note that the name, and the location it was associated with, shifted in history. 

There are multiple claims to the name, but the most common one emerges from the historical struggle against the Ottoman empire in the late 19th and early 20th century. Multi-ethnic, but largely Slavic (at the time, many of them considered themselves Bulgarian) revolutionaries sought to overthrow the Ottoman Empire and establish either an independent state, or a federation of states, regions, communes in the region. This was the Macedonian Struggle, a conflict that pitted both powers at the time external to the region (Greeks, Bulgarians, Serbs) and local Ottoman authorities against the revolutionaries. It lasted in multiple phases, from the 1870s until 1908, extending partially to the Balkan Wars in 1912/3.

Different ""Greater"" {Serbia, Greece, Bulgaria} projects laid claims on an undifferentiated Macedonian territory, where ethnic groups saw themselves as hybrid and undetermined. For example, in the 1870s, in the struggle for the establishment of an independent Bulgarian Church (the Exarchate), which was in many ways a proxy for national struggles, it was highly difficult to establish the distinction between Greek and Slavic populations, as well not finding space for such diverse groups as Aromanians, Muslims (Turkish and Slavic speaking), Jews, Roma, etc. 

In this atmosphere, the idea of Macedonism, separate from these state projects, emerged as a contested identity. For some, it meant the establishment of a Slavic state in the region that would spear-head a large social revolution. For others, it meant an autonomous Macedonia within the Ottoman Empire that would encompass all faiths and languages. This is best viewed in the transformation of the VMRO (the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Oganization) from a Bulgarian organization to that which would encompass all groups/nationalities. The VMRO's slogan ""Macedonia for Macedonians"" accompanied declarations for the unity of all peoples against Ottoman occupation. This organization was also sometimes infiltrated by another organizaiton, the ""Supremists"", which was based out of Sofia, and supported the annexation of Macedonia to Bulgaria. VMRO, however, remained largely independist, as well as supported by local Slavs, who at the time, comprised a large part of the population of today's Greek Macedonia as well. They did not exist in a vacuum, however, as no linguistic group held absolute sway, and many people spoke multiple languages in fact, sometimes even at home. People might speak Greek and Turkish at the shop, Aromanian with a fellow merchant, Slavic to a peasant or another merchant, Greek with one son who studied at a Greek school and Slavic with another who studies at a Bulgarian/Serbian school. Together with that, they might now a bit of Ladino to speak with Jews (in Monastir/Bitola and Salonica), a bit of French, etc.

So as you can see, ""Macedonism"" or the idea that Macedonians were a separate people, created out of their struggles against Ottoman domination, became an important component in the national narrative of Slavic Macedonians. This is why one of the largest parties in Macedonia today has the name VMRO-DPNE. This idea of a ""regional becoming national"" identity was further fused with Slavic overtones by the Hellenization of Aegean Macedonia (today's Greek Macedonia) which accompanied the movement of Anatolian refugees into the region in the 1920s, as well as the latter Greek Civil War of the late 1940s, which pitted multi-ethnic communist units against Greek nationalist state units. In this sense, Aegean Macedonia became firmly ""Greek"" or associated with Greek identity, particularly with the removal or assimilation of most of the other linguistic groups living there (Jews in the Holocaust, Muslims in the Population Exchange, Slavs and Aromanians in gradual Hellenization, etc). 

At the same time, Vardar (nothern) Macedonia, which is today's Republic of Macedonia/FYROM became part of Serbia and later Yugoslavia, while Pirin (eastern) Macedonia became part of Bulgaria. In RoM/FYROM, Serbianization policies were largely unsuccessful in the interwar period, and partisan/communist struggle countered them by returning to this separate ""Macedonian"" identity, celebrating the Ilinden uprising by the VMRO, etc. This identity became indisputably exclusively Slavic by the late 1940s, in order for the local population to distinguish themselves from both Serbs and Bulgarians. In this process of national genesis, Slavic Macedonian identity became deeply separated as a constitutive ""nationality"" of the Yugoslav federation, and linked to the struggle against Ottoman domination (which was then connected to struggles against the Nazi occupation as well. With Yugoslav president Tito's withdrawal of support for Greek communists in 1948, and the disappearance of possibility of a Balkan federation, Macedonian identity was firmly entrenched into the Slavic population. **Thus a geographic designation, in many ways, gradually over the course of the late 19th and the first half of the 20th century, became a specific ethno-national designation.**

I can only speak about the break-up of Yugoslavia briefly because of the nature of this sub, but basically, when Yugoslavia broke-up, this identity became a founding-stone for the FYROM/RoM modern political culture. Contested by surrounding nationalists (Bulgarians, Serbs, Greeks), Slavic politicians and citizens of the state saw this identity (and the name associated with it) as a useful tool in establishing the new nation-state. This is becoming more-and-more of a problem today, because of certain changes taking place in the narrative, but this is outside the scope of this subreddit.

dietTwinkies,6,2,1qptst,3,"I recently discovered [Dan Carlin's ""Hardcore History"" series of podcasts](http://www.dancarlin.com/disp.php/hh) and although he admits he is only an amateur historian, he seems to be reasonable and well-researched in his podcast. He always makes it clear that that there are multiple sides to every story and he uses quotes from actual historians, and I enjoy listening to him.

I especially enjoyed his series ""Wrath of the Khans"" in which he talks about the rise of the Mongolian Empire. He takes great pains to establish a context for the life of Temujin, and spends over 8 hours talking about his rise to power and his conquests as well as the conquests of some of his children. One of the things that seems to annoy him are what he calls ""revisionist historians"" who try to say that men like Temujin (and Alexander the Great) weren't really so bad, and seem to whitewash the blood these men leave in their wake to talk about the great things that happened as a result of their conquests.

So one of the things that really struck me was how he describes the times when the Mongols would supposedly exterminate entire cities. He claims that the Mongols would divide the number of citizens in these cities by the number of soldiers, and give each soldier the task of kill that many people. Carlin does not seem especially critical or skeptical of this fact, though he mentions that the Mongols were excellent propagandists. 

I can't remember exactly how many times Carlin says this happens, though he assures us it wasn't the normal procedure for the Mongolians to just kill everyone. But I have noticed on multiple occasions when Mongolian brutality gets brought up on reddit, there are highly voted responses saying that such accusations are bunk, and almost certainly impossible, and the Mongolians only claimed to do so for propaganda purposes.

It seems like an awfully specific topic to research and I'm not sure how to do so independently, so I'm posing this question to you in the hopes to get a little insight. Would it have been possible for the Mongolians to do this? Do modern historians think there is *any* truth to the claim that Mongolians ever exterminated the entire populace of major cities?

Would this be a common option to give the jury?

/u/profrhodes and /u/khosikulu here, ready and willing to answer any questions you may have on the history of Southern Africa. 

Little bit about us:

/u/profrhodes : My main area of academic expertise is decolonization in Southern Africa, especially Zimbabwe, and all the turmoil which followed - wars, genocide, apartheid, international condemnation, rebirth, and the current difficulties those former colonies face today. I can also answer questions about colonization and white settler communities in Southern Africa and their conflicts, cultures, and key figures, from the 1870s onwards!


/u/khosikulu : I hold a PhD in African history with two additional major concentrations in Western European and global history. My own work focuses on intergroup struggles over land and agrarian livelihoods in southern Africa from 1657 to 1916, with an emphasis on the 19th century Cape and Transvaal and heavy doses of the history of scientific geography (surveying, mapping, titling, et cetera). I can usually answer questions on topics more broadly across southern Africa for all eras as well, from the Zambesi on south. (My weakness, as with so many of us, is in the Portuguese areas.)

/u/khosikulu is going to be in and out today so if there is a question I think he can answer better than I can, please don't be offended if it takes a little longer to be answered!

That said, fire away!

But how much more do we know about the Romans than we knew then? What has modern archaeology and anthropology uncovered in the last ~250 years?

The samurai used swords, even though many of their opponents were mounted. It makes sense to me that one of the samurai who goes on a stealthy mission to steal a gun would use his sword, but in the pitched battles, would samurai have preferred some type of spear?

The bandits also primarily used swords and it seemed like they had a tough time agains the bamboo spear-wielding villagers.
