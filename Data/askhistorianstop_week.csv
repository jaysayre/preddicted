Zebulorg,22,,29,1r7hfk,,95,"Hello gentle scholars,

I am currently writing about the city-states in ancient mesopotamia, Nippur, Lagash, Marad, and such. And I have a hard time wrapping my mind around the distances.

When looking at maps of the archeological sites, I'm stunned at how ""small"" the area seems, especially width-wise. I mean, 200 miles... Some of these cities are merely 20 miles apart or so. How could they be considered different states ? How could they wage war against each other ? They're so close to each other... I just can't think about them in terms of ""different kingdoms, different people"".

Desert is a terrible place to move, I would guess, so it must have been a factor, ""lenghtening"" the distance between rival kingdoms by making travel hard. But can anyone explain it to me clearly ?

What would be the average journey time for a traveller on a mule / dromedary / horse ? And a caravan ? or even someone who's lost they mount ? 

I can easily put an hexagonal grid over the maps with one hexagon representing 10 miles (or less), but knowing how much average ""time"" represents an hexagon would be a tremendous help.

Thanks everyone  !

We're trying something new in /r/AskHistorians.

Readers here tend to like the open discussion threads and questions that allow a multitude of possible answers from people of all sorts of backgrounds and levels of expertise.  The [most popular thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1dv49y/tt_youre_at_a_party_the_people_around_you_find/) in this subreddit's history, for example, was about questions you dread being asked at parties -- over 2000 comments, and most of them were very interesting!

So, we do want to make questions like this a more regular feature, but we also don't want to make them TOO common -- /r/AskHistorians is, and will remain, a subreddit dedicated to educated experts answering specific user-submitted questions.  General discussion is good, but it isn't the primary point of the place.

With this in mind, from time to time, one of the moderators will post an open-ended question of this sort.  It will be distinguished by the ""Feature"" flair to set it off from regular submissions, and the same relaxed moderation rules that prevail in the daily project posts will apply.  We expect that anyone who wishes to contribute will do so politely and in good faith, but there is far more scope for speculation and general chat than there would be in a usual thread.  

We hope to experiment with this a bit over the next few weeks to see how it works.  Please let us know [via the mod mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskHistorians) if you have any questions, comments or concerns about this new endeavour!

**Today's question** is one that might require a bit of insight on your own part! You can only pick one year to highlight - and for every single one of us, that might require a bit of reflection. 

So! What single year do YOU find to be your favourite? It could be because that was the year when liberty finally was born for your country! It could be the year when a great man took the reins of power, taking control of the people and establishing their legacy for thousands of year to come! It could be the year when a scholar finished his most epic work, publishing it for the world to see. Or it could be a year of turmoil, chaos, and unrest, which gives us lots of juicy details to study. Perhaps it could be the year of scandal and intrigue, with people using all of their wiles to try to get one over their rivals. The choice is all yours....and there are thousands and thousands of years to pick from. You just get to pick one - get to telling us about it! :D

I try to keep up with the literature concerning methods of interpreting and applying the text of the Constitution, which was a subject Holmes addressed repeatedly. He had an adventurous and interesting life, and his work as a scholar and judge spanned the period from the Civil War to the New Deal, so he gives us a wonderful vantage point from which to view American history. Ask me anything about his life, his love affairs, his remarkable contributions to constitutional law, what he might say about questions that arise today.

**Today:**

The ""Monday Mysteries"" series will be focused on, well, mysteries -- historical matters that present us with problems of some sort, and not just the usual ones that plague historiography as it is. Situations in which our whole understanding of them would turn on a (so far) unknown variable, like the sinking of the Lusitania; situations in which we only know that something did happen, but not necessarily how or why, like the deaths of Richard III's nephews in the Tower of London; situations in which something has become lost, or become found, or turned out never to have been at all -- like the art of Greek fire, or the Antikythera mechanism, or the historical Coriolanus, respectively.

**This week we'll be taking a look at the great turnabouts or reversals of history - whether it's an outlook, an opinion, a military event, etc.**

This question might seem a bit more attractive to you military folks, but don't fret too much, everyone else - I made a special note of the fact that you can go ahead and use someone's change of opinion here as well! Has someone in your area of specialty changed their minds about something - and subsequently changed a war? Has someone been completely on the back ropes, looking like they won't be able to accomplish more than feeding the worms, before they become a great leader, leading their people to greatness? There are also military reversals! How about a force, beaten back, bloodied, about to lose everything....mysteriously comes out the victor? What happened? More intriguingly...**how** did it happen? It's all your ball game here - put your thinking caps on, and tell us about those insane events that changed history!

Moderation, as always, will be light - just remember to post politely and in good faith!

Extended quote:
""For nearly three hundred years Britain, reconciled to the Roman system, enjoyed in many respects the happiest, most comfortable, and most enlightened times its inhabitants have ever had.
In this period, almost equal to that which separates us from the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, well-to-do persons in Britain lived better than they ever did until late Victorian times. From the year 400 till the year 1900 no one had central heating and very few had hot baths. A wealthy British-Roman citizen building a country house regarded the hypocaust which warmed it as indispensable.
For fifteen hundred years his descendants lived in the cold of unheated dwellings, mitigated by occasional roastings at gigantic wasteful fires. Even now a smaller proportion of the whole population dwells in centrally heated houses than in those ancient days. As for baths, they were completely lost till the middle of the nineteenth century.In all this long, bleak intervening gap cold and dirt clung to the most fortunate and highest in the land""

tomtefar,0,,10,1rd06p,,26,"Hello,

My grandmother Pauline Kaufman, born Niemitz or Nemez, always claimed that her father, also named Niemitz/Nemez, was a famous Russian engineer who, during WWII, was the mastermind behind putting Russian industries on rail and move them back from the front to avoid having them fall into enemy hands.

He was, apparently, shot by Stalin as a reward for his efforts. 

My grandmother claims that she was with her father next to Stalin on a May 1:st parade, although I do not have a year for when this happened.

I've googled a lot on this subject, but have come up with nothing.

Some (perhaps) relevant info on my grandmother.
Pauline was born in the US, but lived in Russia for a while to teach. She was subsequently called in front of the House's Un american Activities to testify about her communist connections. Transcript link below - search for ""Feuer"", her last name at the time: http://archive.org/stream/scopeofsovietact1112unit/scopeofsovietact1112unit_djvu.txt

My question is:
Was Pauline's father (my great grandfather) the engineer who orchestrated the by-rail move of the industries, and, if so, are there any references to where I can read up on him?

Any confirmation to her being next to Stalin during a May 1 parade would also be very interesting.

I've been wondering about if there is any truth to this, or if Pauline was just full of it, since I was a kid and would really appreciate some clarifications on the subject.

Thank you.

Was there a day when literally all of the bus routes changed?

Similarly, when reunification happened, did property prices in East Berlin shoot up as West Berliners snapped up all of the (presumably cheaper) property, or were people hesitant to invest thinking it could all revert?

&gt;In Russia if you wanted to keep your head, you kept your head down in 1917, you kept your head down in 1905, and you kept your head down in 1800's and earlier - deportation to Siberia for being unpleasant to ruling class was a thing for centuries before Russia became Soviet.

&gt;As someone with only naive, cosmetic knowledge in this area, humor me.. but could a lot of it be down to inherited attitudes?

Explain why we chose a certain source and dismissed another, explained how we used one popular website as a spring board to get to an academic website, explain how we distinguish between facts and speculation. 

Rather than just deleting sub-par answers the Mods would post a reply on why they are being deleted 'no source' etc and post a copy of the deleted comment in the reply comment so that the process can be seen. Not for every single one of course, but for a few in each thread. So that people can get the idea. 

And a pre-selected user/mod (to avoid spamming) would post an invitation to come read and participate in these features to the original subreddit the question came from and possibly to related subreddits as well.

Vromrig,1,,1,1rb59a,,11,"I suspect it's a little more nuanced than ""everyone from that family is dead"", since the Hapsburgs enjoyed so much intermingling that there must be hundreds of people today who are technically a part of the family.

But the Hapsburgs are considered extinct, as are the Wittelbachs.  What are the criteria?

Ambarenya,3,,2,1ra00f,,10,"I couldn't really decide where to post this because it doesn't seem relevant for /r/greek (which is only concerned with Modern Greek), or /r/linguistics (which doesn't seem to like questions about pronunciation), so I'm guessing it makes the most sense to post this question here. 

**Question:** 

How are the endings of words like *κατάφρακτοι* and *Ρωμαίοι* pronounced in the traditional Byzantine Greek?

Would they be pronounced like:

KA-TA-FRAC-TEE and ROOM-AY-EE

or more like 

KA-TA-FRAC-TOY and ROOM-AY-OY?

I remember reading somewhere that certain letter combinations in the modern Greek language have changed since Byzantine times, most notably the upsilon changing to more of an f sound in certain words (like in βασιλεύς). 

But, I was specifically unsure about the -oi becoming pronounced as just -ee. Was it always pronounced this way? And would you say pronouncing it a certain way (assuming there is a difference between ""old"" and ""new"") is more valid than the other?

I think it is an especially interesting question to consider because of the ""sharing"" of Greek and Latin words during the Late Classical to Medieval transition period and the preservation of Latin terminology in Greek throughout the history of the Byzantine Empire.

He was subsequently found guilty of impenitent heresy and relaxed to the secular arm,"" I assume that that means the person in question got burned. Was that always the case though? In principle, the secular authorities could refuse to execute someone guilty in the judgment of the inquisition, right?

I suppose that the inquisitorial trial in the first place requires a certain amount of acquiescence on the part of the secular arm. However, I could imagine that a government might agree to allow an inquisitorial investigation on the assumption that the person would be vindicated, but things don't go as expected.

(Example: maybe the King's brother-in-law is a bishop suspected of heresy. The king thinks that his brother-in-law is probably innocent, and that if he refuses to let the inquisition investigate, the realm may be placed under interdict and he may be excommunicated. The inquisition finds the bishop guilty, but then the king refuses to allow an execution anyway.)

It sounds to me like at some point in their history Scots began speaking English with pronunciation influenced by another language or something. I have no idea though and feel like it's equally plausible that it could just be a regional thing that's not really explicable.  What did they speak before English? Did English evolve simultaneously  across the island that Scotland and England share, or was it imposed at some point by English rule? Did the Picts speak French?

To me, it seems that most English speaking historians dismiss armored cars in WW1 because they were not capable of performing in the hideously scarred and extremely muddy no-man's land of the Western Front (let alone cross trench works). It may even be that modern 8x8 or 6x6 armored cars would not be able to function in that environment.

On the other fronts in the East - in Russia and the Middle East - warfare remained more mobile throughout the war however and a number of armored cars were used in combat with some success. The Russian civil war featured several hundreds of armored cars according [this book](http://www.ospreypublishing.com/store/Armored-Units-of-the-Russian-Civil-War_9781841765457), of which the most successful were supposedly the [British Austin and Russian Austin Putilov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Armoured_Car).

Some of the other vehicles in use at this time, like the [Garford-Putilov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garford-Putilov_Armoured_Car) seem to have obviously been even more terrible vehicles.

Looking at these pictures and having read a little in the previously cited book I am struggling to understand why these were the best armored cars available at this late time. Of course, I understand that Russia's industrial capacity was much reduced, especially by a civil war, but I don't understand why nobody else was producing anything better.

Some seemingly obvious issues with the armored cars of the period -

* Low ground clearance.
* High center of weight.
* Body too long.
* Multiple turrets and gun mounts make the vehicle much too heavy and thus under powered.
* **Too few axles.** This interests me the most - Why no 6x4 vehicles? Fewer axles reduces traction to the driving axles (in a vehicle without all wheel drive) and increases weight per axle.

On one hand, he was totally a card carrying member of the nazi party and a PRETTY high rank, but on the other hand, he was driven by science and it's reported that he in fact tried to stall operations due to the fact that he thought the whole Aryan race supremacy thing was nonsense.

His story ends in a very tragic way.  I know he killed himself and his family right before the Russians took Berlin but again I don't know why.  Was this man a real Nazi or was he an innocent scientist who was conscripted by his government to defile the one thing he had passion for only to end up in the middle of Berlin with the Russians destroying everything in their wake?

DrakeSaint,0,,1,1r5gmx,,6,"[Original post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1r56ms/most_representative_tribes_in_germania_europe/)

Was suggested to take my questions here.

* Slavic tribes are only mentioned in Wikipedia as ""slavs"". As such, I can't tell if there was no representative tribe in this period in Eastern Europe, or if they're, as Wiki says, too difficult to separate.

* Let's consider post-Hunnic invasions; Migration Period. Scandinavia only mentions the Goths as Jutes and Gutes, but those are on the baltic peninsula. Could ""Northmen"" be considered the ancestors of the Norse? How influent were the Finnic and east-baltic tribes in this period?

* I know it's kind of difficult to access knowledge since there was too much movement in between Europe in this time. But there were tribes which evolved into kingdoms, like the Lombards, Burgundians, and later on the Franks, which spearheaded their hegemony. In this context, how were tribes like the Thuringi or the Thervingi faring? They were mentioned after the collapse of Rome, but there aren't true clues they were extinct.

* Great Britain. Damn, it's hard to locate it politically. I understand the main tribes were the Gaels, Britons, Angles, Saxons and Picts. But there are indications the Jutes occupied the modern London area, right? And weren't Angles and Saxons considered Britons?

* It's kind of hard for me to understand Scandinavia in this period, mainly because the only solid information given is the migration of the Goths. How about Denmark/Norway? It was occupied by the Jutes, Saxons and the Danes, but how would you specify which part was occupied by whom? There are even reports of Angles in the region by the time!

* There are mentions of tribes like the Nervii, the Alamani, Marsacii... How were they annexed/destroyed?
Goths. Were they ancestors or descendants of the Gutes?

Also taken from there: Is it temporally inaccurate to portray Britain as being occupied, at the same time, by the Saxons, Jutes, Picts, Britons, Angles AND Gaels? Is it possible that by sometime in history those tribes were all present in the islands, before the Anglo-Saxonic merge?",Most representative tribes in Germania (Europe) during Early Middle Ages?,7,askhistorians

Shadowcat770,2,,0,1rhzht,,7,"[Here](http://imgur.com/a/Lyynx) is an album with pictures of the scrimshaw.


The scrimshaw was passed down through my dad's family, and my mom recently took it to the New Bedford Whaling Museum to have it looked at. I guess the people at the museum were very impressed with the piece, and said they'd never seen this artist before. Ultimately, we would like to figure out when it was made and try to find the artist's name.


The family story goes that the tusk was given to my father's great-grandfather as a wedding present from the captain of a whaling ship. We aren't sure which set of great-grandparents it was given to, and unfortunately any family members that could possibly add more details to the story have passed away.


Originally, because of the drawing of Jenny Lind, the experts at the museum thought that the tusk was made around 1950. However, according to our genealogy, my dad's great-grandparents got married in 1881 (Andrew M. Palmer and Orletta ""Lettie"" Cragin) and 1869 (Benjamin F. Peabody and Ann Eliza Dare). The date will be key in attempting to determine the artist's name. In order to pinpoint the date the scrimshaw was made, it was suggested that we try to find the original photos that were used to trace the pictures onto the tusk.
The people at the museum said that the picture of Jenny Lind was likely from an actual photo or playbill because the scrimshaw shows her with a big nose. I guess artists would usually try to correct her nose when they drew a portrait of her?



For the other photos, originally my dad thought that they came from Godey's Lady's Book. However, the people at the museum also suggested looking in Harper Collins Monthly. I found a plate titled ""The Elopement"" in the table of contents of the February 1850 issue of Godey's Lady's Book, but I haven't been able to find a scanned copy of the plate to confirm that it's the picture on the scrimshaw.



Basically, I have hit a dead end in my research. It would mean a lot to my dad to find the artist's name and learn more about our family history.

randomwildshot,7,,0,1rbn9a,,5,"Recently I came upon a debate upon a forum topic that diverged into other topics, Stalingrad included, and gave me the idea to ask this question.

So I am curious to what were your statistical chances to survive Stalingrad serving in the Russian army by gender? With that, how where the women distributed in the army by profession and how were the men distributed as well? Like 30% of men were doing this role, etc.

Also I would like to know what special cases existed in the same roles and important facts. For example, I noticed when searching that there is no recorded case of a female scout performing the 'grab a tongue' I found here: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1oiqus/what_was_boot_camp_like_for_women_during_wwii/

Potential things such as if men were given more rations than women would be great to know too.

In short, I'd like information on the survival rates of men and women in the Russian army by percentage, and how their roles were distributed.

Ultimately I want to answer the question that given the percentage casualty rate of men and women at Stalingrad, were men or women more likely to live through it, adjusted for risk of profession and special cases? Any numbers would be fantastic, especially percentages.

As such, any information that could affect this that I did not request would also be great.

EDIT: Injury rates would be most interesting too. Because what doesn't kill you often makes you crippled. Might as well ask for civilian rates as well. I realize I'm asking a doozy, but might as well do it all at once.",What were the survival rates during the Battle of Stalingrad for the Russian army by gender and statistical role breakdown by gender?

Johnson of being involved in the assassination of Kennedy. Critics of the Warren Commission have accused Johnson of plotting the assassination because he hated the Kennedys and feared that he would be dropped from the Democratic ticket for the 1964 election. With his 1968 book The Dark Side of Lyndon Baines Johnson, Joachim Joesten is credited as being the first conspiracy author to accuse Johnson of having a role in the assassination.

There is a great mythology in the south about the unbelievable evil and brutality that the Yankees - ""Lucifer's legions"" - brought in their victory campaigns towards the end of the war - the obvious examples being, of course, Sherman's ""March to the Sea.""

As I understand it, Sherman's ""March"" was composed of several similar acts; the Battle of Meridian, in which he practiced the sort of total war he would later commit to entirely; the march across Georgia from Atlanta to Savannah; and the march across the Carolinas, which was both the worst (South Carolina) and the most lenient (North Carolina).

I am trying to figure out how bad, *really,* these campaigns were for the south. Does it live up to the mythology - raping, pillaging, plundering, roving bands of criminals, mass starvation - of horror and unthinkable tragedy?

The fact that the south rebuilt so quickly makes me think it wasn't really that bad, and that the mythology was deliberately and easily built up out of a fairly civil - if not terribly wasteful and destructive - campaign. 

Can anyone weigh in on this topic? How bad *were* Sherman's marches? How bad did the worst of life get during the war, and where did that happen?

While doing that I read a lot about the general zeitgeist in the late 19th/early 20th century in Germany. But I get increasingly confused as to how strong the influence of all those ariosophists and occultists really was. I understand that Goodrick-Clark said that the influence to the actual regime was marginal, still Austrian historian Diem says the Thule Society (which was closely associated with Guido von List and Lanz von Liebenfels) that they were responsible for putting in a lot of symbolism into the NS regime, as well as  creating the belief in a prehistoric aryan master race. Still, I read that Hitler himself did not like the ariosophists at all and said they were useless ""wandering priests"". But if Hitler disliked those ariosophists that much, why and how did the Nazis use so much pseudo-germanic symbolism like the Sig-rune (which was, according to my research, just a fictitious work of Guido von List who invented the Armanen-Futhark based upon nothing but ""intuition"") and the Swastika? And why did Hitler himself speak of an Aryan master race while discrediting those who invented its concept?

What were the words for these?

I was thinking since we use numbers to tell us what a number is our words don't represent them in the same way as a symbol would. The Latin alphabet had I-V-X-L-C-D-M so I just assumed there would be words given a similar meaning as the letter, since C is pronounced /keː/ [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet) one would assume the word for 100 is something starting with the pronunciation /keː/, witch I assume centuria or what ever the the correct Latin word is pronounced something like Kenturia!? 

also come to think of it, how would a Roman say he was born 30 years ago, I was born ""XXX annus"" ago? or did they have word to define this. I am Norwegian and we just combine the words for 3 and 10 into three-ten (NO: tre-ti), this goes on ""four-ten"" etc. until one hundred, where we say ""et"" (one) ""hundre"" (hundred).

Rosstin,3,,0,1rd6ph,,1,"Hey guys, I've been here before. I'm that writer who is working on the [visual novel about war and hot men](https://www.facebook.com/queenatarms).

I need to write a duel in the story, and I'm having a lot of trouble with it. It doesn't so much matter what the weapons involved are... right now I'm imagining a standard sort of duel between 2 opponents with one-handed swords sans shields, like arming swords or spadas, but I'm open to other suggestions or conditions that make it easier to write the battle.

The trick is that this is an interactive-fiction story, kind of like a choose-your-own-adventure book. There are graphics but it's not animated or action-oriented in a twitch way. There need to be meaningful choices for the player to make in the context of the fight. Not in the choosing of weapons or the pre-combat strategy (there is no time to prepare), but in the split-second decisions I ask the player to make given what she sees the opponent doing. I have to approach it a bit like a puzzle, where there is some crucial information that the player can pick up during the battle and then use to her advantage when she decides what to do. And I need red herrings too: moves that may seem like a good idea but are actually a literal deathtrap. As much as I've read up on fencing techniques and swordplay, I want to avoid a situation where I require the player to have memorized the fencing wheel or somesuch.

There are 2 of these duels, which are dark reflections of eachother. 

In the first duel, the main character's superior sets one of the other soldiers on her, in order to test her skills. The player needs to go through this friendly duel, make some choices about what to do, and then win or lose, learning something in the process.

In the second duel, the main character will be on a real battlefield. She and her enemy will have similar weapons as were used in the practice yard, and similar tactics will apply. But unlike the yard, this will be dirtier, more real, and lethal. A mistake equals death.

Basically, I'm asking for a bunch of ideas for different kinds of tactics that two duelists would use, so I can think about clever ways to create scenarios and puzzles for them in these confrontations.",Writing a late-1400s Duel,1,askhistorians

I ask this because, in my research, I have gotten a lot of differing opinions. So, sorry if this is a lot, it led to a string of questions:
Did Marcus Aurelius co-rule with his son? Or did he pass the power down to Commodus? I ask this because I have received some conflicting information from different sources.

If the latter, was their relationship as strained as made out to be? Why would he pass the power down to someone he doesn't trust? Because, correct me if I'm wrong, I thought emperors had the power to pass the power to anyone?

Are Aurelius' and Commodus' portrayal as philosopher and unethical, war-lord, respectively, historically accurate?

And lastly, on an unrelated note, I was reading somewhere, and can't remember where, about a woman approaching Aurelius with a petition. To which Aurelius stated he was much to busy to read. Then she said, to his face, ""Then don't be emperor."" Which led to Aurelius reading the petition. Did this happen with Aurelius? Did this happen at all, with any emperor?

Accordingly, the NLF wanted to nationalize all the French industries within Algeria. According to Wikipedia the Soviet Union also provided the NLF with military, technical, and material assistance throughout the war. In the context of the Cold War the United States often attempted to either enact regime change or maintain the colonial system that was in place in order to stop the spread of socialism or communism in numerous countries, even if the threat of a communist movement was weak (French Indochina, Guatemala, Indonesia etc.).

As such, what was the United States' response to the Algerian War? Did the French ask for military or monetary assistance in fighting the NLF? Did the US fear a communist takeover in Algeria? Was the CIA involved in any covert action in Algeria during this period?

I posed the question to my professor who suggested that the United States simply wished to avoid involvement in such a bloody and brutal mess, but that doesn't seem to adequately answer the question as this was not a deterring factor in numerous other instances of US involvement during the Cold War.

Bonus question: Is there any evidence the Soviet Union tempered their involvement in the Algerian War in an effort to avoid alienating the French communist movement? If not, why did they not involve themselves further in the war?

EbenSquid,1,,0,1r14h8,,1,"Reading most works from the ancient world, there is a distinct lack of narrative detail, and I'm wondering why this was and when the modern narrative detail began to emerge. 

For example, in the Odyssey, it takes Odysseus perhaps twelve pages to defeat his wife's suitors, what should be the climax of the work. The author, the semi-mythical bard Homer, does not witness this from the perspective of any particular character. There are no thoughts of the characters on what is occurring. while ""detailed"" when it comes to the actual bloodletting, the Suitors are no little more than names and genealogies.  

For example, Odysseus sends his son to retrieve more weapons and armor, 

&gt; Telemakhos did as his father said, and went off to the store room where the armor was kept. He chose four shields, eight spears, and four brass helmets with horse-hair plumes. He brought them with all speed to his father, and armed himself first, while the stockman and the swineherd also put on their armor, and took their places near Odysseus. 

A modern narrative, this single paragraph would likely have been twelve pages on its own, as Telemakhos rushed from the scene of battle, to the hidden storeroom (with a side discussion of its being hidden to prevent theft by the suitors), his hasty fumble for the equipment, his rejection of breastplates for the lack of time to put them on, his recruitment of the heretofore unmentioned stockman and previously mentioned swineherd (or was it the other way around?), and finally his return to his father just as Odysseus fires his final arrow.  

The narratives from antiquity (that are not plays) appear to be the worst offenders of what any creative writing professor would call ""telling, not showing"". 

Why are these works so short on narrative detail?  The expense of paper? Or lack of previous examples to build on? Culture? Artistic choice?

Bonus: Are there any pre-renaissance works that do read like a modern novel? Especially interested in ancient works, but I know most of our surviving ancient writings are treatise (like Plato's) , letters (like Cicero's) , and Plays (Uggg. Can't stand reading a play. Watch it, sure.)

Double Bonus: What do you suppose an ancient's reaction would be to a modern narrative? Say, If Doctor Who accidentally dropped his Latin copy of ""The Game of Thrones"". Would the be more likely to appreciate our description-heavy style, where the narrator lives in the head of his characters, or would he likely find it ""too much""?

The primary issue that seems to arise is opposition to Shirer's thesis that German people were complicit in the rise of the Nazi party.

Zebulorg,22,,30,1r7hfk,,97,"Hello gentle scholars,

I am currently writing about the city-states in ancient mesopotamia, Nippur, Lagash, Marad, and such. And I have a hard time wrapping my mind around the distances.

When looking at maps of the archeological sites, I'm stunned at how ""small"" the area seems, especially width-wise. I mean, 200 miles... Some of these cities are merely 20 miles apart or so. How could they be considered different states ? How could they wage war against each other ? They're so close to each other... I just can't think about them in terms of ""different kingdoms, different people"".

Desert is a terrible place to move, I would guess, so it must have been a factor, ""lenghtening"" the distance between rival kingdoms by making travel hard. But can anyone explain it to me clearly ?

What would be the average journey time for a traveller on a mule / dromedary / horse ? And a caravan ? or even someone who's lost they mount ? 

I can easily put an hexagonal grid over the maps with one hexagon representing 10 miles (or less), but knowing how much average ""time"" represents an hexagon would be a tremendous help.

Thanks everyone  !

We're trying something new in /r/AskHistorians.

Readers here tend to like the open discussion threads and questions that allow a multitude of possible answers from people of all sorts of backgrounds and levels of expertise.  The [most popular thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1dv49y/tt_youre_at_a_party_the_people_around_you_find/) in this subreddit's history, for example, was about questions you dread being asked at parties -- over 2000 comments, and most of them were very interesting!

So, we do want to make questions like this a more regular feature, but we also don't want to make them TOO common -- /r/AskHistorians is, and will remain, a subreddit dedicated to educated experts answering specific user-submitted questions.  General discussion is good, but it isn't the primary point of the place.

With this in mind, from time to time, one of the moderators will post an open-ended question of this sort.  It will be distinguished by the ""Feature"" flair to set it off from regular submissions, and the same relaxed moderation rules that prevail in the daily project posts will apply.  We expect that anyone who wishes to contribute will do so politely and in good faith, but there is far more scope for speculation and general chat than there would be in a usual thread.  

We hope to experiment with this a bit over the next few weeks to see how it works.  Please let us know [via the mod mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskHistorians) if you have any questions, comments or concerns about this new endeavour!

**Today's question** is one that might require a bit of insight on your own part! You can only pick one year to highlight - and for every single one of us, that might require a bit of reflection. 

So! What single year do YOU find to be your favourite? It could be because that was the year when liberty finally was born for your country! It could be the year when a great man took the reins of power, taking control of the people and establishing their legacy for thousands of year to come! It could be the year when a scholar finished his most epic work, publishing it for the world to see. Or it could be a year of turmoil, chaos, and unrest, which gives us lots of juicy details to study. Perhaps it could be the year of scandal and intrigue, with people using all of their wiles to try to get one over their rivals. The choice is all yours....and there are thousands and thousands of years to pick from. You just get to pick one - get to telling us about it! :D

popcorn_monster,0,,14,1r4po7,,41,"My great-grandfather was a Scottish-born ship's carpenter aboard a steamer on the Britain-Australia route during the 1880s. So far I haven't uncovered any archive material relating to him or his ship, so I have sought to get an idea of his life from secondary literature. I haven't been able to find a lot, though. So here I am! 

To break up the titular question a bit:
* What was life like for seamen whilst aboard ship? 
* What sort of duties might a ship's carpenter have had?
* What would life have been like in their 'home' (esp. Scottish) ports?
* Compared to the above, what would life have been like in the 'away' (esp. Australian) ports?
* To what degree did the lifestyles differ between regions? Eg., How was life on the Britain-Australia route different from life on the Trans-Atlantic route?
* Can anybody recommend any literature on the subject?

Thanks for any help in advance!",What was life like for merchant seamen during the late 19th century? (British-Australian focus),55,askhistorians
beardsayswhat,3,,4,1rhhgp,,45,"In 1493 by Charles Mann, he talks about Japanese samurai stranded in Mexico after the Japanese closed it's borders in the 1630s, and that some of them took up a trade guarding silver shipments. However, I can't find any other information on the subject.

Was this a real phenomenon? Is there any other information about it? Would these Samurai have been treated well?  What would their daily lives have been like?  Would protecting silver shipments have been a high or low status occupation?  Would they have tried to return to Japan regardless of the ""closing of the doors?""

I am an accountant by trade and I have a brief knowledge of the double entry accounting system that was invented in the last few centuries. 

My question is how the hell did 8th century merchants keep track of their wealth before modern accounting? How did owners of great capital in the past keep track of everything they owned? 

I can look at my companies books and see how much revenue was made and where. I can tell at a glance what assets and what liabilities we have.

**Today:**

The ""Monday Mysteries"" series will be focused on, well, mysteries -- historical matters that present us with problems of some sort, and not just the usual ones that plague historiography as it is. Situations in which our whole understanding of them would turn on a (so far) unknown variable, like the sinking of the Lusitania; situations in which we only know that something did happen, but not necessarily how or why, like the deaths of Richard III's nephews in the Tower of London; situations in which something has become lost, or become found, or turned out never to have been at all -- like the art of Greek fire, or the Antikythera mechanism, or the historical Coriolanus, respectively.

**This week we'll be taking a look at the great turnabouts or reversals of history - whether it's an outlook, an opinion, a military event, etc.**

This question might seem a bit more attractive to you military folks, but don't fret too much, everyone else - I made a special note of the fact that you can go ahead and use someone's change of opinion here as well! Has someone in your area of specialty changed their minds about something - and subsequently changed a war? Has someone been completely on the back ropes, looking like they won't be able to accomplish more than feeding the worms, before they become a great leader, leading their people to greatness? There are also military reversals! How about a force, beaten back, bloodied, about to lose everything....mysteriously comes out the victor? What happened? More intriguingly...**how** did it happen? It's all your ball game here - put your thinking caps on, and tell us about those insane events that changed history!

Moderation, as always, will be light - just remember to post politely and in good faith!
