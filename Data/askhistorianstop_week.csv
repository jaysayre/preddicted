of some sort and not just the usual ones that plague historiography as it is Situations in which our whole understanding of them would turn on a so far unknown variable like the sinking of the Lusitania situations in which we only know that something did happen but not necessarily how or why like the deaths of Richard IIIs nephews in the Tower of London situations in which something has become lost or become found or turned out never to have been at all  like the art of Greek fire or the Antikythera mechanism or the historical Coriolanus respectivelyThis week well be taking a look at the great turnabouts or reversals of history  whether its an outlook an opinion a military event etcThis question might seem a bit more attractive to you military folks but dont fret too much everyone else  I made a special note of the fact that you can go ahead and use someones change of opinion here as well Has someone in your area of specialty changed their minds about something  and subsequently changed a war Has someone been completely on the back ropes looking like they wont be able to accomplish more than feeding the worms before they become a great leader leading their people to greatness There are also military reversals How about a force beaten back bloodied about to lose everythingmysteriously comes out the victor What happened More intriguinglyhow did it happen Its all your ball game here  put your thinking caps on and tell us about those insane events that changed historyModeration as always will be light  just remember to post politely and in good faithNext Week

EbenSquid,1,0,1r14h8,1,Reading most works from the ancient world there is a distinct lack of narrative detail and Im wondering why this was and when the modern narrative detail began to emerge For example in the Odyssey it takes Odysseus perhaps twelve pages to defeat his wifes suitors what should be the climax of the work The author the semimythical bard Homer does not witness this from the perspective of any particular character There are no thoughts of the characters on what is occurring while detailed when it comes to the actual bloodletting the Suitors are no little more than names and genealogies  For example Odysseus sends his son to retrieve more weapons and armor gt Telemakhos did as his father said and went off to the store room where the armor was kept He chose four shields eight spears and four brass helmets with horsehair plumes He brought them with all speed to his father and armed himself first while the stockman and the swineherd also put on their armor and took their places near Odysseus A modern narrative this single paragraph would likely have been twelve pages on its own as Telemakhos rushed from the scene of battle to the hidden storeroom with a side discussion of its being hidden to prevent theft by the suitors his hasty fumble for the equipment his rejection of breastplates for the lack of time to put them on his recruitment of the heretofore unmentioned stockman and previously mentioned swineherd or was it the other way around and finally his return to his father just as Odysseus fires his final arrow  The narratives from antiquity that are not plays appear to be the worst offenders of what any creative writing professor would call telling not showing Why are these works so short on narrative detail  The expense of paper Or lack of previous examples to build on Culture Artistic choiceBonus Are there any prerenaissance works that do read like a modern novel Especially interested in ancient works but I know most of our surviving ancient writings are treatise like Platos  letters like Ciceros  and Plays Uggg Cant stand reading a play Watch it sureDouble Bonus What do you suppose an ancients reaction would be to a modern narrative Say If Doctor Who accidentally dropped his Latin copy of The Game of Thrones Would the be more likely to appreciate our descriptionheavy style where the narrator lives in the head of his characters or would he likely find it too much Edit Spelling,Narrative Detail in the Ancient world,1,askhistorians

of some sort and not just the usual ones that plague historiography as it is Situations in which our whole understanding of them would turn on a so far unknown variable like the sinking of the Lusitania situations in which we only know that something did happen but not necessarily how or why like the deaths of Richard IIIs nephews in the Tower of London situations in which something has become lost or become found or turned out never to have been at all  like the art of Greek fire or the Antikythera mechanism or the historical Coriolanus respectivelyThis week well be taking a look at the great turnabouts or reversals of history  whether its an outlook an opinion a military event etcThis question might seem a bit more attractive to you military folks but dont fret too much everyone else  I made a special note of the fact that you can go ahead and use someones change of opinion here as well Has someone in your area of specialty changed their minds about something  and subsequently changed a war Has someone been completely on the back ropes looking like they wont be able to accomplish more than feeding the worms before they become a great leader leading their people to greatness There are also military reversals How about a force beaten back bloodied about to lose everythingmysteriously comes out the victor What happened More intriguinglyhow did it happen Its all your ball game here  put your thinking caps on and tell us about those insane events that changed historyModeration as always will be light  just remember to post politely and in good faithNext Week

Gunslap,11,8,1r2l67,30,Im guessing that the notions of Getting away from it all Being closer to nature and Going off the grid for a while are probably fairly modern constructs but Im wondering if people in previous centuries still did something comparable to camping as a leisure activity Im also assuming that what early explorers of the Americas did for example would be considered camping but Im more interested in campings development as a pastime as apposed to a necessity of your lifestylecareer If any of my assumptions are wrong Id love to hear that as wellThank you,Where did the idea of camping as a vacation come from,38,askhistorians
