UrbisPreturbis,16,24,1qrjqy,80,I wrote a detailed response to a question that was rightly deleted by the someone I hope by the mods because it was a possible flamewar bonanza In any case I thought it might be a useful answer for someone because it is relatively detailed and I put some input into it It deals with why Slavs in todays Republic of MacedoniaFYROM consider themselves Macedonians or rather the process of their national genesisWell there are multiple contested claims to Macedonia as a name as well as a region You have to be more specific what you mean by the name itself Macedonia as a name for a province was really constructed at the same time as national groups in the Balkans emerged  the late th and early th century At the time it was a product of often romantic and sometimes Orientalist visions of mainly local Enlightenment elites and adventurers and travelers from Britain France etc Now while there was an ancient state of Macedon which was Greek speaking in antiquity the origin of todays use of the name has little to do with some type of continuity The Byzantine province of Macedonia for example was in the location of todays central ThracehttpwwwzonucomimagesXTheByzantineEmpireinpng while Thrace was the hinterland of Constantinople So its important to note that the name and the location it was associated with shifted in history There are multiple claims to the name but the most common one emerges from the historical struggle against the Ottoman empire in the late th and early th century Multiethnic but largely Slavic at the time many of them considered themselves Bulgarian revolutionaries sought to overthrow the Ottoman Empire and establish either an independent state or a federation of states regions communes in the region This was the Macedonian Struggle a conflict that pitted both powers at the time external to the region Greeks Bulgarians Serbs and local Ottoman authorities against the revolutionaries It lasted in multiple phases from the s until  extending partially to the Balkan Wars in Different Greater Serbia Greece Bulgaria projects laid claims on an undifferentiated Macedonian territory where ethnic groups saw themselves as hybrid and undetermined For example in the s in the struggle for the establishment of an independent Bulgarian Church the Exarchate which was in many ways a proxy for national struggles it was highly difficult to establish the distinction between Greek and Slavic populations as well not finding space for such diverse groups as Aromanians Muslims Turkish and Slavic speaking Jews Roma etc In this atmosphere the idea of Macedonism separate from these state projects emerged as a contested identity For some it meant the establishment of a Slavic state in the region that would spearhead a large social revolution For others it meant an autonomous Macedonia within the Ottoman Empire that would encompass all faiths and languages This is best viewed in the transformation of the VMRO the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Oganization from a Bulgarian organization to that which would encompass all groupsnationalities The VMROs slogan Macedonia for Macedonians accompanied declarations for the unity of all peoples against Ottoman occupation This organization was also sometimes infiltrated by another organizaiton the Supremists which was based out of Sofia and supported the annexation of Macedonia to Bulgaria VMRO however remained largely independist as well as supported by local Slavs who at the time comprised a large part of the population of todays Greek Macedonia as well They did not exist in a vacuum however as no linguistic group held absolute sway and many people spoke multiple languages in fact sometimes even at home People might speak Greek and Turkish at the shop Aromanian with a fellow merchant Slavic to a peasant or another merchant Greek with one son who studied at a Greek school and Slavic with another who studies at a BulgarianSerbian school Together with that they might now a bit of Ladino to speak with Jews in MonastirBitola and Salonica a bit of French etcSo as you can see Macedonism or the idea that Macedonians were a separate people created out of their struggles against Ottoman domination became an important component in the national narrative of Slavic Macedonians This is why one of the largest parties in Macedonia today has the name VMRODPNE This idea of a regional becoming national identity was further fused with Slavic overtones by the Hellenization of Aegean Macedonia todays Greek Macedonia which accompanied the movement of Anatolian refugees into the region in the s as well as the latter Greek Civil War of the late s which pitted multiethnic communist units against Greek nationalist state units In this sense Aegean Macedonia became firmly Greek or associated with Greek identity particularly with the removal or assimilation of most of the other linguistic groups living there Jews in the Holocaust Muslims in the Population Exchange Slavs and Aromanians in gradual Hellenization etc At the same time Vardar nothern Macedonia which is todays Republic of MacedoniaFYROM became part of Serbia and later Yugoslavia while Pirin eastern Macedonia became part of Bulgaria In RoMFYROM Serbianization policies were largely unsuccessful in the interwar period and partisancommunist struggle countered them by returning to this separate Macedonian identity celebrating the Ilinden uprising by the VMRO etc This identity became indisputably exclusively Slavic by the late s in order for the local population to distinguish themselves from both Serbs and Bulgarians In this process of national genesis Slavic Macedonian identity became deeply separated as a constitutive nationality of the Yugoslav federation and linked to the struggle against Ottoman domination which was then connected to struggles against the Nazi occupation as well With Yugoslav president Titos withdrawal of support for Greek communists in  and the disappearance of possibility of a Balkan federation Macedonian identity was firmly entrenched into the Slavic population Thus a geographic designation in many ways gradually over the course of the late th and the first half of the th century became a specific ethnonational designationI can only speak about the breakup of Yugoslavia briefly because of the nature of this sub but basically when Yugoslavia brokeup this identity became a foundingstone for the FYROMRoM modern political culture Contested by surrounding nationalists Bulgarians Serbs Greeks Slavic politicians and citizens of the state saw this identity and the name associated with it as a useful tool in establishing the new nationstate This is becoming moreandmore of a problem today because of certain changes taking place in the narrative but this is outside the scope of this subredditI firmly recommend this fantastic book by Anastasia Karakasidou Fields of Wheat Hills of Blood Passages to Nationhood in Greek Macedonia Its really a great introductory work to the history of this complex region,Roots of Macedonism as a national ideology  response to deleted question,104

Astrokiwi,4,0,1qwczs,16,I actually have several questions that Id like to get clear I studied Classics at high school and have recently been listening to Mike Duncans and Dan Carlins podcasts on the history of Rome and as many people do Ive developed quite an interest in the late Roman Republic But there are a few things I dont have entirely clear about how the political system worksSo there were elections in the public assembly but it wasnt onepersononevote instead you were arranged into various clansgroups with the richer classes having more clans and hence more votes than the smaller clans and it was the Censors role to make sure this all stayed up to date How did this work in detail Was it exactly onevote per clan with the law passing if a majority of clans voted Who decided how a clan voted  did they have a democratic vote within their clan How were the final votes counted  did the leaders of each clan gather in an assembly vaguely similar to the Westminster systemNext  what was the role of the Senate exactly It seems like its a big thing to bypass the senate and give your laws directly to the peoples assembly but yet this apparently wasnt illegal Did the Senate actually have no real legislative power and it was only tradition that required approval of the senate to pass lawsAnd So you have two Consuls who both have imperium ie power of life and death although usually in different portfolios so they dont clash The Consul is the most powerful position you can get But there are many instances where the senate sent a consul off to war Who actually has the power here Is it something thats not really established and theyre going by tradition rather than recorded law Does a Consul not actually have supreme authority without senate approvalSecondlylastly what was the role of the tribuneoftheplebs outside of the veto power and the laws against being physically assaulted What duties and privileges did they receive over common citizens They must have had some power in passing laws beyond being able to veto what they opposed rightAnd finally how did the First Triumvirate maintain its power What prevented them from being outvoted Was it simply that they maintained a large number of supporters amongst the senate and the people ie its not so much three people directly ruling everything but a bit closer to something like being the three leaders of three political parties that have merged,How did the Roman electoral system work What were the powers of each component,16

itinerarium,8,4,1qu5ls,13,I have a buddy from Germany who says that in Germany people are taught that Charlemagne was something like a founding father of Germany When most Americans and British people hear this their first reaction is to laugh and say that Charlemagne was Frenchand this idea makes my German buddy pretty angry So I started doing a bit of research into the question and the more I read the more complicated the answer became To sum up my impressions and grossly oversimplify the nation of France evolved out of the part of parts of westerncentral Europe that were heavily under Roman influence and the nation of Germany evolved out of the parts that were not Charlemagne himself deliberately toed the line between these two groups and the Frankish people as a whole were split between the two sidesSo based on what we can know of the development of French and German national identity do you think Charlemagnes own identity was more on one side or the other or exactly in the middle ie in Belgium I realize its often silly for modern nations to claim a historical figure like that but I think the idea sometimes has validity George Washington was an American whereas John Singleton Copley was perhaps more British despite having lots of stuff named after him in Boston Julius Caesar wasnt exactly an Italian in the modern sense but hes closer to Italy than to any other modern nation Or is there a better way to ask this question that better respects how historians prefer to view the development of modern European nationalism Thanks either way love the work you guys do here,Was Charlemagne French or German,17

TeoLolstoy,2,1,1r8z41,2,Im currently writing a paper for university in which we analyze metaphors and symbolism in totalitarian Regimes While doing that I read a lot about the general zeitgeist in the late thearly th century in Germany But I get increasingly confused as to how strong the influence of all those ariosophists and occultists really was I understand that GoodrickClark said that the influence to the actual regime was marginal still Austrian historian Diem says the Thule Society which was closely associated with Guido von List and Lanz von Liebenfels that they were responsible for putting in a lot of symbolism into the NS regime as well as  creating the belief in a prehistoric aryan master race Still I read that Hitler himself did not like the ariosophists at all and said they were useless wandering priests But if Hitler disliked those ariosophists that much why and how did the Nazis use so much pseudogermanic symbolism like the Sigrune which was according to my research just a fictitious work of Guido von List who invented the ArmanenFuthark based upon nothing but intuition and the Swastika And why did Hitler himself speak of an Aryan master race while discrediting those who invented its concept    I know these are a lot of questions and Im not sure I phrased it right But Im just really confused where the beginning of all that beliefs were and why they came to be what they were during the NSregime    Thanks a lot   Edit Great a typo in the title  Edit  What Id like to add every documentary Ive watched and basically almost every source says entirely different things ,The more I read the more I am confused Wherefrom exactly did Hitler take his believe in a master race,3

SnakeGD,4,0,1qxbtm,2,Im interested in the religious climate during the First Crusade This is a long one and the question is a bit wide but I thought Id pose it in case anyone else was particularly interested at the momentThe last text Ive read has been Thomas Asbridges The First Crusade and in it he suggests more pragmatic compulsions for the European leadership than what might be described as religious zealFrom Asbridges depiction of Bohemond I for instance I have the impression that the crusade was seen as military expedition for this warlike and predatory individual I have a difficult time seeing figures such as Bohemond believing that they were doing the work of God But Im concerned Im oversimplifying or missing the sort of Christianity that existed in his timeIn the same book Asbridge asserts that Saladin had rather cynical or pragmatic reasons for his association with the Caliph rather than genuine religious ones I believe it was Nur alDin who was described in a similar fashion using the guise of religious unity to give credibility to conquest and to secure cooperation and subordination to his own interests while being cheered on as a championThe reason for this question is that Ive seen it claimed offhand that the crusaders were compelled  by a more ingrained religiosity than moderns would be familiar withI know that the ancient Greeks had a relationship with their gods that is alien to me being a modern raised Catholic and an atheist With skeptics like Xenophanes writing freely however I get the impression that there was no dogma and of course there was no church and no pope to create the atmosphere I associate with modern religious belief However while other intellectuals such as Herodotus took a scientific approach to the gods they still seem to have actually believed in them literallySo Im curious as to what the most prominent theories are  whether addressing the common people or the nobles of this time  as to the nature of belief during this period Was it similar to postHomeric Greece in that while deeply ingrained within society the nobility were not exactly motivated or controlled by religious conviction Surely it would be absurd to imagine a Hellenic crusade driven by the command of the gods  they did not seem to command that sort of primacy The question then Did the Catholic Church combine pragmatic goals conveniently but genuinely with their religious convictions Or can it be said that Urban II used the Church and religious belief as a vehicle for his own advancement A complex mix of these things that can be described as the religious climate Did anyone who wasnt a clear fanatic or member of the clergy actually believe they were fighting for penance or for the good of the Abrahamic God as far as we can tell Or were they really interested in the classic promise of plunder or a new start in a new land free of debt or what have you and for the nobility a fresh kingdomOf course I realize that any evidence for I guess you would call this the historiography of the First Crusade is sort of conjectureIm talking about generalizing a feeling of belief and I know thats a bit crazy but Id like to hear opinions on this ,Do we know how genuineearnest religious feelings were for the first crusaders,2

EbenSquid,1,0,1r14h8,1,Reading most works from the ancient world there is a distinct lack of narrative detail and Im wondering why this was and when the modern narrative detail began to emerge For example in the Odyssey it takes Odysseus perhaps twelve pages to defeat his wifes suitors what should be the climax of the work The author the semimythical bard Homer does not witness this from the perspective of any particular character There are no thoughts of the characters on what is occurring while detailed when it comes to the actual bloodletting the Suitors are no little more than names and genealogies  For example Odysseus sends his son to retrieve more weapons and armor gt Telemakhos did as his father said and went off to the store room where the armor was kept He chose four shields eight spears and four brass helmets with horsehair plumes He brought them with all speed to his father and armed himself first while the stockman and the swineherd also put on their armor and took their places near Odysseus A modern narrative this single paragraph would likely have been twelve pages on its own as Telemakhos rushed from the scene of battle to the hidden storeroom with a side discussion of its being hidden to prevent theft by the suitors his hasty fumble for the equipment his rejection of breastplates for the lack of time to put them on his recruitment of the heretofore unmentioned stockman and previously mentioned swineherd or was it the other way around and finally his return to his father just as Odysseus fires his final arrow  The narratives from antiquity that are not plays appear to be the worst offenders of what any creative writing professor would call telling not showing Why are these works so short on narrative detail  The expense of paper Or lack of previous examples to build on Culture Artistic choiceBonus Are there any prerenaissance works that do read like a modern novel Especially interested in ancient works but I know most of our surviving ancient writings are treatise like Platos  letters like Ciceros  and Plays Uggg Cant stand reading a play Watch it sureDouble Bonus What do you suppose an ancients reaction would be to a modern narrative Say If Doctor Who accidentally dropped his Latin copy of The Game of Thrones Would the be more likely to appreciate our descriptionheavy style where the narrator lives in the head of his characters or would he likely find it too much Edit Spelling,Narrative Detail in the Ancient world,1

UrbisPreturbis,16,23,1qrjqy,80,I wrote a detailed response to a question that was rightly deleted by the someone I hope by the mods because it was a possible flamewar bonanza In any case I thought it might be a useful answer for someone because it is relatively detailed and I put some input into it It deals with why Slavs in todays Republic of MacedoniaFYROM consider themselves Macedonians or rather the process of their national genesisWell there are multiple contested claims to Macedonia as a name as well as a region You have to be more specific what you mean by the name itself Macedonia as a name for a province was really constructed at the same time as national groups in the Balkans emerged  the late th and early th century At the time it was a product of often romantic and sometimes Orientalist visions of mainly local Enlightenment elites and adventurers and travelers from Britain France etc Now while there was an ancient state of Macedon which was Greek speaking in antiquity the origin of todays use of the name has little to do with some type of continuity The Byzantine province of Macedonia for example was in the location of todays central ThracehttpwwwzonucomimagesXTheByzantineEmpireinpng while Thrace was the hinterland of Constantinople So its important to note that the name and the location it was associated with shifted in history There are multiple claims to the name but the most common one emerges from the historical struggle against the Ottoman empire in the late th and early th century Multiethnic but largely Slavic at the time many of them considered themselves Bulgarian revolutionaries sought to overthrow the Ottoman Empire and establish either an independent state or a federation of states regions communes in the region This was the Macedonian Struggle a conflict that pitted both powers at the time external to the region Greeks Bulgarians Serbs and local Ottoman authorities against the revolutionaries It lasted in multiple phases from the s until  extending partially to the Balkan Wars in Different Greater Serbia Greece Bulgaria projects laid claims on an undifferentiated Macedonian territory where ethnic groups saw themselves as hybrid and undetermined For example in the s in the struggle for the establishment of an independent Bulgarian Church the Exarchate which was in many ways a proxy for national struggles it was highly difficult to establish the distinction between Greek and Slavic populations as well not finding space for such diverse groups as Aromanians Muslims Turkish and Slavic speaking Jews Roma etc In this atmosphere the idea of Macedonism separate from these state projects emerged as a contested identity For some it meant the establishment of a Slavic state in the region that would spearhead a large social revolution For others it meant an autonomous Macedonia within the Ottoman Empire that would encompass all faiths and languages This is best viewed in the transformation of the VMRO the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Oganization from a Bulgarian organization to that which would encompass all groupsnationalities The VMROs slogan Macedonia for Macedonians accompanied declarations for the unity of all peoples against Ottoman occupation This organization was also sometimes infiltrated by another organizaiton the Supremists which was based out of Sofia and supported the annexation of Macedonia to Bulgaria VMRO however remained largely independist as well as supported by local Slavs who at the time comprised a large part of the population of todays Greek Macedonia as well They did not exist in a vacuum however as no linguistic group held absolute sway and many people spoke multiple languages in fact sometimes even at home People might speak Greek and Turkish at the shop Aromanian with a fellow merchant Slavic to a peasant or another merchant Greek with one son who studied at a Greek school and Slavic with another who studies at a BulgarianSerbian school Together with that they might now a bit of Ladino to speak with Jews in MonastirBitola and Salonica a bit of French etcSo as you can see Macedonism or the idea that Macedonians were a separate people created out of their struggles against Ottoman domination became an important component in the national narrative of Slavic Macedonians This is why one of the largest parties in Macedonia today has the name VMRODPNE This idea of a regional becoming national identity was further fused with Slavic overtones by the Hellenization of Aegean Macedonia todays Greek Macedonia which accompanied the movement of Anatolian refugees into the region in the s as well as the latter Greek Civil War of the late s which pitted multiethnic communist units against Greek nationalist state units In this sense Aegean Macedonia became firmly Greek or associated with Greek identity particularly with the removal or assimilation of most of the other linguistic groups living there Jews in the Holocaust Muslims in the Population Exchange Slavs and Aromanians in gradual Hellenization etc At the same time Vardar nothern Macedonia which is todays Republic of MacedoniaFYROM became part of Serbia and later Yugoslavia while Pirin eastern Macedonia became part of Bulgaria In RoMFYROM Serbianization policies were largely unsuccessful in the interwar period and partisancommunist struggle countered them by returning to this separate Macedonian identity celebrating the Ilinden uprising by the VMRO etc This identity became indisputably exclusively Slavic by the late s in order for the local population to distinguish themselves from both Serbs and Bulgarians In this process of national genesis Slavic Macedonian identity became deeply separated as a constitutive nationality of the Yugoslav federation and linked to the struggle against Ottoman domination which was then connected to struggles against the Nazi occupation as well With Yugoslav president Titos withdrawal of support for Greek communists in  and the disappearance of possibility of a Balkan federation Macedonian identity was firmly entrenched into the Slavic population Thus a geographic designation in many ways gradually over the course of the late th and the first half of the th century became a specific ethnonational designationI can only speak about the breakup of Yugoslavia briefly because of the nature of this sub but basically when Yugoslavia brokeup this identity became a foundingstone for the FYROMRoM modern political culture Contested by surrounding nationalists Bulgarians Serbs Greeks Slavic politicians and citizens of the state saw this identity and the name associated with it as a useful tool in establishing the new nationstate This is becoming moreandmore of a problem today because of certain changes taking place in the narrative but this is outside the scope of this subredditI firmly recommend this fantastic book by Anastasia Karakasidou Fields of Wheat Hills of Blood Passages to Nationhood in Greek Macedonia Its really a great introductory work to the history of this complex region,Roots of Macedonism as a national ideology  response to deleted question,103
