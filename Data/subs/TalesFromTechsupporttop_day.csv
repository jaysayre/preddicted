jooiiee,28,43,1rpivn,96,I am on paper a student in a school that specializes in IT and that lets students that have the knowledge help with IT related things During my ½ years at this school I have helped with rouge DHCP servers several times WiFi overhauls server builds installs and fixes Nobody in house knows nix network redesigns and a fair share of both student and teacher laptop issues and troubleshooting  IE I have had a lot experience and everybody knows me and talks to me if they need help including the principals Every year we have about  new students starting that gets a brand new laptop This is usually not a problem and the first interaction I have with said laptop is when I borrow one to see the specs of them but this year that was not the case This year some smart fella decided to without notice give us active directory connected computers I heard this day two of the term when the principal old tech and teacher spoke about students not having logins and since we study windows server I instantly told them that this would be a problem The answer I got was that the central IT department was promising that it would be safe and that they would have local admin so they can install software and they would not be able to sign in on one another computersA few days go by and we finally get the accounts for our  affected users to the email of the local so called PC tech He printed the lists and put them in his room while we gathered our forces two d grade students to start giving them out to the students that for a week had not been able to use their brand new computers But do you think we got the lists when we got there No we did not But this story is not about how the the so called PC tech prioritized a single d grade student that broke his computer the day before over  students that has not been able to use their computers for a week Or how he yelled at me when I told him to re prioritize This story is about something worse After we distributed the logins to the students doing our best to make sure the right student got the right account I said I did not thrust the system and asked for a testing system and was promptly given one As it turns out everything that central IT had said was wrong and I had to go in to the principals office close the doors pull the curtain and explain that the students could use their own logins to gain full admin on all of the computers Including all of the teachers computers And all of the principals computers And then showed him on his own computer when I accessed his files The alarm bells rung and a few scary days later central IT had fixed the AD so students could not log in with admin right on teachers computers any more We could finally breath again But fear not the story is not over yet Remember I told you the school specializes in IT Its only a matter of time before the students try hacking each other something that is not a problem in it self as long as they play nice and so far they have always done that Ye old hosts file patch and desktop background prank the stuff you did when you were young But remember that they can use their own credentials to log in to other laptops with full admin privileges and not only prank when the computer is left unlocked Not that very good Once again central IT promised a solution and last week I heard the solution was done Note that the first issues were in august but all has been fine and only the nice students have figured out what they can do with their friends laptops but I did not trust the solution again so I grabbed my testing laptop once again and checked if their solution worked It did not and resulted in a new email to central IT telling them to get their shit together since it was broken This may seem crazy but this is just bad IT and bad IT is not what this subreddit is about This subreddit is about the absolutely horrible act from the local so called PC tech to central IT after he was CCd in a mail earlier today where they asked for help with testing if they had fixed it This was his response it central IT gt Hello NAMEgt gt Sorry I could not answer your mail earlier I have been on vacation th november And after that I have had still have lots of stuff to do regarding student laptop issues cases and lots of stuff on the janitorial front gt gt New things come from the central IT department all the time that we on the school have to adapt to and that really takes from the active worktime in all sorts of ways gt gt I will try to dedicate time to this in the beginning of next week and see what is new then gt gt Have a nice weekend No that is how he writes I just translated it from swedish The best part The so called PC tech has no idea what AD is and how it works so he does not understand the problem As a effect of that the issue was not on his table This issue has taken a total of  minutes of his time that he has spent reading the emails that he was CCd in and that is the only thing he had to do But he just lashed out against the guys that tried to fix our problem HOW THE FUCK WHAT I DONT EVEN HE WORKS IN IT WHATI would not expect better from a regular user but this guy does it support himself What Oh and this is also the guy that told me you have to be hard and mean against the support agents to get what you want I was nice and calm and got exactly what I wanted but that was above his understanding TLDR Of course he did it was a rhetorical question ,1385732227.0,Did he just send angry emails to central IT because they are trying to fix our

samuraitechnician,13,18,1rourb,101,I worked for a large multinational telecommunications firm a long long time ago We worked with the local telcos to get customers data from here to there We worked with T lines k leased lines ISDN and satellite reception We dealt with modems and multiplexers Packet switching was the latest and greatest thing with HDLC and X Componentlevel work consisted of reprogramming eeproms in the packet assemblerdisassembler PAD and replacing bad diodes and caps Everything else was plug and play or card swappingOne time a handful of the field technicians from around the country were chosen to form a team for a media project We converged at the hotel and partied with the managers and a good time was had by all The first day on the remote site consisted of orientation planning and cablingethernet Yay Something new to learnSamurai your job is to terminate the ethernet cables with this RJ crimper You know the color codeYup I said proudly I wasnt yet really a samuraitechnicianI was skinny and youthful but I knew enough and I wanted to impress the managers I knew the color code in my sleep I could recite it forwards and backwards and on this particular day I could do it hungover I never handled a crimper but I assumed it was just like punching down a  or  so whats to know I wired all  ends of all the runs with BlueWhiteBlue OrangeWhiteOrange GreenWhiteGreen and whatever was laststraight throughMind you this is a remote project We are all miles from home and everything was prepackaged and shipped by our companys technical centerNeedless to say there were intermittent problems It was hard to diagnose and the managers were on the phones with the engineers for hours until it came down tomeWhat did you doUm Everything Ive done up to this point was always with premade cablesFortunately there were enough RJ plugs to cover my blunder and I learned TA and hey Look T pinout is almost the same Whaddya know,1385699825.0,Never assume even if you have to impress,119,TalesFromTechsupport,top_day
jooiiee,28,45,1rpivn,94,I am on paper a student in a school that specializes in IT and that lets students that have the knowledge help with IT related things During my ½ years at this school I have helped with rouge DHCP servers several times WiFi overhauls server builds installs and fixes Nobody in house knows nix network redesigns and a fair share of both student and teacher laptop issues and troubleshooting  IE I have had a lot experience and everybody knows me and talks to me if they need help including the principals Every year we have about  new students starting that gets a brand new laptop This is usually not a problem and the first interaction I have with said laptop is when I borrow one to see the specs of them but this year that was not the case This year some smart fella decided to without notice give us active directory connected computers I heard this day two of the term when the principal old tech and teacher spoke about students not having logins and since we study windows server I instantly told them that this would be a problem The answer I got was that the central IT department was promising that it would be safe and that they would have local admin so they can install software and they would not be able to sign in on one another computersA few days go by and we finally get the accounts for our  affected users to the email of the local so called PC tech He printed the lists and put them in his room while we gathered our forces two d grade students to start giving them out to the students that for a week had not been able to use their brand new computers But do you think we got the lists when we got there No we did not But this story is not about how the the so called PC tech prioritized a single d grade student that broke his computer the day before over  students that has not been able to use their computers for a week Or how he yelled at me when I told him to re prioritize This story is about something worse After we distributed the logins to the students doing our best to make sure the right student got the right account I said I did not thrust the system and asked for a testing system and was promptly given one As it turns out everything that central IT had said was wrong and I had to go in to the principals office close the doors pull the curtain and explain that the students could use their own logins to gain full admin on all of the computers Including all of the teachers computers And all of the principals computers And then showed him on his own computer when I accessed his files The alarm bells rung and a few scary days later central IT had fixed the AD so students could not log in with admin right on teachers computers any more We could finally breath again But fear not the story is not over yet Remember I told you the school specializes in IT Its only a matter of time before the students try hacking each other something that is not a problem in it self as long as they play nice and so far they have always done that Ye old hosts file patch and desktop background prank the stuff you did when you were young But remember that they can use their own credentials to log in to other laptops with full admin privileges and not only prank when the computer is left unlocked Not that very good Once again central IT promised a solution and last week I heard the solution was done Note that the first issues were in august but all has been fine and only the nice students have figured out what they can do with their friends laptops but I did not trust the solution again so I grabbed my testing laptop once again and checked if their solution worked It did not and resulted in a new email to central IT telling them to get their shit together since it was broken This may seem crazy but this is just bad IT and bad IT is not what this subreddit is about This subreddit is about the absolutely horrible act from the local so called PC tech to central IT after he was CCd in a mail earlier today where they asked for help with testing if they had fixed it This was his response it central IT gt Hello NAMEgt gt Sorry I could not answer your mail earlier I have been on vacation th november And after that I have had still have lots of stuff to do regarding student laptop issues cases and lots of stuff on the janitorial front gt gt New things come from the central IT department all the time that we on the school have to adapt to and that really takes from the active worktime in all sorts of ways gt gt I will try to dedicate time to this in the beginning of next week and see what is new then gt gt Have a nice weekend No that is how he writes I just translated it from swedish The best part The so called PC tech has no idea what AD is and how it works so he does not understand the problem As a effect of that the issue was not on his table This issue has taken a total of  minutes of his time that he has spent reading the emails that he was CCd in and that is the only thing he had to do But he just lashed out against the guys that tried to fix our problem HOW THE FUCK WHAT I DONT EVEN HE WORKS IN IT WHATI would not expect better from a regular user but this guy does it support himself What Oh and this is also the guy that told me you have to be hard and mean against the support agents to get what you want I was nice and calm and got exactly what I wanted but that was above his understanding TLDR Of course he did it was a rhetorical question ,1385732227.0,Did he just send angry emails to central IT because they are trying to fix our
