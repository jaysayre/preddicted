NotACEO,180,227,1rdpxf,928,Heres a relatively short tale today folksIve posted here a few times before and it should bear mentioning that Im a bank teller and have been for  years  My story takes me back to when I first started working as a TellerI had gone through the mandatory day supervised portion of my training and apparently passed with flying colors and was shortly given my own drawer and station within the bank  I was technically under the  day Probationary stage but for all intents and purposes I was a fullfledged employee  Two weeks go by and Im steadily getting more and more comfortable  Any mistakes I made were small and easy fixes until I made a rather large mistake and very nearly shat my pantsA customer walks in hands me his  payroll check and says hed like to deposit it into his account  All right no problem heres your receipt have a nice day  He leaves and thats that  Or so I thought  About  minutes later my supervisor walks up with a piece of paper and says Hey NotACEO did you help this guy a few minutes agoWhen I acknowledge that I did in fact help him with this deposit my supervisor calmly tells me to access this guys account and to tell him if I noticed anything off  So I didand immediately noticed something wrong  Theres a small portion of our teller screens that tells us if there is any activity in that account for the current dayI can see if hes been to the grocery store a gas station or if hes made any deposits  Sitting in the Deposit section iswait for ita deposit made  minutes ago for the nice little sum of   With my teller signature on itRead that sentence above again for me would youI deposited one hundred million dollars into this guys account when it only should have been  dollarsNoticing what I did makes my heart rate skyrocket and the words Ohshitohshitohshit start to fly about in my mind  Im currently trying to think of various ways that I can commit suicide when my dear old teller supervisor starts laughing at me  He affectionately calls me an idiot and carefully walks me through in deleting the transaction and replacing it with the correct amount which I had been completely unaware that we could do up until that pointTurns out I had entered the customers ACCOUNT number in the DOLLAR section which it automatically assumed was the amount deposited  Management thought it was hilarious and had initially meant to make me sweat bullets for a while before telling me how easy it was to fix but apparently I looked like I was legitimately about to have a heart attack so they took pity on meOops,1385336644.0,Oh manIm gonna get fired arent I An Amusing Screwup on My Part,1155,talesFromRetail,top_week

diinomunster,72,108,1rcku1,402,Hello my lovelies I had a wonderful pa shift Friday into Saturday at my lovely gas stationCStore Im a softy who just cant say no This offense happened around am Now my gas station is in a really dumb place Were in the main Highway of our city which is why were a  store but were in an upper middle class neighborhood right by the middle and high school I dont see much traffic between midnight and four am That is until some shitty little dive bar called Shotz opened up somewhere behind us Somewhere because theres a huge parking lot behind us that situates a Kmart a pizza Hut a burger restaurant a funeral home yeah idk either and then the bar is somewhere in that mess So anyway between  amp  I get a nice hour of drunks Our local police force is always really nice They know that its either me  lbs female or J scrawny but seriously awesome little white guy working alone I work the weekends so I get the worst drunk traffic The officer who has our district has taken to sitting in the high school parking lot across the street during this hour with their headlights trained on our store I seriously give these guys so much free coffee The usual weekend officer stopped in and introduced his ride along that he had fresh out of the Academy Super nice guy Gave them coffee and a bag of donuts I was about to toss we get them fresh every day so they arent dried out if they were bagged and thanked them when they said theyd be keeping an eye out for me Around ish they had nabbed a drunk driver yay team and I was watching them do the field check stuff from across the street Now a quick inside to give you an idea of our store layout Im on my phone but will make a crappy picture in paint later and post it in an edit The cashier area is right smack in the middle of the store When you walk in theres the newspaper stand and the back counter area to your right coffee to your left and if you go waaaay left our bathrooms are down a little hall You have to walk around to your right following the counters to leave through the exit door This is so you cant sneak out behind us and steal something Queue am I have a college guy vomiting in the bathroom and a super nice guy whos browsing our snack food quietly In comes this super drunk middle aged black male He starts hanging on the newspaper stand and trying to climb over the back counter wall its about  feet high He will be Drunk Guy DG DG Hey How much for a cab to Menomininity I assumed menominee which is a city maybe twenty minutes from us Me Im not sure We can call a cab and ask Do you have a certain cab company you like to use DG just look some numbers up for me on the Internet Me I dont have the Internet here I have a phone book though you can borrow Please note this was NOT the answer he was looking for DG NIGGA FUCK YOUR PHONE BOOK Yeah Okay He proceeded to grab my newspaper stand and throw it behind him into the coffee counter and started storming off towards the bathrooms On his way he took out the fruit stand the magazine rack and the little employee break table in the hallway Drunk college kid comes tearing out of the bathroom That black guy grabbed me by the jacket pulled me out of the stall then ripped your toilet paper dispenser off the wall and threw it at me Uhh What The nice guy has been quietly picking up all the scattered fruit despite me telling him he didnt have to because I have to throw it all away anyway insists hell stay until this guy leaves Me Yeah I dont have the time for this Im just calling the police I get on the phone with none emergency explain my situation and ask if officer X can send his ride along over just to help keep this guy in control until another officer can come in Not even a minute later RideAlong is jogging across the street as officer X is piling the drunk driver in his back seat and I guess radioing the location for another officer DG comes out of the bathroom all sheepish and apologetic And then he sees the officer DG AW THE FUCK YOU YOU DIRTY ASS SKANK WHORE BITCHthe officer calmly cuffs DG who surprisingly didnt fight I sell nice guy some candy and put his coffee on my nightly expense College kid dipped out at some point I think he was underaged A second officer shows up and runs the drunk guys info as Im talking to RideAlong for my statement Turns out DG has a warrant out on him in North Carolina for skipping out on parole His friends apparently got tired of his drunk ass and left him at the bar Apparently Shotz has been doing last call at  like normal but then locking their restrooms so drunks cant hang out in there and they can clean them and leave faster They also havent been letting the drunk patrons use their phone For both things they explain that there is a gas station open about a block away with bathrooms and a phone Yeah Screw them DG got hauled off I burned a copy of the security footage for the officer and clean everything up The DM lives down the road so he stopped in for his deer hunting coffee and snacks and was pretty livid when I explained the situation I guess he knows the owner of the bar and gave him a call about his bartenders I thankfully had last night and tonight off so Ill see next weekend if our drunk flow is any better Well its bed time Sorry for the sleepy rambling Good night TFREDIT Heres that layout I promised look at my awesome gas

Tufty,35,59,1rdse5,308,This is a story from long long ago that I am copying from another website that I posted it to before discovering Reddit I thought you all might enjoy itThis happened a while ago but it just popped into my head so Im gonna do my best to remember itI used to work nights on the checkout of a  hour supermarket Now in this particular store there were certain things that you couldnt do on the checkout without a managers key and a code generally anything that would change the total by more than  including voiding items would require you to call a managerSince we worked nights they gave the key and the code to  women who worked on the cigarette kiosk because they had worked there for a long time there was always at least one of them working and they didnt want us bothering the on duty night manager every time there was any mistake All worked fine normallyUntil the day that neither of these women were in Did the management organise anyone else who had a code to be in the area Did they buggeryThere were  of us working that night and the other  were quite new on the department We did our best but I was the first to go down A customer had read the price on a baby stroller wrong and wanted it voided I put a call out for the on duty manager then apologised to the people in my line and explained that it might take a couple of minutes The line wasnt very long because it was getting quite late There was a little grumbling but everyone seemed fairly understanding minutes pass I put out another call for the manager to come down URGENTLY I advise everyone to start going through the other  tills I am starting to get worried but we still have  tills running so its not the end of the world The lines get longerThen one of the other girls accidentally scans something through twice It happens the scanners sometimes just glitch The item cost more than  and bam  checkouts are locked down I direct people through the lone surviving till The poor girl on there was clearly struggling but there was nothing else to be done I get hold of a store phone and call the manager directly No answer I call again Nothing I put another call out over the speakers Apologise to all customersThen it happens The last till goes down Another double scan The line is  people deep And this is at midnight when its odd to have more than  customer at a time I try to call the manager again Nada I call a team leader explain the problem and beg him to find me a manager any manager I turn to the ever increasing group of customers and do my best to explain whats going on I am practically on my knees begging them for forgiveness Some fo them have been waiting for  minutes I break from the script and try to explain as a human being that there isnt anything I could do I wish there was something anything I could do We cant open any other tills They are all shut down and even if I had the key to turn them on all of our log ins are locked into these tillsFinally someone saunters to the tills They arent a manager They had been sent down by the on duty manager because he had heard that we had too many customers and needed another checkout operator Im getting frantic I send her back to find the managerTime passes People have been waiting for over half an hour now and you can imagine what that looks like Thankfully none of the customers are directing their anger at us but they are all very very angryEventually the manager turns up All good right NopeHe takes one look at the scene And walks away The customers see my face Now they know what the manager looks likeThere is more of the same Frantic phone calls announcements over the speakers Ten minutes that feel like an eternity later the manager calmy walks back into sight and immediately gets collared by the crowd The only good thing that came out of this moment was when several customers took time out of their ranting to defend me it seems my pleas for forgiveness workedThe manager is barely listening to the poor people He keeps interrupting them trying to push blame off of himself This was the first he had heard of the situation Luckily all of the customers had seen me doing everything possible to get hold of him The manager eventually rolls his eyes and wanders off to the office to pick up the keysA full  minutes after the last till went down we finally got the code and unlocked the tills Did the manager apologise to the customers Nope Did he offer them anything to make up for the wait Nope Did he apologise to us working on the checkouts for putting us through all that Take a guessAs I rang through the customers I did everything in my meager power to make it up to them It wasnt much but I would accept any coupon they had even if they werent for our store I would accidentally mistype the reduction codes to give them more money off If something wouldnt scan Id just pretend I hadnt noticed and give it to them I knew it would mess up the inventory and probably get me in trouble but I just didnt care at this point When we cleared the line I sent the other  girls off for a break and told them to take an extra few minutes while they were at it When they were gone and I was sure I was alone I spent a minute or two hiding under the till whimpering ,1385338587.0,Cashiers Nightmare,367,talesFromRetail,top_week
GlowingBall,43,78,1rioer,300,These are my Tales of Retail Loss PreventionPart Three  Citizen Snips Aka  The Pants AquaticAs a recap for those of you who have never read one of my stories before  I am a male in the midwest who is on the wrong side of his twenties and works retail loss prevention for a major retailer one of the Big   I am underpaid for what I do but enjoy my job none the less  A majority of my time is spent wandering the floor or watching middle aged moms shop for clothing far too skimpy on them via CCTV closed circuit television or security cameras  Every once in awhile I get a case that is just so mind blowingly WTF that I have to share  This story opens up with me doing just as I said above  watching people on CCTV  It is a blisteringly cold afternoon so the customers far more content to stay in their warm homes and snuggled beneath their blankets are few and far between  I as the ever watchful hawk of justice that I am was busy playing a Marvel version of Candy Crush Saga  My job provides me the liberty of slacking off a good amount and my boss is rather lenient as long as I continue to bring in a good amount of stops per month  I am sitting there diligently trying to match up small colored tiles with one another when I am startled by a sudden ring  the phone is going off  Now the phone going off is common place  We get tons of calls a day ranging from the frozen dairy department calling to tell us a temperature alarm is going off we knowit goes off for us as well to people asking us to deactivate a door alarm we also knowwe see you standing at the door  This happened to be a call from one of the few places that doesnt call us often  the meat department  The guy on the other end a tall black man with more muscle than he knows what to do with calls to tell us that there is a guy standing in front of the freshly butchered meat  The guy has refused any help the meat employee has offered and continues to say he is just browsing for over ten minutes  This strikes me as rather odd  Who just hangs out around the meat department  I quickly devise a plan for the situation  I tell the employee to walk into the back so I could see just what the person was going to do  The employee hangs up and walks over to the man to let him know he is going to be into the back and to ring the bell if he needs anything  No sooner than when he had walked into the back but the man glanced around and then walked behind the counter  My adrenaline already began to rush as my suspicions came to fruition  he was going to steal  Oh shit here we go  I declared only to watch in confusion and frustration as he walked right past all the glass displays full of meat and right over to the lobster tank  Now if you arent familiar with these tanks they are exactly just what the name implies  a water filled tank full of live lobsters we sell by the pound  Their claws are bound and they just kind of hang out crawling all over one another  Kids love to sit there and watch themNo wayis he really going to I whispered as I watched on in awe  Sure enough he reached right into the live lobster display tank we have  After a moment of fishing around he plucked the lobster he wanted from the tank and pulled it out of the water  Before I could even make heads or tails of the situation he glanced around once more and shoved the lobster right down the front of his pants  The guy whom shall be hence forth called Lobster Johnson then proceeded to shuffle run his way out of the meat department and through the grocery department towards the front of the store  The only way I can really describe how he ran was a forward version of Zoidbergs shuffle  All he was missing was yelping out Woop woop woop woop loudly as he went  Needless to say he wasnt too hard to stop  I may not be in the best shape of my life but I can still move quicker than a guy with a large lobster squirming around in his pants  He didnt fight me at the door or even try to argue what he was doing  After all it is kind of hard to argue that you arent stealing when you have a large lobster shaped bulge in your pantsBonus icing on top of the cake I usually ask the person why they are stealing  It usually wont change anything but it fulfills my curiosity and keeps them talking which usually calms them down a bit  This guy tried to say that he was stealing the lobster for his kidsHis kids have some expensive tastes,1385496989.0,Loss Prevention Tales Pt   Citizen Snips,378,talesFromRetail,top_week

arsci,56,36,1ren2b,225,All of the talk of black Friday brought up some good memories one of which involves two kids and a rather large gun safe Its kind of a long one but hopefully you all enjoy itA little background I work for a large national farm and ranch supply chain that sells a large variety of items including gun safes This particular story takes place the day after black friday of last year We have several models of these gun safes on the sales floor for customers to see with the largest at the time being an Canon Armory gun safe This thing was MASSIVE compared to the rest of our stock Our store only ever had  of them they never had an official SKUwe had to ring them under the generic merchandise SKU we had them for over a year and after we sold out we never saw them again Now all the safes are electronic keypad and locked by default from the manufacturer but they all ship with the same combination  Most people know this from either asking us to see inside the safes or by just guessing It was no secret and we encourage people to take a good lookIt was the evening and we were working on getting the store cleaned up after a very hectic day Not very many customers were left in the store and things were winding down I was working on restocking the feed when I saw the assistant manager walk by and he looked PISSED And not just end of black friday pissed but someone done fucked up pissed so I went to casually investigate only to find him talking to this giant safe Literally ear to the door asking if it was doing alright Maybe not to the safe but to the person stuck INSIDE the safe Uh Oh Things start running through my headwhy didnt he just unlock it HOW did a person get locked in it Then he pulls me asideAssistant Manager We have a situationMe A situationAM Yes a kid just locked his brother in the gunMe Soo why dont we unlock itAM It wont unlock I think the battery died but I replaced it and its still not workingMe How did he end up locked in itAM His brother apparently Hes over hiding in the feed racks last I saw Not sure where the parents are they havent made an appearance yetI went over and tried it myself and sure as crapits locked And this kid is FREAKING out for obvious reasons We tried a couple other batteries with no luck and even tried swapping the keypad out with the one from the other gun with no luck The parents FINALLY realized their kids were MIA and started asking around and very quickly we determined the kid in the safe was theirs We had taken out the power access port from the pack and passed the kid a flashlight so he could calm down a little and after swapping the keypads out and a fourth set of batteries we called in for backup Assistant Manager called the police while another employee called the safe company to see if there was another way into the safeAfter about half an hour had gone by and the fire department was about ready to cut the back off of it to get the kid out we find out from the safe manufacturer that there is a  minute lockout on the keypadif the battery dies or is removed you cant touch it for  minutes after putting the battery back in So after  long agonizing minutes of listening to this hag of a woman yell at us for not taking enough precautions the safe OPENED And this  year old kid I repeat FIFTEEN YEAR OLD KID comes bolting out of this safe straight into his mothers arms and both of them are sitting of the floor breaking down in tears The police and fire department left pretty quick after that but after the woman and her kid calmed down she UNLOADED on us Complaining about precautions safety how we need to be more responsible and how corporate needs to handle things differently Eventually we stopped herAM Maam your kid walked up to the safe entered in the combination himself that he got FROM YOU and opened the safe Your other child WILLINGLY stepped into the safe and at the exact moment he did the battery died At this point the brother closed and locked the door And its our fault for not taking enough precautionsEventually the woman and her kids left No policies changed except when we give out the combination we use her children as an example of what not to do Gives us all a good chuckle Every couple months she calls and identifies her self as the person whose kid got locked in the safe Usually shes prying to know if weve changed our policies we havent then asks for a discount on whatever she seems to be in need of which she doesnt get Oddly enough its been another year and weve had no incidents of kids locking their siblings in safes Heres to surviving another Black Friday,1385367211.0,Two kids and the gun safe,261,talesFromRetail,top_week
morgueanna,27,59,1rkwmz,211,So I worked at the Goth store for millenia as most of you know already This was probably a decade ago now Im not quite sure what part of holiday season this was but the store was jam packed wall to wall and as the floor manager Im running around like a chicken with my head cut off Suddenly I hear the security alarm at the door go off Theres a woman with a teen girl and two HUGE bags of stuff I rush over groaning internally because its not like I think she stole something but if theres a sensor tag left on a clothing item that would super suck for wrapping as a giftI start going through the first bag feeling all the items for a chunky hard plastic surface while the lady and her daughter look on Note she has her daughter with her and hasnt said anything to me None of the clothing in either bag has a sensor but then I feel the slim jewel case of a CD AHA I pull it from the bag and as I do the woman freaks the fuck out on me She starts screeching that it was supposed to be a surprise The daughters eyes lit up when she saw the title and my heart just dropped OopsSure you could say the woman overreacted You could say that she should have sent her daughter out of the store to finish the transaction All of that is true But from that point on if the alarm went off and it was a parent I asked them to step to the desk so I could go through the bag discreetly in case there were any surprises Its hard to remember that sometimes the customer just expects you to come up with solutions like that for them As mean as they are they also just stand there like sheep waiting to be told what to do instead of offering vital information So keep that in mind and OVER HELP everyone so you dont feel bad like I did for the next few days over that one,1385570583.0,Just remember during the holiday season you WILL mess something big up So heres an example and keep your chin high this Black Friday,270,talesFromRetail,top_week
Scott,20,54,1riony,209,Ive met a lot of strange customers in my time at the casino This guy takes the cake as the most fuckedup unpleasant guy thats ever darkened our doorstep Well call him Dick because he is oneTo begin with Dick is in the casino for a fuckedup reason Hes dying of cancer or some other terminal disease He spends his last days in our casino trying to win an inheritance for his children Of course mathematics says its not going to happen so hes squandering what money he does have and the remainder of his life sitting in a smoky room with no natural light playing  per spin on a slot machine I wouldnt judge him so harshly for that if he wasnt a colossal asshole Pretty much everyone who has had to pay a jackpot for him has some sort of unpleasant experience to share Mine was when I was processing a jackpot for him and I go to clear the jackpot message from the screen See if you win say  and you had  in credit when you hit it when the attendant clears the jackpot your  will still be left on the machine People sometimes forget or dont know this and will leave the money on the machine and walk away so after clearing it most of us will say You still have  left on the machine Of course when I mention this to Dick he flies into a rage screaming I CAN SEE THAT GOD I started dodging his jackpots when I knew where he was playing after thatI dont put up with that sort of BSthough I still had to pay him out a couple of times after that because I didnt realize who it was And Dick did hit a lot of jackpots He would usually destroy the copy of the WG tax forms we would give him I guess thinking since hes dying he wont need to worry about paying taxes though you would think he would realize his kids would be on the hook for all of it He also had the tendency to swear ambiguously so you never really knew whether he was calling the machine or you a piece of shit Management had talked to him a couple of times about treating the attendants better He did tip the bare minimum to not be considered an ass in that department at leastAll of that is backstory to properly put in context what happened this week At this point Dicks managed to piss off enough attendants that most of the shift is dodging his calls so it takes him probably twice as long to get someone over there than it would anyone else This coupled with the fact that hes losing heavily pisses him off Management gets called over to a machine in my section Im generally pretty curious about these things so I head over there The machines touchscreen retail price quoted to me by a tech as  or so is totally shattered The machine still has  on itwith an inoperable touchscreen theres no way to cash that out on this machine Theres a patron further down the bank who saw the whole thing Said the guy was losing got pissed punched the screen threw a piece of paper down and stormed off One of the managers that showed up picks up the paperIts a tornup WG with Dicks name address and social security number on it A little bit of searching in the computers turns up copies of his driver license and the hotel room he is in And of course the whole incident is caught on tapeWe dont know what happened to Dick after that Apparently it became the responsibility of the casinos assistant general manager and she isnt talking Were all watching the usual locations for ban notices to go up though,1385497149.0,The worst casino patron in the world,263,talesFromRetail,top_week
prickelypear,26,29,1rf2t9,202,Ive lurked for a while and decided to share one of my experiences that I can rememberI used to work in a big name retail store in a college town we usually got a lot of college kids due to this obviously and they were generally pretty laid back customers But of course we got older customers as wellOne night I had a woman with her college aged son come through my line It was close to the beginning of a new semester and she was clearly buying him items to put in his dorm or apartment so he would be set for the school semester to come One of items was a basket it looked like wicker but I dont remember what it was exactly Either way when I rang it up it came up full price  and the woman stopped meWoman Thats supposed to be on sale why is it ringing up full priceMe Im not sure Ill get one of the girls from that department to come up and shell know whats going onWhile I ring the operator to get me one of the hard lines girls on the phone or to my till I can hear the woman going on about a Clearance aisle which this store doesnt have we would put little tags buy the price tag on the shelf that stated it was on sale and for how much and how this is so aggravating Finally one of the girls walks up and the woman explains to her that the basket was on the Clearance aisle and its ringing up full price and she knows it wasnt placed there by another customer because there were many of them there The girl from hard lines informs the woman we dont have a Clearance Aisle but she knows where the baskets are and she will go lookWhile we are waiting for the other girl to come back the lanes are backing up Other employees from the floor are coming up to open new tills and help with the load and everyone is displacing from my lane to others The other girl comes back and explains to the woman that the item is not on sale the sale tag was for the baskets next to this one its full price and walks off Woman to me Well he needs the basket for his clothesMe Okay and I start to place it in the bagging areaWoman No Im not paying that price for it I want it for the Clearance price You had it on the Clearance Aisle I want it for Clearance price I dont remember what she was saying the Clearance price was but it was far below the actual price Usually if its less than  we were told just give it to them and even sometimes if its  on something worth at least  But I believe she was saying it was supposed to be Me Maam we dont have a Clearance aisle the basket is full price and I dont have a way to lower it in my systemWoman Thats bullshit if you have it on the Clearance Aisle I should get the Clearance price and you can adjust the priceMe This store doesnt have a Clearance Aisle We have items on sale and they are marked to reflect that but this basket isnt one of themWoman No That basket was on the Clearance Aisle Everything on the shelf around that basket was on sale That one is too Im getting that basket but I am not buying  for it Where are the managers This is bullshit Im not dealing with you anymoreSo with the womans son looking more and more embarrassed by his mother as this goes I call up my manager explain the situation and she comes right up I know what you are thinking because it happens all the time manager comes to front to deal with ridiculous customer customer behaves like a child explaining the issue themselves and threatens all sorts of things manager gives them what they want and customer leaves smug Not this manager she always was my favorite She gets to my till listens to the of course now calm and smiling woman explain why she wanted the manager Woman So see the basket was on the Clearance Aisle but it rings up full price If its not on Clearance then it shouldnt have been place in that aisle and since that is where I got it with many of the same placed there and I need it I expect to get it for the Clearance priceManager Smiling at her We dont have a Clearance Aisle That basket is in the home section with the other baskets We have baskets on sale in that aisle they have tags marking them But this one isnt on sale If you would like to go pick out one of the ones on sale we can put off the transaction and you can go get oneWoman smile now gone and voice getting louder as she goes NO I will NOT go pick out another basket because of your mistakes I got this basket from the Clearance Aisle and I want it for the Clearance priceManager still calm and smiling Well seeing as we still dont have a Clearance Aisle the basket is full price We arent lowering it If you want the basket its  Otherwise we will remove the basket from the purchase you can pay for your other items and leaveWoman screaming at this point Im never coming back here again but Im not done with this yet This is ridiculous Im writing corporate about both of you and how you are trying to swindle your customers I will make sure you both lose your jobs You can keep this shit Im not buying ANY of itAnd with that she stormed off and out the door leaving her son to mutter Im so sorry and chase out the door after her and my manager yelling to have a nice day Before she left my manager grabbed the basket and said she would put it back and not to worry about the woman Nothing was going to happen And nothing did So much for not being done with it yet we didnt hear a thing about about her after that Her son did frequent the store thoughEDIT words and things ,1385390318.0,Im not DONE YET,231,talesFromRetail,top_week

InvdrZim,56,54,1rjww9,190,Obligatory first time post long time lurkerMy brief stint in retail was at a grocery store with a blue logo only sold groceries and the things that went with them I worked there for about six months I started as a bagger went to produce got fucked over by the produce manager went back to bagging moved to the deli quit for a job at my universitys helpdesk Somehow the store viewed me as a good employee even though by the time I was about done with the place my hatred was so great that I would actively avoid all work if possibleThis story is about a particular customer service manager who was probably the most unpleasant woman Ive ever dealt with she was perpetually hung over coworkers who were there longer than I tell me shes an alcoholic and theyve never seen her not hung over so Ill take their word for it Anyways She treated the baggers like shit sucked up to the store managers was rude to customers and ignored them multiple times to do something more important which I assume can only mean go to the break room for an hour and play on her phone which she did A lotThis takes place about two weeks before I left and a month after I just couldnt take it anymore and stopped caring So if I seem like a brash asshole its probably because I was being one Not the best thing to do in hindsight but I wasnt having any of their shit anymoreOn to the actual storyIt was Sunday our busiest day of the week still upset about being screwed out of working in the best department produce least amount of work for the night shift really chill coworkers who I still talk to its safe to say I wasnt in the best of moods did I let my emotions get the better of me Yeah theres no denying that one Was it worth it Very much so I think I left her speechlessNow we were shorthanded on baggers meaning some hadnt shown up for work when they were supposed to or were off doing who knows what in some corner of the store So there two or three of us covering nine registers A familiar and obnoxious buzzer starts going off One of the bottle machines is full and the bin needs to be swapped outHaving just finished bagging for a customer I tell my fellow baggers Ive got this and make my way towards the bottle room which involves walking past the Customer Service counter and the bitch manager who will be abbreviated as BM henceforthBM Where do you think youre goingMe Bottle room to swap out one of the binsBM Oh no youre not You stay up front and bagUtterly confused I turned around and resumed bagging now by this point it wasnt super busy and the relief cashiers had returned to their departments Yet the buzzer kept going And going And going I already knew the other baggers wouldnt do it because they really were far too lazy to bother with itSuddenly a shrill voice pierces the air coming to us via the intercomBM I need a bagger she spit out the word like it was moldy burnt food to go to the bottle roomOnce again I make my way over Once again she stops meBM Not you One of the other ones can do itHuhMe Theyre not going to do it and itll keep buzzing until someone goes Even if you tell them to they wontBM You cant be trusted Go back and bagAt this point I should mention that weve got an overflowing shelf of gobacks that need to get put away she wouldnt let me do that either And were still only an hour into my shiftBM Seeing me with a basket of gobacks I SAID STAY UP FRONT It wasnt exactly yelling but she was pretty damn closeMe Nothing is going to get done then And these are all frozens so they need to go back before theyre no goodBM I DONT CARE HAVE SOMEONE ELSE DO IT at this point she was yelling and heads were turningI put the frozen go backs on the Customer Service counter gave her a look of utter disapproval and went backFor the next hour it was dead in the store Weird for a Sunday but I didnt complain The buzzer was still going off the gobacks didnt get put away and BM was positively fuming She called me up to the front deskBM InvdrZim break Shes the only person in the store that called me by my legal first nameMe OkAs I walk away I hear her muttering something along the lines of Lazy fucking baggers getting breaks after not doing shit while Im up here busting my assI turn around and walk back up to the desk Im fuming theres no denying it Ive got my mothers temper so when I get mad I get madMe You spent the last hour up there sitting and playing around on your phone and you have the guts to call the baggers lazyBM You never do anything Weve got all this stuff to do and youre all too lazy to do itMe On multiple occasions I tried to get that stuff done Every time I tried you were hostile to me and told me to go back Its not my fault youre incompetentBM How dareAt that point I stopped listening I made my way over to the breakroom area punched out and walked right past her on my way out the door It felt great She was yelling at me the whole time I just ignored her and kept walkingWhy wasnt I fired Why wasnt she fired a long time ago for sucking at her job Well those are fair questions Where we work youre pretty much forced to be in the union which means you can be as terrible as you want at your job and still have it the next dayNext time I came it I was called to the managers officeM Whyd you clock out early yesterdayMe BM was being incredibly rude and unpleasant to me every time I tried to do something shed snap at me and tell me to go back to the front and bag even though there were no lines and all two of the registers that had customers had baggers on themThey left it at that My two weeks were put in very shortly after this incident which funnily enough was also shortly after they moved me to the deliLast I heard shes still working there and as

TRAVELVICTIM,29,44,1rk5uo,180,As a travel agent I work with a product that fluctuates in price almost by the minute Prices change almost as drastically and rapidly as stock prices do This is completely out of my control and at the sole discretion at the airline Which is why when this particular client called me on the day of our blow out sale  discount per booking and no I cant apply the discount  times because you are purchasing tickets for your three children Does your  year old have a credit card No Shes not getting a discount because she cant buy anything I spent four hours FOUR HOURS on the phone with this lady helping her find a flight for herself and her three kids over christmas I missed out on a lot of other business because of her Not only that her booking was on a discount I honestly believe in providing every client with an ideal experience so I did it with a smile and did everything i could to find her the cheapest option She asked me several times weather or not I though the price would go down or up to which I answered I doubted it would but I could not guarantee that the airline would not have a sale nor that the prices of the tickets would not increase She finally after taking up my ENTIRE DAY decided to make this booking Well of course three weeks later she calls my manger saying that the price has gone down hundreds of dollars and that I ripped her off I check the flights they have gone down not more than  per person My manager kindly explains that this is not my fault and that I have no control over this stuff The lady then writes a long winded letter to my customer service department she claims that I never told her the price of the flights and that I was taking advantage of her as a single mother I have never been so offended in my life Email after email she has sent I almost want her to get a refund so that when the price of the flight goes up I can call her and say sorry mam your ticket has gone up  you will need to pay the difference before you can fly The worst part is when someone writes a letter like this falsely slandering you to your employer they are not considering that you may lose your job and not be able to pay your rent Forget that you havent done anything wrong The fact is that for a shot in the dark at getting  a person whom I spent an entire day servicing and working with to ensure their happiness just created a huge scenario and risked my job so that they could possibly get enough cash to hit up a Chillis ,1385539090.0,And now for something completely ridiculous,224,talesFromRetail,top_week

MrDoctorSmartyPants,25,21,1rep4z,148,A little backstory I worked for a large and generic yet popular apparel retail store for a a little while right when I was getting out of high school I was rarely on the floor as a sales rep because I generally spent my day in the stock room going through endless stacks of shipment boxes however my managers loved the idea of me being on the floor because I am so outgoing and generally enjoy peopleto be quite honest I really enjoyed my time at this storeAll my managers were great it was in a very upscale shopping center so generally the customers were great and everyone I worked with was very cool I literally never had ANY problems with anyone that I worked withI guess it was kind of a utopian retail job  Now a little more background about my particular job responsibilitiesI was the stock room manager I was the person that met the truck at the back door at am every tuesday thursday and saturday  I was the one that printed off the delivery summary from the computer every night before the shipmentI knew how many boxes were coming I was the one responsible for counting each one of the boxes to make sure I got no more or no less than what was on the shipment invoice and I was the one responsible for processing all the shipment  In a nutshell I knew the stock room backwards and forwards knew what we had back there and what we didnt have because I unpacked it organized it and set up carts for employees on the floor to distribute in between helping customers There were rare occasions when  I would emerge victorious from the depths of the stock room having everything processed and put away and I would help out on the register or I would go find things in the stock room for associates on the floor and on occasion I would just help customers with whatever they neededThis particular day I was working the cash registers and a woman comes in who I had seen many times  She was a really nice lady and she even knew me by name because she had enjoyed our interaction on a previous trip to the store and had asked my name to brag to managers about me  A little about our return policyWith a receipt and tags on the clothes there was no time frame for returns  You can buy something put it in a closet for ten years decide you dont want it and bring it back  No problem  If you dont have a receipt and the tags are still on the clothes you can always return themthings stay in the system basically indefinitelybut if you dont have the receipt we scan the bar code and whatever comes up is what you get  If it says  bucks on the tag but comes up  cents you get  cents back  who knows what reduction stickers youve peeled off the tag  So all this being said here is my actual storyand I only remember this because in almost a year this is literally the only negative experience I ever had at this jobNice lady NL comes up to my register with a pair of bright red skinny jeans and drops them down on the counterNL Hi MrDoctorSmartyPants  How are you  I havent seen you the last few times Ive been in hereMe  It has been a while Im doing pretty gooddo you want to return these pants  Do you have your receiptNL I sure dont but Ive never taken the tags off of these as you can see so I can still return them rightMe Yep you sure can but unfortunately if you dont have your receipt I can only give you back what they ring up as and Im sure you bought these a while back because Ive never seen these in this store It should be noted the tag said  bucks for these particular pantsNL  Ok that is fine Ive dealt with that beforebut the tag says  dollars and just because I dont have my receipt doesnt mean I should be penalized and lose money on my purchaseMe I know you come here all the time but without a receipt we have no way to prove that you actually paid this amount for these pants we place stickers to denote sale prices over the original prices all the time and they are easily removed to look like they were never thereand to be honest with you in the time that Ive worked here since the store opened I have never seen these pants did you purchase them at another locationNL  Yes but that doesnt matter because I paid  for them like a year and a half ago and Ive never worn thembut lets just return them and see what I can get back for themMe ok lets seeat this point I scan the item and it comes up no shit at  Ok it says NL WHAT Thats robbery That CANT be rightMe Im afraid thats the best I can do for you I explained our policy and you said you understood  Ive returned things without a receipt for you beforeif I could give you more I wouldbut I cant and I dont have any of these pants in the store to verify a current price other than what the computer reads  NL Well this is absolutely unacceptable  You probably have some in the back that you can check for price so you can see how much these cost meI know the policy but this is a little differenti paid a lot for these pantsthis should be an exception  I want to see a managerMe Maam I am the stock manager I know everything in this entire store and I have never seen these pants beforeIm sure there are none in the back and I wish there was something I could do for you but I cant  Honestly this return policy is rooted in loss prevention and instances like this are the exact reason this policy existsNL Cant you just go look to make sure  Me Sure Ill do that for you  at this point i go in the back and out the back door for  minutes and smoke a cigarette and come back  Nope  We dont have any  what the computer shows is the best I can doNL NO I WANT TO SEE THE STORE MANAGER LESLIE WHERE IS SHEMe She isnt here today maamIm the only manager in the storeNL  Well call herMe I dont have her home number and Im not going to disturb her on a sunday over a cut and dry return policy issue  Im not making you return the pants Im not forcing you to take this moneyyou can keep the pantsNL  This is so stupidI cant believe youre treating me like this I come in here all the time You should make exceptions  Just give me my money and Ill be on my wayI dont want these stupid pantsMe Ok Maamhere you go   Im really sorry for your inconvenience have a nice dayNL  Yeah you ruined this nice day Wait until I talk to your managerI actually saw this lady a couple days later and my store manager and I were chatting in the middle of the store about somethingthe lady walked up and said hello was cordial and never so much as mentioned the incident from a few days prior  Sorry if this is so long it wasnt even that badit just stuck out in my mindTLDR Woman accepted return policy except for when it was going to lose her money and in that instance thought she deserved special treatment EVEN THOUGH she previously said whatever was fine,1385370544.0,Woman

slandeh,17,38,1rmmh5,146,More return stories This one happened fairly recently and it made me a little cheerful inside to have to deal with itBackstory I work in a electronics department at a larger department store Our staff is fairly shorthanded currently so our shifts typically are open to midday and the closer comes in to hand off keys and tills Because of this if I take a lunch I have to have another department watch my department while Im gone Furthermore I am required by state law to take a lunch by my fifth hour or the company can get a fineToday is another busy preBlackFriday day Ive been stressed all morning getting stuff ready for the sales that will be occurring and I am noticing that Im close to my fifth hour I try to pass off my keys to a department I always hand them off to but many of them are busy so I give the keys anyway and tell them to just make sure whoever helps the department knows what they are doing I head out to lunch and relax in the breakroomNo more than  minutes pass when I get a page Electronics associate please dial  Electronics  Knowing that there is no one who will respond to it I go to the breakroom phone and respond Hey its slAndeh Im on lunch Whats up A coworker in a softlines department responds Theres a guy here attempting to return a  inch TV he bought today because its damaged I know you guys have different procedures than us so I figured youd want to see this Ive got nothing better to do albeit Id rather not have to process a return on my lunch The bigger question I hadnt sold any  inch TVs today so how was this being returnedI head down to the department and see a man standing with a return slip in his hand Whenever an item too large to carry around is returned its taken to pickup and they give them a slip to let us know its received and OK to return I look at the slip nothing out of the ordinaryMe Why are we returning the TV todayMan The TV is broken and I need a new one I was hoping to get it in time for Thanksgiving so we can watch the football gameMe punching in the receipt code to see the full receipt Im sorry to hear that Unfortunately I dont have this TV anyway and I didnt sell any today Where did you get the TVMan Well I bought it at store located  minutes away and was taking it up north to visit family and get it set up I dont want to have to go back down to the other store since I have to be up north in an hourMe Ok well let me check on the TV first and see if we can just return it and order you one to pick up laterWe have to verify that the TV isnt physically damaged Note when the customer said it wasnt working I had assumed he meant it wouldnt power on or something My pickup associates hadnt been responding to my pages and I didnt have time to wait so I headed downstairs myself to look at the TV I get downstairs and have the receiving manager Marie help me open the box When we lift the box up I can see a huge crack along the corner indicative of a being pressed against something or slammed against a corner Marie mentions that he was driving a small Prius and she would have had him sign a waiver if he wanted them to load it into his PriusSidenote When a customer wants something loaded in their car and we are pretty sure the item wont fit without being damaged it is storecompany policy to have the customer sign a waiver saying that he agrees we sold and loaded the item in the car in working condition This prevents customers from getting a nice exchange for damaging product after the fact so we arent responsibleAfter seeing the TV I immediately headed upstairs to talk to the customer looking at my watch now that my lunch was more than rds overMe Sir do you remember if you signed any waiver for loading this TVMan No I dont remember signing anything at all WhyMe Well it seems they loaded the TV into a PRIUS Last I checked a  inch TV shouldnt be toted around in a Prius let alone carried over  milesMan Well what does that meanMe Well if the store didnt have you sign a waiver then they are responsible for taking back the TV for inability to follow procedures Both my managers have agreed that this TV shouldnt have left in a PriusI get on the phone and contact the store he purchased from and asked to talk to receiving The associate tells me they cant get in contact with receiving so I instead give her this lineMe Well I have a customer John Doe here who purchased a  inch TV from your store and is trying to return it because its damaged The man tried to have your guys load it into a Prius and didnt sign any waiver We are refusing to return and hes pretty upset that I dont have this TV in stock I see you guys have one so Ill let your managers decide if they want to exchange this TV or notI didnt bother to hear a response and simply covered the microphone and informed the customer that he needs to head back to the store if he wants a refund After ending the call with the store the customer walks back sullen that he may not be enjoying the game with his new TV Last wordsI guess I wont be heading up north today to show off my new TV,1385616645.0,Sir a inch TV will not fit in a

prettehkitteh,24,31,1rcsdq,142,Wall of Text coming tis the season and Im feeling inspired by all these insane posts about people losing their shit over things they dont need I worked in retail for five years off and on as a grocery store cashier so I never really experienced Black Friday  except one year when I got a temp job at a major toy store on the side I started my new job two days before this day of reckoning For some reason the managers thought it prudent to stick the new girl on the front line when the store opened at am I had barely gotten a chance to get familiar with the store layout and we had special areas where the really populardiscounted toys were set up the day before so I pretty much had no idea where anything wasWe didnt get the typical zombies clawing at the windows phenomenon but people were lined up and a few even knocked on the doors because it was snowing outside and they really wanted to get in early I watched with a giant knot in my stomach as my manager unlocked the doors and people nabbed carts and ran inside I was immediately flooded with shouted questionsWHERE ARE THE TICKLE ME ELMOSWHERE IS THE HOMOSAPIEN ROBOT I NEED IT FOR MY SONI NEED

because everyone wanted one I could not believe how many people wanted one I stayed up toward the entrance because I knew if I went into the main sales floor I would get eaten alive and after the initial rush for the first two hours people started being a little more polite though there was still a lot of running and shouting going on That was when crazy beard came inCB was a grungy

dont handle anger very well and was relieved to get some help I ran to a phone a few feet away and called for help over the intercom CB followed me and lowered his voice to keep grumbling to me about his worldending problem but he seemed to calm down a little now that he knew he had gotten up a rung on the ladder We waited I knew a manager might be a little longer because they were also amidst the throng of shoppers so I tried not to panic and made some small talk with CBFive minutes passed I saw CB getting more impatient so I called again over the intercom trying a joke about how the managers were probably up to their necks with customers CB wasnt amused so I just kept standing there shuffling my feet I couldnt leave the guy so I did my best to answer the couple questions that came my way while I was doing nothing Another five minutes passedCB What the fuck is taking him so longMe I dont know Im so sorry I can go look for a manager if you wantCB Youre staying RIGHT HERE until he shows up I know a cop out when I hear oneMe Im not trying to abandon you sir I want to helpCB You need to get your manager here RIGHT NOW DO YOU HEAR MEI was on the verge of crying at this point I picked up the phone for a third time trembling trying to take a breath so I didnt start crying over the intercom  when the lead manager Tim finally showed up out of breath from hurrying up front so quickly CB immediately looked a lot less threatening compared to Tim who was  built like a linebacker with tattoos on his arms and a long braided black beard Tim who had a heart of gold and cared about his employees asked ME what the problem was which pissed off CB but he looked scared shitlessMe Were out of TMEs and he really would like oneCB Thats RIGHT I have a problem with the fact thatTim Just a moment sir Prettehkitteh thank you you can go back to the frontI scampered away as quickly as possible as Tim started to explain that if we didnt have TMEs we didnt have TMEs I watched as CBs anger overcame his cowardice and he raised his voice a little to be rebutted or cut off each time with Tims best gentle giant voice Within two minutes Tim smiled and pointed out the door CB yelled one last unintelligible word and stormed out Tim came over to me gave me a big hug and told me to go take a breather in the back room The rest of that shift was a piece of cake comparatively and when I left

DrunkenBlackBelt,27,25,1rhw8z,118,Im back bitches  About  months ago I got a second job working part time at a mens Big ampTall store  The hours are easy commision is alright and to be honest the customers are generally friendly and awesome  It helps that a lot of them dont have anywhere else to shop Unfortunantly the store isnt as eventul as my past retail jobs  Its just selling clothes and shoes  But Ive gotten a few funny stories that Ill share over time here And with the holidays coming up im sure Ill have plenty more  Welll for your pleasure hopefully I present Boy Are My Feet SoreWARNING GROSSSo recently I began working in a mens store for Big amp Tall sizes  I knew of it because I buy my shoes there  Only store that carries a size   I am too small for the clothes despite being  and slightly overweight  And if Im being honest  seeing some of the people who come in makes me more motivated to keep losing weight  lbs this year alone  Now dont get me wrong SOME of the people have legitimate health concerns  One gentleman was born with his left foot backwards  During his childhood they would constantly have to break his foot set it slightly closer to the proper position let it heal and repeat But it never set  correct keeping him from being able to run or exercise or even stand for long periods of time  Its guys like him I feel for  Given a shitty deal in life and just having to suffer for it Most customers however are just plain old fat guys  I dont want to sound mean or fat shame  But its just poor lifestyle choices and such  I was there  I was lbs shy of  last new years  And it was just being lazy and making bad choices  I dont have as much sympathy for these guys  And that brings us to our story todayIts a sunny fall day  Its midweek and pretty dead  Im in my suit fixing clothes putzing around pretty much just pretending to work  I hear the door chime and in walks an older couple  Probably late s very early s  The lady was using a walker to move around and the gentleman was resting his weight on a cane as he slowly moved with her  They seemed like a nice enough couple but as you know those are the ones who always turn into assholesI introduced myself asked how I could help them that day  The man gruffly replied shoes  I brought them to the shoe department  Now my store is small and there is only one small bench to sit on and its in the shoe department  Naturally this oaf takes the seat leaving his frail wife to stand  I could tell she was having difficulty being particularly petire and frail so I went in the back and got her a folding chair to sit in next to her husband  She thanked me because manners  The man charming fellow that he was just said can you get me some shoes now  It was about this time that I realized this was going to go south faster than a my ex gf in a dick sucking contestI offered several suggestions as the gentleman didnt seem to know what kind of shoes he wanted  The man complained that most of our shoes dont even fit him I expressed sympathy as I have large feet and can only fit into the largest size available in store  The man looked me up and down and sneered Well you just have big feet I have a health condition that causes this so consider yourself lucky  Eventually we found a pair he liked and thought may just fit his feet  And thats when the real horror of this story starts  The man then proceeds to roll up his sweatpants  He was wearing ankle socks and sandals  His feet are hugely swollen and covered in open sores  This guy has diabetes and its eating away at his foot  Sadly its fairly common where I work  What came next however is notI hand him the shoes and take a step back giving him some space to put the shoes on look at them in the mirror see how they feel etc  NOPE  He looks at me like an idiot and says Well I cant put them on myself  I cant bend that far  Put them on for me   Now I am no fan of feet even on a good day  Sure if Im dating someone and they want a footrub and their feet are clean then ill oblige  But other than that I just want nothing to do with that area of the body  Add to the fact that we are talking about a stranger whose foot is literally covered in open oozing sores  DBB Sir I just cant do that Im sorryMan  You need to help me  Im a customer and I need serviceDBB There is no way I am doing that sir  I am sorry but you have open sores on your foot and leg Its unsanitary for both me and YOU to have me do thatMan Oh just wash your hands after itll be fineHow this man survived  or so years with logic like that will forever amaze me  DBB Absolutely not  Man I want the manger  Ill have your ass for discrimination and harrassmentDBB  I am the manager  If you want the store manager call back tomorrow  If you want corporates phone number Ill give it with my name gladly  The man continued to yell and scream about receiving the shoes at a discount and having me fired  Typical stuff for anyone who works in retail really  I essentially told him that I wasnt going to touch his feet and if he didnt like the service he could leave Wife is trying to keep the peace  Its not very effective  Husband used Rage  Its inneffective against DBB  Besides my DEF is to high  Anyways i wish there was some more to this  Eventually he stormed out as dramatically as one can when you can barely walk under your own weight and your wife is frail and moves about as fast a christian school girl with a chastity belt  I did hear from corporate the next day though  Naturally some of the details were changed when he called in but once I explained about the sores I receieve a Yea that happens all the time Dont worry about it  Sorry if its not very exciting  Im sure Ill have some good ones coming up  Hope you all are surviving

arent really THAT bad and only minor annoyances Now this night we were slow and it was just about closing time so the MOD manager on duty and I were cleaning up around the store Our bliss is soon interrupted by a dark haired demon disguised as a human being   For whatever reason Demon Bitch bypasses the MOD and heads straight for me and I feel a chill roll down my spine I know somehow that this is going to be bad DB I bought this dress the other day whips out cotton dress and I went to put it on a button is missing from the back Can I exchange itMe Hoping this is easier than I first thought Of course lets see if we still have another in the same sizeExtra small petiteWe did not Me Im sorry it doesnt look like we have another in the same color and size We can exchange it for a different color or I can refund you back your money for it no problemDB No I want to wear THIS oneMe I can look it up and see if another store has it if you want We can put it on hold for however long you want and you are welcome to exchange it there We can try to place an order for it as well through the computer but if there is a low inventory theres no guarantee you will get t unfortunately The inventory is about  hours behind and often the numbers are lower than what is shownDB No That is unacceptable I want this one Cant you just sew a new button on itMe Unfortunately we dont have spare buttons but I can sew the button loop to the other side so it doesnt look off balance if you like Mind you the button is TINY About half the size of a dime Its really not that big of an issueNow this where things start to go downhill DB What will you do with the dress if I return it  Honesty to me  is the best policy but had I known how this was going to go down I probably would have just lied to this personMe Most likely we will write a damage tag for it and it will get removed from the inventory and shipped outDB Then rip a button off another dress and sew it to this oneI am VERY taken aback by this  She wants meto destroy No way Just No Me Maam Im sorry I cannot destroy company propertyDB WHAT You just SAID that this one would get sent out if I returned it what is the difference between this one and that one getting sent outMe Well that dress is now YOURS since you bought it You can do with it what you will and if you return it then it becomes the property of the company again  meaning that we will adhere to company policy and not put a damaged item on the floor The other dress on the rack is still company property and I will not willfully destroy company propertyDB I RAN A BUSINESS FOR TEN YEARS YOU DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO MAKE THE CUSTOMER HAPPY RIP A BUTTON OFF THAT DRESS AND SEW IT ONTO MINE THIS INSTANTMe I am not going to destroy company property You can return the dress or I can find one at another store Those are your options I am not risking my job by destroying company propertyDB THAT IS BULL SHIT YOU WILL NOT LOSE YOUR JOB OVER MAKING THE CUSTOMER HAPPY I RAN A BUSINESS I KNOW I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGERMe Alright MOD who has been listening the whole time this client would like to speak with youThe MOD comes over and I walk away continue to tidy up the store and do my job Then I see the MOD take the clients dress And the dress on the floor Im thinking that she CANT POSSIBLY be doing what I thinkYes the MOD ripped a button off a dress from the floor and sewed it back on to DBs dress Something or other had brought me to the desk a few moments later while the MOD was wrapping up sewing the new button on During the entire time DB wont stop going on and on about how she ran a business and knows that you do whatever it takes to make a customer happy etc etc etc  She then turns to me again and tells me Losing your job over making a customer happy That is SUCH bullshit I dont know of ANY company that would fire you for making a customer HAPPYI dont give her a response because at this point I am infuriated that the MOD would give into this horrible excuse for a human being and if I do respond it will be nasty DB eventually leaves and the MOD comes overMOD MysticSpiral Im sorry that I went over your head and did that I just could tell that it would escalate further and I didnt want a scene I REALLY loved that MOD she was like another mom to me but I absolutely could not respond to her I dont think I said a word for the rest of the evening The whole thing boils my blood even now So the lesson here is that if you scream and cry and rant and rave you can get someone to destroy company property just so you dont have to fork over a few cents for a replacement button at a fabric store ,1385239109.0,The Button,128,talesFromRetail,top_week

thompsontoonsart,16,19,1r9l9k,94,Customer walks up to me just as Im about to go on my late afternoon lunch break She says shes there to pick up an order for X person name Well call her Fuddle Duddle and it should be a couple of bedskirts She received a call that the order was in Seems clear cut like any other order we have shipped to the store from our warehouse I go to our holds area to find the ordertheres no bedskirts on hold and no orders under the name the customer gave me I walk back onto the selling floor to speak with the customer Maam you said your name is Fuddle Duddle I dont see any orders out back with that name attachedWell no My name is Sue Fuddle is my friend Im in the area so she asked me to pick up her order for herThe next half hour spirals into this confusing mess of misinformation that five other associates attempted to clear up Sue came to the store with Fuddle a couple weeks ago and made a few largeish purchases Sue said Fuddle was pretty sure shed paid for the order being shipped to the store and it just needed to be picked up I look through our log book listing paid for pickup orders and there was no listing of Fuddles name in the book I inform Sue that the order may have only been transferred into the store but not paid for if this was the case our policy is that unpaid hold items are put onto the selling floor after hrs Sue said Fuddle had paid for the bedskirts I tried looking up Ms Duddles customer information in our register and through our catalog system and I found no purchase records at all Well that cant be right Sue said We were here in the store We bought several hundred dollars worth of stuff We were here for hours You must have a record I informed her that their purchases would be in our records but they wouldnt be logged under their names unless we created customer profiles for them Since their names didnt come up in our profile search I figured theyd opted out of having a profile created Sue decides to call Fuddle and confirm the information Sue hands me the phone after a few minutes so I can speak directly with Fuddle I inquire what style bedskirt it was that shed ordered for pick up and she said she couldnt really describe it She could tell me where she found the bedskirt in the store but the one she ordered was the correct size she needed that wasnt available in store at the time Supposedly it was a plain tailored style and she had a receipt for the item at home but she wasnt at home that very moment so she couldnt give me the information on the receipt She insisted she paid for the bedskirt because she had a receipt but her friend had also received a call to pick up her order which she said is a queen sized dust ruffle in white or maybe it was two twins She couldnt even remember what she ordered I described a couple of the styles to her and she suggested our diamond quilted style seemed most likely I asked if her order could have been logged under anyone elses name and she said no but her neighbor Pierce was supposed to pick it up So we had a third person involved in this order I took down Fuddles phone number and the number for her neighbor Pierce who was originally called and notified about the order and I told her wed give her a call once we sort the issue outSue is getting somewhat impatient now because she was there solely to pick up Fuddles order Fuddle lives out of state but owns a second house here in Maine which is where the bedskirt is supposed to go Sue looks at me saying So if you eventually find this bedskirt youll have to mail it to us for free right I dont want to drive another  miles to come pick it up and you already called Pierce to say it was here and somehow its not I told her that we would figure out some way to get the items to the customer if she did indeed already pay for them Sue and her patiently waiting husband decide to leaveMeanwhile my coworker pieces all the mashed up information together and tracks down the receipt for Fuddles original purchase which has a queen sized bedskirt on it She bought the bedskirt and one matching sham in store and they left with her What could she have possibly ordered We went back to the holds area There was a white queen coverlet and one matching sham on hold in the same style as the bedskirt she already purchased under Fuddles neighbor Pierces name and contact phone number and it was unpaid for I run out the door hoping Sue and her husband hadnt pulled out of the parking lot yet They were gone My coworker gets on the phone and calls the neighbor asking if they can contact Sue before she gets too far away from the store Were just hoping things will work out so we dont have to ship this to the customer because the customer clearly gave us all the wrong information The neighbor does get a hold of Sue she comes back and purchases the coverlet and sham for her friendTL Woman comes in to pick up supposedly paid for bedskirt for her friend Lady picking up the order gets annoyed with us because we cant track down the order thats supposed to be in store The actual order wasnt a bedskirt it wasnt paid for and the contact person listed on the order was neither the friend nor the original customer ,1385178250.0,Customer doesnt remember what she ordered,113,talesFromRetail,top_week
kemmer,37,24,1rbkuk,97,Summer after I graduated high school I worked at a deli in a casino Ive worked at several other retail jobs since then and the casino job is easily the worst Ive ever had The main reason is that customers were all either drunk or had just lost a bunch of money and they took out that anger and frustration on us Some storiesOrientationEveryone that was starting work in the casino that week no matter the job or department took part in the same orientation It basically consisted of an HR lady telling us how great the company was while we filled out tax forms but it ended in a tour of the whole property We saw the high roller suites the ballrooms all the restaurants etc While touring the steakhouse the most expensive restaurant the manager came out to show us the super expensive liquors they had available He pulled out a bottle of one I dont remember what it was now probably Cristal or something like that and told us how lucky we were to see it up close because none of us would ever be able to afford it Its been  years since I had that job and the memory of that STILL pisses me off I was  years old that dude had no way of knowing what I would do with my life or how much money I would make Not to mention not everyone there were retail workers there were some that were working in management or in administrative jobs like accounting Its been a life goal of mine since then to go back to that restaurant and order all the highest priced items on the menu Just for my own satisfication you know I should have known then this job was gonna suckCountingIm not gonna front Im pretty bad at math Im fairly intellegent otherwise graduated college with a  GPA but Ive just never been able to wrap my head around numbers One day I rang a guy up for a sandwich and drink The order was something like  He handed me  I punched it into the register and was all ready to give him  cents back when he suddenly gave me a quarter I hesistated for a second while I tried to manually calculate what the change would be now It honesly couldnt have been more than  seconds that I hesitated but in that time he started screaming literally screaming at me about how stupid I was and how shitty my education must have been But he couldnt stop there oh no he had to call his wife over so he could point out to her how stupid the employees at this place were Can you believe it How can they hire people this dumb I had figured out his change in the meantime handed it to him turned around and sobbed over the chili The guy walked away shaking his head at me in disgustSuicideMy most memorable day working at the casino and the day I praised God that I was lucky enough to go to college and not have to work there forever This place was essentially like Disneyland in that there was a whole underground world for the employees We had our own stores our own bank our own cafeteria etc To get to the employee cafeteria from the deli we had to walk around the back of the building under a covered walkway type thing The parking garage was right outside the deli doors One day I was walking back to work after my break when I noticed a commotion happening on the ground in the front of the parking garage I looked over and noticed a huge wetspot on the ground mixed with blood and other unidentifiable fluids I couldnt tell what was going on but I was late getting back from break so I just went back into the deli Found out later that an employee in another department had committed suicide by jumping off the roof of the parking garage They had already removed the body but I got to see the remnants The image of that will forever stick in my brainThose are my best stories but that doesnt even touch the mean as nails cook that got hit by a car the Jamaicans that stole from me and that were essentially being used as indentured servants by the company or the chef that I secretly discovered had two families neither knew of the other I got my revenge on that place by stealing cookies all the time Those cookies were damn goodTLDR Casinos are possibly the worst places on earth,1385255609.0,Why I cried over chili and other tales from the casino,121,talesFromRetail,top_week

LossPreventionSucks,24,26,1rfcsa,92,This is my first time posting here but Ill just warn you this can get a bit winded  Ive yet to be able to REALLY rant about this guy as my manager mentioned I should keep quiet about the whole ordealNow I work for a popular gaming store chain  Im sure you can guess which one  Ive heard the horror stories however Ive had an amazing experience working there up until I met our Loss Prevention ManagerTo start the day off I had to open  I went in about  minutes earlier than usual because we had a heavy load from the night before thanks to the XBox One launch  I wanted to clean everything up before customers started piling in  I already told my manager I was just going to leave earlier in the day so we didnt go over hours and he was totally fine with that  Anyway  minutes after walking through the door a group of people start banging on the door relentlessly yelling IM HERE LET ME IN  I ignore them for the first  minutes I mean gates are down and they are banging on the door exactly where our hours are posted and its almost  hours before open  I walk up to them and inform them we open at   The man quickly snaps Bullshit We were told by StoreManager that you opened early today for the system release  So I texted my manager and sure enough he said Absolutely not  If theyre picking a system up let them in though  I asked if they were picking a system up and he responded with No I want to return this stuff holding up at least  worth of XBox games and a system  I told him he would have to wait as my computers are still down  He finally agreed and left only to call every  minutes or so and ask if we were open yet For the next hour and a half  Now because this guy was so persistent I decided to leave the safe cracked open so we didnt have to wait for the  minute timer to go up  I figured hed come back right away  That was my first mistake  He never did come back and due to us being so busy and me being the only one there I forgot that the safe was cracked just a tiny bitOn to the second half I was there alone all morning  I had several people asking for systems which require me to go through a locked door through a hallway and into another locked door to get to  I have to do this for each system whether or not  people in line are waiting for a system  This gives  minutes of time each time I have to get a system where there is absolutely no employees covering the store  So what did I do  I propped the first door open  Mistake number twoAfter a bit my parttimer came in   minutes after opening I repeat we were open for  whole minutes at this point  of which I had spent alone with nearly  customers in the store picking up systems In walks our Loss Prevention guy  I didnt know he was Loss Prevention though No He instantly walks in starts yelling at my parttimer about the door and she directs him to me as she had just gotten there  Still no introduction the following commencedFatLossPreventionMan  Why the hell is the back door openMe  Can I help youFatLP  IS YOUR SAFE OPEN  WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU THINKING remember theres multiple people in the store at this point several in lineMe oh fuck   stutter

you areFatLP beaming Im Dave  Im here to audit and help with customersMe  Okay  Yeah I messed up  Its been a hectic morningAfter this exchange he continued to point out every thing that was wrong in our store  Mind you Im not the manager  Im not even assistant manager  Im a store worker who gets paid  cents more than minimum wage with manager duties  He continued to attack my coworker and I about controllers being live on the floor hanging on pegs  feet in the air saying someone could jump up and knock them off to steal them I wanted so badly to ask him to show me how  He then answered phones with just Hi this is Dave  No greeting nothing Just Dave  Then he proceeded to hang up on the people when he didnt know the answer These people then called back so they could complain to meAt this point he had yelled at my coworker and I loomed over us and degraded us so badly that I was near tears  He walked around the store talking to our DM about how pathetic this was and how incompetent the work is that he is seeing  Several customers had come up expressing their concern for my coworker and I  The best part was when I was actually shedding tears and helping a customer while Dave looked on giving no personal space  The customer asks Are you okay and Dave butts in Shes fine Do you want the GPG  I said nothing I was beaten and I couldnt do anything  The entire two hour period this man was there he told me about  different things that I had done that was a terminable offense  I was afraid if I said anything more that I would be done And I need this job  Anyway Theres a lot more

ExcerptMusic,18,16,1rahbf,88, I work for a major cell phone retailer and frequently deal with technical issues Most of the time I love to help people figure out their phone so that they can get the most out of it However there are always certain individuals that blame their devices for their own faults Feel free to comment with similar issues as an employee or customer including silly things that were accidentally done that messed up a phoneKeep in mind the following text is currently in my head unless in quotes I am being as nice as possible on the outsideI had a customer come into the store that had a few problems with his phone I knew it wasnt going to be fun to figure out because he had on the fuck you face and looked to be in the ignorant with technology age range He presented me with  problems My alarm doesnt alert me in the morning and I need it for work The outside keys dont lock so the phone turns the speaker on The battery runs out when I unplug it at nightHe then followed by I bought this phone  days ago and want to return it and Ive been with this company for  years Advice to anyone that plans on throwing the Ive been shopping here for X amount of years This company doesnt care about you personally they just dont This isnt some mom amp pop shop that is hanging on simply by your individual business This is a multiBILLION dollar company They care even less if you were an asshole to them for those  years because I guarantee this isnt your first time complaining  So you bought the phone  days ago Sorry you cant return it There is a  day return policy on phones company wide This does not change unless there was an issue with ordering or computer date errors which doesnt happen We could also get the manufacturer to replace it if there is actually a problem with it There was no problem with the phone so there is  nothing I can do to get this guy a new phone So I check it out and explain to him what is going on The alarm First off his alarm was off He said it is because he turns it off on the weekends and on Monday it doesnt work I told him you need to turn it on or only set it for weekdaysI did this for him He kept saying that the phone was broken and the alarm would go off  minutes after it was supposed to I tested the alarm feature about  times No issues If it happened every time like he said I would have seen it at least once Even after telling him that the alarm was off he kept telling me it was the phone that had the problem and it was doing it automatically No It wasnt Next issue The outside keys wouldnt lock Ok This is a flip phone so there are volume keys and speaker phone keys He also has a horizontal belt carrier He tells me when he pushes the phone up in its holster while someone is calling him he pushes the buttons and that his old phone didnt do that I tell him that there is no way to turn off the buttons while someone is calling You can turn them off while no one is calling but not during a call After talking more with him I figured out why his old phone didnt have that issue He used to have a vertical belt clip and never pressed the buttons when he took out his phone Next issue The battery runs out at night This one is just stupid He told me that when he fully charges his phone at night he unplugs it and leaves it open The phone also has the screen timeout disabled So at night he unplugs the phone at  leaves it open fully lit and goes to bed Then in the morning he is mad that it is almost dead He must sleep with the lights on or something I dont know I set a screen timeout and told him to just leave it plugged in even though that slowly discharges battery over months and years A problem with battery capacity in  years isnt going to be his most pressing issue and it will prevent a lot of manufacturer return claims because the phone dies at night Now that ive fixed his issues he says that he will try it out but he doesnt expect it to work because it was the phone  Sorry guy it wasnt the phone It was user error through and through Dont blame technology for your mishaps Technology isnt some black magic  of operating a phone is common sense and an ability to read If the alarm says OFF then the alarm is off Its that simple  As much as I hate these people I like to see their reactions even when I fix their issues Its almost always negative with no thanks while stomping out the door I just have to roll my eyes and wait for that awesome customer that listens to experienced advice and recognizes their errors while laughing about it Seriously those are the best customers everTLDR User error accounts for most errors,1385222796.0,Dont blame technology if you dont know how to use it,104,talesFromRetail,top_week

adelajoy,17,20,1rg29x,84,I spent two years working at a big warehousestyle grocery store I worked mostly as a cashier but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a weekMost of the crappy moments have all blurred together but there are a few particular moments that stick outThis grocery store is the only one in the area that doesnt bag your groceries for you Each till has two long conveyor belts to hold your groceries while you bag them Both the customer and the cashier have buttons to move the groceries down away from the till This speeds orders up requires less staff saves money and drops prices People occasionally complain about it but if they want to pay more for their groceries and have someone else bag them theyre welcome to  The store isnt exactly famous for customer service but I think the prices make up for thisI was one of the fastest cashiers on staff at the time This meant that my belts would often get full I had ways to deal with this I knew how fast people packed I knew how soon a belt would clear I was really good at my job One day the lines were insanely long I was working really fast everyone was buying a lot I got to a point that there were groceries on both of my belts so I squeezed the smaller order down a little watched for a moment and knew that he would be down before the next order crowded him I started scanning the next order and smiled at the customers  a man and his very pregnant wifeThe wife snapped at me Can you just waitExcuse meCan you wait I dont want you to crowd out that other guyI looked and he was literally loading his last bag with groceries I stopped scanning anyways and maybe glared at the lady I dont really like it when other people tell me how to do my jobEventually he was packed and gone so I started scanning again While I had been waiting I had lined all of their canned goods up I can scan cans super fast if theyre all really close I started scanning the canned goods grabbing a can tossing it to my other hand and setting it on the other belt Except that this woman had walked around The belt she got was behind me and was standing behind me trying to bag the cans as I scanned them Im sorry but Im not actually looking where the cans go I know the space and I need to watch the computer screen not my hands Well she kept trying to grab the one Id just set down which meant that I kept hitting her hand with the next can I wasnt by any means throwing the cans but I was moving quickly and she was in my space so she was getting hit I didnt actually realize that I was hitting her until she complained to her husband So I slowed down apologized and moved on to her other groceriesShe then had a bag of apples She had grabbed one of our bags and put three different apples in it and tied it shut I have to weigh each type of fruit separately so I opened the bag weighed the first apple set it aside I noticed her husband grabbed the apple right away I weighed the second apple and set it aside He grabbed that one too When I weighed the third my plan had been to put all three back in the bag and tie it shut but the other two apples were gone I tied the bag around the last one and set it on the belt If the husband wanted to pack the apples separately he was welcome toThe couple also bought about half a dozen little bags of frozen perogies One of the bags had been ripped all the open right down the middle and frozen perogies were laying all over the belt I considered not telling them because I was mad but I took a deep breath rounded up all of the stray perogies put them in a plastic bag and informed the lady I asked her if she would like me to send for a new bag She snippily replied Yes as if I should have just known Some people dont bother to get a new bag because it can hold up the line so I always ask Our runner quickly returned with an identical bag and I kept goingWhen I finally finished They bought a lot of stuff the husband paid while the wife stormed over to customer service I watched as she talked to my supervisor and eventually a store manager I was getting pretty nervous Oh also I should mention this woman was rude and snapped every time I asked her a question I was pretty angry by the time they leftAfter they were completely done my supervisor closed my till and asked to speak to me at customer serviceShe said the lady had filed a formal complaint against me Apparently the conversation went something like thisPregnant Lady I want to complain about the cashier on till Nice Supervisor Till  Do you mean till  I was on   one of my quicktoanger coworkers was on PL No I mean NS Like the girl with brown hair not the blondePL getting frustrated YesNS So what did adelajoy doPL She was rude and short with meNS Adelajoy Are you surePL Yes She also threw canned goods at me ripped open a bag of perogies scattered them everywhere and scattered all of my apples too She also bruised all of my fruit because she was throwing them aroundA store manager was brought down to take a formal complaint which means it probably went in my employee file The lady was calmed down and left and that was the end of it Typically the store managers will meet with you to discuss complaints and make sure they wont happen again The fact that I didnt means either the manager simply didnt believe the woman or wasnt concerned because it was my first and only The supervisor who helped her said she closed my till because I looked upset and she thought I needed a break The only reason she told me was to find out what really happened I told her my side and she just laughed it off I admitted to being short and snippy but the rest was just ludicrous I still cannot beleive she blamed me for the bag of perogies being ripped open considering I told her about them got a new bag and spent a minute or two picking up all of the perogies Also why would I take the time to do that when I was clearly rushed with everything elseI get that pregnant women have a lot of hormones and tend to be angry shorttempered whatnot but I think theres a line Also the fact that her husband didnt stop her stand up for me or admit to grabbing all the apples kind of pissed me offTldr Crazyhormones pregnant lady complained about me but the supervisor didnt believe her,1385415043.0,In my spare time I like to rip open your groceries and scatter

HeloRising,18,15,1ra3ti,68,Since the last one did so well and people enjoyed it I got in touch with one of the girls I worked with at the pottery store trolling for more stories and she mentioned one Id forgottenThis was about a month after I signed on and I had just come back from lunch on an otherwise quiet day Alas the day was not to remain so A woman walked in and started browsing the shelves She smiled and I greeted her asked her if she was looking for anything in particular she said no she was just browsing so I left it at that About ten minutes later she comes up to me with about four smaller pieces in her hands and she looks a little worried Note the punctuation in her statement is very very deliberateUmmIm trying to decide on one of these Its for my daughter shes graduating college next week and I wanted to get her a little something that was nice but not big so she wouldnt have to worry about carting it around and I thought oh maybe some figurines would be good but then I dont know because she likes faeries and horses but maybe thats a little too childish for her and I saw these and I love them and maybe theyd go well in her new place but I dont know for sure what it looks like because its all the way out past the freeway andThis goes on for quite some time Im overclocking my mental CPU hardcore just to be able to process everything shes saying because its coming out like fire from a rocket and she doesnt seem to want to slow down I try to slow her down but her automatic verbal machine gun has got me pinned After about five minutes of this it becomes very clear that she doesnt intend to stop Like ever At this point I started entertaining the idea of calling security This was a fairly high end shopping area so getting stayathome moms who have a doctor friend with a loose prescription pad wasnt unheard of and it was starting to look like shed either taken too much or too little of something strongBy now shed begun almost a fullblown panic attack and I had stopped being able to decode what she was saying it was coming out so fast Her eyes were getting red and puffy and she was gesticulating wildly Also shed stopped focusing on me she was no longer looking directly at me anymore She had this kind of thousand yard stare going on Her volume had also gone up and unreasonably hot coworker came out to see what the commotion was only to be greeted by the sight of a grown woman frothing at the mouth waiving pottery faeries around going about a million miles a minute about her daughter and somebody named Howie and looked like she was on the verge of spontaneously combusting Unreasonably hot coworker tried to calm the situation down but the woman was a volcano in full eruption at this point spewing molten crazy on everything around herJust before the ten minute mark she had apparently ran out of energy because she kind of half sat half collapsed onto the floor bawling her eyes out We were watching a grown human being have a fullblown psychological meltdown on the floor of the shopand we hadnt the slightest fucking idea how to deal with it Shed gotten so loud she attracted the attention of security who came in and asked what was going on and in a quavering tone of voice unreasonably hot coworker told the security guardA customer is having a nervous breakdown whats the policy on that It was apparently a first for the guard too because he had that same sort of expression youd expect on peoples faces if someone started stripping and pouring syrup on their genitals in the middle of breakfast at IHOP profound confusion mixed with a little bit of morbid fascinationEventually I guess she just completely ran out of gas and resorted to juststaring off into space with her mouth slightly open We got her cellphone and called the ICE contact who I assume was her husband He showed up about ten minutes after we called and somehow got her up and out of the store He didnt explain what was going on just thanked us for calling him and left with her I never did see her again after thatPart of me is amazed Id forgotten about this story but it wraps up with a lot of other things that happened later that are a little triggering so I guess I kinda just buried it Not as funny as the other two but still entertaining in its own way,1385202905.0,A customer is having a nervous breakdown whats the policy on that,83,talesFromRetail,top_week

KDR,9,14,1ra3wz,52,Im reasonably new to this subreddit and reddit in general but because I have spent the bulk of my working life in retail and can relate to most of these stories I find myself drawn here I felt it was only fair to share one of my stories This one in particular is inspired by uunmined most recent storyQuick back story I moved to the city earlier in the year after finishing high school After a string of lousy or temporary jobs I get hired as an electronics associate at an overwhelmingly large retail chainOur story begins on my first day of work Which happened to coincide with my birthday    I step on to the floor following way too close to my manager because I have absolutely no idea what to do or where to go At this point Ive just resigned that this day is gonna be terrible no matter what happens After all spending your birthday at your first day as a retail slave isnt exactly a dream come true He sets me up changing all the tags for the new DVD releases with another coworker lets call him Bas to make sure I dont screw it up At the time the department wasnt terribly large at least not as big as it is now so to make up for that fact the shelves were quite tall As far as I was concerned the department didnt exist past the DVD racks and B and myself were the only employees in the department As soon as Im starting to get comfortable and feel like I know what Im doing I hear a female voice behind me So this is the new guy huhI turn to see where the words are coming from and Im completely blindsided by what stands before me She is the girl Ive been searching my entire life for and I didnt even know it She stands eye level with me about  if it matters with long blonde hair that comes down to her shoulder blades Her eyes are a deep green color that I could lose myself in to the point that I cant look in to them for too long in fear Ill never find my way back out I can smell a faint sweetness when shes near almost like vanilla which I find out later is from her body wash In short she is every thing I have ever wanted and all I will ever wantB finally breaks the silence which seems to go on for an eternity but was probably only  seconds Yea his names    whats your name againIn that instant I suddenly forget what people have been calling me my entire life to the point where I have to sneak a look at my name tag to remember Its    umm    KDRShe cracks a smile and almost starts to giggle Thats an interesting name where you named after Insert ActorAround the time she stops speaking I finally remember how words work Honestly Im not sure I never thought enough to askHeh well I guess Ill see you around thenI wave bye to her as she disappears around the corner I can still smell vanilla and shes all I can think about for the rest of my shiftWe continued to work together but never really had any extended conversation except for having to ask her where things were for customers or what set of keys opened what cases Based on what I had heard from my coworkers she wasnt a very pleasant person to be around and the word bitch was used a few times It wasnt until a full month after our initial encounter that we finally got to spend some time togetherOur manager had given her the task of reorganizing the wall of printer ink It was essentially a  foot tall  foot wide section of madness She was to pick one person to help her with this and it was expected to take a few days I find out the day she starts working on it that Im the one that gets to help from our manager As we were walking over he leans over to me as half whispers I know this isnt gonna be a fun project and she isnt always the most friendly person but at least she isnt bad to look at I force a laugh and crack a smile but something tells me Im gonna enjoy the hell out of this projectDuring this time we talk    a lot About everything from interests and hobbies to our coworkers where we grew up and everything in between As it would happen most of our interests coincide She reads comics as well shes into computers albeit not quite to the extent I am but this is hardly a deal breaker and we actually grew up only  miles from each other but in different school districtsAfter that week of work I had decided she was going to be the woman I would spend the rest of my life with It would seem she had decided the same because she started inviting me over after work to hang out with her and a few friends Eventually she stopped inviting the friends And from there things ran their course This story took place over  years ago Im very happy to say that I havent changed my mind about spending the rest of my days with her and she hasnt either I guess what Im trying to say is yes retail is awful The customers are almost always unbelievably rude or amazingly stupid and the pay is never enough to make up for it Were on the cusp of one of the worst times to be a retail employee but sometimes things work out in ways you would never expect and change your life foreverTLDR  I met the girl of my dreams on my first day as a retail slave,1385203076.0,Retail isnt always terrible,66,talesFromRetail,top_week

malnormalish,19,6,1r9oo9,42,So I work at an art craft store and we sell these crazily popular rubber band bracelet looms  along with rubber band refill packs They come in a multitude of colors but we usually only have  colors at a time Every day I have people coming up asking if we have any other colors which is a valid question I tell them that no what we have out is all that there is and then half of the time they ask Are you sure  No Im not sure Im just pulling that out of my assWhen I tell them yes Im definitely sure Ive seen more people than I would have guessed throw tantrums Ive gotten people asking if I could just double check in the back No nothing in the back and even had a couple people offer me extra cash on the side if I could give them a certain color trying to bribe me I dont understand what they want me to do its not like I can magically summon the rubber bands out of thin airIts absolutely crazy how these people act trying to get these looms Seriously we have sold  of them in one night That same night for the last loom available I taped a note on it saying Im the LAST one and about ten minutes later saw two ladies walk up to it at the same time It was like a showdown in a movie They glared at each other before one lady just quickly grabbed it and walked away The other lady then complained to me about how we should have had more of them to check when theyll be in we dont know yadda yaddaA couple annoying things to note about this product is that we have moved the display for it from about the middle of the store to quite literally the frontmost center of the store standing there right as the customers walk in These customers have to walk past the display directly to my counter where they ask me where the product is I usually just point and they follow my deadeyed stare to the display behind them Then the customer will walk over pluck one from the shelf ignoring the neoncolored bolded signs printed on x pieces of foamboard stating that no coupons are to be accepted on the looms The customer then promptly whips out a coupon When I then tell them I cannot use said coupon most of them are annoyed but okay while others tell me its bullshit and storm out threatening to never come back to the store again  saying that The coupon is the only reason I came Of course all of you know that people do not read and refuse to even attempt to observe their surroundings blaming poor cashiers for problems out of their control so my tale should not come as a surprise So to end this rant I just wanted to ask what products sold at your place of work give you the most frustration This loom kit has been probably the worst to deal with for me I see people get insanely angry about these things its sort of funny but also very horribly frustrating,1385181474.0,The Loom of Doom No coupons arent accepted,48,talesFromRetail,top_week

BraveSouls,12,14,1rfyes,35,Some background I work for a privately owned consignment shop For those that dont know its a secondhand shop though we also sell new items but not like pawn shops where the owners can get a loan for an item or get paid the least amount the shop workers can get away with for the items before they resell them We take the items in and once they sell we get a commission off the sale and the original owners get a check in the mail once a month We sell both in store and on eBay  spacer  spacer  This little old lady walks into the shop one afternoon looking for furniture for her daughter She had just moved into a new apartment and she has nothing to put in it I smile thinking thats very nice of the lady to come in with the intention of getting things for her daughter The greater majority of our big furniture is right in the middle of the store when she walks in so she looks around while I go back to my laptop to continue working on an eBay listing  spacer      spacer  She asked me random questions here and there about the different items then finds her way to the back where we have a large screen TV for sale She calls my attention and the conversation went something like thisOld Lady How much for the TVMe OL Okay Ill probably take it Does it come with a remote  spacer  spacerMy boss who was processing item drop offs overheard and said there wasnt one with the TV but we had a separate remote next to it It was one of those big button universal remotes that likes to think bigger is better Note I know why theyre really that size At this point she told me she planed on getting the TV and the remote but she had no idea how it worked and asked me about it I anticipated this question when my boss mentioned the remote so rather than try to explain to her how to use the remote on the TV I told her Id be right back and to feel free to look around more  spacer  spacer  I noted the brand of the TV cant remember what it was and went to my laptop with the remote I look up the instructions for that specific remote since it didnt have any with it and also looked up the codes for the TV I wrote everything down on a piece of paper and then went over exactly what she had to do with the remote to get the TV working with it I figured showing her rather than just telling would be better The whole process took about  minutes including the other questions she had about stuff in the store She was very grateful and purchased the TV remote and a wall plaque  spacer  spacer  The next trick was getting the TV into her car This wasnt a flat screen It was one of those TVs that liked big butts and it cannot lie It was also very heavy So while she was pulling her car up front my boss and I were trying to figure out how we were getting the behemoth from the back of the store to the front and into her car Silly him doesnt have a dolly so Im looking for something with wheels on it while he takes measurements I look outside and see this tiny station wagon right up front and my heart drops just a little Im worried it wont fit but he is unfazed He works with the lady to pull down seats and clear space Turns out it was going to be a tight fit but my boss was just fine with holding it for her in the store since she had paid for it for a week or two until she could get someone with a bigger car to help her with the TV He sends me out with a sticky note to get her name and number since she didnt want to come back inside  spacer  spacer  OL So now whatMe Ill just get your name and number and well put a SOLD sticker on the TV until you can come pick it upOL Okay but what about my moneyMe Huh Thinking uh ohOL Can I get my money back I dont know if Ill have someone who can take it out of my car for me when I get homeMe Well we certainly will hold the TV for you until youre ready to pick it up since youve already paid for it We wont be able to hold it for your otherwise Its worth noting here that she originally asked if she could put a deposit down to hold the TV But as it was only  and my boss had been burned by this more than once before on higher ticket items he doesnt allow deposits for items anymoreOL I know but Im worried about getting it out of my car Can I just get my money backMe Oh boy Im sorry but youll have to come back in and talk with my boss about this  spacer  spacer  The shop has a no returns policy My boss sometimes makes exceptions for some electronics when a customer worries if itll work or not but hes otherwise firm against returns This is due to the nature of the business Someone pays for a consigned item we send a sale check out to the consignor then that person decides to try to return it afterward isnt exactly good for business Either way I couldnt give it to her so she came back inside and gave him the same story He said almost the exact same things as I did but she was adamant yet still nice about it so he gave her the return for the TV and the remote She didnt ask for a return on the plaque and he later told me he wouldnt have anyway She thanks us and leaves   spacer  spacer  We were both more than slightly frustrated and irritated at the whole situation At the very least we didnt have to move the TV Its still sitting in the shop looking for a home Poor thingspacer  spacerTLDR Self conscious TV develops disorder after not fitting in an old ladys car All it plays

ScaldingSoup,6,7,1rha57,41,So several  years ago I worked for a very popular lingerie store  This store didnt pay commission but would give us more or less hours per week based on sales performance  My sales performance was VERY good  I got more hours a week than most people  During the holiday season we had a lot of seasonal employees as any big retail store normally does  One of the workers hired seasonally was this lady who was a lot older than the rest of us  This was not the problem  Her hair was bleached blonde and growing out showing obvious roots and styled in a feathered fashion  She did not know how to wear makeup and what she wore did not flatter her  In this store our dress code was all black   She wore skirts with no stockings but with slouch socks and yeah that was a hot mess  People began to call her the missing link as in to the s because of the hair and her wearing slouch socks that were probably black in the s but grey now  Reading this you may think that I judged her based on this or have some animosity for people older than me  I do not but this just sort of describes what she looked like because it is important  Black Friday rolls around and she wears her normal dress of skirt slouch socks and whatnot  Surrounding her socks are these bells that jingle  She begins waving panties in the air helicopter style like a stripper chanting what the sale is as customers are passing by  One of our gay male managers passes me by and mutters so only I can hear it I want her out  I was dying trying not to laugh at the situation and meanwhile feeling very embarrassed for her  Everywhere she walked she jingledSome time during her short career with the lingerie store she found my phone number on the schedule  I guess they werent giving her enough hours because she had the nerve to leave me a message asking me for some of mine  Weirdest person I ever worked with hands down she takes the cake,1385447267.0,Lingerie Store  weirdest employee ever,48,talesFromRetail,top_week
meguriau,22,16,1refgz,38,Hi TFR Todays Tales from a Hat Boutique httpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailsearchqmeguriauamprestrictsronampsortnewamptall story is brought to you directly from where the magic happens I was really happy with myself but dont have any coworkers to share the moment with Here goes   BackgroundTwo years ago I was employed by an Australian designer brand to sell hats at its flagship store Worn by various celebrities ranging from Hillary Clinton to Sandra Bullock the store attracts a large number of tourists as well as affluent locals The majority of the customers Ive had have been pleasant however there have been interesting characters and even a few nasty pieces of work discontent customers that have come by This collection of tales will be a mixture of my interactions with the most wonderful and absolutely nasty people I have met within this timeStoryThe weather this morning had been rather unremarkable for a spring day overcast with intermittant bouts of sun or rain As a store specialising in hats this does have an detrimental impact on the frequency of local customers On quiet days like these I typically wind up gardening this term is not a euphemism for indulging in cannabinoids behind the desk but rather a routine that consists of spraying the hats with water to reshape them and trimming any stray fibres poking out of the weave It can be mindless and therapeutic at first but only at first Every time you think that hairy hat is as smooth as it will ever be flipping it over reveals another fibre reaching out like that kids in class who knows everything that everyone likes to dislike As a completionist the process invokes feelings of frustration rage and selfpity After this ordeal I often hide behind the counter to take an extended tea break This place is fantastic for a sneaky snack because it faces the entrance is quite elevated so that people cant peer over easily and I can emerge from behind as gracefully as a meerkat when the sensor goes off if need beOne bite into a delicious banana muffin baked by my mother the sensor by the door went off I forcefully swallowed the mouthful with a swig of water emerged from behind the counter to be greeted by an elderly couple poking their heads into the store from the entrance and examining our wares Lets call the man DHS for designer hat snob DHS and wife it so seemed had decided that actually entering the store was too mainstream and clearly blocking the entrance was a great option Pet peeve  Maybe a minute or two had passed when DHS had a revelation He decided to bellow from the entrance to convey his disappointmentHB EXCUSE ME YOU ONLY HAVE LADIES HATSThe brand does stock mens hats In fact there is a display window showcasing the more popular mens styles which he had clearly missed In some ways it is understandable as fedoras are worn by a lot of women lately Unfortunately this question gets asked of me a few times every shift even though there are pictures from photoshoots of manly male models wearing similar hats in the backdrop some of them topless for good measure Pet peeve M We do stock mens hats Theyre just up the back near the counter and to your rightThis appeared to pique his interest Without so much a thank you DHS and wife scuttled over to the mens section Pet peeve  I aimed a friendly smile in their direction to counter the feeling of frustration growing insideDHS rams the nearest ivorywhite  panama hat on his headDHS Its too smallM The mens panamas are sized and do also with internal adjustment so if yoDHS gruntI continued to give him the best smile I could muster Pet peeve DHS flips the swing tickets over to look at the price and flips outDHS Ridiculous This is more expensive than a Borsalino For those of you that are unaware Borsalino is a Italianmade designer hat brandHe stared at me expectantly as though the distasteful look on his face could conjure a discount To be completely honest I know nothing about Borsalino apart from a few basic shapes they carry but of course I wasnt going to let my ignorance be known Knowing I wouldnt get a sale from him anyway I decided to not dignify him with a response and froze my face in a customer service smile Without anything to argue against the pair let out indignant huffs and made their way back to the entrance I sat back down and took a huge bite out of my muffin it tasted like victory I felt like a Magicarp that had finally recognised its shortcomings and slash those that have been laughing at me in the face Later during the day I decided to google the Borsalino online boutique to look at similar hats My findings were interesting For his statement to be true there were two possiblities Yes the hat was more expensive than some similar shaped Borsalino hats However the hat he was referring to was a papier hat  or about AUD  basically a pseudo panama hat made of rice paper and not toquilla palm The panama hats Borsalino sold were in

Rocknocker,4,13,1rmjui,25,Obligatory first time post long time lurker inevitable wall of text Backstory A long time ago in a galaxy pretty close to home that is if you call Baja Canada home I worked for a company that did railroad retrievals Of course this was back a few decades and such companies no longer exist nor does the concept odd thing that but it was a way for a cornfed mutant such as myself and my comutants from the Planet Huge we formed a good portion of the front line of our high school football team so much so that myself and two others were called the HalfTon Squad so dont even think about fucking with us to earn a few bucks and keep us well into cases of Old Style and a bottle or two of J BavetAhemAnyways we were all more or less gainfully employed with a company referenced above that did railroad retrievals that is if it fell off out of or away from the railcar it was ours that is if the boss fella won the lot at auction Since we lived in a rather largish city just north of the City of the Big Shoulders Hog Butcher to the World there was an amazing amount of commerce shipped via rail that passed through our little slice o Heaven and an amazing amount of things that went awry in shipping that we procured Bit of hard cheese to keep any sort of inventory going one week a railcar load of canned vegetables the next week a load of spirited and disorderly lumber but typically the sort of scratchndent stuff that was still perfectly usable however not entirely pristine Needless to say wholesale derailments were like the arrival of a Chicken Delight truck for us The store was a of the basic Quonset Hut variety just enough to keep the rain and rats at bay but it lived adjacent to a rail spur which gave it trumps in the local wholesaleretailbuyithereyoucheapbastards market So the owner in a fit of frugality actually purchased some rolling stock and we used that along with a  vintage pupengine puppuppuppup to ride the rails and collect our bounty for sale In other words we loaded up an absolutely dilapidated boxcar last seen hauling mass bovinity to butchery with whatever the railgods deemed fit to lose and what lots our boss could win only to chug smokily back to ground zero and put out the signs extolling the bounty of what was available this weekBackbackstory the boxcar in the manner of The Grinch of Xmas fame stink stank stunk It was noisome It was mephitic malodorous and foul It offended ones olfactory sense It reekedAnd the air apparent wasnt much helped by the  mutants that loaded and unloaded it each day no forklifts or pallet jacks we were much cheaper being selftesting and repairing Remember we were and mostly still are huge We lived in the north a bastion of great European gastronomic traditions like headcheese beer black radishes beer pickled beef hearts beer liver dumplings beer pickled eggs and beer Couple a lunch like that with C summer sun and youve got a recipe in which the Pentagon would be interestedWhich finally bring us to our antagonist Mr Smith not a real name more a nom de guerre his real name of course was Mr Super Dickhead Mr SD ran a consignmentpawnIts worth  let me give you  on that shop just down the road and was unfortunately one of our best customers Best notice the quotation marks meaning he bought a load of stuff each week only to be uppriced and sold in his shop and was the most irksome annoying irritating and infuriating creature evolution ever shrugged up on aerobic shores And cheap Did I mention he was cheap Cheap to the point of squeezing nickels until they bled He was so tight he hummed when the wind blew He also demanded first chance at what we brought back often backing in his  Dodge by into our lot knocking over whatever signs stacks or piles we had unloaded that day so that he could get first choice and get free loading by a trio of less than amused employees who had to clean up after his weekly excursionsAnyways Stav Orel and I were once again unloading the boxcar after a typical days haul  cases of Libbys best somewhat dented  pallets worth of Sara Lee  slightly injured packs of Pabsts finest Blue Ribbon minus those lost in shipment ie ended up in the trunks of our cars an entire boxcars worth of pine furniture from Sullys of Minnesota tools from Snap On water heaters from AO Smith and about  hogsheads of freshly minted Wisconsin cheddar He Mr SD wanted the lot And he wanted us to transfer it from the boxcar to his truckThe owner of course blinded by avarice grabbed the proffered cash and left it to us to move approximately  metric tons of goods some  meters for free from place one to place two Put that shit in his truck and get him outta here We were not amused nor were we being paid any extra in fact it was company policy that You buy it you tote it for insurance and other pecuniary reasons for this hitherto unknown service that no one to date or since has demanded  Remember the baneful boxcar It was a rabbits warren of culdesacs lost passages and endless Moebius trails of lost and dented items There was no light as we had plywooded over the cracks in the walls and wallpapered them with a festive floral print that had fallen off a railroad consignment a few months back it was hot and virtually airless Thats when Mr SD wandered in loudly complaining that it was taking us too long to load his stuff we were all idiots and complained bitterly about our apparent genetic history It was then the shit hit the fan or more exactly Stav let loose a barrage of weaponsgrade black radish beer and liver dumpling flatus shimmied out of the secret floor trapdoor while I subtly eased the side doors just a bit closer so Mr SD would not lose a single whiff of our appreciation Inevitably it was pity that stayed our hand Pity that lunch lasted only an hour and we tired of hearing Mr SD wailing to be let out TLDR Man who abuses rail yard employees gets a case of the Boxcar

SongBird,5,5,1rjwkm,19,Background I work at a fairly well known department store I have been working in the handbag department for a little over a year I have a good grasp on what brands we carry in the store If we dont have the brand in store I can look it up on the system to see if its a brand the company carries The story Its about thirty minutes to close and an older couple come over to my register with a return Now our return policy is extremely lenient we will basically accept a return within  days of purchase Even without a receipt as long as we can find the product on the system I take the purse and look for the tag and cannot find it on the bag It is also a brand that I have never seen before me Maam Do you happen to have the tagslady no I threw them outMe ok do you have a receipt or even the card it was purchased onlady no we got it from here last month I payed cash I need to return and get a new purse because Im allergic to wool mitesme i understand that maam Im not familiar with this brad if you would just give me a moment see if I can find it on the system I search for the product on the system and even go to the website and still cant find any mention of this brand me Im really sorry maam but this item isnt on the system and I cant even find the brand I cannot return this item lady look around for it I bought it here last month and payed  for itAt this time its about fifteen minutes till close i spend about five minutes wandering around the department knowing full well that we didnt sell this bradme Im sorry maam but we dont have this handbag or brand Im afraid i cant do the return husband give her store credit then me I cant do that but Ill gladly call my manager for youhe nods so i call my manager and he tells me the exact same thing I told them They are still expecting store credit towards another purse because of her medical condition My manager ended up having to stop what he was doing and come to my rescue He calmly explained that they couldnt return it and they would not be receiving store credit since its a brand that the company has never carried They finally leave but I heard the woman keep saying that she bought at this store Im thinking that she bought it at one of our competitors and got our stores confused I dont like assuming everyone is trying to rip us off but I do get my fair share of thosetldr Im optimistic that some people just dont know whats going on rather than assume people are trying to rip us off ,1385529161.0,I like to assume ignorance over malicious intent,24,talesFromRetail,top_week

Dannythegirl,6,7,1rh77t,16,I dont know if this is the right place to post this but I needed to share Long time lurker of this subreddit On my phone sorry for wall I am a customer in this story but former multiyear serviceretail employeeToday I was grocery shopping with my two very little children Not a huge chain store but prominent in my state for supporting local foods Many locations I got in line to check out after an eventful and frustrating trip around the store with the kids There was an elderly man checking out ahead of me He was friendly and talkative to my kids and was asking me about my tattoos while we were waiting The cashier was probably  spacey but very sweet woman When it was old guys turn to check out I overheard their conversation at the register and it was obvious they were both long time veterans to the store The man had some trouble checking out He rang his credit card through the machine multiple times while chatting with the cashier and he seemed confused Eventually she explained that he didnt have to keep swiping his card and that his transaction was complete In the mean time she was scanning my items The cashier chatted up a storm with me too Asking about my kids while I was trying to wrangle them I was getting a little impatient at this point because my  and  year old were ready to get the hell out of there but I listened to her stories with patience She was kind tooWhen she finished scanning my food I pulled my card out to run through the machine but it was asking for a signature when I hadnt scanned my card yet Me there must be a mistake I havent slid my card through but its already asking for a signatureCashier no you did you must have forgot looks at screen you swiped your America expressMe No I dont have an Amex see Oh no did the man in front of me swipe his card while you were ringing me upCashier uh oh that must have been what happenedShe looked panicked but printed the receipt and said Ill just do this AND SIGNED THE RECEIPTCashier Hell be okay he can be so spacey Dont even worry about itShe at first folded up the receipt like she was going to trash it but I asked her if that was really ok and that I could wait for a manger She unfolded the receipt and told me not to worry There was a long line behind me and frankly I was ready to get the fuck out of there with my crazy kids I asked her are you sure I feel uncomfortable She told me not to worry and to go ahead and leave And I did I think her career might have ended todayTLDR Elderly man in line ahead of me accidentally paid for my groceries cashier eventually realized but didnt give a fuck to fix it I got free groceries EDITUPDATE I can see how it looks like I was unsympathetic in my post I was in fact horrified I know the groceries werent free I just did not pay for them In my car I wrote down the time my total  and what I thought the mans total was before me  and the name of the cashier I should have stuck around and put my foot down but I was flustered and unsure how to proceed  I was planning on calling when I got home and totally forgot about the whole thing until I was in bed redditing from my phone late at nightThis morning I called and spoke with a manager giving him all of my information I told him I would happily come back and pay for the groceries and to please make sure the man did not actually get charged hoping the cashier took the issue to the manager after I left He said he will look into the receipts from last night and give me a call back I will update again when I hear from him,1385444538.0,I think her career might have ended today,23,talesFromRetail,top_week
TaterSaladDelta,9,9,1re9xa,17,  OK so this is basically the climax of my time at the tent The next two stories arent quite as grand but they are funny   So this was a few years ago now way back when I first started helping at the tent We were sitting around eating some greasy takeout from the chinese place in the shopping complex we were stationed in front of when we saw him   He came in skipping he owned the place His real name was fairly normal so my brother nicknamed him Tyrone This kid wasinteresting First off he wasnt the best dressed OK I understand that not everyone can afford fitting clothes his shirt was huge his shorts were wellshort and his flip flops were a few sizes too small Whatever I dont judge  He was kind of dirty and looked like he needed a good hosing This was forgivable kids get dirty and some dont have access to showers I get it  Then I saw the hat  It was a flashy hot pink Add a layer of sparkly rhinestones Then the centerpiece a cutout of Miley Cyrus This was Hannah Montana era cyrus Premium shit   The hat was ok If he likes the queen of Disney more power to him But HE WAS SINGING SONG AFTER SONG AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS HOLY SHIT I mean maybe if his singing was good but no it was painful   So after watching him wander the tent for a few laps yes he went around at least  times I noticed something He was behaving oddly Not shifty like he was going to steal something butlike a girl  He would do the usual Nyugh Im soo hawt walk that girls sometimes do the floppy hand the rest all your weight on one leghip move he missed not one nuance of the female behavior I was astounded To my narrow  year old mind he was gay The gay of the gays Now Im not so sure but then I was convinced   My brother and his friend were convinced too but they were so bored being in there constantly for  days that anything was cause for immediate judgement  So fast forward to checkout he swaggers up to the table and makes his payment He smacks his gum and pulls out a Miley Cyrus wallet I know you shouldnt judge anyone but cmon I couldnt help but think whatwhat is he doing withoh myley cyrusheh  He then lingered for about an hour and pole danced on our tent supports Yeah Im not really going to explain that one He didnt do too much after that but hes been coming every year since then about  or  years now and hes lost the girl mannerisms and Miley swag but he still compulsively lies about stuff  Antwon wasnt as crazy he was just a short portly little guy with a s porn stache that followed Tyrone around on his schwinn bicycle He rides it to and from the tent every year and I see him all year around and hes always on that bike Youd think he would get skinnier right I mean he always is riding Well no He just gets bigger But its ok everyone loves Antwon  I actually do feel bad for Tyrone because he doesnt have a whole lot I was actually inspired by him he left me with a better understanding of the other side of life I saw the way kids like him have to compromise they have to use what they have to make ends meet and theyre happy doing it He had access to a Miley Cyrus hat and sequinencrusted wallet and damnit he was fabulous   Wherever you are Tyrone youve helped me see the best of both worldsPart onehttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsrcuvbubbycelebratesthethofjulyPart  coming soon What should part  be Mervin Gerfin The little badass who couldnt or Kenny the Lion King Ill do what you guys want to hear more,1385352236.0,The fireworks tent from hellPART  sequel to Bubby celebrates the fourth of july,26,talesFromRetail,top_week

BreakfastWithReddit,13,20,1rcwf1,11,This is my first post here and as you can read my flair I work fast food parttime and Ive been working here for the past  months While this story may not be about my boss or any customers I just want to share with you how my coworker well call here Sarah to protect her identity has irritated me so much since I started working hereSo here I am an  yearold male working at a restaurant tonight and for this month I have to work the drivethru by using the headset to take orders making drinks and making desserts sometimes all at the same time My hands can get pretty tied up easily once there is a reasonable line of cars lined up Sometimes my manager swings by to help make desserts when he sees that I am making drinks and taking orders at the same timeMeanwhile Sarah is working the window only transacting the money credit cards etc and handing our customers their food Quite obviously I have a bigger job than her and as a human I can make mistakes or be slow at times but its only to provide the same excellent service to each customer I talk to on the headset For example I might miss the chance to make the earlier customers drinks while I am taking the previous customers order For a few seconds of making the drinks delivering them and apologizing for the wait customers are usually very understanding since I expressed excellent customer service when I talked to them via headset they sometimes compliment me on my customer service and I am very grateful that they compliment me and understand when they see I am busy with another customer on the headsetNow insert Sarah into the equation and she stresses me out when I try to do my job If the food was already delivered to the customer at the window and theyre waiting on me to make their drinks I would most likely have another customer giving their order to me on the headset While I am talking to the customer on the headset and I am trying to switch glances from the drink that could overflow and back at the POS where I record the customers order It can be hard at times for me because I really dont want to screw up the drink by letting the soda tea or lemonade overflow or make the liquid too high and when I would punch in the buttons the liquid would spill out of the top This kind of stuff happens frequently and apparently Sarah hates when I make mistakes like thisShe will tell me through a strained voice that I needed to make the drinks much faster and she has been doing this to me all the time but I really want to tell her that maybe I dont want the drink to overflow or maybe that I dont want to make the wrong drink and waste the cup or maybe that I dont want to keep asking the customer what they last said because I couldnt hear what they said when she pretty much shouts at me It makes the customer and I irritated when I have to ask himher again what they recently ordered and I really had enough of her annoyed toneThere were times when I would be taking an order and she would stress on me and I would make a mistake on the customer Im taking an order from When this happens the customers would complain that their order is wrong when it was read back to them for confirmation Sarah would have to ask for a managers card to change the order at the window and then she would deathstare me as if I stepped on her iPhone I really cant say what I feel against her because Im working on the headset which is on  of the time and the customers at the window can hear everything I say and I really wouldnt want to say anything I could regret It just makes me mad because Im doing all of these jobs where one mistake can happen here and there while she only stands there doing her window job and yelling at me when I cant finish a drink for a few seconds She doesnt even help me finish my drinks which would be nice but she only stands there with her claw of a right hand waiting for a cup to snatch She always takes the cup right out of my hand even when its not done so fast that it seems she is more pissed than I am at her It makes me so mad that she doesnt even lend a hand and she just stands there being so ignorant of me while I work  jobs and her job only takes  secondsIm really trying to do my job here and I really try to do everything I can to treat all of our customers with the same quality respect everyone else deserves Before she started bitching at me I tried to interact with her while were on breaks but she mindlessly stares at her phone while wolfing down a chicken sandwich while I try to talk to her She only gave a few quick and blunt words to me and she was obviously disinterested in the interactions so I stopped seeing that I cant break the wall that is her selfishnessThis post is probably very long for you guys and this is more of a rant about Sarah but here is the part that youve probably been waiting for I just wanted to give more background information and context to my situationIt was  pm tonight and my shift was going to end at  pm and there were quite a few customers waiting in line to have their orders taken I had to make a quick largesize Diet Dr Pepper for a customer waiting at the window and one person was telling me to put American cheese bacon lettuce tomato wheat bun and extra pickles on a regular chicken sandwich which had me pressing a lot of buttons At this point it seemed that Sarah had enough of my dawdling and she finally decided to help me finish the drink which was still fizzing at the top I wanted to make sure the customer didnt get cheated for an underfilled large drink and I didnt want it to spill at the same time but after she took my hand to hold it under the Diet Dr Pepper nozzle and tried to shove a lid on the sucker she pulled her hand back too fast and the soda spilled all over my uniform She quickly looked away and went back to her post acting as if it never happened and she left my sticky self in a state of complete rage I wanted to shout profanities kick and scream at her but I quickly suppressed my extreme anger because the customer was still sitting in her car in complete shock of what happened My manager quickly came over and he immediately assumed it was my accident and he told me to clean up in the restroom I was shaking in rage and the cold wet feeling of soda when I cleaned myself up My shift ended when I exited the restroom I immediately clocked out in anger and embarrassment and drove home still smelling of Dr Pepper and my hands stuck to my wheelTLDR Sarah my coworker has some kind of a bad grudge against me and I dont know why After repeatedly telling me to hurry up with the drinks I was making she finally decided to help me for the first time to finish a large Diet Dr Pepper and she spilled the entire drink on me and she did not take responsibility for it,1385314811.0,My coworker is a terrible person,31,talesFromRetail,top_week

gas station is in a really dumb place Were in the main Highway of our city which is why were a  store but were in an upper middle class neighborhood right by the middle and high school I dont see much traffic between midnight and four am That is until some shitty little dive bar called Shotz opened up somewhere behind us Somewhere because theres a huge parking lot behind us that situates a Kmart a pizza Hut a burger restaurant a funeral home yeah idk either and then the bar is somewhere in that mess So anyway between  amp  I get a nice hour of drunks Our local police force is always really nice They know that its either me  lbs female or J scrawny but seriously awesome little white guy working alone I work the weekends so I get the worst drunk traffic The officer who has our district has taken to sitting in the high school parking lot across the street during this hour with their headlights trained on our store I seriously give these guys so much free coffee The usual weekend officer stopped in and introduced his ride along that he had fresh out of the Academy Super nice guy Gave them coffee and a bag of donuts I was about to toss we get them fresh every day so they arent dried out if they were bagged and thanked them when they said theyd be keeping an eye out for me Around ish they had nabbed a drunk driver yay team and I was watching them do the field check stuff from across the street Now a quick inside to give you an idea of our store layout Im on my phone but will make a crappy picture in paint later and post it in an edit The cashier area is right smack in the middle of the store When you walk in theres the newspaper stand and the back counter area to your right coffee to your left and if you go waaaay left our bathrooms are down a little hall You have to walk around to your right following the counters to leave through the exit door This is so you cant sneak out behind us and steal something Queue am I have a college guy vomiting in the bathroom and a super nice guy whos browsing our snack food quietly In comes this super drunk middle aged black male He starts hanging on the newspaper stand and trying to climb over the back counter wall its about  feet high He will be Drunk Guy DG DG Hey How much for a cab to Menomininity I assumed menominee which is a city maybe twenty minutes from us Me Im not sure We can call a cab and ask Do you have a certain cab company you like to use DG just look some numbers up for me on the Internet Me I dont have the Internet here I have a phone book though you can borrow Please note this was NOT the answer he was looking for DG NIGGA FUCK YOUR PHONE BOOK Yeah Okay He proceeded to grab my newspaper stand and throw it behind him into the coffee counter and started storming off towards the bathrooms On his way he took out the fruit stand the magazine rack and the little employee break table in the hallway Drunk college kid comes tearing out of the bathroom That black guy grabbed me by the jacket pulled me out of the stall then ripped your toilet paper dispenser off the wall and threw it at me Uhh What The nice guy has been quietly picking up all the scattered fruit despite me telling him he didnt have to because I have to throw it all away anyway insists hell stay until this guy leaves Me Yeah I dont have the time for this Im just calling the police I get on the phone with none emergency explain my situation and ask if officer X can send his ride along over just to help keep this guy in control until another officer can come in Not even a minute later RideAlong is jogging across the street as officer X is piling the drunk driver in his back seat and I guess radioing the location for another officer DG comes out of the bathroom all sheepish and apologetic And then he sees the officer DG AW THE FUCK YOU YOU DIRTY ASS SKANK WHORE BITCHthe officer calmly cuffs DG who surprisingly didnt fight I sell nice guy some candy and put his coffee on my nightly expense College kid dipped out at some point I think he was underaged A second officer shows up and runs the drunk guys info as Im talking to RideAlong for my statement Turns out DG has a warrant out on him in North Carolina for skipping out on parole His friends apparently got tired of his drunk ass and left him at the bar Apparently Shotz has been doing last call at  like normal but then locking their restrooms so drunks cant hang out in there and they can clean them and leave faster They also havent been letting the drunk patrons use their phone For both things they explain that there is a gas station open about a block away with bathrooms and a phone Yeah Screw them DG got hauled off I burned a copy of the security footage for the officer and clean everything up The DM lives down the road so he stopped in for his deer hunting coffee and snacks and was pretty livid when I explained the situation I guess he knows the owner of the bar and gave him a call about his bartenders I thankfully had last night

Tufty,35,63,1rdse5,303,This is a story from long long ago that I am copying from another website that I posted it to before discovering Reddit I thought you all might enjoy itThis happened a while ago but it just popped into my head so Im gonna do my best to remember itI used to work nights on the checkout of a  hour supermarket Now in this particular store there were certain things that you couldnt do on the checkout without a managers key and a code generally anything that would change the total by more than  including voiding items would require you to call a managerSince we worked nights they gave the key and the code to  women who worked on the cigarette kiosk because they had worked there for a long time there was always at least one of them working and they didnt want us bothering the on duty night manager every time there was any mistake All worked fine normallyUntil the day that neither of these women were in Did the management organise anyone else who had a code to be in the area Did they buggeryThere were  of us working that night and the other  were quite new on the department We did our best but I was the first to go down A customer had read the price on a baby stroller wrong and wanted it voided I put a call out for the on duty manager then apologised to the people in my line and explained that it might take a couple of minutes The line wasnt very long because it was getting quite late There was a little grumbling but everyone seemed fairly understanding minutes pass I put out another call for the manager to come down URGENTLY I advise everyone to start going through the other  tills I am starting to get worried but we still have  tills running so its not the end of the world The lines get longerThen one of the other girls accidentally scans something through twice It happens the scanners sometimes just glitch The item cost more than  and bam  checkouts are locked down I direct people through the lone surviving till The poor girl on there was clearly struggling but there was nothing else to be done I get hold of a store phone and call the manager directly No answer I call again Nothing I put another call out over the speakers Apologise to all customersThen it happens The last till goes down Another double scan The line is  people deep And this is at midnight when its odd to have more than  customer at a time I try to call the manager again Nada I call a team leader explain the problem and beg him to find me a manager any manager I turn to the ever increasing group of customers and do my best to explain whats going on I am practically on my knees begging them for forgiveness Some fo them have been waiting for  minutes I break from the script and try to explain as a human being that there isnt anything I could do I wish there was something anything I could do We cant open any other tills They are all shut down and even if I had the key to turn them on all of our log ins are locked into these tillsFinally someone saunters to the tills They arent a manager They had been sent down by the on duty manager because he had heard that we had too many customers and needed another checkout operator Im getting frantic I send her back to find the managerTime passes People have been waiting for over half an hour now and you can imagine what that looks like Thankfully none of the customers are directing their anger at us but they are all very very angryEventually the manager turns up All good right NopeHe takes one look at the scene And walks away The customers see my face Now they know what the manager looks likeThere is more of the same Frantic phone calls announcements over the speakers Ten minutes that feel like an eternity later the manager calmy walks back into sight and immediately gets collared by the crowd The only good thing that came out of this moment was when several customers took time out of their ranting to defend me it seems my pleas for forgiveness workedThe manager is barely listening to the poor people He keeps interrupting them trying to push blame off of himself This was the first he had heard of the situation Luckily all of the customers had seen me doing everything possible to get hold of him The manager eventually rolls his eyes and wanders off to the office to pick up the keysA full  minutes after the last till went down we finally got the code and unlocked the tills Did the manager apologise to the customers Nope Did he offer them anything to make up for the wait Nope Did he apologise to us working on the checkouts for putting us through all that Take a guessAs I rang through the customers I did everything in my meager power to make it up to them It wasnt much but I would accept any coupon they had even if they werent for our store I would accidentally mistype the reduction codes to give them more money off If something wouldnt scan Id just pretend I hadnt noticed and give it to them I knew it would mess up the inventory and probably get me in trouble but I just didnt care at this point When we cleared the line I sent the other  girls off for a break and told them to take an extra few minutes while they were at it When they were gone and I was sure I was alone I spent a minute or two hiding under the till whimpering ,1385338587.0,Cashiers Nightmare,366,talesFromRetail,top_week
GlowingBall,43,77,1rioer,300,These are my Tales of Retail Loss PreventionPart Three  Citizen Snips Aka  The Pants AquaticAs a recap for those of you who have never read one of my stories before  I am a male in the midwest who is on the wrong side of his twenties and works retail loss prevention for a major retailer one of the Big   I am underpaid for what I do but enjoy my job none the less  A majority of my time is spent wandering the floor or watching middle aged moms shop for clothing far too skimpy on them via CCTV closed circuit television or security cameras  Every once in awhile I get a case that is just so mind blowingly WTF that I have to share  This story opens up with me doing just as I said above  watching people on CCTV  It is a blisteringly cold afternoon so the customers far more content to stay in their warm homes and snuggled beneath their blankets are few and far between  I as the ever watchful hawk of justice that I am was busy playing a Marvel version of Candy Crush Saga  My job provides me the liberty of slacking off a good amount and my boss is rather lenient as long as I continue to bring in a good amount of stops per month  I am sitting there diligently trying to match up small colored tiles with one another when I am startled by a sudden ring  the phone is going off  Now the phone going off is common place  We get tons of calls a day ranging from the frozen dairy department calling to tell us a temperature alarm is going off we knowit goes off for us as well to people asking us to deactivate a door alarm we also knowwe see you standing at the door  This happened to be a call from one of the few places that doesnt call us often  the meat department  The guy on the other end a tall black man with more muscle than he knows what to do with calls to tell us that there is a guy standing in front of the freshly butchered meat  The guy has refused any help the meat employee has offered and continues to say he is just browsing for over ten minutes  This strikes me as rather odd  Who just hangs out around the meat department  I quickly devise a plan for the situation  I tell the employee to walk into the back so I could see just what the person was going to do  The employee hangs up and walks over to the man to let him know he is going to be into the back and to ring the bell if he needs anything  No sooner than when he had walked into the back but the man glanced around and then walked behind the counter  My adrenaline already began to rush as my suspicions came to fruition  he was going to steal  Oh shit here we go  I declared only to watch in confusion and frustration as he walked right past all the glass displays full of meat and right over to the lobster tank  Now if you arent familiar with these tanks they are exactly just what the name implies  a water filled tank full of live lobsters we sell by the pound  Their claws are bound and they just kind of hang out crawling all over one another  Kids love to sit there and watch themNo wayis he really going to I whispered as I watched on in awe  Sure enough he reached right into the live lobster display tank we have  After a moment of fishing around he plucked the lobster he wanted from the tank and pulled it out of the water  Before I could even make heads or tails of the situation he glanced around once more and shoved the lobster right down the front of his pants  The guy whom shall be hence forth called Lobster Johnson then proceeded to shuffle run his way out of the meat department and through the grocery department towards the front of the store  The only way I can really describe how he ran was a forward version of Zoidbergs shuffle  All he was missing was yelping out Woop woop woop woop loudly as he went  Needless to say he wasnt too hard to stop  I may not be in the best shape of my life but I can still move quicker than a guy with a large lobster squirming around in his pants  He didnt fight me at the door or even try to argue what he was doing  After all it is kind of hard to argue that you arent stealing when you have a large lobster shaped bulge in your pantsBonus icing on top of the cake I usually ask the person why they are stealing  It usually wont change anything but it fulfills my curiosity and keeps them talking which usually calms them down a bit  This guy tried to say that he was stealing the lobster for his kidsHis kids have some expensive tastes,1385496989.0,Loss Prevention Tales Pt   Citizen Snips,377,talesFromRetail,top_week

LIVESINCANADA,108,75,1rbn62,251,So I used to work for a large department store in the frontend cash and customer service mainly At our location we had  cash registers  of which were express  items or less and the other  were regular belts We also had  selfcheckout machines that were watched over by  cashier at a time This particular day I was the one who got to watch over them Now I dont remember what time of year it was or even what time of day it was but I do remember that it was very busy We had every single register open and we still had lines of  people at each register When Im watching the selfcheckouts Im watching a screen that shows me what each customer has entered in order to make sure that the pack of toilet paper they placed under their cart actually gets scanned I also have to help people out when they have coupons as  of the time the machine doesnt recognize them as well as any and all questions about their purchasespricespayment methods So basically Im busy running around the whole timeSo this day while Im watching the selfcheckouts two women who were next in the seemingly neverending line come to one of the machines nearest to me One of the women is pregnant and the other looks like an older women I found out it was the pregnant womens mother Nothing note worthy happens with them until theyre at their last item It was a heavier item at the bottom of their cart The older women waves at me and asks if I could lift the heavy item for them as the daughter is pregnant and she has some illness I think she said cancer Now they choose to come to a selfcheckout machine A machine where you are supposed to check yourself out They didnt think to wait in one of the  other lines where youd have a dedicated cashier whod be happy to lift and scan all your large and heavy items for you No they decided to come to the self checkouts and get the cashier who had to watchhelp  customers simultaneously to lift and scan their items So all that went through my head but what came out of my mouth was Sure no problem and I started walking towards them they were  feet away from me I take not more than  steps before the daughter says Oh its alright mom Ive got this and then she bends down and picks up the heavy item herself The mom notices that I didnt match Usain Bolts world record speeds while walking towards them and says to me What awful service you have forcing a pregnant woman to lift ltitem namegt by herselfI just shrug it off and inform them that in the future if theyd like more hands on service that going to one of the nonselfcheckout registers would probably be better The two women finish paying and as they walk by me on their way out the mom drops this doozy on meI guess some peoples mothers just didnt raise them rightWhat I dont know what she expected me to do maybe scream at her daughter and push her out of the way as she attempted to lift the large item I knew with that statement she was just trying to provoke me so I ignored her Its been years since thats occurred and its still the experience from retail that I remember best,1385257598.0,Self checkouts are more trouble than theyre worth,326,talesFromRetail,top_week

DolfyuttSrednaz,65,59,1rh8hc,244,I have got to say after working  years in retail parents should be responsible for their childrens actions I have seen so many kids acting like demons that have just spawned from a dimension full of pointy sticks being shoved up their asses but I never blame the kids I usually dont even blame the parents because kids are kids but when customers blatantly let their kids run around like Sonic on meth I blame the parents that is why we have an announcement that plays every few minutes reminding customers to keep their little shits in line So when a customer like the one I had comes in I usually inform my manager who will be called Jared of the situation and he watches the kid from a distance A middleaged couple stumbles into the store with their  year old son They head off to furniture but their son makes a beeline to toys I immediately call Jared and let him know that this little tornado is heading to toys and he should try to contain the damage as much as possible Before the kid makes it to toys he stops over in the Halloween section and starts putting on masks and runs around the store trying to scare the other customers After  complaints Jared stops the kid and drags him to his parents who dont give one shit nor a giggle about what my manager has to say and wave him off The kid bolts towards toys and stars ripping toys down off the shelf The floor looks like a miniature Antietam by the time he is finished Now he has an armload of toys and decides to take them to the bathroom Once in there he places them on the floor and proceeds to urinate on them Jared walks in on him finishing up and drags the kid back to his parents leaving a trail of piss footprints behind him Jared tells the parents what he did and that they have to clean up the mess This switches the parents into rage mode They just cannot BELIEVE that their kid would do this And he will be punished severely when they get home Jared tells them calmly I am punishing you not your child You guys made no effort to control him and even brushed me off after the first incident You guys will clean up every mess he has made and then you can leave You are no longer welcomed here They start yelling profanities at him and their kid saying how this is ridiculous and they shouldnt have to put up with this After they cleaned up they left empty handed Jared received many compliments on how he handled the situation It is the second worst customers I have ever had even if I didnt directly deal with them The worst by far has to be a couple out of towners That is for another day though Thank you all for reading this and tell me about your nightmare parentschildren in your store,1385445692.0,Parents not their kids should be punished,303,talesFromRetail,top_week

arsci,56,35,1ren2b,226,All of the talk of black Friday brought up some good memories one of which involves two kids and a rather large gun safe Its kind of a long one but hopefully you all enjoy itA little background I work for a large national farm and ranch supply chain that sells a large variety of items including gun safes This particular story takes place the day after black friday of last year We have several models of these gun safes on the sales floor for customers to see with the largest at the time being an Canon Armory gun safe This thing was MASSIVE compared to the rest of our stock Our store only ever had  of them they never had an official SKUwe had to ring them under the generic merchandise SKU we had them for over a year and after we sold out we never saw them again Now all the safes are electronic keypad and locked by default from the manufacturer but they all ship with the same combination  Most people know this from either asking us to see inside the safes or by just guessing It was no secret and we encourage people to take a good lookIt was the evening and we were working on getting the store cleaned up after a very hectic day Not very many customers were left in the store and things were winding down I was working on restocking the feed when I saw the assistant manager walk by and he looked PISSED And not just end of black friday pissed but someone done fucked up pissed so I went to casually investigate only to find him talking to this giant safe Literally ear to the door asking if it was doing alright Maybe not to the safe but to the person stuck INSIDE the safe Uh Oh Things start running through my headwhy didnt he just unlock it HOW did a person get locked in it Then he pulls me asideAssistant Manager We have a situationMe A situationAM Yes a kid just locked his brother in the gunMe Soo why dont we unlock itAM It wont unlock I think the battery died but I replaced it and its still not workingMe How did he end up locked in itAM His brother apparently Hes over hiding in the feed racks last I saw Not sure where the parents are they havent made an appearance yetI went over and tried it myself and sure as crapits locked And this kid is FREAKING out for obvious reasons We tried a couple other batteries with no luck and even tried swapping the keypad out with the one from the other gun with no luck The parents FINALLY realized their kids were MIA and started asking around and very quickly we determined the kid in the safe was theirs We had taken out the power access port from the pack and passed the kid a flashlight so he could calm down a little and after swapping the keypads out and a fourth set of batteries we called in for backup Assistant Manager called the police while another employee called the safe company to see if there was another way into the safeAfter about half an hour had gone by and the fire department was about ready to cut the back off of it to get the kid out we find out from the safe manufacturer that there is a  minute lockout on the keypadif the battery dies or is removed you cant touch it for  minutes after putting the battery back in So after  long agonizing minutes of listening to this hag of a woman yell at us for not taking enough precautions the safe OPENED And this  year old kid I repeat FIFTEEN YEAR OLD KID comes bolting out of this safe straight into his mothers arms and both of them are sitting of the floor breaking down in tears The police and fire department left pretty quick after that but after the woman and her kid calmed down she UNLOADED on us Complaining about precautions safety how we need to be more responsible and how corporate needs to handle things differently Eventually we stopped herAM Maam your kid walked up to the safe entered in the combination himself that he got FROM YOU and opened the safe Your other child WILLINGLY stepped into the safe and at the exact moment he did the battery died At this point the brother closed and locked the door And its our fault for not taking enough precautionsEventually the woman and her kids left No policies changed except when we give out the combination we use her children as an example of what not to do Gives us all a good chuckle Every couple months she calls and identifies her self as the person whose kid got locked in the safe Usually shes prying to know if weve changed our policies we havent then asks for a discount on whatever she seems to be in need of which she doesnt get Oddly enough its been another year and weve had no incidents of kids locking their siblings in safes Heres to surviving another Black Friday,1385367211.0,Two kids and the gun safe,261,talesFromRetail,top_week

prickelypear,26,30,1rf2t9,200,Ive lurked for a while and decided to share one of my experiences that I can rememberI used to work in a big name retail store in a college town we usually got a lot of college kids due to this obviously and they were generally pretty laid back customers But of course we got older customers as wellOne night I had a woman with her college aged son come through my line It was close to the beginning of a new semester and she was clearly buying him items to put in his dorm or apartment so he would be set for the school semester to come One of items was a basket it looked like wicker but I dont remember what it was exactly Either way when I rang it up it came up full price  and the woman stopped meWoman Thats supposed to be on sale why is it ringing up full priceMe Im not sure Ill get one of the girls from that department to come up and shell know whats going onWhile I ring the operator to get me one of the hard lines girls on the phone or to my till I can hear the woman going on about a Clearance aisle which this store doesnt have we would put little tags buy the price tag on the shelf that stated it was on sale and for how much and how this is so aggravating Finally one of the girls walks up and the woman explains to her that the basket was on the Clearance aisle and its ringing up full price and she knows it wasnt placed there by another customer because there were many of them there The girl from hard lines informs the woman we dont have a Clearance Aisle but she knows where the baskets are and she will go lookWhile we are waiting for the other girl to come back the lanes are backing up Other employees from the floor are coming up to open new tills and help with the load and everyone is displacing from my lane to others The other girl comes back and explains to the woman that the item is not on sale the sale tag was for the baskets next to this one its full price and walks off Woman to me Well he needs the basket for his clothesMe Okay and I start to place it in the bagging areaWoman No Im not paying that price for it I want it for the Clearance price You had it on the Clearance Aisle I want it for Clearance price I dont remember what she was saying the Clearance price was but it was far below the actual price Usually if its less than  we were told just give it to them and even sometimes if its  on something worth at least  But I believe she was saying it was supposed to be Me Maam we dont have a Clearance aisle the basket is full price and I dont have a way to lower it in my systemWoman Thats bullshit if you have it on the Clearance Aisle I should get the Clearance price and you can adjust the priceMe This store doesnt have a Clearance Aisle We have items on sale and they are marked to reflect that but this basket isnt one of themWoman No That basket was on the Clearance Aisle Everything on the shelf around that basket was on sale That one is too Im getting that basket but I am not buying  for it Where are the managers This is bullshit Im not dealing with you anymoreSo with the womans son looking more and more embarrassed by his mother as this goes I call up my manager explain the situation and she comes right up I know what you are thinking because it happens all the time manager comes to front to deal with ridiculous customer customer behaves like a child explaining the issue themselves and threatens all sorts of things manager gives them what they want and customer leaves smug Not this manager she always was my favorite She gets to my till listens to the of course now calm and smiling woman explain why she wanted the manager Woman So see the basket was on the Clearance Aisle but it rings up full price If its not on Clearance then it shouldnt have been place in that aisle and since that is where I got it with many of the same placed there and I need it I expect to get it for the Clearance priceManager Smiling at her We dont have a Clearance Aisle That basket is in the home section with the other baskets We have baskets on sale in that aisle they have tags marking them But this one isnt on sale If you would like to go pick out one of the ones on sale we can put off the transaction and you can go get oneWoman smile now gone and voice getting louder as she goes NO I will NOT go pick out another basket because of your mistakes I got this basket from the Clearance Aisle and I want it for the Clearance priceManager still calm and smiling Well seeing as we still dont have a Clearance Aisle the basket is full price We arent lowering it If you want the basket its  Otherwise we will remove the basket from the purchase you can pay for your other items and leaveWoman screaming at this point Im never coming back here again but Im not done with this yet This is ridiculous Im writing corporate about both of you and how you are trying to swindle your customers I will make sure you both lose your jobs You can keep this shit Im not buying ANY of itAnd with that she stormed off and out the door leaving her son to mutter Im so sorry and chase out the door after her and my manager yelling to have a nice day Before she left my manager grabbed the

Phishmcz,17,41,1rl0x6,191,So I used to work at that big blue electronic store we all know the one and they had a fairly standard return policy You break it its yours unless of course you purchased a protection plan which covers damage to the product So my main job was working at the returnsexchange desk and I saw all manner of BS from customers about trying to return product that clearly couldnt be returned but this one has to be the best story by farSo this couple comes in with a  TV they want to return and right off I can tell its going to be a weird return because the TV wasnt in a box They didnt even have the box with them Now that doesnt necessarily mean I cant do the return We can return it without the box and manual but everything else that came with has to be thereSo they get to the counter after being in line for about min and this is where all the fun begins Well call them WC for Weird CoupleWCWed like to return this TV we boughtMe Ok no problem Do you have the receiptWCNo we actually lost it But we just purchased it yesterdayMeNo worries do you have our stupidbluemembershipcard If you used it to make the purchase then we can just pull transaction information off the accountWCOhsure The phone number is uhumuh I found the pausing and what appeared to be guessing kind of oddSo I punched in their totally real phone number and pull up an account Its from Wisconsinand the last transaction was over  years agoMeIm sorry but Im not seeing a purchase from yesterday on the accountWCWell we used it yesterday It should be on thereMeThe last transaction Im seeing is from June WCOhumMeHow did you pay for it Did you use a cardWCNo we used cash which means the transaction is almost completely impossible to track down in the systemMeWell without a receipt or a way to look it up I cant do the returnWC turns their backs and whispers to one anotherWCOk can we leave this here for a bit Were gonna go back home and look for the receiptMeSure I guess Do you also have the box it came in That would make my life a little easier laterWCOhuhno See we took a trip to the city garbage dump yesterday and the box got thrown outOf course you purchased a TV and then threw out the box immediatelythat makes total senseThey leave the TV with me and take off So before people do a return we have the check the product to make sure its fully functional and not damaged or broken in a way that could from fault of the customer My co worker comes over and we think might as well plug it in to make sure it works so when they come back we dont have to do it again So we plug it in and a blue screen pops up obviously because nothing is plugged into the video ports Wellpart of a blue screen comes up We stare at what appears to be a MASSIVE spider crack in the screen A spider crack is where the middle is filled with cracks and then expands outwards for those who have never heard the term before So we look a little closer and it looked like someone had jammed a screw driver into the tv because there was a fairly deep dent in the middle of it all So we immediately notify our supervisor who tells us we clearly cant return the TV in that conditionSo the couple comes back and we let our manager know theyve returned and she comes up the handle it instead of us She tells them because there is physical damage to the TV that there is absolutely no way we can return it and they need to take it with them They of course start screaming at her saying they just bought it and that they had no idea it was broken and all kinds of crap So they want the store manager to get involved Which she does They go off on the same crap to her but this time they tell her its not their TV Their returning it for a wheelchair bound neighbor My SM doesnt buy it and sends them packing but not before they flip us off call us stupid cnts and assholes and push over a stand of about  DVDsEdited for formatting and a few typos,1385573448.0,People who try to return broken merchandise and my awesome story about it,232,talesFromRetail,top_week
InvdrZim,56,52,1rjww9,192,Obligatory first time post long time lurkerMy brief stint in retail was at a grocery store with a blue logo only sold groceries and the things that went with them I worked there for about six months I started as a bagger went to produce got fucked over by the produce manager went back to bagging moved to the deli quit for a job at my universitys helpdesk Somehow the store viewed me as a good employee even though by the time I was about done with the place my hatred was so great that I would actively avoid all work if possibleThis story is about a particular customer service manager who was probably the most unpleasant woman Ive ever dealt with she was perpetually hung over coworkers who were there longer than I tell me shes an alcoholic and theyve never seen her not hung over so Ill take their word for it Anyways She treated the baggers like shit sucked up to the store managers was rude to customers and ignored them multiple times to do something more important which I assume can only mean go to the break room for an hour and play on her phone which she did A lotThis takes place about two weeks before I left and a month after I just couldnt take it anymore and stopped caring So if I seem like a brash asshole its probably because I was being one Not the best thing to do in hindsight but I wasnt having any of their shit anymoreOn to the actual storyIt was Sunday our busiest day of the week still upset about being screwed out of working in the best department produce least amount of work for the night shift really chill coworkers who I still talk to its safe to say I wasnt in the best of moods did I let my emotions get the better of me Yeah theres no denying that one Was it worth it Very much so I think I left her speechlessNow we were shorthanded on baggers meaning some hadnt shown up for work when they were supposed to or were off doing who knows what in some corner of the store So there two or three of us covering nine registers A familiar and obnoxious buzzer starts going off One of the bottle machines is full and the bin needs to be swapped outHaving just finished bagging for a customer I tell my fellow baggers Ive got this and make my way towards the bottle room which involves walking past the Customer Service counter and the bitch manager who will be abbreviated as BM henceforthBM Where do you think youre goingMe Bottle room to swap out one of the binsBM Oh no youre not You stay up front and bagUtterly confused I turned around and resumed bagging now by this point it wasnt super busy and the relief cashiers had returned to their departments Yet the buzzer kept going And going And going I already knew the other baggers wouldnt do it because they really were far too lazy to bother with itSuddenly a shrill voice pierces the air coming to us via the intercomBM I need a bagger she spit out the word like it was moldy burnt food to go to the bottle roomOnce again I make my way over Once again she stops meBM Not you One of the other ones can do itHuhMe Theyre not going to do it and itll keep buzzing until someone goes Even if you tell them to they wontBM You cant be trusted Go back and bagAt this point I should mention that weve got an overflowing shelf of gobacks that need to get put away she wouldnt let me do that either And were still only an hour into my shiftBM Seeing me with a basket of gobacks I SAID STAY UP FRONT It wasnt exactly yelling but she was pretty damn closeMe Nothing is going to get done then And these are all frozens so they need to go back before theyre no goodBM I DONT CARE HAVE SOMEONE ELSE DO IT at this point she was yelling and heads were turningI put the frozen go backs on the Customer Service counter gave her a look of utter disapproval and went backFor the next hour it was dead in the store Weird for a Sunday but I didnt complain The buzzer was still going off the gobacks didnt get put away and BM was positively fuming She called me up to the front deskBM InvdrZim break Shes the only person in the store that called me by my legal first nameMe OkAs I walk away I hear her muttering something along the lines of Lazy fucking baggers getting breaks after not doing shit while Im up here busting my assI turn around and walk back up to the desk Im fuming theres no denying it Ive got my mothers temper so when I get mad I get madMe You spent the last hour up there sitting and playing around on your phone and you have the guts to call the baggers lazyBM You never do anything Weve got all this stuff to do and youre all too lazy to do itMe On multiple occasions I tried to get that stuff done Every time I tried you were hostile to me and told me to go back Its not my fault youre incompetentBM How dareAt that point I stopped listening I made my way over to the breakroom area punched out and walked right past her on my way out the door It felt great She was yelling at me the whole time I just ignored her and kept walkingWhy wasnt I fired Why wasnt she fired a long time ago for sucking at her job Well those are fair questions Where we work youre pretty much forced to be in the union which means you can be as terrible as you want at your job and still have it the next dayNext time I came it I was called to the managers officeM Whyd you clock out early yesterdayMe BM was being incredibly rude and unpleasant to me every time I tried to do something shed snap at me and tell me to go back to the front and bag even though there were no lines and all two of the registers that had customers had baggers on themThey left it at that My two weeks were put in very shortly after this incident which funnily enough was also shortly after they moved me to the deliLast I heard shes still working there and as unpleasant and bitchy as everComments and criticisms welcomeneeded Thanks for reading,1385529447.0,The Time I Walked Out Because Of My Incompetent Manager,244,talesFromRetail,top_week

MrDoctorSmartyPants,25,23,1rep4z,148,A little backstory I worked for a large and generic yet popular apparel retail store for a a little while right when I was getting out of high school I was rarely on the floor as a sales rep because I generally spent my day in the stock room going through endless stacks of shipment boxes however my managers loved the idea of me being on the floor because I am so outgoing and generally enjoy peopleto be quite honest I really enjoyed my time at this storeAll my managers were great it was in a very upscale shopping center so generally the customers were great and everyone I worked with was very cool I literally never had ANY problems with anyone that I worked withI guess it was kind of a utopian retail job  Now a little more background about my particular job responsibilitiesI was the stock room manager I was the person that met the truck at the back door at am every tuesday thursday and saturday  I was the one that printed off the delivery summary from the computer every night before the shipmentI knew how many boxes were coming I was the one responsible for counting each one of the boxes to make sure I got no more or no less than what was on the shipment invoice and I was the one responsible for processing all the shipment  In a nutshell I knew the stock room backwards and forwards knew what we had back there and what we didnt have because I unpacked it organized it and set up carts for employees on the floor to distribute in between helping customers There were rare occasions when  I would emerge victorious from the depths of the stock room having everything processed and put away and I would help out on the register or I would go find things in the stock room for associates on the floor and on occasion I would just help customers with whatever they neededThis particular day I was working the cash registers and a woman comes in who I had seen many times  She was a really nice lady and she even knew me by name because she had enjoyed our interaction on a previous trip to the store and had asked my name to brag to managers about me  A little about our return policyWith a receipt and tags on the clothes there was no time frame for returns  You can buy something put it in a closet for ten years decide you dont want it and bring it back  No problem  If you dont have a receipt and the tags are still on the clothes you can always return themthings stay in the system basically indefinitelybut if you dont have the receipt we scan the bar code and whatever comes up is what you get  If it says  bucks on the tag but comes up  cents you get  cents back  who knows what reduction stickers youve peeled off the tag  So all this being said here is my actual storyand I only remember this because in almost a year this is literally the only negative experience I ever had at this jobNice lady NL comes up to my register with a pair of bright red skinny jeans and drops them down on the counterNL Hi MrDoctorSmartyPants  How are you  I havent seen you the last few times Ive been in hereMe  It has been a while Im doing pretty gooddo you want to return these pants  Do you have your receiptNL I sure dont but Ive never taken the tags off of these as you can see so I can still return them rightMe Yep you sure can but unfortunately if you dont have your receipt I can only give you back what they ring up as and Im sure you bought these a while back because Ive never seen these in this store It should be noted the tag said  bucks for these particular pantsNL  Ok that is fine Ive dealt with that beforebut the tag says  dollars and just because I dont have my receipt doesnt mean I should be penalized and lose money on my purchaseMe I know you come here all the time but without a receipt we have no way to prove that you actually paid this amount for these pants we place stickers to denote sale prices over the original prices all the time and they are easily removed to look like they were never thereand to be honest with you in the time that Ive worked here since the store opened I have never seen these pants did you purchase them at another locationNL  Yes but that doesnt matter because I paid  for them like a year and a half ago and Ive never worn thembut lets just return them and see what I can get back for themMe ok lets seeat this point I scan the item and it comes up no shit at  Ok it says NL WHAT Thats robbery That CANT be rightMe Im afraid thats the best I can do for you I explained our policy and you said you understood  Ive returned things without a receipt for you beforeif I could give you more I wouldbut I cant and I dont have any of these pants in the store to verify a current price other than what the computer reads  NL Well this is absolutely unacceptable  You probably have some in the back that you can check for price so you can see how much these cost meI know the policy but this is a little differenti paid a lot for these pantsthis should be an exception  I want to see a managerMe Maam I am the stock manager I know everything in this entire store and I have never seen these pants beforeIm sure there are none in the back and I wish there was something I could do for you but I cant  Honestly this return policy is rooted in loss prevention and instances like this are the exact reason this policy existsNL Cant you just go look to make sure  Me Sure Ill do that for you  at this point i go in the back and out the back door for  minutes and smoke a cigarette and come back  Nope  We dont have any  what the computer shows is the best I can doNL NO I WANT TO SEE THE STORE MANAGER LESLIE WHERE IS SHEMe She isnt here today maamIm the only manager in the storeNL  Well call herMe I dont have her home number and Im not going to disturb her on a sunday over a cut and dry return policy issue  Im not making you return the pants Im not forcing you to take this moneyyou can keep the pantsNL  This is so stupidI cant believe youre treating me like this I come in

slandeh,17,38,1rmmh5,145,More return stories This one happened fairly recently and it made me a little cheerful inside to have to deal with itBackstory I work in a electronics department at a larger department store Our staff is fairly shorthanded currently so our shifts typically are open to midday and the closer comes in to hand off keys and tills Because of this if I take a lunch I have to have another department watch my department while Im gone Furthermore I am required by state law to take a lunch by my fifth hour or the company can get a fineToday is another busy preBlackFriday day Ive been stressed all morning getting stuff ready for the sales that will be occurring and I am noticing that Im close to my fifth hour I try to pass off my keys to a department I always hand them off to but many of them are busy so I give the keys anyway and tell them to just make sure whoever helps the department knows what they are doing I head out to lunch and relax in the breakroomNo more than  minutes pass when I get a page Electronics associate please dial  Electronics  Knowing that there is no one who will respond to it I go to the breakroom phone and respond Hey its slAndeh Im on lunch Whats up A coworker in a softlines department responds Theres a guy here attempting to return a  inch TV he bought today because its damaged I know you guys have different procedures than us so I figured youd want to see this Ive got nothing better to do albeit Id rather not have to process a return on my lunch The bigger question I hadnt sold any  inch TVs today so how was this being returnedI head down to the department and see a man standing with a return slip in his hand Whenever an item too large to carry around is returned its taken to pickup and they give them a slip to let us know its received and OK to return I look at the slip nothing out of the ordinaryMe Why are we returning the TV todayMan The TV is broken and I need a new one I was hoping to get it in time for Thanksgiving so we can watch the football gameMe punching in the receipt code to see the full receipt Im sorry to hear that Unfortunately I dont have this TV anyway and I didnt sell any today Where did you get the TVMan Well I bought it at store located  minutes away and was taking it up north to visit family and get it set up I dont want to have to go back down to the other store since I have to be up north in an hourMe Ok well let me check on the TV first and see if we can just return it and order you one to pick up laterWe have to verify that the TV isnt physically damaged Note when the customer said it wasnt working I had assumed he meant it wouldnt power on or something My pickup associates hadnt been responding to my pages and I didnt have time to wait so I headed downstairs myself to look at the TV I get downstairs and have the receiving manager Marie help me open the box When we lift the box up I can see a huge crack along the corner indicative of a being pressed against something or slammed against a corner Marie mentions that he was driving a small Prius and she would have had him sign a waiver if he wanted them to load it into his PriusSidenote When a customer wants something loaded in their car and we are pretty sure the item wont fit without being damaged it is storecompany policy to have the customer sign a waiver saying that he agrees we sold and loaded the item in the car in working condition This prevents customers from getting a nice exchange for damaging product after the fact so we arent responsibleAfter seeing the TV I immediately headed upstairs to talk to the customer looking at my watch now that my lunch was more than rds overMe Sir do you remember if you signed any waiver for loading this TVMan No I dont remember signing anything at all WhyMe Well it seems they loaded the TV into a PRIUS Last I checked a  inch TV shouldnt be toted around in a Prius let alone carried over  milesMan Well what does that meanMe Well if the store didnt have you sign a waiver then they are responsible for taking back the TV for inability to follow procedures Both my managers have agreed that this TV shouldnt have left in a PriusI get on the phone and contact the store he purchased from and asked to talk to receiving The associate tells me they cant get in contact with receiving so I instead give her this lineMe Well I have a customer John Doe here who purchased a  inch TV from your store and is trying to return it because its damaged The man tried to have your guys load it into a Prius and didnt sign any waiver We are refusing to return and hes pretty upset that I dont have this TV in stock I see you guys have one so Ill let your managers decide if they want to exchange this TV or notI didnt bother to hear a response and simply covered the microphone and informed the customer that he needs to head back to the store if he wants a refund After ending the call with the store the customer walks back sullen that he may not be enjoying the game with his new TV Last wordsI guess I wont be heading up north today to show off my new TV,1385616645.0,Sir a inch TV will not fit in a

prettehkitteh,24,34,1rcsdq,141,Wall of Text coming tis the season and Im feeling inspired by all these insane posts about people losing their shit over things they dont need I worked in retail for five years off and on as a grocery store cashier so I never really experienced Black Friday  except one year when I got a temp job at a major toy store on the side I started my new job two days before this day of reckoning For some reason the managers thought it prudent to stick the new girl on the front line when the store opened at am I had barely gotten a chance to get familiar with the store layout and we had special areas where the really populardiscounted toys were set up the day before so I pretty much had no idea where anything wasWe didnt get the typical zombies clawing at the windows phenomenon but people were lined up and a few even knocked on the doors because it was snowing outside and they really wanted to get in early I watched with a giant knot in my stomach as my manager unlocked the doors and people nabbed carts and ran inside I was immediately flooded with shouted questionsWHERE ARE THE TICKLE ME ELMOSWHERE IS THE HOMOSAPIEN ROBOT I NEED IT FOR MY SONI NEED A VIDEOGAME WHERE IS YOUR ELECTRONICS SECTIONI did my best to stutter answers out as people didnt even stop moving for me to answer I quickly picked up on where Tickle Me Elmos TMEs from now on were because everyone wanted one I could not believe how many people wanted one I stayed up toward the entrance because I knew if I went into the main sales floor I would get eaten alive and after the initial rush for the first two hours people started being a little more polite though there was still a lot of running and shouting going on That was when crazy beard came inCB was a grungy exconfederatelooking older man with a bandana tied around his head and a big scruffy grey beard all over his face He marched straight up to me and levelly demanded I need a TME Me Of course sir if you follow this aisle to the back and make a right they are in a special display in the middle of the aisle you cant miss themCB Are you sure there are any leftMe I havent been back there in a little while so unfortunately I dont know Im sorryHe waved a hand at me and scurried off I thought that was the end of it A minute later he scurried back visibly a lot more agitatedCB There were no TMEsMe Im sorry sir we did have some this morCB How could you not have any TMEs You must have more in the back I need oneI knew we had put out almost everything we had the night before  there was no backstock I tried to explain this to CB as he started shakingCB I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU COULDNT POSSIBLY HAVE ANY MORE TMEsMe fishing for anything to get this guy off my back IIm sorry sir theres not much I can do If you had gotten here earlier big mistakeCB IT DOESNT MATTER WHEN I GET HERE YOURE A FUCKING TOY STORE HOW CAN YOU NOT HAVE TMES I DEMAND TO SPEAK TO A MANAGERThose magic words I was shaking now I dont handle anger very well and was relieved to get some help I ran to a phone a few feet away and called for help over the intercom CB followed me and lowered his voice to keep grumbling to me about his worldending problem but he seemed to calm down a little now that he knew he had gotten up a rung on the ladder We waited I knew a manager might be a little longer because they were also amidst the throng of shoppers so I tried not to panic and made some small talk with CBFive minutes passed I saw CB getting more impatient so I called again over the intercom trying a joke about how the managers were probably up to their necks with customers CB wasnt amused so I just kept standing there shuffling my feet I couldnt leave the guy so I did my best to answer the couple questions that came my way while I was doing nothing Another five minutes passedCB What the fuck is taking him so longMe I dont know Im so sorry I can go look for a manager if you wantCB Youre staying RIGHT HERE until he shows up I know a cop out when I hear oneMe Im not trying to abandon you sir I want to helpCB You need to get your manager here RIGHT NOW DO YOU HEAR MEI was on the verge of crying at this point I picked up the phone for a third time trembling trying to take a breath so I didnt start crying over the intercom  when the lead manager Tim finally showed up out of breath from hurrying up front so quickly CB immediately looked a lot less threatening compared to Tim who was  built like a linebacker with tattoos on his arms and a long braided black beard Tim who had a heart of gold and cared about his employees asked ME what the problem was which pissed off CB but he looked scared shitlessMe Were out of TMEs and he really would like oneCB Thats RIGHT I have a problem with the fact thatTim Just a moment sir Prettehkitteh thank you you can go back to the frontI scampered away as quickly as possible as Tim started to explain that if we didnt have TMEs we didnt have TMEs I watched as CBs anger overcame his cowardice and he raised his voice a little to be rebutted or cut off each time with Tims best gentle giant voice Within two minutes Tim smiled and pointed out the door CB yelled one last unintelligible word and stormed out Tim came over to me gave me a big hug and told me to go take a breather in the back room The rest of that shift was a piece of cake comparatively and when I left that day I knew the store layout like the back of my hand TLDR Fuck Tickle Me Elmos,1385311409.0,My first Black Friday and first TFR post  Tickle Me Elmos,175,talesFromRetail,top_week

DrunkenBlackBelt,27,24,1rhw8z,119,Im back bitches  About  months ago I got a second job working part time at a mens Big ampTall store  The hours are easy commision is alright and to be honest the customers are generally friendly and awesome  It helps that a lot of them dont have anywhere else to shop Unfortunantly the store isnt as eventul as my past retail jobs  Its just selling clothes and shoes  But Ive gotten a few funny stories that Ill share over time here And with the holidays coming up im sure Ill have plenty more  Welll for your pleasure hopefully I present Boy Are My Feet SoreWARNING GROSSSo recently I began working in a mens store for Big amp Tall sizes  I knew of it because I buy my shoes there  Only store that carries a size   I am too small for the clothes despite being  and slightly overweight  And if Im being honest  seeing some of the people who come in makes me more motivated to keep losing weight  lbs this year alone  Now dont get me wrong SOME of the people have legitimate health concerns  One gentleman was born with his left foot backwards  During his childhood they would constantly have to break his foot set it slightly closer to the proper position let it heal and repeat But it never set  correct keeping him from being able to run or exercise or even stand for long periods of time  Its guys like him I feel for  Given a shitty deal in life and just having to suffer for it Most customers however are just plain old fat guys  I dont want to sound mean or fat shame  But its just poor lifestyle choices and such  I was there  I was lbs shy of  last new years  And it was just being lazy and making bad choices  I dont have as much sympathy for these guys  And that brings us to our story todayIts a sunny fall day  Its midweek and pretty dead  Im in my suit fixing clothes putzing around pretty much just pretending to work  I hear the door chime and in walks an older couple  Probably late s very early s  The lady was using a walker to move around and the gentleman was resting his weight on a cane as he slowly moved with her  They seemed like a nice enough couple but as you know those are the ones who always turn into assholesI introduced myself asked how I could help them that day  The man gruffly replied shoes  I brought them to the shoe department  Now my store is small and there is only one small bench to sit on and its in the shoe department  Naturally this oaf takes the seat leaving his frail wife to stand  I could tell she was having difficulty being particularly petire and frail so I went in the back and got her a folding chair to sit in next to her husband  She thanked me because manners  The man charming fellow that he was just said can you get me some shoes now  It was about this time that I realized this was going to go south faster than a my ex gf in a dick sucking contestI offered several suggestions as the gentleman didnt seem to know what kind of shoes he wanted  The man complained that most of our shoes dont even fit him I expressed sympathy as I have large feet and can only fit into the largest size available in store  The man looked me up and down and sneered Well you just have big feet I have a health condition that causes this so consider yourself lucky  Eventually we found a pair he liked and thought may just fit his feet  And thats when the real horror of this story starts  The man then proceeds to roll up his sweatpants  He was wearing ankle socks and sandals  His feet are hugely swollen and covered in open sores  This guy has diabetes and its eating away at his foot  Sadly its fairly common where I work  What came next however is notI hand him the shoes and take a step back giving him some space to put the shoes on look at them in the mirror see how they feel etc  NOPE  He looks at me like an idiot and says Well I cant put them on myself  I cant bend that far  Put them on for me   Now I am no fan of feet even on a good day  Sure if Im dating someone and they want a footrub and their feet are clean then ill oblige  But other than that I just want nothing to do with that area of the body  Add to the fact that we are talking about a stranger whose foot is literally covered in open oozing sores  DBB Sir I just cant do that Im sorryMan  You need to help me  Im a customer and I need serviceDBB There is no way I am doing that sir  I am sorry but you have open sores on your foot and leg Its unsanitary for both me and YOU to have me do thatMan Oh just wash your hands after itll be fineHow this man survived  or so years with logic like that will forever amaze me  DBB Absolutely not  Man I want the manger  Ill have your ass for discrimination and harrassmentDBB  I am the manager  If you want the store manager call back tomorrow  If you want corporates phone number Ill give it with my name gladly  The man continued to yell and scream about receiving the shoes at a discount and having me fired  Typical stuff for anyone who works in retail really  I essentially told him that I wasnt going to touch his feet and if he didnt like the service he could leave Wife is trying to keep the peace  Its not very effective  Husband used Rage  Its inneffective against DBB  Besides my DEF is to high  Anyways i wish there was some more to this  Eventually he stormed out as dramatically as one can when you can barely walk under your own weight and your wife is frail and moves about as fast a christian school girl with a chastity belt  I did hear from corporate the next day though  Naturally some of the details were changed when he called in but once I explained about the sores I receieve a Yea that happens all the time Dont worry about it  Sorry if its not very exciting  Im sure Ill have some good ones coming up  Hope you all are surviving

SuzyGreenburg,10,13,1re89p,117,When I was bar tending one evening a guy that I knew by name only came in  He stumbled up to the bar and ordered his drink a martini of some kind I think  As I grabbed a shaker to get to work on it he began saying that I was being too slow and if I couldnt figure out what to do he would come back there and do it for me  I ignored him and finished the drink  As I handed it back he looked at it told me anybody could make a martini and slapped  cent on the counter  THEN he left the bar to go back into the restaurant that is attached turned back around and said I think I tipped you to fn much  I can make my own gd martini next time  Enjoy your minimum wage  Okay  This all occurred in the matter of two minutes it took to make the drink and the only thing Id said the entire time was What would you like to drink  The other customers were astounded at his rudeness but I brushed it off just another night at the bar rightFast forward an hour or so and I go down to meet my husband at another bar on the property that stays open after the hotel bar closes  Who should be there but the jerk from before  When he spots my husband he comes directly over and starts chatting him up because theyd known each other as kids and were friendly  When my husband introduced me to this guy it was like I was talking to a completely different person  He was all compliments and can I by you a drink and its so nice to meet you lets get a table together  Clearly this guy did not recognize me from before  I stood there looking at his stupid face trying to remain calm but the more I thought about it the angrier I became  When Im in service mode Im worthy of ridicule and rudeness but as my husbands wife Im someone he wants to be friends with  I decided I couldnt let it pass  By the end of my tirade my husband was holding me back jerk off had spilled his drink on himself and was profusely apologizing while trying to blend into the wall  He left shortly thereafter and called my husband the next day to apologize sober  Ugh  Still makes me angry but I hope at least he is hesitant to treat others this way now  My only regret is that I couldnt handle him in a classier way but oh well  He deserved what he got,1385350965.0,I hope this belongs here my own experience with people in service being treated like crap,130,talesFromRetail,top_week

MysticSpiral,23,30,1rb12d,99,This is a story of a horrible client a weak manager and a poor associate me caught amidst it all It was a dark night in late spring The shorts are being unpacked and the air is fresh and new hope blooms I love my job and my customers at this store this is before I was promoted and moved to a different location are generally exceptionally awesome Even the bad ones arent really THAT bad and only minor annoyances Now this night we were slow and it was just about closing time so the MOD manager on duty and I were cleaning up around the store Our bliss is soon interrupted by a dark haired demon disguised as a human being   For whatever reason Demon Bitch bypasses the MOD and heads straight for me and I feel a chill roll down my spine I know somehow that this is going to be bad DB I bought this dress the other day whips out cotton dress and I went to put it on a button is missing from the back Can I exchange itMe Hoping this is easier than I first thought Of course lets see if we still have another in the same sizeExtra small petiteWe did not Me Im sorry it doesnt look like we have another in the same color and size We can exchange it for a different color or I can refund you back your money for it no problemDB No I want to wear THIS oneMe I can look it up and see if another store has it if you want We can put it on hold for however long you want and you are welcome to exchange it there We can try to place an order for it as well through the computer but if there is a low inventory theres no guarantee you will get t unfortunately The inventory is about  hours behind and often the numbers are lower than what is shownDB No That is unacceptable I want this one Cant you just sew a new button on itMe Unfortunately we dont have spare buttons but I can sew the button loop to the other side so it doesnt look off balance if you like Mind you the button is TINY About half the size of a dime Its really not that big of an issueNow this where things start to go downhill DB What will you do with the dress if I return it  Honesty to me  is the best policy but had I known how this was going to go down I probably would have just lied to this personMe Most likely we will write a damage tag for it and it will get removed from the inventory and shipped outDB Then rip a button off another dress and sew it to this oneI am VERY taken aback by this  She wants meto destroy No way Just No Me Maam Im sorry I cannot destroy company propertyDB WHAT You just SAID that this one would get sent out if I returned it what is the difference between this one and that one getting sent outMe Well that dress is now YOURS since you bought it You can do with it what you will and if you return it then it becomes the property of the company again  meaning that we will adhere to company policy and not put a damaged item on the floor The other dress on the rack is still company property and I will not willfully destroy company propertyDB I RAN A BUSINESS FOR TEN YEARS YOU DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO MAKE THE CUSTOMER HAPPY RIP A BUTTON OFF THAT DRESS AND SEW IT ONTO MINE THIS INSTANTMe I am not going to destroy company property You can return the dress or I can find one at another store Those are your options I am not risking my job by destroying company propertyDB THAT IS BULL SHIT YOU WILL NOT LOSE YOUR JOB OVER MAKING THE CUSTOMER HAPPY I RAN A BUSINESS I KNOW I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGERMe Alright MOD who has been listening the whole time this client would like to speak with youThe MOD comes over and I walk away continue to tidy up the store and do my job Then I see the MOD take the clients dress And the dress on the floor Im thinking that she CANT POSSIBLY be doing what I thinkYes the MOD ripped a button off a dress from the floor and sewed it back on to DBs dress Something or other had brought me to the desk a few moments later while the MOD was wrapping up sewing the new button on During the entire time DB wont stop going on and on about how she ran a business and knows that you do whatever it takes to make a customer happy etc etc etc  She then turns to me again and tells me Losing your job over making a customer happy That is SUCH bullshit I dont know of ANY company that would fire you for making a customer HAPPYI dont give her a response because at this point I am infuriated that the MOD would give into this horrible excuse for a human being and if I do respond it will be nasty DB eventually leaves and the MOD comes overMOD MysticSpiral Im sorry that I went over your head and did that I just could tell that it would escalate further and I didnt want a scene I REALLY loved that MOD she was like another mom to me but I absolutely could not respond to her I dont think I said a word for the rest of the evening The whole thing boils my blood even now So the lesson here is that if you scream and cry and rant and rave you can get someone to destroy company property just so you dont have to

thompsontoonsart,16,19,1r9l9k,92,Customer walks up to me just as Im about to go on my late afternoon lunch break She says shes there to pick up an order for X person name Well call her Fuddle Duddle and it should be a couple of bedskirts She received a call that the order was in Seems clear cut like any other order we have shipped to the store from our warehouse I go to our holds area to find the ordertheres no bedskirts on hold and no orders under the name the customer gave me I walk back onto the selling floor to speak with the customer Maam you said your name is Fuddle Duddle I dont see any orders out back with that name attachedWell no My name is Sue Fuddle is my friend Im in the area so she asked me to pick up her order for herThe next half hour spirals into this confusing mess of misinformation that five other associates attempted to clear up Sue came to the store with Fuddle a couple weeks ago and made a few largeish purchases Sue said Fuddle was pretty sure shed paid for the order being shipped to the store and it just needed to be picked up I look through our log book listing paid for pickup orders and there was no listing of Fuddles name in the book I inform Sue that the order may have only been transferred into the store but not paid for if this was the case our policy is that unpaid hold items are put onto the selling floor after hrs Sue said Fuddle had paid for the bedskirts I tried looking up Ms Duddles customer information in our register and through our catalog system and I found no purchase records at all Well that cant be right Sue said We were here in the store We bought several hundred dollars worth of stuff We were here for hours You must have a record I informed her that their purchases would be in our records but they wouldnt be logged under their names unless we created customer profiles for them Since their names didnt come up in our profile search I figured theyd opted out of having a profile created Sue decides to call Fuddle and confirm the information Sue hands me the phone after a few minutes so I can speak directly with Fuddle I inquire what style bedskirt it was that shed ordered for pick up and she said she couldnt really describe it She could tell me where she found the bedskirt in the store but the one she ordered was the correct size she needed that wasnt available in store at the time Supposedly it was a plain tailored style and she had a receipt for the item at home but she wasnt at home that very moment so she couldnt give me the information on the receipt She insisted she paid for the bedskirt because she had a receipt but her friend had also received a call to pick up her order which she said is a queen sized dust ruffle in white or maybe it was two twins She couldnt even remember what she ordered I described a couple of the styles to her and she suggested our diamond quilted style seemed most likely I asked if her order could have been logged under anyone elses name and she said no but her neighbor Pierce was supposed to pick it up So we had a third person involved in this order I took down Fuddles phone number and the number for her neighbor Pierce who was originally called and notified about the order and I told her wed give her a call once we sort the issue outSue is getting somewhat impatient now because she was there solely to pick up Fuddles order Fuddle lives out of state but owns a second house here in Maine which is where the bedskirt is supposed to go Sue looks at me saying So if you eventually find this bedskirt youll have to mail it to us for free right I dont want to drive another  miles to come pick it up and you already called Pierce to say it was here and somehow its not I told her that we would figure out some way to get the items to the customer if she did indeed already pay for them Sue and her patiently waiting husband decide to leaveMeanwhile my coworker pieces all the mashed up information together and tracks down the receipt for Fuddles original purchase which has a queen sized bedskirt on it She bought the bedskirt and one matching sham in store and they left with her What could she have possibly ordered We went back to the holds area There was a white queen coverlet and one matching sham on hold in the same style as the bedskirt she already purchased under Fuddles neighbor Pierces name and contact phone number and it was unpaid for I run out the door hoping Sue and her husband hadnt pulled out of the parking lot yet They were gone My coworker gets on the phone and calls the neighbor asking if they can contact Sue before she gets too far away from the store Were just hoping things will work out so we dont have to ship this to the customer because the customer clearly gave us all the wrong information The neighbor does get a hold of Sue she comes back and purchases the coverlet and sham for her friendTL Woman comes in to pick up supposedly paid for bedskirt for her friend Lady picking up the order gets

kemmer,37,24,1rbkuk,93,Summer after I graduated high school I worked at a deli in a casino Ive worked at several other retail jobs since then and the casino job is easily the worst Ive ever had The main reason is that customers were all either drunk or had just lost a bunch of money and they took out that anger and frustration on us Some storiesOrientationEveryone that was starting work in the casino that week no matter the job or department took part in the same orientation It basically consisted of an HR lady telling us how great the company was while we filled out tax forms but it ended in a tour of the whole property We saw the high roller suites the ballrooms all the restaurants etc While touring the steakhouse the most expensive restaurant the manager came out to show us the super expensive liquors they had available He pulled out a bottle of one I dont remember what it was now probably Cristal or something like that and told us how lucky we were to see it up close because none of us would ever be able to afford it Its been  years since I had that job and the memory of that STILL pisses me off I was  years old that dude had no way of knowing what I would do with my life or how much money I would make Not to mention not everyone there were retail workers there were some that were working in management or in administrative jobs like accounting Its been a life goal of mine since then to go back to that restaurant and order all the highest priced items on the menu Just for my own satisfication you know I should have known then this job was gonna suckCountingIm not gonna front Im pretty bad at math Im fairly intellegent otherwise graduated college with a  GPA but Ive just never been able to wrap my head around numbers One day I rang a guy up for a sandwich and drink The order was something like  He handed me  I punched it into the register and was all ready to give him  cents back when he suddenly gave me a quarter I hesistated for a second while I tried to manually calculate what the change would be now It honesly couldnt have been more than  seconds that I hesitated but in that time he started screaming literally screaming at me about how stupid I was and how shitty my education must have been But he couldnt stop there oh no he had to call his wife over so he could point out to her how stupid the employees at this place were Can you believe it How can they hire people this dumb I had figured out his change in the meantime handed it to him turned around and sobbed over the chili The guy walked away shaking his head at me in disgustSuicideMy most memorable day working at the casino and the day I praised God that I was lucky enough to go to college and not have to work there forever This place was essentially like Disneyland in that there was a whole underground world for the employees We had our own stores our own bank our own cafeteria etc To get to the employee cafeteria from the deli we had to walk around the back of the building under a covered walkway type thing The parking garage was right outside the deli doors One day I was walking back to work after my break when I noticed a commotion happening on the ground in the front of the parking garage I looked over and noticed a huge wetspot on the ground mixed with blood and other unidentifiable fluids I couldnt tell what was going on but I was late getting back from break so I just went back into the deli Found out later that an employee in another department had committed suicide by jumping off the roof of the parking garage They had already removed the body but I got to see the remnants The image of that will forever stick in my brainThose are my best stories but that doesnt even touch the mean as nails cook that got hit by a car the Jamaicans that stole from me and that were essentially being used as indentured servants by the company or the chef that I secretly discovered had two families neither knew of the other I got my revenge on that place by stealing cookies all the time Those cookies were damn goodTLDR Casinos are possibly the worst places on earth,1385255609.0,Why I cried over chili and other tales from the casino,117,talesFromRetail,top_week

LossPreventionSucks,24,23,1rfcsa,95,This is my first time posting here but Ill just warn you this can get a bit winded  Ive yet to be able to REALLY rant about this guy as my manager mentioned I should keep quiet about the whole ordealNow I work for a popular gaming store chain  Im sure you can guess which one  Ive heard the horror stories however Ive had an amazing experience working there up until I met our Loss Prevention ManagerTo start the day off I had to open  I went in about  minutes earlier than usual because we had a heavy load from the night before thanks to the XBox One launch  I wanted to clean everything up before customers started piling in  I already told my manager I was just going to leave earlier in the day so we didnt go over hours and he was totally fine with that  Anyway  minutes after walking through the door a group of people start banging on the door relentlessly yelling IM HERE LET ME IN  I ignore them for the first  minutes I mean gates are down and they are banging on the door exactly where our hours are posted and its almost  hours before open  I walk up to them and inform them we open at   The man quickly snaps Bullshit We were told by StoreManager that you opened early today for the system release  So I texted my manager and sure enough he said Absolutely not  If theyre picking a system up let them in though  I asked if they were picking a system up and he responded with No I want to return this stuff holding up at least  worth of XBox games and a system  I told him he would have to wait as my computers are still down  He finally agreed and left only to call every  minutes or so and ask if we were open yet For the next hour and a half  Now because this guy was so persistent I decided to leave the safe cracked open so we didnt have to wait for the  minute timer to go up  I figured hed come back right away  That was my first mistake  He never did come back and due to us being so busy and me being the only one there I forgot that the safe was cracked just a tiny bitOn to the second half I was there alone all morning  I had several people asking for systems which require me to go through a locked door through a hallway and into another locked door to get to  I have to do this for each system whether or not  people in line are waiting for a system  This gives  minutes of time each time I have to get a system where there is absolutely no employees covering the store  So what did I do  I propped the first door open  Mistake number twoAfter a bit my parttimer came in   minutes after opening I repeat we were open for  whole minutes at this point  of which I had spent alone with nearly  customers in the store picking up systems In walks our Loss Prevention guy  I didnt know he was Loss Prevention though No He instantly walks in starts yelling at my parttimer about the door and she directs him to me as she had just gotten there  Still no introduction the following commencedFatLossPreventionMan  Why the hell is the back door openMe  Can I help youFatLP  IS YOUR SAFE OPEN  WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU THINKING remember theres multiple people in the store at this point several in lineMe oh fuck   stutter stutterYeah there was an incident this morning where I had a return but he never showed up  I also needed to add change to the registerFatLP You cant do this  Are you the managerMe No may I ask who you areFatLP beaming Im Dave  Im here to audit and help with customersMe  Okay  Yeah I messed up  Its been a hectic morningAfter this exchange he continued to point out every thing that was wrong in our store  Mind you Im not the manager  Im not even assistant manager  Im a store worker who gets paid  cents more than minimum wage with manager duties  He continued to attack my coworker and I about controllers being live on the floor hanging on pegs  feet in the air saying someone could jump up and knock them off to steal them I wanted so badly to ask him to show me how  He then answered phones with just Hi this is Dave  No greeting nothing Just Dave  Then he proceeded to hang up on the people when he didnt know the answer These people then called back so they could complain to meAt this point he had yelled at my coworker and I loomed over us and degraded us so badly that I was near tears  He walked around the store talking to our DM about how pathetic this was and how incompetent the work is that he is seeing  Several customers had come up expressing their concern for my coworker and I  The best part was when I was actually shedding tears and helping a customer while Dave looked on giving no personal space  The customer asks Are you okay and Dave butts in Shes fine Do you want the GPG  I said nothing I was beaten and I couldnt do anything  The entire two hour period this man was there he told me about  different things that I had done that was a terminable offense  I was afraid if I said anything more that I would be done And I need this job  Anyway Theres a lot more about working at this game retailer that I could share mostly from corporate but this is by far the worst experience Ive ever hadTLDR  Shitty customers banging on the door  I screw up Loss prevention

ExcerptMusic,18,13,1rahbf,90, I work for a major cell phone retailer and frequently deal with technical issues Most of the time I love to help people figure out their phone so that they can get the most out of it However there are always certain individuals that blame their devices for their own faults Feel free to comment with similar issues as an employee or customer including silly things that were accidentally done that messed up a phoneKeep in mind the following text is currently in my head unless in quotes I am being as nice as possible on the outsideI had a customer come into the store that had a few problems with his phone I knew it wasnt going to be fun to figure out because he had on the fuck you face and looked to be in the ignorant with technology age range He presented me with  problems My alarm doesnt alert me in the morning and I need it for work The outside keys dont lock so the phone turns the speaker on The battery runs out when I unplug it at nightHe then followed by I bought this phone  days ago and want to return it and Ive been with this company for  years Advice to anyone that plans on throwing the Ive been shopping here for X amount of years This company doesnt care about you personally they just dont This isnt some mom amp pop shop that is hanging on simply by your individual business This is a multiBILLION dollar company They care even less if you were an asshole to them for those  years because I guarantee this isnt your first time complaining  So you bought the phone  days ago Sorry you cant return it There is a  day return policy on phones company wide This does not change unless there was an issue with ordering or computer date errors which doesnt happen We could also get the manufacturer to replace it if there is actually a problem with it There was no problem with the phone so there is  nothing I can do to get this guy a new phone So I check it out and explain to him what is going on The alarm First off his alarm was off He said it is because he turns it off on the weekends and on Monday it doesnt work I told him you need to turn it on or only set it for weekdaysI did this for him He kept saying that the phone was broken and the alarm would go off  minutes after it was supposed to I tested the alarm feature about  times No issues If it happened every time like he said I would have seen it at least once Even after telling him that the alarm was off he kept telling me it was the phone that had the problem and it was doing it automatically No It wasnt Next issue The outside keys wouldnt lock Ok This is a flip phone so there are volume keys and speaker phone keys He also has a horizontal belt carrier He tells me when he pushes the phone up in its holster while someone is calling him he pushes the buttons and that his old phone didnt do that I tell him that there is no way to turn off the buttons while someone is calling You can turn them off while no one is calling but not during a call After talking more with him I figured out why his old phone didnt have that issue He used to have a vertical belt clip and never pressed the buttons when he took out his phone Next issue The battery runs out at night This one is just stupid He told me that when he fully charges his phone at night he unplugs it and leaves it open The phone also has the screen timeout disabled So at night he unplugs the phone at  leaves it open fully lit and goes to bed Then in the morning he is mad that it is almost dead He must sleep with the lights on or something I dont know I set a screen timeout and told him to just leave it plugged in even though that slowly discharges battery over months and years A problem with battery capacity in  years isnt going to be his most pressing issue and it will prevent a lot of manufacturer return claims because the phone dies at night Now that ive fixed his issues he says that he will try it out but he doesnt expect it to work because it was the phone  Sorry guy it wasnt the phone It was user error through and through Dont blame technology for your mishaps Technology isnt some black magic  of operating a phone is common sense and an ability to read If the alarm says OFF then the alarm is off Its that simple  As much as I hate these people I like to see their reactions even when I fix their issues Its almost always negative with no thanks while stomping out the door I just have to roll my eyes and wait for that awesome customer that listens to experienced advice and recognizes their errors while laughing about it Seriously those are the best customers everTLDR User error accounts for most errors,1385222796.0,Dont blame technology if you dont know how to use it,103,talesFromRetail,top_week

adelajoy,5,12,1ri8kg,69,I spent two years working at a big warehousestyle grocery store I worked mostly as a cashier but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a weekMost of the crappy moments have all blurred together but there are a few particular moments that stick outI realize this isnt the craziest story on here but I will probably never forget this lady Backstory Our store had a policy that if an item scanned differently than the price tag the customer would get it for free up to  The mistake happened because the price tag didnt get changed or was misplaced If they spotted a problem we would go look If we found a tag in front of their item with the same code and a different price we gave it to them and changed the tag If the tag was for a different item they didnt get anything I was working the customer service desk and a lady stormed up I had several customers on the go at the moment but it was pretty clear she needed help right away As soon as I could I asked what I could help her with She was holding a bottle of toilet cleaner her receipt and a price tag Lets call her Crazy Customer CC for shortCC I bought this bottle of toilet cleaner but it was the wrong price You guys are trying to charge me too muchMe Okay can I see your receiptCC Hands me the receipt I tried to tell the cashier but she didnt believe meMe I checked who her cashier was and it was one of our longtime girls She knew the policy There was no way she didnt believe the customer Okay so the price came up  Ill just send a pricechecker out to see what the tag saidCC Oh I grabbed the price tag already She hands me the price tag This lady is pretty worked up  Im not sure if she just wants to get out of the store or if shes trying to pull one on meA policy was that the tag had to be on the shelf If a customer brings it to you whos to say they didnt take it off the shelf last week and save it They also could have found it in the wrong place somewhere that the stock employees wouldnt have checked to fix the tag As with most stores Ive been to store policy is to inform the customer about the relative store policies and then see if you can help them anyways No matter the problemIt study the tag and inform her of the policy that the tag would have to be on the shelf I start to let her know I can contact a manager but she snatches the tag back and interrupts meCC Well if thats your policy Ill just put it back on the shelf I was trying to save you some goddamn work but I guess if you guys want to work extra Ill just go put it backShe took off before I could say anything I was just standing at the desk aghast I didnt even know what to say The supervisor that was on shift was the scary kind You know the kind that isnt afraid to yell a little handles the worst customers and isnt phased when people call her names Lets call her Jane When the woman was gone I grabbed Jane and told her the whole story She said Okay When she comes back let me know who she is Ill handle herAs soon as I saw the customer coming back I hissed Jane Jane Jane White hat Thats her I then ducked behind the display at customer service and quite actually hid back there until the customer was gone I could hear her yelling at Jane I dont know what the verdict was Any other manager and the customer would have gotten the item for free but its hard to say with JaneI remember one of my coworkers came around the display and exclaimed my name I hushed them and told them I was hiding I was so afraid the woman would see me and do one of those Her Thats the one I was talking to She told me this And drag me back into itIve never hid from a customer before or since Oh Fun fact The price tag she was holding said  a  difference from what she paid and the tag was dated for the week before which means it wasnt the current price Not to say it wasnt still on the shelf but there is a chance she did save it and bring it back in especially with how worked up she wasThank goodness for thickskinned supervisors who can handle being yelled at,1385486313.0,I guess if you guys want to work extra Ill just go put it back,81,talesFromRetail,top_week

HeloRising,18,14,1ra3ti,69,Since the last one did so well and people enjoyed it I got in touch with one of the girls I worked with at the pottery store trolling for more stories and she mentioned one Id forgottenThis was about a month after I signed on and I had just come back from lunch on an otherwise quiet day Alas the day was not to remain so A woman walked in and started browsing the shelves She smiled and I greeted her asked her if she was looking for anything in particular she said no she was just browsing so I left it at that About ten minutes later she comes up to me with about four smaller pieces in her hands and she looks a little worried Note the punctuation in her statement is very very deliberateUmmIm trying to decide on one of these Its for my daughter shes graduating college next week and I wanted to get her a little something that was nice but not big so she wouldnt have to worry about carting it around and I thought oh maybe some figurines would be good but then I dont know because she likes faeries and horses but maybe thats a little too childish for her and I saw these and I love them and maybe theyd go well in her new place but I dont know for sure what it looks like because its all the way out past the freeway andThis goes on for quite some time Im overclocking my mental CPU hardcore just to be able to process everything shes saying because its coming out like fire from a rocket and she doesnt seem to want to slow down I try to slow her down but her automatic verbal machine gun has got me pinned After about five minutes of this it becomes very clear that she doesnt intend to stop Like ever At this point I started entertaining the idea of calling security This was a fairly high end shopping area so getting stayathome moms who have a doctor friend with a loose prescription pad wasnt unheard of and it was starting to look like shed either taken too much or too little of something strongBy now shed begun almost a fullblown panic attack and I had stopped being able to decode what she was saying it was coming out so fast Her eyes were getting red and puffy and she was gesticulating wildly Also shed stopped focusing on me she was no longer looking directly at me anymore She had this kind of thousand yard stare going on Her volume had also gone up and unreasonably hot coworker came out to see what the commotion was only to be greeted by the sight of a grown woman frothing at the mouth waiving pottery faeries around going about a million miles a minute about her daughter and somebody named Howie and looked like she was on the verge of spontaneously combusting Unreasonably hot coworker tried to calm the situation down but the woman was a volcano in full eruption at this point spewing molten crazy on everything around herJust before the ten minute mark she had apparently ran out of energy because she kind of half sat half collapsed onto the floor bawling her eyes out We were watching a grown human being have a fullblown psychological meltdown on the floor of the shopand we hadnt the slightest fucking idea how to deal with it Shed gotten so loud she attracted the attention of security who came in and asked what was going on and in a quavering tone of voice unreasonably hot coworker told the security guardA customer is having a nervous breakdown whats the policy on that It was apparently a first for the guard too because he had that same sort of expression youd expect on peoples faces if someone started stripping and pouring syrup on their genitals in the middle of breakfast at IHOP profound confusion mixed with a little bit of morbid fascinationEventually I guess she just completely ran out of gas and resorted to juststaring off into space with her mouth slightly open We got her cellphone and called the ICE contact who I assume was her husband He showed up about ten minutes after we called and somehow got her up and out of the store He didnt explain what was going on just thanked us for calling him and left with her I never did see her again after thatPart of me is amazed Id forgotten about this story but it wraps up with a lot of other things that happened later that are a little triggering so I guess I kinda just buried it Not as funny as the other two but still entertaining in its own way,1385202905.0,A customer is having a nervous breakdown whats the policy on that,83,talesFromRetail,top_week
