nilhaus,364,3558,15in05,3225,Example I have huge bookshelves full of books If you blind folded me and went through asking me did I own book X I could tell you with  accuracy You could even fake books or ask me about books I dont own Id be able to tell you yes or no However if you asked me to list all my books and write it on a piece of paper Id be lucky to get  of them before running out of steam Furthermore when prompted with the book name I could tell you the general plot of the book list characters describe the physical book and maybe even when and where I got it Why is this information only accessible one way and not another For lack of a better description why cant my brain search by Books owned tag and return a list The information is clearly there I stumbled on this strangeness when someone asked me to list all  states I could get about  of them before I started repeating and only when I sketched a map was I able to fill in the rest But when I had a map I could easily label every state Edit I dont know which category tag to use for this Neuroscience or Psychology,1356613589.0,Why cant I list every book I know but I can tell you if I own it,6783,askscience,top_all

Ruiner,770,3935,w0qgf,2408,In a few hours we will have an official announcement from the CERN teams about the searches for the Higgs boson Ill update this afterwardsYou should also check the previous Higgs threadhttpwwwredditcomrasksciencecommentsnaxmktheeverythingyouneedtoknowaboutthehiggs where many of the common questions were answeredFor many reasons this is a very exciting moment for everyone in the community Many of the older folks spent their life constructing all the building blocks of what we now know as the standard model of particle physics and the discovery of the Higgs ends this big chapter in our understanding of nature For us younger physicists this might be the first and only occasion in our lifetimes in which we get to witness a major experimental discovery in particle physics The LHC was built because we were sure that something would be found since the theory for electroweak interactions without the Higgs becomes completely unpredictive once we cross this energy range Since W bosonshttpenwikipediaorgwikiWandZbosons are massive they carry an extra degree of freedom  while light has  polarizations both transverse to the direction of propagation of the light beam W are also polarized in the direction parallel to their propagation This longitudinal degree of freedom is troublesome since it makes the probability of collision of W bosons collide grow very fast with the energy so fast that it crosses the unitarity scale meaning that the sum of all the probabilities of different ways in which W bosons interact no longer add to When this happens we need to resolve the interactions This means that while at large distances what we see is two W colliding at short distances the Ws can also produces a particle and this particle again decays into Ws Summing up all these contributions we have again something finite Check the last  of these diagramshttpwwwhepluseatlasthesisegedethesisimggifThe Higgs  or whatever particle is in there at GeV  is very heavy and decays almost immediately into some lighter particles so we cannot really produce it as a final state thus we need indirect ways of detecting it Check the above diagrams again you see that the presence of the Higgs changes the ways in which the W bosons can scatter so we can look for these signals W bosons are also too heavy to be produced as a final state so we need something else We start by shooting protons against each other and these protons contain  quarks each The quarks can emit W bosons and the W can also collide and produce a Higgs as can be seen in this diagramhttpbpblogspotcomHGdkIqlgcTzHATkSIAAAAAAAAAkoCfwXeseKQsvbfpng Once the Higgs is produced it will immediately decay into some light final state such as photons or quarks What we really observe is an excess in the production of any of these final states when compared to the predictions of the same scattering without the Higgs And in order to determine if the Higgs is really the Higgs we compare the branching ratios of the theory with the experiment which means that it has to produce just the right ammount of each final state  So is this guy also responsible for giving a mass to all the particles Yes and no In the real construction the Higgs particle is part of something called the Higgs mechanism In this mechanism the energy is minimized once the Higgs field fills the whole space with a Higgs condensate the field has a vacuum expectation value and the actual Higgs boson are just the excitations of this field like ripples on the water Almost every particle interacts with this field and by this interaction they become massive What changed since the last announcementNow they have more data and its possible to say with a lot more certainty that there is in fact some particle with a mass of around  GeV Well have to wait until the announcement to know exactly how certain it is but its likely to be already above  sigma so we can celebrateedit now we havefrom CMS    GeV   sigmafrom Atlas  Gev   sigma Is it the HiggsIts needed more data But their result seems to be compatible with the standard model Higgs What nowIf its really a Higgs then we need to solve the Hierarchy problem or abandon the idea of naturalness The problem is that the Higgs is unaturally light since quantum corrections would naturally make the Higgs mass as big as the Planck scale  GeV compared to the  and to make it light we need a an arbitrary cancellation that is heavily finetuned The best candidates were supersymmetry and large extra dimensions but it seems that both are very unlikely nowIf its not a Higgs then we probably will see more signals in the future and the greatest theoretical challenge will be to figure out what exactly it is,1341382091.0,The official Higgs announcement thread,6343,askscience,top_all

Ruiner,464,1689,naxmk,1547,Since the Cern announcement is coming in  hour or so I thought it would be nice to compile a FAQ about the Higgs and let this thread open so you guys could ask further questions Why we need the HiggsWe know that the carriers of the weak interaction  the W and Z bosons  are massless massive typo  We observed that experimentally We could just write down the theory and state that these particles have a hard mass but then wed go into troubles The problems with the theory of a massive gauge boson is similar to problem of naive quantum gravity when we go to high energies and try to compute the probability of scattering events we break unitarity probabilities no longer add to  The way to cure this problem is by adding a particle that mediates the interaction In this case the interaction of the W is not done directly but its mediated by a spin particle called the Higgs boson Higgs boson and Higgs fieldIn order for the Higgs to be able to give mass to the other particles it develops a vacuum expectation value It literally means that the vacuum is filled with something called the Higgs field and the reason why these particles have mass is because while they propagate they are swimming in this Higgs field and this interaction gives them inertia But this doesnt happen to all the particles only to the ones that are able to interact with the Higgs field Photons and neutrinos for instance dont care about the HiggsIn order to actually verify this model we need to produce an excitation of the field This excitation is what we call the Higgs boson Thats easy to understand if you think in terms of electromagnetism suppose that you have a very big electric field everywhere you want to check its properties so you produce a disturbance in the electric field by moving around a charge What you get is a propagating wave  a disturbance in the EM field which we call a photon  Does that mean that we have a theory of everythingNo see responses herehttpwwwredditcomrasksciencecommentsnatpifevidenceofthehiggsisreleasedontuesday Whats the difference between Higgs and gravitonsAnswered herehttpwwwredditcomrasksciencecommentsnafdwwhatsthedifferencebetweenthehiggsbosonand What does this mean for particle physicsIt means that the Standard Model the model that describes weak electromagnetic and strong nuclear interactions is almost complete But thats not everything we still have to explain how Neutrinos get masses the neutrino oscillations problem and also explain why the Higgs mass is so small compared to the Planck mass the Hierarchy problem So just discovering the Higgs would also be somewhat bittersweet since it would shed no light on these two subjects Are there alternatives to the HiggsHerehttpenwikipediaorgwikiHiggslessmodel Short answer no phenomenological viable alternative Just good ideas but no model that has the same predictive power of the Higgs CockroachED pointed out this other reddit thread on the subject httpredditmwuqi Why do we care about itOngoing discussion on thishttpwwwredditcomrasksciencecommentsnawxumypartneraskedmewhyweshouldbeinterested thread My cents We dont know but the only way to know is by researching it  years ago when Dirac was conjecturing about the Dirac sea and antiparticles he had no clue that today we would have PET scans working on that principle EDIT Technical points to those who are familiar with QFTYes neutrinos do have mass But in the standard Higgs electroweak sector they do not couple to the Higgs That was actually regarded first as a nice prediction of the Higgs mechanism since neutrinos were thought to be massless formerly but now we know that they have a very very very small mass No Gauge Invariance is not the reason why you need Higgs For those who are unfamiliar you can use the Stückelberg Language to describe massive vector bosons which is essentially the same as taking the selfcoupling of the Higgs to infinity and youre left with the NonLinear Sigma Model of the Goldstones in SU But we know that this is not renormalizable and violates perturbative unitarityABlackSwan redminded meBroadcast httpwebcastwebcernchwebcast Glossary for the broadcast httpwwwsciencecomquantumdiariessurvivorfundamentalglossaryhiggsbroadcastAnd dont forget to ask questions,1323780554.0,The everything you need to know about the Higgs boson thread,3236,askscience,top_all

Abusing,724,1795,p6csa,1089,Hi Reddit Theres a few questions that I havent been able to piece together answers for in my head on the subject of evolution Ill start with what my brain is working withEvolution as I understand it Any favorable mutation whether small or large to an organism will tend to tip the scales of survival in its favor  against its competition in its environment This increases its likelihood of surviving and reproducing This mutation is likely to carry on to future generations This process is continuously ongoing and is easily observed over large lengths of timeI hope thats right My English is decent but I cant really articulate my questions in an elegant way Ill use an example for each of my questions to try to make them a bit more clear Feel free to crush my assumptions and mistakes but try to focus on the idea behind the example more than the specifics of the example itself Development of new genusHow do minor random mutations cause such specific long term changes in any organism Example Lets take fish who makes the eventual transition into a land based creature This fish would have to randomly acquire the ability to absorb oxygen from the air develop limbs to move on land change its skin to survive in air and compete against an entire new world of predators All of these changes would also have to be favorable to the organism as well My brain tells me the likelihood of this happening no matter the length of time is so remote it seems negligible  Adaptation vs EvolutionWhy do various different species develop similar traits in a common environment as opposed to a great variety of adaptations to the same environment Example Why would the lossdiminishment of a sense to a large group of organisms be a favorable change to all these organisms ie Troglobites Almost universally blind but their ancestors are all creatures which had the ability to see WhyHow did this trait blindness become favored almost universally over competing organisms who could see Adaptation vs LamarckismOn the same thought as question  Has Lamarckism been proven false in long term scenarios I understand use and disuse in a few generations not being observed but how about over thousands of generations Millions Would a colony of rats living in a scentless environment theoretically over a large amount of generations lose their sense of smell Would this be because of disuse or natural selection Can humans keep evolving With our massive gene pool lack of competition and the ability to change our environment to suit us instead of the other way around Will our evolution continue Is it possible we regress as a species Traits that would not be favorable in a competitive environment are accepted and passed on to future generations in this current dayThanks for reading I look forward to learning somethingEdit Well this blew up I was expecting  to read  or  responses when I got back from work Thanks for the answers everyone I will read every post,1328117704.0,Evolution why I dont understand it,2884,askscience,top_all
