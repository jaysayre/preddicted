Slooooooooooooooooth,255,31,1rgb8p,169,I was born and raised a catholic along with my two older brothers We all were baptized and my brothers were both confirmed Im in the process of being confirmed right now and am in the week classroom section My teacher had some interesting views on Atheism and I thought I would share them here One day when talking about heaven and how to make sure you get there a question which I dont remember unfortunately came up I do remember his answer Atheists arent like us Catholics They dont know about the difference between right and wrong This struck a lot of us odd as we had just thought of Atheism as another religion people believed in Once he saw our blank looks he added on For example and Atheist would walk up to you and shoot you in the head Why silence Because Atheists dont care A few kids questioned him only to be silenced and we moved onA week or two later we meet every Sunday Were talking about some other Jesusy thing and Atheism comes up again Atheists are people who have turned away from God At this point I was thinking You cant really turn away from something you dont think exists Again he turns down any arguing from a bunch of  year olds and moves onTwo weeks ago we were talking about life and each persons soul Yet again Atheists came up I wasnt surprised when the question was Do Atheists have souls As in godgiven souls where sin affects you and all of that His answer was skeptical Atheists have turned themselves away from God and even though God forgives them over and over again they still reject Him He goes back to an old argument of his They cant tell what is right or wrong because they just dont care They dont care about themselves or others or life in general I piped up and asked him Then why havent they all just killed themselves if they dont care at all I matched his overlydone stress on dont care He of course avoided this and moved on despite several time people trying to get him back on the topic What bothered me is that this class and his teachings have put me off of religion completely We have had one kid drop out of conformation and doesnt know what he wants to believe He made me think If this is what Catholics think about Atheists then I dont agree with it There I had said it I dont agree with what the Church teaches With all of the scandals and drama in the church with priests being charged and how all the Church wants is money I just dont want to deal with it all His views on Atheism were atrocious and it has pissed off a large number of his students,1385420923.0,Not an Atheist but would you mind giving me some feedback on my Conformation teachers views on Atheism,200,atheism,top_week

simplicity,12,14,1rgw3u,20,Kind of a blurry memory sprang to the forefront of my subconscious recently and I had a sudden realisation that the place where I spent some of my Sundays with my best friend was a Christian youth group thing It was all pretty innocent stuff but it was in fact the subtlety of it which bothers me The people who ran the group were just so happy and enthusiastic all the time like they were so high on life nothing could faze them which now in retrospect seems a little creepy I was a pretty down to earth kid even at the age of  and never really read too much into their games and all their bullshit happiness I was just there to have fun with my friend I only went a few times and my family isnt religious in any way so I was never really exposed to religion before that apart from painting eggs at Easter and getting presents at Christmas which is why I only just figured out what that group was until recently Id just never given it much thought I remember one game in particular where theyd hand out candy to us and tell us to send it up to God and warned us that if we ate the candy instead of sending it up to him hed be very upset We would then proceed to throw the candy up in the air as high as we could and of course it would just drop back down and theyd tell us that God wants us to have the candy because he could see we deserved it for thinking of him first before ourselves My thoughts were that it was stupid because it was just gonna fall back down on the floor and even if it had a wrapper it was gonna get dirty  like I said I never really bought into religion even as a gullible kid and I especially didnt like eating things that had been on the floor but I reluctantly went along with it for the free candy The next bit was the cherry on top of this stupid exercise My poor friend who was a little on the larger side and no stranger to candy scoffed one of the sweets before sending it up to God but got caught and had to sit out of the next game In my mind this whole charade follows the model of be good or Santa wont bring you presents and all that does is make me hate the indoctrination of young children all the more Even if they didnt cram it down our throats using sweets and veiled threats to manipulate young kids isnt exactly morally correct in my opinion even if it does teach them that sharing is good in a messed up sort of way I always wonder if any of the kids at the group attended church regularly or if they really believed in the magic man in the sky because I certainly didnt and no amount of candy and jolly songs about Noahs Ark could fool me I honestly hope that the others had the same thoughts I did or at least werent sucked in by the creepy plastic smiles of those Christian group leaders  TLDR Went to Christian youth group as a kid a few times was told God would be mad if I didnt give him my sweets  didnt buy into it          ,1385435633.0,As a kid I went to a church group a few times with a friend didnt realise how subtly we were being brainwashed until many years later,34,atheism,top_week

mikevilla,13,4,1rogr9,17,After waking up and getting ready for Turkey day I called my mom and wished her a happy Thanksgiving We talked for a while and talked about how life has been so far which was a cheerful talk When the conversation was over I asked her if Dad was around she said yes and passed the phone over to him      Pausing the story here to explain a few details of the past I came out to my family this past spring which went very well with the exception of my conservative father He did not approve and defended his decision with religious justifications also expected and not surprising Back to the conversation     I start talking with my dad and said happy Thanksgiving to which he responded back happy Thanksgiving as well I ask how theyre all doing up north and he goes into the typical dialog youd expect with a sonfather relationship Later he decides to turn the conversation around and tell me that I need to find the Holy Ghost to rid me of my gay ways All these people coming out thinking its OK but its unnatural son I live across the since country from my family and since the last time I visited them all my dad wanted to do is argue with me about how I need to conform to his way of life Mind you Im  have a very stable career which I am confident in have a happy relationship with my boyfriend and no religion He was not happy with these for some reason and feels the need to drag me down Anyone else have their Thanksgiving shot down    Edit Spacing,1385686218.0,So I tried to wish my father a Happy Thanksgiving,21,atheism,top_week

ColdSerenity,5,10,1rfuxg,16,I will try to be brief sharing a brainstorm I had last night at am as you do since I would like to see what rAtheism and reddit as a whole has to say about it I am a tried and tested Atheist but I believe selfreflection and doubt are what led me to and keep me in this line of thought As I lay awake in contemplation I started to imagine what existence really isAll we really have is our own mind painfully aware of our limited existence conditioned to seek answers even to the most frustrating questions In the absence of answers to these questions are we a cosmic accident and nothing more Is there anything at all special about mankind in the universe Is there a point to all this an image of emptiness started to well up in my mind It was dark allconsuming and inescapable like a quicksand that gripped me tighter the more I struggled against it A place that was no place at all that threw up only questions and uncertainty the physical manifestation of helpless despair For the first time in my life for just a few seconds I mentally grasped at straws I wanted out I wanted answers I wanted light  anything to keep that awful darkness away from me It was in that moment that I almost invented God Thats right theres something out there that has all the answers I dont need to worry I dont need to ask these questions any more that cause me such trouble It could really be so simple But then those few seconds were over What good would come of me just strapping on the philosophical equivalent of an Oculus Rift to convince myself it was all over I would be a pathetic sight smiling like an idiot wearing my own illusions on my head as the darkness swallowed me regardless In the words of Dylan Thomas I would rather not go gentle into that good night but Rage rage against the dying of the light And so I formulated the following thought A true Atheist is a person deserving of respect not condemnation for his conviction Not only for resisting societal pressure and walking the path of reason but for having felt in some way this darkness I have attempted to describe and learning to fear it but soldiering through it all the same Those who cling to God or Gods are like those mesmerized by the shadows on the wall of Platos cave httpenwikipediaorgwikiAllegoryoftheCave A few of them have faced the darkness and given up their fight some are just subconsciously aware of it and choose to avoid it altogether They cling often fanatically to their little nightlight lashing out against those who would have them lift their gaze This brings me to the second half of my thought When Atheists such as me deal with religious people we often find it hard to contain our disdain for many reasons that have been beaten to death on this forum the History of repression and bloodshed Science the whole caboodle Those of us that have either consciously or subconsciously chosen the fight look with anger resentment sometimes even hatred on the shadowworshippers partially out of jealousy for their ignorant bliss But I think we have to move beyond that Sure we have to keep fighting against obscurantism and of course indignation is often an accurate and necessary response to many of the worldly trespasses of the religious but our very very first reaction should be pity Pity those who did not have your mental fortitude to face a losing battle Pity those who never had the chance through lack of education andor indoctrination to even enter the fight for themselves Pity those who are subconsciously aware but choose to flee I do not want to let this pity lead to arrogance I am a fallible human just as they are even when they claim otherwise but I see it rather as a cure to my arrogance I feel genuine pity rather than anger and disdain I am still frustrated beyond belief dont get me wrong but I think this might be a step forward at least for me personally in understanding Let me know what you think I am genuinely interestedKind regardsColdSerenity,1385410371.0,Pity  or the night I almost invented God,26,atheism,top_week

PheaMike,4,12,1rdjl7,15,Red Jacket Defends Native American Religion  by Red JacketThe Senecas members of the Iroquois Confederacy fought on the side of the British in the American Revolution Red Jacket also known as Sagoyewatha was a chief and orator born in eastern New York he derived his English name from his habit of wearing many red coats provided to him by his British allies After the hostilities as the British ceded their territories to the Americans the Senecas and many other Indian peoples faced enormous pressure on their homelands Red Jacket was a critical mediator in relations between the new US government and the Senecas he led a delegation that met with George Washington in  when he received a peace medal that appeared in subsequent portraits of the Indian leader In  a Boston missionary society requested Red Jackets permission to proselytize among the Iroquois settlements in northern New York State Red Jackets forceful defense of native religion below caused the representative to refuse the Indians handshake and announce that no fellowship could exist between the religion of God and the works of the DevilFriend and brother it was the will of the Great Spirit that we should meet together this day He orders all things and he has given us a fine day for our council He has taken his garment from before the sun and caused it to shine with brightness upon us our eyes are opened that we see clearly our ears are unstopped that we have been able to hear distinctly the words that you have spoken for all these favors we thank the Great Spirit and him onlyBrother this council fire was kindled by you it was at your request that we came together at this time we have listened with attention to what you have said You requested us to speak our minds freely this gives us great joy for we now consider that we stand upright before you and can speak what we think all have heard your voice and all speak to you as one man our minds are agreedBrother you say you want an answer to your talk before you leave this place It is right you should have one as you are a great distance from home and we do not wish to detain you but we will first look back a little and tell you what our fathers have told us and what we have heard from the white peopleBrother listen to what we say There was a time when our forefathers owned this great island Their seats extended from the rising to the setting sun The Great Spirit had made it for the use of Indians He had created the buffalo the deer and other animals for food He made the bear and the beaver and their skins served us for clothing He had scattered them over the country and taught us how to take them He had caused the earth to produce corn for bread All this he had done for his red children because he loved them If we had any disputes about hunting grounds they were generally settled without the shedding of much blood But an evil day came upon us your forefathers crossed the great waters and landed on this island Their numbers were small they found friends and not enemies they told us they had fled from their own country for fear of wicked men and come here to enjoy their religion They asked for a small seat we took pity on them granted their request and they sat down amongst us we gave them corn and meat they gave us poison in return The white people had now found our country tidings were carried back and more came amongst us yet we did not fear them we took them to be friends they called us brothers we believed them and gave them a larger seat At length their numbers had greatly increased they wanted more land they wanted our country Our eyes were opened and our minds became uneasy Wars took place Indians were hired to fight against Indians and many of our people were destroyed They also brought strong liquor among us it was strong and powerful and has slain thousandsBrother our seats were once large and yours were very small you have now become a great people and we have scarcely a place left to spread our blankets you have got our country but are not satisfied you want to force your religion upon usBrother continue to listen You say you are sent to instruct us how to worship the Great Spirit agreeably to his mind and if we do not take hold of the religion which you white people teach we shall be unhappy hereafter You say that you are right and we are lost how do we know this to be true We understand that your religion is written in a book if it was intended for us as well as you why has not the Great Spirit given it to us and not only to us but why did he not give to our forefathers the knowledge of that book with the means of understanding it rightly We only know what you tell us about it How shall we know when to believe being so often deceived by the white peopleBrother you say there is but one way to worship and serve the Great Spirit if there is but one religion why do you white people differ so much about it Why not all agree as you can all read the book Brother we do not understand these things We are told that your religion was given to your forefathers and has been handed down from father to son We also have a religion which was given to our forefathers and has been handed down to us their children We worship that way It teaches us to be thankful for all the favors we receive to love each other and to be united We never quarrel about religionBrother the Great Spirit has made us all but he has made a great difference between his white and red children he has given us a different complexion and different customs to you he has given the arts to these he has not opened our eyes we know these things to be true Since he has made so great a difference between us in other things why may we not conclude that he has given us a different religion according to our understanding The Great Spirit does right he knows what is best for his children we are satisfied Brother we do not wish to destroy your religion or take it from you we only want to enjoy our ownBrother you say you have not come to get our land or our money but to enlighten our minds I will now tell you that I have been at your meetings and saw you collecting money from the meeting I cannot tell what this money was intended for but suppose it was for your minister and if we should conform to your way of thinking perhaps you may want some from usBrother we are told that you have been preaching to the white people in this place These people are our neighbors we are acquainted with them we will wait a little while and see what effect your preaching has upon them If we find it does them good makes them honest and less disposed to cheat Indians we will then consider again what you have saidBrother you have now heard our answer to your talk and this is all we have to say at present As we are going to part we will come and take you by the hand and hope the Great Spirit will protect you on your journey and return you safe to your friendsSource Daniel Drake Lives of Celebrated American Indians Boston Bradbury Soden amp Co  ,1385331961.0,Red Jacket Defends Native American Religion  A brilliant response to a

DepressedAndDecieved,24,9,1r92wd,11,Before I delve into the bulk of this post I feel that you fellow Redditors may need some background I am younger than twenty and attend a local college I am not above the average weight for my age I have recently tested my IQ to be well above normal for individuals my age with a recently designed test I have not confined to the internet and solitude with a bag of chips my entire life I am using a throwaway account and Reddits karma does not matter to me  this is a very serious post I seek you because I need help Forgive me if I write more than you may deem necessary This is my story I was born to a conservative Christian family in the mids My early years were spent living in a smalltown neighborhood regularly attending church on Sundays and Saturdays As my parents were relatively poor I didnt have all that much to play with Lego sets were a novelty I remember those years as my best  I had friends in school my parents were loving and their arguments few and fun was always somehow wherever it was needed I remember countless times when I would go to the park with my sister and mother We would walk through the woods mom telling us fantastic tales ranging from the simple childish Mickey and Minnie Mouse stories to even more wonderfully fantastic ones I was fascinated by nature  the trees the wildlife She would chase us around the playgrounds join in on our silly games of medieval roleplay and spin us around on the cold metal carousels These are the memories that bring tears to my eyesAs the years went on we moved to a larger nearby city My parents were earning more money My father had been promoted at work Our new home was in an area of the city generally populated by older individuals There was no one my age to play with My kindergarten teacher hated me as a new student interrupting her school year My parents slowly seemed to loose interest in parenting Nightmares plagued my dreams always some situation where my parents werent there They couldnt help me and I was being dragged away by some unseen force to some evil monsters grasp or we were chased by some evil being  often wolves  and my mother was just a step away a few yards ahead Other dreams involved other obstacles such as steep hills or steep staircases always a step behind or unable to go any further My father was never present his presence only hinted at by a few of the dreams I could never quite find a group of friends to fit in with I picked up a friend here and there but I could never come to associate myself with a larger group This has not changed There was always something else in the way  at the time these kids had seen the big films of the day they had cable televisions at home and understood sports They didnt really care for nature After a while visits to the park with mom became less and less frequent and the stories more shallow Playgrounds became a thing where I could escape from the dreary classroom environment Recess was my fun Now that my parents had more money they bought me more toys Lego sets became my life I came to find a substitute for moms stories in the Lego sets Entire worlds were dreamed up conceived over the span of weeks and months I dont remember how I obtained a subscription but the occasional Lego Club magazines were like monthly Christmas presents I never had the opportunity to play any of the popular video games of the day I only knew Mario from a PC adaptation my uncle gave me My dad eventually gave in and either purchased or borrowed a few of the Lego titles that existed at the time  Lego LOCO Lego Chess and Lego Island I did not see Star Wars until I was sixteen I still held my passion for the medieval era during this time borrowing books from the library about knights and chivalry staring completely floored at the elaborate pieces of armor that they wore At home I would dream up elaborate castles fantasizing about the wonderful adventures these knights must have had I could recite the entire legend of King Arthur by heart  and not just the modern adaptations of the story I still am fascinated by itWhen I was attending first grade a teacher saw potential in me I attended a third grade reading class for the remainder of that year reading stories such as Charlottes Web and I enjoying it Over time the close attachment that I had to my parents began to fade By the time I had moved on to third grade I was reading chapter books such as The Hardy Boys series and The Boxcar Children books Gary Paulsens White Fox was one of my favorites Things changed drastically again around sixth grade My mother and father began to argue more My mother began to take the abuse out on us primarily me The change seemed so drastic I will not go into any details here I will not define the physical or emotional nature When I was in the seventh grade my English teacher spoke to my mother at a parent orientation event about a particular assignment that I had slacked off on I submitted the work but my writing was awfully sloppy My mom came home furious and convinced that I was a drug addict I have never to this day taken any drugs for recreational purposes I have not tasted tried or consumed any alcohol or smoked tobacco to this day It took me weeks to convince her that I was not a drug addict On another occasion with me on the brink of consciousness she called me what translates to a useless work donkey This may sound humorous in English but it was far from that I was afraid to come home from school The once loving mother that I had as a child was someplace else This was not her If I were to say that I hated my mother or my father that would be a lie I still love both of them dearly I would give up any of the baubles that come with money just to bring back those old times so that they could be different They still remain the same old ultraconservative Christians They attend church regularly dragging me along though I have lost all interest in religion I began to look to other people and found very little that was spiritual Preachers come out to speak and draw upon examples of miracles yet they fail to present any proof or evidence when asked Pastors turn around and abuse the very deeds for which they claim to stand I have red the Christian Bible and I have found nothing more than good words and wise sayings The Koran was no different Please understand that I do not offer any judgment on those who continue to believe and follow those religions earnestly  I do not share the same sentiments The one they call God never rescued me no matter how many times I believing the words asked and it will be given unto you prayed for it My parents remain disinterestedToday I considered suicide What used to guide me was the belief that somewhere a God exists Someday that God would help me He would save me My parents taught me that atheists were deceived by the devil My church agreed I was taught that gays and lesbians were also deceived and perverted by the devil My church agreed I was taught that God punished liars yet I saw that seemingly without toll all around me My church insisted Eventually I came to the realization that not everything may be quite as we are taught it seems Going on a quest to fill in my lifelong blanks I spoke with homosexual individuals and came to realize that they are not psychologically different from those who are not I have observed poverty and class structure along with politics After having a thorough discussion with several classmate atheists I came to the startling realization that secular thought had far more substance than the Godless perversion and devilguided thought that my church spoke of I needed to understand both sides to fairly form an opinion and so I decided to research the topic I uncovered stories and history on the likes of the Bibles first human  Adam and his first wife Lilith and how strangely the story is avoided in the King James translations That was in the least my first eyeopener As a formerly religious individual I was taught that God created only two human beings  one from the dirt and another from the flesh of the first At first I thought that maybe both science AND religion were correct What if certain things were just symbolism for a greater meaning that those individuals simply did not understand Books changed hands and were purchased Pages turned Eventually I was convinced This quest has lasted for the duration of these past two years I thank you ratheism as you have provided a foundation for my research I have found enough to satisfy and confirm my doubts As aforementioned I mean no disrespect to those who choose to believe Today I sat in my car before heading home It was a peaceful moment serene and beautiful with the trees waving overhead and the cosmos further still It was almost surreal Depressing Why do we exist What purpose do we no more than a complex mass of cells with seemingly no purpose other than ecological substantiation and selfpreservation have in the greater sphere of the universe  Why should we continue to live and thrive if there is no greater purpose of salvation The thoughts strayed towards my past I had no motive to return home  there was hardly anything to return to I could have ended my life there and left others to continue their own miserable existence Driving home there were hundreds of opportunities for my life to just end A second here a truck there It seemed like a very viable thought but my curiosity kept me alive After much further focus on the idea of suicide I have as I hope banished the thought If there are other atheists out there then there inherently must be some sort of explanation or reasoning to approach this How did you fellow atheists approach  these questions of existence How did you deal with the realization that quite nearly all youve believed was if you were not born to atheist parents false How did you deal with this sense of insignificance the idea that everything needs a beginning and an end I thank you for sparing your time and if you so choose giving your responses Edit tldr   Had abusive childhood with

Listentheshort,13,4,1r9gzz,7,        Yesterday I hit an ice slick and lost control while driving on a two line highway  My car spun into the center medium continued into the opposing lanes of oncoming traffic luckily there was a gap in cars and eventually came to a stop in a roadside ditchravine on the other side  If any oncoming car had hit me I would surly be dead right now  Instead I was able to immediately get out and assess the damage without so much as a scratch  As an atheist I attribute my survival to luck and good fortune but many of my family members will no doubly thank God and angels of our dead relatives  I havent told them about the accident yet but I can already picture my grandma throwing her hands up in the air while stating that Jesus must have taken the wheel cleared a path and guided me to safety as grandpa Bob watched over          Other family members will hear my tale and claim it as proof of a reason to believe in God  While I wouldnt classify this as a neardeath experience it was a close enough brush to provide a healthy dose of respect for my own mortality and leave me in awe over human existence  I was reminded that we each get only one shot at this thing called life and mine almost ended  These are emotional thoughtprocesses  I do not think believers are capable of feelingunderstanding since they feel heaven and eternal life after Earth exist  My question for all you awesome atheists out there is this  how to I combat this religious rhetoric and explain the fragility of live and the finality of death knowledge only nonbelievers are privy to actually enriches my life MORE than mindlessly believing in prayers and eternal life ever did  While I know people mean well by offering phrases such as God was looking out for you and thank heavens you are ok  I want people to know these empty gestures cheapen the power of worldly human experiences,1385174340.0,Narrowly escaped death on a snowy highway yesterday How do I deal with the religious rhetoric my family is bound to throw at me when discussing the fact that I am lucky to be alive,11,atheism,top_week

jlevy,6,5,1rfs1v,3,httpwwwfoxnewscomopinionsevenwaysforchristianstolovetheirneighborsevenwhendisagreeThis was a disgusting piece and I honestly just have to get this off my chest It was a link posted by a family member on Facebook and I couldnt just let such a misleading article title imply that his religion is truly one of loveI am sorry but I cannot read this and accept that the author is someone who truly sees equality as a means to better the world and human relations or coexistence The author speaks as though they want to show that they and their flock are empathetic to a cause of a fellow minority they just happen to have a differing opinion with The reality of the situation is not only far from the perspective of the writer but more to the point is crossing the line of fictionMy first and nearly overlooked quarrel with this piece was the rhetorical What does it look like to remain faithful to God while loving neighbors who passionately disagree with Christian convictions Instantly this presumptive statement should ring in the ear of all the staunch believers who have been condemned by the faith church and by extension the god that they dedicated their lives to serving As I am sure many are aware a Pastor a follower of a faith that sees his son as an abomination is being punished for marrying his son into a loving union It is not something that the faith merely passionately disagrees they actually punish and discriminate against anyone who passionately disagrees with cherry picked doctrine This is neither the first nor the last of similar offenses httpwwwreligionnewscombreakingmethodistpastorguiltyofficiatinggaysonsweddingAnd then there are the myriad of churches that cater to and preach the good news to those of faith and of LGBT lifestyles and their friends These can be found at httpwwwgaychurchorg Simply calling implying a whole group many of the faith Christianity nonbelievers is offensive even to me To say that about a personpeople that have clear allegiance to faith is an insult in with the utmost distaste and degradation I am sure there are many like me an atheist a part of the LGBT community and I am sure they like me take every bit of pride in that label But for the others those of faith within the LGBT community this is a slap in the face to their faith and spiritualitySo in answer to the allegorical question it looks like misunderstanding lack of acceptance discrimination disgust and questionable morality I wish this was the only transgression the person behind this article acquiesced but unfortunately it did not stop there Assuming this Pastor has read through the biblical literature it would seem as though their understanding of reality including the fact that cultural evolution has overwhelmed faiths of all types is lost on the pastor Over time all faiths and practices evolve with the cultures surrounding them I challenge anyone to find a religion belief or faith that has not changed As an example off the top of my head in keeping with the modern day culture of science technology and discovery the Dali Lama said If science proves some belief of Buddhism wrong then Buddhism will have to change Yet the author states For the Christian changing Gods laws in Scripture by popular opinion makes as much sense as changing Gods laws in nature it seems to beg the question to hermeneutics regarding the idea of context and audience is paramountcy This has an implication that as we are not the original readers that much of what is in the religious texts is not to be taken as direction in the modern era as the context has changed and with it the faith and church as well  Take Leviticus  as example Do not cut your bodies for the dead and do not mark your skin with tattoos I am the Lord This is not to mention eating pork or lobster wearing clothing of differing threads and working on Sundays For the audience of the era this was a method of separating their culture with the Pagan cultures surrounding them The faith has changed with popular culture as tattoos are not nearly the taboo they once were Tattoos no longer mean heathen worship and witchcraft they are a mark of individualism and hold deep sometimes even religious meaning even amongst Christians The modern culture sees this command from the lord some would say Gods law has outlived its usefulness Nearly half of all adults today have at least one tatooo and given that nearly  of Americans identify as Christian it would translate that many of those that are tattooed are Christians httpbcctrincolleduweblogsAmericanReligionSurveyARISreportsARISReportpdf This brings be to my next pointThe statement Both homosexuals and Christians are curiously enough organized minority groups attempts to elicit a feeling of solidarity with the LGBT community Unfortunately the statement is a outright lie and a false attempt to empathize As stated above nearly  identify as Christian I am not sure where the idea that the author is a part of a minority with th of the nation behind them At this point I am more than upset at the author I am downright disgustedFinally the tipping point was reached when the author blatantly dismissed LGBT community by implying that homosexuality was some sort of disease akin to alcohol addiction or cancer The method in which the writer expressed their churches generosity and willingness to accept people they clearly feels are lepers and others who are struggling with same sex attraction to varying degrees is repulsive The notion that homosexuality is some form of sickness has led many to and is responsible for creation of the thoroughly debunked disingenuous and dangerous practice of gay conversion therapy The author has left me with a sense that his own message of Christian love is lost on themselves TLDRFamily member posted a disgusting article about a Pastor that tried to convince the readers that his hate is really only christian love

Geronimou,11,8,1re379,4,Ive been here for a short while now and this subreddit has proven to be quite great filled with rationally thinking people Im here to ask advice for my current situation which is following I am currently an exchange student in United States Michigan and Im from Finland I have been here for three months now and Ive had many experiences both good and bad mostly good However I still have  months left and Im feeling quite homesick The worst thing being here is that my hostfamily is very religious They are YECs devoted Christians and very active members of their church community While they are very heart warming and good people their conservative values are greatly conflicting with my own quite liberal values that I have so far kept for myself Every Sunday feels worse than the one before and I dont really know how much longer I can take this So far the family has not been pushing their religion down my throat but I suspect it is because they think Im theistic like them When I think will I be able to live here for  months longer Im very unsure I have a good time here I like my school and the people there and I enjoy the people here in  general However I miss my family friends pets and the ultimate freedom to do what I want a thing I have actually never experienced before even close to this magnitude By losing ultimate freedom I mean that I cant get to places without one of them giving me a ride and they have tight curfewsSo far my host mother has told me that attending church is not optional for me and Ive thought that what the heck it makes them happy and its only one day per week However they asked me to play guitar in the worship band and having no excuse to decline the request I accepted Now I feel really bad since Im participating in the brainwashing of many young childrenIve been thinking about telling the family that I am not religious but I am not sure what would happen The possibilities are roughly They would be totally fine with it I highly suspect this one We would keep living like this except they would shove their religion down my throat They would no longer want to host me in which case my program coordinator would shelter me until I get a new host family if one is not found I my family get a refund and I get sent homeI do indeed realize that being able to participate in an exchange program is a onceinalifetime chance only few people get to experience and that I should not take it lightly that my decision might lead to my program ending prematurely My parents paid a load of money for this and I already feel bad for that aborting the program would make me very ashamed and I know a lot of people would think bad of me not my parents though theyd just be happy to have me back The reason why I was pointed to such religious family is that in Finland I am officially a member of the church and as reading my application my host family thought I was religious To give you examples of how religious my family is I really dont know are they extremely religious in American standard We bless the food every time we eat together YECs they think evolution is absolutely ridiculous My Hostbrother almost decided to not go out with this girl he had a crush on because she is halfJewish Church every Sunday my hostbrother father and mother are in the churchs worship band we play mostly Hillsongs songs and dragged me into it Sunday school before church youth group in the evening prayer group after school on Wednesdays I dont have to attend the prayer group They are fundamentalists about the bible my other hostbrother constantly keeps searching stuff from the bible that can support his conservative views They dont like it when I say mild swear words such as if I say the movie title Inglorious Bastards or kick your ass instead of kick your butt I hear them just randomly praying at different times of the day My brothers room is full of religious stuff on the wallI hope you get the picture of what kind of people they are If not think about the family in Tenacious D where Jack Black escapes fromSo far Ive been thinking about telling about my beliefs to my hostsister who is pretty much the one I would consider least religious of these people and ask her how she thinks her family would react to the matterIt is also possible that I am simply so homesick that I try to find excuses to sabotage my own exchange year just to get home earlier I dont really know What I do know is that I dont think I can attend the church for six more months They also have many youth events for the church that they are expecting I would attend happening in February and I really dont want to take part in themtldr I am an exchange student Should I do something cause I cant stand the religiousness of my host family,1385346954.0,Asking ratheism for advice in my situation,12,atheism,top_week

DeuceSevin,15,8,1rn8i8,2,So for a while now I have felt that if homosexuality was such a big sin as many evangelicals make it out to be surely god would have dedicated a commandment to this vile behavior But quite the contrary except for an obscure mention how it is an abomination for men to lay together it hardly warrants a mention elsewhere So this to me means that if you believe in god and the bible you should believe that homosexuality is at best a minor sin But this morning while laying in bed contemplating the universe I had an epiphany When writing rules for living such as the US constitution the writers realized that they are not perfect or omniscient and they cant foresee all possibilities so they left a mechanism for amending the rules of conditions change When crafting the  commandments god didnt do this He didnt need to because being the allknowing being that he is he could foresee all future developments and create the commandments accordingly Now if you believe as I do that for the most part gays and lesbians are born that way then you would that homosexuality has been around for a really long time if not forever However until recently it appeared less prevalent as people stayed in the closet So a god writing commandments would surely have been aware of this and accounted for this terrible sin but a person or persons writing commandment would not TLDR god disappears in a puff of logic again,1385646555.0,Gods words prove the bible isnt gods word,10,atheism,top_week

Jancy,2,5,1rlysi,2,This is a very important book that is often overlooked by atheists  However I believe it is a must read for modern Christians and Atheists alike The first entry in the book is called Abbe  A year after Voltaire published one of his early original works a young man tried to put the philosophy into practice  France asshole catholic community  The young Chevalier de la Barre had refused to kneel in the presence of a religious procession  He was found GUILTY of the crime of irreverence  He was then tortured and his tongue was ripped out  After he was beheaded his body was committed to the flames  In the bonfire his executioners threw the book that caused this uproar  Voltaires Philosophical Dictionary  This is an important document to France and a contribution to history      My favorite ending of this first story goes speaking of priests  Gentlemen you are right  You should lay claim to the earth it belongs to men with the strength and the skill to acquire it  You have used ignorance superstition and strife to strip us of our legacies and trample us under your feet while you waxed fat on the resources of the unfortunate  Tremble for the day of reckoning is at hand     Voltaire can be difficult to understand at times due to translation from French to English but his satirical style is unmistakable   The concepts in the book are over two hundred years old but are just as telling about human nature as a modern book     Take the time to read the book if you can find a copy of it as a reasonable price  There are five different versions of this book written by Voltaire in his lifetime the one published before his death was his best    ,1385596477.0,Book Voltaires Philosophical Dictionary,7,atheism,top_week

grifthesniper,14,6,1rdxhf,3,Gents and ladies I decided to be Atheist on my own knowledge and choosing and declared my belief  or lack of  to my Catholic mother and later that day my Atheist father who divorced my mother five years ago To cover some background and just to vent my compiled lifetime of confusion Im going to start from as far back as I can remember When I was a small boy probably around the age of six I began taking interest in the news I glued my eyes on the headlines as often as possible and quickly was exposed to the media and shenanigans that are frequently pasted in bold lettering on the screen Among things like sex movie stars divorcing their spouses violent crimes I found interest in politics At this time around in  George W Bush was on the television having some sort of debate with John Kerry Me blissfully ignorant to politics and what a Democrat was or what a Republican was I curiously asked my mother  Since my fathers work takes him away from home for lengthy periods of time Mum who is John Kerry I asked this because she had been talking smack against Kerrys platform and campaign with her friend and praised Bush So naturally I was curious She told me John Kerry is an evil man who wants to take us away from God and let us burn in hell You must never trust a Democrat he will always try and cheat and swindle you So being a dumb little kid absorbed this statement like a sponge As time proceeded I began asking things like What does the bible say will happen to the people on TV who are divorcing their wives And my mother would reply with something along the lines they would be judged by God and sent to hell So I grew a little went a few grades with the statements my mom had said to me In order to go to heaven I must follow the ten commandments to the letter I must never believe or say anything that contradicts the bibles teachings If I did something bad I must tell my mom right away and go to confession the next Sunday However I had as a child always wondered what it would be like to be the dragon with two heads male and female from the childrens show Dragon Tales I fantasized about it obsessively for a a few months wondering how it had gone about its daily life if it had both a male and female part And from there my curiosity about the opposite gender went skyrocketing It wasnt perversion it was genuine curiosity I wanted to know how girls worked and why However I had the sayings of my mother looming over my head at the same time If I looked at porn or interacted with anything that had sexual nature in it I would be sentenced to hell for eternity and a half This among other things like little white lies that all kids tell began to psychologically compile Eventually I felt so bad that I had gone against my mothers words that I stopped confessing anything to the priest at confession Every hour of every day I worried about going to hell for my actions This I also obsessed over but not in a similar way as earlier I began having vivid dreams about different ways that God would smite me and send me to hell Then during the day I would worry that something would cause my death and I would go the opposite direction than the pearlywhite gates when my soul passed on As years went by I became trapped in a cycle of worry which led to depression at a very young age Fastforward a few years to about  I witnessed my Mom and Dad have a vicious fight over something my memory fails me at this particular moment so I do not recall what exactly it was over Though the bottom of the line I saw my father pack a suitcase and march out the door and I didnt see him for a few weeks He came back eventually and declared that he wanted a divorce from my mother Over a painfully long two years the process went on at a snail pace I asked my mom why are you and dad getting divorced She told me that my father was an evil person and had sinned to greatly for her to acknowledge him According to her he had strayed from the ten commandments and was going to hell After they divorced my dad nearly disappeared from my life and I only saw him one weekend a month He sank into a depression which impacted me Around this time I had started to stray away from religion myself I loathed church and sundayschool with a fiery passion I ignored everything that went on when I had to sit through mass I didnt want anything to do with Catholicism Fastforward some more I had just turned sixteen I was a depressed and lonely individual an outcast in my local school I didnt have too many friends only a small group on online gamers and a couple of band kids in my class I started to date a girl in the freshman class who was very nice and accepted me for who I was We spend two of seven days a week together and talked as much as possible Things went wonderfully till summer came along I had taken her out to the movies in my car and decided to stop at the lake on the way home to take a walk under the stars I brought along a blanket and when we had found a nice spot with a clear view of the sky we set it down and layed back and talked about life However we didnt keep track of time and I was thirty minutes late back home My mom scolded me severely and sent me off to bed which I gladly did The next morning my brother and brotherinlaw went with along with me to go to the theater and my BIL asked me if I had done anything with my girlfriend last night Sarcastically I replied in a fitting tone yeah suuure Later that day my mom asked me to join her in the living room and she began to interrogate me She had snooped through my car and found my blanket and accused me of having sex with my girlfriend I denied it and stuck to my story However she said that a parent had certain instincts and that God was telling her that I was lying She refused to accept my answer though I gave it over and over again Eventually she took my car keys from my hand disconnected my internet connection and confiscated my cell phone She refused to let me go out of the house unless for grocery shopping or church I had to wake up at six every morning to read scripture for every hour and was told that I was a disgrace to her and the lord I left on court order to live with my Dad for a month and a half He understood my story and accepted me with open arms into his new home When I returned to my moms after summer was mostly over I said that I didnt believe in god and if she couldnt respect that then I would legally remove myself from her house when I turn  She went nuts telling me that I was going to go to hell for disobeying her that I was a worthless and ungrateful child and that she regretted bringing me into this worldSo here I am ratheism I am grateful that you have taken the time to hear me rant and I would appreciate any advice on how to deal with my situation She refuses to acknowledge that I have the power to make decisions on my own and until I turn  I have to hunker down and keep lowTLDR My

skorost,5,5,1rnen1,3,Nihilism is a rather mysterious philosophical concept and hence a rather difficult one to grasp One must dig deep into the philosophical tradition to fully understand what it means what it entails and how anyone could subscribe to it But here I will hopefully and with some measure of success do so here I will develop and formulate that harrowing realm of thought that we call nihilism that movement towards nothingness and bring to the fore the nature of those in and by whom it is expressednamely those of a religious persuasion who derive the value of their lives and of their deeds therein from a divine realm outside the worldEvidence regarding the ostensible meaning of nihilism can be found in the etymology of the word itself It consists of the root nihil which in Latin means nothing This nevertheless does not inform us as to how the word is being used and thusly what it means Nor would it really tell us definitively what the word means if we were to look it up in a dictionary yet we will nonetheless and indeed in doing so we come across an oddly wide range of senses to which the word nihilism is attached as well as a wide range of fields which submit their own definition of it Let us examine a few of these just for the sake of clarityIn philosophy nihilism traditionally refers to Extreme skepticism maintaining that nothing has a real existence In ethics it is formulated as the rejection of all moral principles And yet one more definition we might find is The belief that all endeavors are ultimately futile and devoid of meaning These are all in one sense or another correct but none of them quite penetrates to the heart of nihilism to the cause of it rather they each seem to be dancing around it as though it were a black hole and they were trying to keep beyond its event horizon for fear of being trapped by it and yet to observe it no less as if it could be known fully from the outside Indeed it seemsto me at leastthat these definitions reflect only a vague awareness of the conditions from which nihilism naturally proceeds so I suppose that it is my task to tie them all together into the larger picture that they formI myself if I had to put forth a definition of the word would pronounce it thusly Belief in or towards nothingness Yet that is also too simple if only because it does not inherently paint the picture of what is happening Regardless let us look at the first sense of the word I introduced namely that one concerning extreme skepticism Skepticism is a very useful tool of thinking in that by virtue of it we question our assumptions which we might also call faith and drive ourselves ever towards truth and honesty As I noted in the introduction I am very much a skepticas any educated or intellectual person necessarily needs to bebut it is also necessary that I subscribe to some measure of faith That is to say I must assume a certain range of truths in particular the healthy functioning of my brain and hence the integrity of my own sense experiences and perceptions But I assume these things insofar as I rely on them to function as a human being I am also aware of the possibility that my brain is perhaps in fact not working properly but the lack of evidence to suggest this gives me grounds to assume that it is after all working properlyIf that doesnt aptly demonstrate what Im getting at then consider the alternatives if I were not skeptical at all then I would believe whatever anyone told me regardless of whether or not any two statements or notions contradicted each other I would be a tool at the disposal of everyone else a puppet to be manipulated a gob of clay to be molded I would not be a functional human being were this the case and my reality would consist of the illusions which I accept without questionAnd on the other hand if I rejected everything every assumption every possible truth on the grounds that I cannot know anything with any certainty I would be unable to see my life and my existence as anything but an endless inalterable dream a stage of illusions and phantoms where all is pretend all is fantasy and where nothing I do has any real effect or real meaning outside of myself and my hallucinationa profound despairing selfannihilating solipsism I am God and this is all just a sad pathetic daydream Nothing is real,1385653098.0,Religion makes life meaningless only those who do not believe truly have purpose in this life,8,atheism,top_week

NotFreeAdvice,18,6,1rd1yo,2,First off why do we care to address this issue  Everyone in this subreddit probably understands that religion is not scientific  However there are many religious people that do not understand this  They will attempt to argue that religion can be scientific  In the worst case scenario they then attempt to influence public policy with this misconception  Working under the assumption that it is respectful personal interactions with the religious that are most likely to change minds what is needed is a very concise way of showing them that they are incorrect  I feel that the best way to do this is to show that religion cannot even formulate the most basic tools of science  the hypothesis  The general idea is to show that the traditional assertion of religion the existence of a god or gods is not a wellformed scientific hypothesis  This is for two reasons such assertions are neither falsifiable nor are they testable  We can examine these both in turnThe religious position is not falsifiableThe traditional religious assertion is that fill in the blank gods exists  For instance in Christianity the idea is that the Jewish god exits  However this is not a falsifiable statement  The reason is that one can never prove that this god does not exist  Consider a different example  The statement lime green monkeys with  hands exist  You can never prove that this statement is false  Even if you searched the entire world and did not find such a monkey you could not be certain that you didnt just miss the one such monkey that exists  Thus there is always the possibility that the monkey exists but you didnt find it  This is just a restatement of the black swan effect but it is an important point to return to in debates with the religious  In order to be a wellformed hypothesis you need to either provide more details ie a  handed green monkey exists in my backyard and can be seen today at pm  Or you need to reformulate the statement as a negative ie  handed green monkeys do not exist  Both of these statements are clearly falsifiable  For the reasons the atheistic position is a scientific one There is no god is a falsifiable statement  The religious position is not testableAgain the traditional description of gods  especially in Christianity  is not testable  The god itself is stipulated to be unobservable directly and thus cannot be verified  Thus no test can be constructed  Unless a religious person can formulate a plausible test that would lead to possible falsification of their statement it cannot be counted as scientific  When debating a religious person this should be stressed  Asked them for a specific test of their statement that would lead to falsification of their position  In the absence of such a test their position cannot be scientific  Again the atheistic statement can be made testable fairly readily  If one takes the statement there is no god and substitutes any particular god within that statement then all that must be demonstrated is that specific god does exist  which in turn negates the original atheistic position  In summary the atheistic position is both falsifiable and testable which renders it scientific  The religious position is neither falsifiable nor testable which renders it ascientific  When debating religious folk  especially regarding what should be taught in science classes  this is a good tactic to use  These two simple points stress the fact that they are forwarding a position that is simply not scientific  Anyway I welcome any thoughts on this line of reasoning  ,1385319178.0,A simple strategy for demonstrating why the traditional religious position is not scientific but the atheistic position is scientific,8,atheism,top_week

DaemonicSpookyLadder,0,7,1rnhz5,0,Rudolf Otto was a theologian who first coined the word numinous Mircea Eliade later used this word in his work on shamanism and it has become a common word used in academia but in my opinion he really abused what the original context of the word was which was that the numinous is connected to the human empathy of daemonicdread Rudolf Otto analyzed the numinous through what he thought was a primal emotion in its own original category unto itself which he called daemonicdread  the shudder hair standing on end spooky feeling derived from the reading of the gothic horror story Himself in his time he analyzed that experience through Bible stories such as Jacobs Ladder but fascinatingly he raised the gothic to the level of religious literature praising the poems of Blake  for its supernatural thrill  and Wuthering Heights  with its sombre torment of passion Ironically he considered the emotion of daemonic dread debased and primitive Despite that he asserted that none the less it has a potent effect on people and the feeling can break out in the soul in all its original naivety and so to be experienced afresh even among persons of higharound education That this is so is shown by the potent attraction again and again in the horror and shudder in ghost stories In modern times English literary critics have used his work titled The Idea Of The Holy in the analysis of H P Lovecraft Arthur Machen and Algernon Blackwood Ill give you some film trailers and you can reply with what you think The logic goes something like this  The idea of a ghost is spooky the reaction is physical and there is a causal relationship between that reaction and spirit communion which kickstarts the alchemical apparatus Channeling  Exit Profane Enter Sacred Is daemonicdread a real human emotion I think this is selfevident its the reason ghost stories are popular Its a fear unlike others it should be emphasized that its a unique emotion unto itself If it is a real human emotion could it have a function for initiating into shamanism This is my ethnographic evidence From Chongho Kims Korean Shamanism The Cultural ParadoxSoh Bosal started the kut ritual with a drum sitting together with Okis Mother on the mat It was a very cold and windy night even though it was spring Everything seemed to be frozen in the spring cold It was so cold that I came back to the car for a rest while Soh Bosal performed the first phase of the kut I was not keen to observe the first phase because it just consisted of routine procedures I took a cigarette out of my pocket and put it in my mouth Suddenly I felt a strong haunted feeling in the air around me It felt as if a ghost was going to jump in front of the windscreen I was so scared that I felt goose bumps appearing on my skin and a shiver ran down my spine I turned on the cars interior light and looked in the rear vision mirror because it felt as though a ghost was about to enter the car through the rear windscreen and squeeze my neck from the back seat I locked all ofthe doors But still the spooky feeling did not go away So I switched on the radio and turned up the sound  I began to talk to myself  What is the reason I was possessed by a haunted feeling just now  What did Mirims Mother say to you She said I do not like to see kut rituals where there seem to be lots of ghosts around I feel as if worms are going around my body Yes The haunted feeling  Chisuns Grandmother said to me  The waves of life made me know this way  Linda  asked me in a letter Why do they take responsibility for the dark side of life  I continued to talk to myself Because of the dark side of social life there is a cultural domain dealing with the experience of misfortune in Korean culture In contrast to ordinary domains the field of misfortune is full of darkness and dampness Look at this kut for Okis Mother Isnt it full of darkness  It is my impression that shamanism looks like a poisonous creature Korean shamanism is very colourful its dances and music are dynamic and costumes are full of bright colour However most adult Koreans know that its poisonousness This is why Yongkis Mother said Im not going to a kut ritual because I am afraid of being possessed by the spirits kwisine ssiuiulggaba Is there any ordinary Korean who likes to be possessed This is why they dont like to be involved in shamanic practices This is why shamanism has been stimatized in Korean history This is also why my research has encountered such strong resistance in the field The field which I have been investigating is the field of misfortune Why do people seek shamanic practices even though they dont like shamanism How can this paradox be explained Yes Like cures like The mode of shamanic healingis homeopathic It is like using derivates of poison when one is bitten by a venomous snake In Korean society there is no one who suffers from misfortune more than the shaman and no man or woman ever wants to be a shaman The shamanic illness an extreme of misfortune makes the shaman a healer  the Stick held by Okis Mother still showed no sign of being possessed even though it sometimes shivered a little bit Soh Basal asked again Is it like something has come Okis Mother replied shakily Well I dont know The Stick shivered a little bit Here are some film

sun was set and he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and lay down in that place to sleep And he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it And behold the Lord stood above it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father and the God of Isaac the land whereon thou liest to thee will I give it and to thy seed And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed And behold I am with thee and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of And Jacob awaked out of his sleep and he said Surely the Lord is in this place and I knew it not And he was afraid and said How dreadful is this place this is none other but the house of God and this is the gate of heavenTo really appreciate Rudolf Ottos theories in anthropological studies Ive never seen an author on shamanism use him as a reference and I find that really sad since I think it is very fundamental to understanding some forms of shamanism anyway you really got to look to Korean shamanism but especially Vietnamese mediumship Ghosts Of War In Vietnam by Heonik KwonWar And Shadows The Haunting of Vietnam by Mai Lan GustaffsonSpirits Without Borders by Karen Fjelstad  Ill give you additional complexity by combining the theories of Rudolf Otto with those of Marcel Mauss Mauss theorized a sort of psychology of gift giving within the economy of Polynesian islanders He believed that offerings at shrines contain mana which is inalienable from the giver haunts the receiver until it is reciprocated to its owner To put it another way the most profuse sacrifices yield the greatest rewards A modern analogy would be the boss of organized crime that gives you a shiny watch and expects not only a favour in return but an emotional commitment that can be immensely powerful PotlatchhttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvNgYjQwBfOverview of the Maussian principle of ReciprocityhttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvlAKBcsATwin Korean ShamanismKut  Happiness Through Reciprocity by Hyunkey Kim Hogarththe Shaman in ritual offers their chi which is consumed by the Hungry Ghosts and channeled back in reciprocation to the shaman This empowering ritual is regularly performed Korean Christians heavily influenced by shamanism interpret the infilling of the Holy Spirit as chi Shamanism In Korean Christianity by Jang Nam Hyuck This energy is pneumatic as in yoga from Korean Shaman Rituals by Jung Young LeeOur special interest lies in the initiation process of charismatic shamans who are primarily confined to the midcentral part of Korea where Seoul is located The initiation process of shamans is known by many different names such as Gansin Sini naerinda Sini orunda Sini tanda and so on Perhaps these terms are best translated in English as the intrusion of spirit in the body even though it is usually understood as the possession of spirits  When the spirit enters or approaches the body  it is known as Sinju or the spiritual master or spiritual self who becomes a counterpart of the shamans soul Here the spirit master acts as yang or the active principle and the soul of the shaman is yin or the receptive principle Both of them coexist together as wife and husband In other words it indicates the intimate union of two souls the male and female or the male god and the female shaman or the female god and the male shaman  To say this another way the mystical union between god and shaman is primarily sexual It is rather interesting to examine the term Sini tanda which literally means to place god over shamans body which seems to indicate the proper position for sexual intercourse  We occasionally hear people talk about the loss of soul or or the escape of soul Talhon To me sic these terms are inadequately applied to the Korean shamans It is not the state of no soul or escape of soul but the state where the soul is completely receptive to the coming of spirit When the spirit comes in there is a mystical union the oneness of two which creates the experience of ecstasy  This wedding with god is known as Naerim gut or Kangshin gut which formalizes the initiation of shamanhoodIf any of you have any inquisitive questions I can help with that I would love to write a very detailed essay winding through more pop culture youd be familiar with such as the Type O Negative song All Hallows EvehttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvabmuKofMkw but there is only so much I can write before people stop reading and dont care Music goes a bit beyond attention spans and is far more abstract I recommend checking out the lyrics to that song and considering daemonicdread and Mauss in your analysis of his incantation My suggestion is very serious because I am aware of Peter Steeles spiritual emergence crisishttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvPhaismWL  it was that album that song which is a great synthesis of this particular shamanism theory Whitley Strieber wrote a book called Communion made into a film starring Christopher Walken critics have noticed that his alien is little more than

skorost,0,4,1rgvrw,0,This is a blog Ive been following it discusses why religion is wrong and why we need to start thinkingHere is a samplePerhaps we should start with the obvious it is impossible to prove or disprove the existence of God  There is no evidence for either claim no way of testing or observing either possibility  The most sophisticated theists to their credit will readily admit that they can offer up no tangible or empirical evidence to substantiate the claim that a being such as God exists  It is something they must take on faith something which they must believe without evidence  Similarly the most sophisticated scientists and secular thinkers could not offer any evidence to substantiate the claim that no such being as God existsnor would theyIndeed this notion that secularists or atheists as they are popularly known positively assert that God in fact does not exist is a frequent and gross misrepresentation of their intellectual position  To be sure there are atheists who are just as dogmatic and fundamentalist as any religious fundamentalist who lack the intellectual sophistication and honesty to be as critical of themselves and their own beliefs as they are of others and who no doubt inherited their atheistic dogmas to the same degree of piety and thoughtlessness as any religious person rather than discovering it and developing it for themselves  Let it be known not one sincere secularist would deny that such is the case  Stupidity and bigotry are to be opposed in all of their formsHence it is not my goal to destroy religious people or even to do away with religious ceremony or tradition  My aim is to destroy the fallacy lying at the heart of religious faith to pluck the wrench that has been jammed into the cogs of the human mind to quell the impulse towards superstitious belief in the absence of rational explanation  The issue I and others like myself take with the whole notion of God is not that God does or does not exist in any factual sense but that our experience of reality as human beings has no need of such an assumption and furthermore we hold that the assumption itself ultimately serves to denigrate and cheapen the limitless complexity and breathtaking beauty of the universeA classical illustration of this viewpoint comes from a supposed exchange between the eighteenthcentury physicist PierreSimon Laplace and Napoleon Bonaparte who after receiving Laplaces work on the physical model of the solar system remarked that there was no mention of God throughout it to which Laplace replied essentially It works without that assumptionIndeed belief in God is not necessary to possess or develop an understanding or appreciation of the universe and its complexity  Here the theist will make a hurried effort to argue that while this may be true Gods existence is necessary to explain why the universe exists at all why something exists rather than nothing  But I contend that such is not the case and furthermore that God is no explanation at all  The presupposition of the existence of God does not describe the mechanisms by which the universe came into being it does not describe the processes underlying these profound mysteries  Rather God is a notion which mystifies them further which darkens them and which in most cases contents itself not simply to leave them obscure and unknown but to actively obfuscate themGod is a copout it is intellectual and nihilistic resignation it is an appeal to the ease with which ignorance gleefully closes its eyes and blinds itself it is an affront to the heroic brilliance of human reason and the search for truth it is laziness complacency and willful blindness and I would argue that in todays world it is morally wrong to profess the existence of God in such a way that disenfranchises reason and scientific endeavors  Such a mindset is something which we must wholeheartedly and tenaciously oppose it is the delusion the cancerous assumption that lies at the heart of radical conservatism that fundamental resistance to change to adaptation to the very idea of evolution  Indeed it is a mindset which allows the ancient world to tyrannize and destabilize the present world which offers up eternal and absolute values where new ones must be establishedThe relationship between religion reason science and morality will not be the central argument of this section but I will address it in due time and with due considerationFor now just imagine you are sitting in the passenger seat in a vehicle which is speeding towards a cliff and the person in control of this vehicle believes that God will not let the car plummet will not let you and himself die or maybe even that it does not matter if you both die because you will be ushered into the next life  Naturally you want desperately to reach over and slam on the brakes  The driver of this vehicle is insane and as the precipice approaches every part of you every animal instinct written in to you every shred of reason echoing inside you rejects what this driver believes because you know that God will not save you regardless of if such a being exists or notthe belief itself does not matter does not change realityThis is the plight of the whole human species and of the whole earth  We are headed towards an abyss a world climate crisis the threat of overpopulation resource exhaustion pandemic and those

jeeple,14,5,1rgmlx,0,This time last year I was a situational Catholic  I attended church periodically and thought of all the pageantry as although overdone sort of nice  Familiar  HarmlessSince then Ive lost my faith in a rather drastic fashion  Ive become really antagonistic towards religion although I dont voice it even to my own family  I used to see the holiday busyness as fun and festive now it seems like a materialistic shared delusion that I want no part of  My SO and kids are busy decorating the house all I want to do is hide and read a bookYears ago we stopped giving lots of gifts and focused our holidays on spending time together and donating to charity so Ive already done away with most of the commercialism of the holiday  But now that it holds no religious meaning for me I cant figure out how to navigate this time and really enjoy it  Im afraid Ill be unhappy and cynicalHow do atheists find meaning in the holidays  What is there for you in this,1385428756.0,Atheists what do the holidays mean to you,5,atheism,top_week

Varaben,11,7,1rklji,0,The conclusion I have come up with is a pretty common sense one but nonetheless I havent come across it in my Internet travels yet so I wanted to share with you all We typically talk about natural selection in a biological way Certain traits are better than others which can lead to better survival making those traits more common But what I am talking about is those traits that religions possess that make them survive in a similar wayOften one of the traits common to religions is that they are unfalsifiable Their claims are supernatural or metaphysical such that with our physical means we cant detect them Thats one trait thats selected for the survival of religionsThis shouldnt be a surprise but I think its interesting and ironic to frame religions in this manner Those religions that have certain traits or if youre a conspiracy theorist were crafted this way tend to have larger followings and last longer Imagine a religion that said something like The speed of light is actually only  ms not  ms We could easily prove that wrong so the religion would not be on firm footingSome religions like Christianity are extraordinary at selfcorrection What I mean is that its easy for a Christian to turn any situation into a selfsupporting one Your life got saved during a cancer surgery Thank god for sending the doctor You died after the surgery wasnt successful Thank god youre in heaven now This is another trait that helps this particular religion surviveSo my argument is that religions that are able to maintain this sort of sidestepping routine are those that last the longest Theres dozens of examples specific to Christianity that Im sure you can think of Thats all I wanted to say hopefully that makes sense Next time you see a religion try to unpack it and see what makes it so resilient I think youll find some interesting traits that have been selected for its survival PS For those philosophers out there Im aware this is a form of the genetic fallacy Im not saying this natural selection process means religions arent true but rather its one means we can figure out why they continue to have followers There are plenty of other reasons to believe religions arent true  ,1385561500.0,Religious Natural Selection,6,atheism,top_week

jackwhite,8,8,1rhck3,0,The notion that atheists are somehow more moral than religious folk because of their ability to differentiate between right and wrong due to the fact that atheists are not following a prescribed method of living seems highly contradictory to the common atheistic logical conclusion that people are hardwired the same way regardless of religious affiliation  Yes people with religious backgrounds can point to specific writings that make general claims regarding what we as humans see as morally correct or reprehensible but these claims are conclusions drawn by human beings as a whole  As logicappreciating people the atheist community should recognize this as a natural human acceptance of what we as a species have deemed to be evolutionarily beneficial put into textThis type of right and wrong reasoning should be acceptable to a large majority of the earths population but if it is spoonfed to you as a child mixed with fantastical stories it becomes difficult to separate the human nature with mass appeal from the mythology it is mixed withThe sensational stories become a backdrop from which to contextualize personal feelings of morality and can become the a major part of belief systemsAtheists are not more moral Religious people experience the same sense of wrong after committing a wrong act but can sometimes misattribute it due to their upbringing In my opinion and from what I have seen frequently around this sub SOME posters have taken the view that we are better people for behaving the way that people should behave because were people and that the religious only have their religions to support their actions Christians do good deeds to get into HeavenIf we as a community trivialize the actions of the religious to following a code then we are taking the same path as religious people who say that atheists have no reason to do good deeds,1385449801.0,Ive seen this postedreferenced a lot around here and I disagree with it on a basic level,8,atheism,top_week

hulivar,3,7,1rnyt0,0,And then I got to thinking about just how connected our consciousness is to our biologyIf you think about our consciousness and how it came to be it was brought forth through our five senses  And of course are senses rely on biological processes in order to function  Basically my point is the consciousness is so directly dependent on biological processes that the thought of a soul doesnt make sense  Just think about all of the things that you experience such as being hungry being scared remorseful annoyed and every other emotion  Basically what Im getting at is your consciousness completely revolves around biology  Without your senses and your feelings how would a consciousness even come to be One thing I thought of was nerve bundles and other feelings that you have that arent in your brain  Like your sense of touch and painthat feeling is localized wherever the nerves are  When I stub my toe I feel the pain down there its not like my consciousness is separate from ityou get what I meanAlso likeI start to think just how many things affect my consciousness when its supposed to be this soulseparate entity  For instance when you get tired you start to think slower  When you get a headache you cant think straight  When you do different type of drugs your perception of reality is completely changed  All of these things are biological reactions that directly affect your consciousness  Anyway Im just saying that I dont think the consciousness is likethis special thing  I almost hope Im wrong though because as time goes on and science progresses I worry that we will find out that consciousness is nothing special and then I worry about mans motivation to create life after thatI understand that the argument can be made that the consciousness arises from all of these biological processes and is a special entity or a soul or whateverbut it just doesnt make sense to me I guessLike when I try to do certain thought experiments like thisImagine you replace someones body and brain atom for atom one by one while they are conscious the entire timeuntil eventually they are made up of all new atoms  You might say you are still you correctWell then lets say you take those same atoms that make you up now and you make a copy of yourselfwhich is essentially you right now as you were replaced atom for atom while still conscious  So you have this copy nowboth of you exist at the same timeand I shoot you in the head  Is the copy now you orIs it about not losing consciousness then  What if I just shoot you in the head right now  And then I take a bunch of atoms and make an exact copy of you the only difference is it was done without you being conscious this time  Is that you  Lastly what if we replace you atom for atom while still being awake but meanwhile taking your discarded atoms and making another you atom by atom until heshe is conscious  What if it were done while you werent awake  We all think about things like this just like the whole star trek teleporter thing killing you every time you use it  The reason non of this makes sense is because as humans we assume the consciousness is special and unique when most likely it is not  If you view the consciousness as nothing special then these thought experiments actually make senseAnyway I was just thinking of the movie The th Man with Arnold Schwarzenegger where when someone dies they take a ocular device and scan the persons memories and then they put those memories into a cloned copy of yourself  The problem is this movie portrayed it like it was everlasting life and the ocular scanner was somehow scanning your soul  Anywho what do you guys think,1385669499.0,So I was thinking about people that believe the consciousness is a soul or whatever,3,atheism,top_week

bendaman,5,7,1rmdzk,0,hey it is so sad to hear so much hate and anger against SDA and EGW  Where does it really come from  We all are given choices and have a bible to learn from so study and find your own truth  The schools didnt really give only one idea there are many ideas and many peoples opinions  I went to school in many places and most was public school  Loved my science teacher in La Mesa High School who said here in the book is the chapter on evolution read it if you want  He knew evolution isnt true for if was it would be continuing on  You will find a day when you will be alone and be praying why me Lord and what next  He is coming soon so many more people are showing anger against God the churches the schools that are trying to teach about Christianity  We have a choice to study and learn for ourselves and to make our own decision  But from what I saw you write against Adventist schools I can hear and see you have a lot of anger coming from something else that is going on in your life  Those schools are not you  Only you can find the truth which doesnt come from the anger and hate of any religion or schools  You have the choice to open the door to your heart and be a part of the good or the evil part of the truth or the untruths  Look at the movies out there they are all showing the battle between the good and bad  May you find what you need and are searching for  Maybe you are from a single parent home or from  parents who dearly cared and loved you enough to put you in Christian schools  Maybe you had to go but you are the one who is in charge to learn more about the choices we all have and live with  They didnt make you believe and Satan really will tug and pull until he wins but God is always there and doesnt force nor tug He is waiting for each of us to make our decisions  May he guide and bless you  You are loved and god is loveThe following is exactly what she said regarding evolution if it was true then it would still be continuing How come only true for past  years my grandparents if were still alive would be  plus years now they never saw any evolution going on Have you been at a birth of a baby it is such a miracle when one is born and do well there are so many things that can go wrong during the birth of each child Where do you see evolution happening for I havent seen it except for frogs starting as a guppy to a frog those babies arent coming from evolution By the way I did watch a video in high school on evolution and did read different versions of it It isnt really proven to be true It is interesting but sure wasnt believable to me and didnt see any scientific proof in the book when it talked of what could be regarding Jonah and the whale he had to of smelled awful after such an experience and yes it may of been a miracle but if look at it from a scientist side they probably could tell you that one could live inside a large whale and eat off the fish the whale swallowed and have air but I wouldnt want to find out if could Truthfully there is more to the storyI dont always have the faith and the arguments for dont want to argue nor prove to anyone the truth I am weak on the Bible but have gone to campmeeting this past summer where our speaker did a good job comparing history from real history and what the Bible also said prior it happening the Bible next to history shows the truth but I couldnt give it to you you could go check out the history books and read the history in revelation but maybe can be found on the internet at amazing facts How old are you what do you really believe life is about without mentioning any religion Ok day to day morning to night do you feel we just are a existence of a body that will eventually age and die what does die mean then nothing ok take that as what kind of life is it then ok I am living on a day to day basis working to pay bills for my existence fine When I read history in college an Adventist one there was no watered down stuff it was history facts and not biblical but history I hated history due to it was always hard for me in public high school as well as collegeBut the real thing here concerning me as a mom of kids is seeing so much anger that it is directed at your past and the church Forget the church as you think of it Look at yourself There is something more driving that anger out from somewhere you dont believe in religion and church that is fine but what else deep inside of you is really causing the anger who else broke the trust or hurt you no church or religion is in control of my decisions I make my own mistakes and mess up I get angry a lot for I got abused and hurt and do have a hard time trusting anyone or anything but life goes on That anger I have comes out sometimes with anger at God at family at religion even from me but I am thankful to be able to believe in there is a God You dont have to but your anger is more then God or a religion Hope you find the truth within yourself and get peace and love that you do need from yourself then eventually if your anger calms down you will have a partnerwife that will be able to show you unconditional love or maybe you have found that The anger can hurt our relationships so it is good to work out some of that anger without hurting others with itSomeday you will learn and understand more and know He does care for you and everyone around us But each of us will make our own decision and find what works for ourselves so go and find your peace however you find what gives you peace and LovePs I have  children and one of my sons may believe in the bible but he has the same feelings as you do about sda religion etc and my other sone is into the sda then my girl the youngest not sure where she is at with it,1385609143.0,I wrote a brief post

of Arthur Machen with H P Lovecrafthttpwwwteemingbraincomtheteemingbrainpodcastcosmichorrorvssacredterror  heres a quote from H P LovecraftThis type of fearliterature must not be confounded with a type externally similar but psychologically widely different the literature of mere physical fear and the mundanely gruesome Such writing to be sure has its place as has the conventional or even whimsical or humorous ghost story where formalism or the authors knowing wink removes the true sense of the morbidly unnatural but these things are not the literature of cosmic fear in its purest sense The true weird tale has something more than secret murder bloody bones or a sheeted form clanking chains according to rule A certain atmosphere of breathless and unexplainable dread of outer unknown forces must be present and there must be a hint expressed with a seriousness and portentousness becoming its subject of that most terrible conception of the human brain  a malign and particular suspension or defeat of those fixed laws of Nature which are our only safeguard against the assaults of chaos and the dæmons of unplumbed space Naturally we cannot expect all weird tales to conform absolutely to any theoretical model Creative minds are uneven and the best of fabrics have their dull spots Moreover much of the choicest weird work is unconscious appearing in memorable fragments scattered through material whose massed effect may be of a very different cast Atmosphere is the allimportant thing for the final criterion of authenticity is not the dovetailing of a plot but the creation of a given sensation We may say as a general thing that a weird story whose intent is to teach or produce a social effect or one in which the horrors are finally explained away by natural means is not a genuine tale of cosmic fear but it remains a fact that such narratives often possess in isolated sections atmospheric touches which fulfill every condition of true supernatural horrorliterature Therefore we must judge a weird tale not by the authors intent or by the mere mechanics of the plot but by the emotional level which it attains at its least mundane point If the proper sensations are excited such a high spot must be admitted on its own merits as weird literature no matter how prosaically it is later dragged down The one test of the really weird is simply this  whether of not there be excited in the reader a profound sense of dread and of contact with unknown spheres and powers a subtle attitude of awed listening as if for the beating of black wings or the scratching of outside shapes and entities on the known universes utmost rimHeres a poem by Sir Charles G D Roberts that illustrates the experience of daemonic dreadThe SkaterMy glad feet shod with the glittering steel I was the god of the wingèd heel The hills in the far white sky were lost The world lay still in the wide white frost And the woods hung hushed in their long white dream By the ghostly glimmering iceblue stream Here was a pathway smooth like glass Where I and the wandering wind might pass To the faroff palaces drifted deep Where Winters retinue rests in sleep I followed the lure I fled like a bird Till the startled hollows awoke and heard A spinning whisper a sibilant twang As the stroke of the steel on the tense ice rang And the wandering wind was left behind As faster faster I followed my mind Till the blood sang high in my eager brain And the joy of my flight was almost pain The I stayed the rush of my eager speedAnd silently went as a drifting seed Slowly furtively till my eyesGrew big with the awe of a dim surmiseAnd the hair of my neck began to creepAt hearing the wilderness talk in sleepShapes in the firgloom drifted nearIn the deep of my heart I heard my fearAnd I turned and fled like a soul pursuedFrom the white inviolate solitude The Flight Of The Geese I hear the low wind wash the softening snowThe low tide loiter down the shore The

hulbhen,66,13,1rpxdg,0,Id like to start off this post with giving a brief background on my religious views or lack thereof I grew up in a very liberal household who fell into more of a CalvanistLutheranist ideaset As such with the freedom of choice I found myself not to believe in any theistic religions as they are todayHaving said that I subscribed to this subreddit as more of a provision to be a part of this community with a similar mindset and its only been recently that I have spent time really looking through this subreddit and to be frank I see a lot of bashing of religious people mainly Christians While in ideologies I do disagree with much of the Christian faith I think its important not to forget what that specific organized religion has done Namely I think its important not to remember that many local churches hold fundraisers lead disaster relief and provide shelter for the homeless And I do think that thats a very important part of the Christian religion itself as being a wholesome person a good Samaritan if you will is a central part of the religiontldr Im an atheist and see a lot of hate towards religious people on this subreddit while some of its warranted theres a lot of good that I feel like there is a lot of good from organized religions thats being overlookedEDIT I created this post in the hope to have an open discussion on the merits of organized religion that are so often overlooked and overshadowed by the indoctrinating acts of the church but it seems as if there is an overwhelming hatred towards organized religion that people are unable to put aside for even an instant which was the main point of this posting in its origins I would like to reiterate a few keynotes from the few replies I have given out in that I dont think there is more good than harm being done by organized religion but quite the contrary I also dont want these few acts to rationalize the poor decisions made by organized religions And finally I dont think that these few acts of good should be the main focus but they do exist and many people forget thatI personally dont have an existential hatred towards those who believe in organized religion and I find myself to be tolerant in the face of organized religion I wanted to bring an air of tolerance to this seemingly hatefilled subreddit and I suppose in that endeavor I have failed to communicate this to a group of people that are stuck in their mindset Because of that I wont be responding to any more of the comments left on this posting unless its clear that the commentor is willing to cast aside hisher prejudices to have an intellectual conversation on the matterEDIT  Yes I understand my comment is very unpopular That much is clear thanks guys,1385746845.0,As an atheist seeing a lot of bashing Christians on this subreddit,5,atheism,top_week
