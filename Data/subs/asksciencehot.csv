leftylouis,10,3,1rp7zv,6,So far my understanding of light is that it is radiation of an photon or a wavelengthin this case it isnt a particle But i know that by the decay of an electron to a lower shell there will be energy wich will be emitted into a wavelength and if has the right ammount of energy then we can see it  so is it that in a lightbulb that you force a lot of electrons through wire that doesnt really allow them to pass but how do they release radiation in this way and how does a LED do this about the electron You have a neutron with betadecay udd to uud the up is a bit lighter then the down so there is some excess energy wich is a electron and a positron anti electron the electron has a negative charge nad the proton a positive but doe this charge mean a constant emission of photons wich makes electromagnetism wich keeps makes up the electron shells and what does the negative charge do i am probably a bit on the wrong path with this story but i dont really know how to ask my questions but i hope this makes senseand ofcourse now knowing if a electron is a particle or a wavelength isnt really helping me either because it is hard to think something is not a particle but but a wavelength and then what is a wavelength but in some situations it is hard to understand that there is a particle without mass etc etc i dont want to spend too much time on this but i allready gave up on even thinking about it i just want to learn some basics so i know what is going on while doing chemistry instead of just using electrons interacting with protonsThanks,1385714678.0,How does a Lightbulb or LED emit photons  from electron to photon,9,askscience,hot
