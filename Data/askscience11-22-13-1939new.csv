trevmiller,8,2,1r8r2g,9,An article I recently read on the Mayo Clinic website states Pregnancy stresses your heart and circulatory system During pregnancy your blood volume increases by  to  percent to nourish your growing baby The amount of blood your heart pumps each minute also increases by  to  percent This leads me to believe that the circulatory systems of mom and baby are intertwined somehow Is this true Secondarily if moms blood is flowing through baby what happens when say mom is Type A and baby is Type O,Is a pregnant womans circulatory system pumping blood through the baby And if so how does the body handle different blood types between mom and baby,11

Penjach,4,2,1r8phn,6,Right now I am studying citric acid cycle oxidative phosphorylation and other energy related cell mechanisms  Googling about I realized that bacteria have evolved to harvest almost all conceivable energy sources Furthermore scientists have been able to modify some strands to eat some compounds they were not able before  Because the final step to all those processes is making local electrical potential difference that is then used to make ATP I wonder if direct voltage induced by a couple of electrodes could be used by bacteria for their energy needs  Of course I guess some nutrients like aminoacids and iron ions would be included in the substrate but not glucose or fatty acids except in very small quantities for cell membrane production etc,Bacteria are able to harvest many compounds for energy But are there bacteria that can live from electrical energy,8

doomybear,2,1,1r70u0,7,I know that this is a kind of weird question to ask but I thought I would at least give it a go I know that birds tend to eat seeds and kernels This makes sense Complex carbohydrates are high in energy density and offer nutrition over a longer period of time than simple sugars although hummingbirds make better use of nectar apparently and as far as I can suppose its not advantageous to be weighed down by heavy foods or fat storage when birds have to fly      Im finding it a lot harder to find information about other mammals and their consumption of starch If its not a bird complex carbohydrate consumption seems to be opportunistic instead of a dietary staple I think pigs seems to be okay with a starchy diet Do omnivores in general have the adaptations to eat starch regularly      The other question is about what happens to other animals if they are put on a complex carbohydrate diet The only studies I know concern cornfed cows in which the tradeoff is from grass to corn Just from wikipediaorg cornfed cows have a more acidic digestive process leading to a more virulent strain of E Coli surviving in their intestinal tracts Cornfed cows are also fatter Would other herbivores suffer comparable complications How about frugivores and carnivores What about reptiles amphibians and fish      Thanks in advance,Complex carbohydrate consumption in nonhumans What other animals have high starch diets What happens when you introduce high starch diets to animals whose usual diet does not contain significant complex carbohydrates,8

BackThatThangUp,1,0,1r6lk9,2,Hi allMy understanding as a layperson is that casein is the component in milk that helps to counteract the capsaicin that causes the hotness of spicy foods  It apparently does this by surrounding the fatty capsaicin molecule and dragging it away from the taste buds in much the way that soap surrounds and then pulls away grease Im curious if a solution containing a significant amount of isolated casein would do a better job of pulling away the capsaicin on the tongue and tastebuds or if milk already happens to contain the maximum effective amount of casein for that purpose Would it be effective enough to justify bothering with it Also would there be any drawbacks to a solution containing so much casein such as toxicity Would it be effective as a gargling solution like Listerine for spicy foods if that was the case,Would a solution containing a significant amount of casein do a more effective job of soothing the burn one experiences when eating spicy foods than an equivalent amount of milk,2

YouRackaDisciprine,3,0,1r6tl1,2,It seems like as time passes DNA polymerase genes that make fewer and fewer errors are likely to become more common since they will more faithfully copy their own genes Obviously there is some baseline level of fidelity necessary for reproduction but a completely error free polymerase will not allow for any adaptation at all Is there an optimal error rate for evolution This question cant be answered without further qualification since it is not clear what exactly is being optimized ie evolution does not have a goal but Id like to hear your thoughts My real question is this Do all species ultimately reach some evolutionary plateau or at least approach it asymptotically as the fidelity of the DNA replication system approaches  Note Im aware that DNA copying relies on various proteins besides just DNA polymerase to copy genes but that doesnt really matter Ultimately there is some system of proteins that replicates DNA and their overall fidelity will tend to increase with time ,Does the genetic mutation rate level off with time,2

BangkokDave,3,1,1r4bju,2,First a disclaimer  I am not an astronomer or a physicist so please let me know if any assumptions made in this question are fundamentally wrongAs I understand it the observable universe is made up of everything that is within our past light cone But the universe is expanding at an increasing rate the more distant the object the faster it is moving away from us and at the threshold of the observable universe space is effectively becoming more distant from us at the speed of light and objects outside the observable universe are presumably becoming more distant at greater than the speed of lightSo does this mean that over time observable objects galaxies etc which are right at the edge of the observable universe will eventually pass the observable threshold will be moving from us at greater than the speed of light and suddenly blink out of existence from our point of viewIf this is correct have we ever witnessed any objects crossing this threshold and becoming unobservable,Question about the expanding universe and the threshold of the observable universe and whether the number of objects in the observable universe is decreasing over time,3

buzzboy,6,2,1qcp3c,8,Ive taken a few lower level physics classes throughout my college career and they have opened up an interesting question about friction So the simple formula for the force of friction is FMN This formula tells me that the surface area of the contact point between the two items does not affect the force of friction Would I be correct to take this to mean its a linear relationship Eg with more surface area there is less pressure per unit area but because there is more area it adds up to the same total force of friction So then if surface area is unimportant in the force of friction why do dragsters use such wide tires It seems that they would get no more frictiongrip from a wider tire than they would from a narrower tire ,Friction vs Surface area applied to dragsters,10
NoCatNoCradle,2,1,1qcmm5,1,Trees at different latitudes get their fall colors at different times Is this because theyve evolved to optimize themselves to the local climate and so theres something in their DNA that tells them when to change colors Or does their environment send them sort of signal based on sunlight or temperature on when to change that has nothing to do with genetics or evolutionI guess another way of asking is this if you took a tree from Maine and plopped it down in Pennsylvania would the timing of its changing leaves change If the answer to that is yes what would happen if you plopped it in the southern hemisphere where the seasons are reversed,Is the timing of tree leaves changing colors based on genetics or environment,2

FlyMeTheMoon,19,4,1qcjtf,2,If thats the case then would say  hours of rocket burn take  hour of rocket burn in the opposite direction to stop you Also since speed is relative to other objects in space the sun is traveling through our galaxy and our galaxy is traveling though the universe  would every moment of push from the rocket be exponentially going faster and faster For instance if Im driving and I hit the gas and I stop at  mph the only reason Im slowing down is because of friction gravity etc  But in space every time I hit the gas its just going faster and faster right,If a spaceship is in space and is going  mpr relative to earth and you hit the rockets at a sec burst the speed you just gained wouldnt stop until a sec burst in the opposite direction occurred,6

Pluvialis,6,6,1qc6h1,11,Is there a hard dividing line between gas and liquid in principleI was thinking about the inhaling in space question someone asked earlier and got to wondering about water evaporating in a vacuum again as you doAs I understand it liquid water sits in my saucepan because although the molecules are loose they dont have enough energy to overpower the Earths atmospheric pressure Thats why in a vacuum liquid water will immediately evaporate One might naively hypothesise that gravity would keep it in but in fact its only atmospheric pressure that normally maintains a liquid phase I hope Im right so farSo if I had water vapour in a canister or something and slowly compressed it eventually Id get a canister of liquid water But how would it transition Would a pool of water or droplets ie something with a surface slowly form If so why What would happen if you expanded it again slowly Wouldnt the water molecules all just gradually get further and further apart belying the distinction we normally make between gas and liquidFor some reason that image seems wrong but I dont know why it shouldnt happen I feel like probably it would instead boil But which one is it and whyEDIT Bonus question I dont know if thats allowed but  How much do atmospheric gas molecules simply follow freefalling trajectories versus being jostled about by neighbouring gaseous molecules Would a molecule of oxygen fly up from the surface of the Earth slowing down until gravity pulls it back down or does it just get smacked about a relatively smaller volume by other molecules how much space actually is there between molecules at atmospheric pressure and how fast do they actually move around,What would happen if you could slowly compress and expand say water vapour Would there be a transition from gas to liquid and if so why,17
