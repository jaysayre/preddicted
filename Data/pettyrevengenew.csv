LovesEwoks,72.0,65.0,1ri9iq,392.0,I have a recipe that my now deceased grandmother had always used for a potato dish Over the years I perfected this recipe experimenting with ingredients and seasonings creating a nearly perfect dish its always a hit at parties dinners and gatheringsAfter I was married I brought this potato dish to one of my spouses family gatherings People raved and immediately requested I bring it to every gathering  I am happy to oblige since the dish is inexpensive to make and very quick and easy to put together The potato dish quickly becomes known as LovesEwoks Potatoes well my actual name not screen name Although I always refer to them as my grandmothers potatoesOver the next few years I bring these potatoes to every family function and every holiday mostly by request I share this recipe many times with my spouses family every aunt uncle cousin and sibling who asks I even give some tips for best resultsA week before Thanksgiving my sisterinlaw calls me explaining she wants to take the potatoes to her inlaws house and asks for specifics on the recipe the exact brands of products I use where I purchased the pan etc I go into great detail giving her step by step instructions for perfect resultsA few days later my motherinlaw calls me asking what dish I planned on bringing to the extended family gathering Oh I thought I would bring the potatoes She informs me that my sisterinlaw Kelly is bringing potatoes and I should bring something else This is not a problem for me since I have a collection of exceptional recipes from my grandmotherWe gather for Thanksgiving and in walks Kelly with her potato dish She removes the cover and its funny because it looks exactly like the dish I always bring I had just assumed she was going to bring something else Nope exact same recipe exact same pan She walks around telling everyone you MUST try Kellys potatoes At first I thought this might have been a joke so I let it go this is not the first time she has acted very jealous and did things for attention In the past she had made comments about not liking the potatoes to family members who complimented my cooking skillsChristmas gathering same situation I decide to ignore it and let her have Kellys potatoes  just not worth dealing with her I had brought along a dessert again people raved and requested I bring it again at Easter thanks grandma It seems I might have a new signature dish My sisterinlaw calls me a few days before Easter asking for the dessert recipe I brought at Christmas can you believe it I give her the recipe except this time I leave out a very small but critically important ingredient Easter gathering I bring my the dessert as requested by the host Just as I suspected in walks Kelly with the exact same dessert I was actually starting to feel a bit guilty until she said everyone must try this I found the recipe on pinterest Needless to say they were terribleSteal my grandmas recipes and call them your own Hope you like recipes that are missing an ingredient,You followed the recipe and it still tastes different How strange,457.0,pettyrevenge,new

squirrelboy,7.0,17.0,1rhb3g,22.0,I live in a pretty scummy college house with  other guys It isnt nice but when it is clean it can almost feel like homeUnfortunately one of my roommates lets call him LB for Lazy Bum as his name suggests is incredibly lazy He doesnt accept any responsibility for the mess he contributes to the houseAmong many other offenses he produces more dirty dishes than the rest of the house combined What I find even more irksome is that LB regularly complains about the mess in the kitchen Hey somebodys got to do the dishes Theyre all HIS I told him flat out but he refused to do themI usually use my own dishes I have  plate  spoon  fork and  bowl I use my pocket knife and drink out of the bottle so I dont need a knife or cup I wash each as soon as I am done eating I cant stand dirty dishesSo for the petty revenge muwhahahaha I began planning how to exact my revenge a few months ago I bought a large plastic container and a gallon of bleach from Walmart I totally looked like a serial killer I took them go the full sinks and proceeded to place every dish into the plastic bin while LB watched I could tell he didnt like this at all but he couldnt say anything because he knew they were all hisUnfortunately this didnt stop him from doing it again After one of my other roommates washed all of LBs dishes he began to fill the sink againTonight it shall end I used my plastic bin amp bleach trick again but this time I took one of his ceramic bowls with me in my car I had to drive on the interstate to get to work and on my way I rolled down the window at mph It didnt matter that it was  degrees F I took the bowl threw it out the window and watched it shatter into a thousand pieces That was one of the most satisfying things I have seen I will continue doing this until he has no dishes to fill the sink withTldr My lazy roommate fills the sink with dishes so I throw them out the window of my car at highway speeds,Fill the sink with dirty dishes Not any more,39.0,pettyrevenge,new

YourFederalOverlord,52.0,218.0,1rg4z6,810.0,When I was in middle school many years ago I had a Digital Arts teacher whos job it was to teach us about computers and how to use them correctly  She did not do that at all instead opting to give us the same typing routines several times over and call it a class  She was also obsessed with the Philadelphia Phillies so she was immensely pleased when they made it to the World Series one year this being back in   She attempted to get tickets but the website was overloaded so instead she did the logical thing and forced her classes to get them for her telling us all to reload the page until it came back online so that she could get her tickets  Failure to comply would mean no credit for the day as well as a black mark on our record  I wasnt pleased by this so I having figured out her administrators password a few days earlier she had it on a sticky note on her desk like a chump surreptitiously logged into the system and added the tickets page to the list of blocked websites before changing her password to  logging out and feigning shock at the sudden block to the page  It took her almost a week to figure out how to unblock the page though the school did figure out the password pretty quickly and she never did end up going to the World Series  God Im horrible    ,No tickets for you,1028.0,pettyrevenge,new

Cawkii,29.0,23.0,1rdk0e,93.0,After watching a video on YouTube it reminded me of this story that me and my Dad had a great laugh too TLDR at the bottom for anyone that doesnt want the build upMy Dad is a lover of his back garden and in the best interests of the birds he put up a variety of bird feeders in this one big tree We can see this tree from our windows and my Dad loves watching the birds eat from his study windowAfter a while we notice a fat squirrel doing the rounds on the lawn and sometime later I notice the squirrel eagerly watching the birds eat out of the feeders probably thinking he wants some too  minutes go by and I look out again to see fat squirrel on the branch of where the main big feeder is hung My Dad had thought of this so he used garden wire instead of rope which he first thought about using The wire isnt very thin about as thick as a pencil I knew the squirrel would be able to get down it and sure enough after  minutes of betting we notice the feeder flying all over the place with one squirrel getting as many nuts in his mouth as he can before my Dad scares him off the hoseThe next day I find my Dad taking down the feeders I think probably to save the money on buying nuts since the squirrel can get into them easily enough now But oh no My Dad is one that he will have his fun with pesky animals such as this squirrel as long as it doesnt well kill them the only animals I could see him kill are pigeons and I dont blame himI go into the garage to find him rubber gloved up thinking that hes going to be removing all the nuts and storing them away oh no he wasnt I find that he practically lathers up all this engine grease all over the wire and then sets them back up with a nice evil smile days go by without any sightings of a squirrel until one day I spot the same fat squirrel come back with his eyes on the prize another bird feeder my dad bought earlier in the day to fit peanuts in but lathered up with the same engine grease he used minutes of chatting in the study watching out the window and we see the fat squirrel go onto the wire one foot two hands then as he leaves the safety of the branch THUMP he slides off the wire and with no chance of catching the basket flops into the bush with a small crash me and my Dad are in tears and laughing and we have a toast to engine greaseThe height from the bird feeder to the bushes is only  foot or less I am sure he got away ok although we never saw him again until a week later when he had managed to get inside a ball shaped feeder that my Dad had bought later on In that case he put chicken wire all around the ballTLDR Squirrel got into my Dads bird feeders so he got his revenge and put engine grease on the wire connecting it to the branch we saw a squirrel fall off and laughed really hardEDIT EDIT EDITPlease people it was one Grey squirrel that may or may have not been injured in this case I DID see it a week later and it moved perfectly fine If you want to go on about animal cruelty you might want to read up on the Grey squirrel and what their species did to our native Red Squirrels,The evil uses of Engine Grease,116.0,pettyrevenge,new

murrhurr,24.0,54.0,1rbsaq,182.0,Back in  RuneScape was one of the largest freeplay MMOs It also used to be the most popular MMO before WoW hit RS was blocked at school so kids often went to the library to play in their free time I was one of those kids I couldnt really play at home since my parents were afraid the game had a virus LolSo Id see this kid at the library also playing RS He was pretty highleveled at the time ish and had lightblue rune armorthe best in the free game I would choose the computer next to him and logon to my character Id talk to him and he seemed friendly enough He saw I was lower leveled and offered to help me level up As a noob I was level  at the time I gladly took on this offer However as a noob I also was more immune to the more clever scams I would attend the library regularly and after about a week of gaining my trust the guy offered to trim my adamant armor Of course since he was so helpful to me before how could I refuseIn RuneScape like other MMOs players trade items through a specific screen So the trade screen popped up and I offered up my  addy armor which was expensive for a noob like me A friend loaned me some money to buy it which was about  coins or k Even though it cost so much I trusted my new friend enough to just hand my stuff to himWe completed the trade and I asked him how long it would take to trim my armor He said depending on your crafting level it can take a few minutes because you had to trim each part by itself He suddenly had the urge to piss and excused himself for the bathroom I naively believed him and patiently waited for his return Meanwhile his avatar on the screen beside me stood still Then it autologged meaning the game automatically loggedout his account after a period of inactivity Now it had been over  minutes since he left I wondered what took him so long After waiting a bit longer I went to check up on him Checked the male bathrooms on both floors He wasnt there It hit me that he simply left with no intention of returning my shit Well I wasnt going to have that Lucky for me there was a particular computer this kid always used probably because it was closest to a rack of teen magazines or something I hatched a plan You see in a game as popular as RuneScape was there were private servers many of questionable quality These servers hosted ripped code from the actual game client but came with many modifications like X normal XP rate and player commands that in the real game only admins JMods could use One of these shitty private servers was frequently advertised by autotyping bots in the game You could tell it was a scam because many of the accounts advertising it were highlevelmeaning that other curious players checked out the site and got their main accounts hijacked with malware No pro player would actually advertise a private serverthey were already far ahead in the real game I was gonna infect this kid with malwareMy plan was simple I went on the kids computer and created a disposable account on the real RuneScape Then I typed in the URL of the private server website I did as much fishy shit as I couldclicking on flashing advertisements and downloading whatever free Viagra came my way At this point I figured the computer was fucked but functional On the outside everything seemed normal Until it was too late I wanted to test if the computer was infected now I logged onto the disposable account and logged off I figured a hidden keylogger would record the password I hopped back to the uninfected computer and logged onto my main account It was in Varrock a popular trading city for players and spammers Now to play the waiting game I added the disposable account name to my friends list so I could be notified when it logged in Sure enough five minutes later my disposable account logged in and started spamming the server URL Satisfied I logged off and went home When the kid came back the next day I confronted him I asked him why he left without trimming my armor Guy said Oh dude I forgot Im real busy Of course youre not busy youre in middle school Guy was pulling lies from his ass I told him I forgave him and that he could keep my armor actually He didnt seem to care Fair enoughI took my seat beside him and watched him log onto the infected computer Thats all I needed to see I said I had to leave guy still didnt seem to caretoo busy killing other players in the wildernessI wanted to check the progress on my plan away from his sight I went home and disobeyed my parents rules to not play RuneScape To my delight I saw his account at Varrock West Bank spamming the URL My plan was a success The neat thing is that these bots could spam  until they were muted andor bannedthat was a bonus I only needed to ensure he couldnt access his account I returned to the library the next day Guy was furious I pretended to care as he ranted about how he couldnt logon to his accountpassword was changed He didnt have recovery questions so his account was pretty much fucked I dont know what happened after that but I hope his main was banned for botting TLDR I tricked a kid into losing his RuneScape account after he scammed my items No regrets PS To those who wonder if other innocent users got infectedI prepared for this I used a USB stick to load extra malware onto the computer Complained that it ran slowly to library staff Got it replaced like the day after the kid lost his acc ,Petty RuneScape Revenge,236.0,pettyrevenge,new

ksquid,13.0,16.0,1ra14h,136.0,I was just reading a petty revenge story involving the movie theater and thought Id post one of my ownMy boyfriend and I used to live in a college town While there my boyfriend worked at this really shitty theater In reality it was just really old and they were only able to get second run movies As a result there were barely ever many customers On a weeknight the average amount of customers would be around  for two sets of three movies My boyfriend basically ran the place while the owners son Well just call him OS screwed around and did nothing but fuck up anything he touchedAnyway we were watching the end of Movie A which was running a bit late OS allowed people who bought tickets for Movie B it was running after Movie A to come in and get situated so long as they were quiet about it Surprisingly people were usually pretty good about being quiet if they went in That night a small group of older men and women came in talking loudly making a shitload of noise while finding seats and then removing their coats Already sick of them I turned around and said Excuse me were still watching this movie Youre only supposed to come in here if youre going to be quiet They quieted down and I thought that was the end of itI was wrongAny time something funny happened in Movie A a few of them would laugh in a way that was incredibly loud and fake sounding The ridiculous laughing only got more frequent even when what happened on screen was barely worth a chuckle I turned around again and asked if it was really necessary for them to do that and one of them spit back You need to learn to respect your elders Were only laughing at how dumb this movie really is To which I replied It sounds like you need to learn some respect yourselfThe movie was over soon after that so my boyfriend and I went out to the front of the theater OS was going home leaving my boyfriend to start his shift I started plotting my revenge immediately Movie B was more of a serious movie and that only helped my plan along After my boyfriend started up Movie B I went up into the projection booth As luck would have it the group of noisy elders were the only ones in the theater so I didnt have to worry about ruining the show for anyone elseFor those of you unfamiliar with projection booths they tend to have an extra window or two next to the big window through which the projector shows the movies This way the projectionist can get a good view of the screen for focusing and such At the shitty theater the windows were basically plexiglass that you could easily remove I took out one of the pieces and waited Whenever Movie B got to a serious part in the movie Id poke my head through the window and start laughing in a similar loud and fake fashion From up there my laugh pretty much echoed through the theater The lights were off in the booth so these assholes couldnt even see me I saw one get up a couple of times but I remained in the booth faking laughing at least every  minutes or so When the movie was over and they left my boyfriend called me back downstairs when the coast was clear He told me that one of them had come out a couple of times to complain about me hiding in the theater somewhere but boyfriend refused to help them because they couldnt show him exactly where I was He said they didnt seem to recognize him in the light so they didnt even connect him with mePlease be kind to your fellow theater patrons ,Revenge on annoying movie patrons,152.0,pettyrevenge,new

YesYouCannot,204.0,221.0,1r7zub,726.0,So I have an  year old nephew who can be pretty alright sometimes but is normally quite a brat especially when something gets in the way of his gaming addiction If you tell him to get off his PS at am on a school day hell chuck a tantrum and throw his controls across the room and kick everything in his room over Sometimes when you give him helpful advice hed palm it off and act like he knows everything already and what youre telling him is useless or wrong in a very stubborn wayAnyway the other day he was at home on a school day I woke up when his mum he and his mum live in the house with us had already left for work I assumed immediately that he had told his mum he felt sick and wanted to stay home something he does a lot and something she gives in to a lot After having to experience this many times I knew straight away the day would entail him screaming and yelling on Skype with his friends whilst playing his PS I decided that even though I wasnt certain of his excuse for being at home on a school day I figured his recent outbursts against his grandmother my mum and owner of the house entitled him to a bit of karma So I turned off the router He had no internet for the entire day which meant no online gaming with all his friends and no Skyping either It was great The entire day he was at home I heard barely a sound from his room also the justice for his despicable and ungrateful behaviour towards his grandmother made it all the betterLater during the day as I was getting ready to leave the house some  hours after he had been awake I walked past his room and heard him on Skype with his friends It was very civil and didnt involve loud screaming which I think normally only happens when hes gaming with them I was impressed by his good behaviour He approached me after he saw me and asked what was wrong with the internet He said he had been playing offline mode all day and had to Skype with his friends on his iPhone his mum spoils him which I think explains a lot of his abhorrent behaviour I palmed it off and said I didnt know because I didnt want him to know how easy of a solution it was but had the intention to turn the router back on before I left the house I figured that although he had played games all day and probably lied to his mother to stay at home he had been relatively good today compared to other days so I figured Id cut him some slackAs I finally finished getting ready and started going downstairs to turn on the router before I left he approached me asking me again if I knew what was wrong with the internet and if I could please fix it He was very polite at this point so I was quite happy to help him I continued to say I didnt know what was wrong with the internet but Ill check soon and then mentioned that he could actually connect his PS to his mobile for internet He for some reason became very defensive at this and kept telling me You cant do that Ive tried it and it doesnt work I told him yes you can I use my mobile phone to connect to my computer to the internet all the time I told him my friends connect their PSs to their mobiles all the time too a lie but I just wanted him to know that you can do it He started telling me I was wrong and that my friends were probably doing it on the XBOX and that PSs cant do that So I told him that if his PS connects through WiFi then it definitely can connect to a mobile phone to use internet I spent around  minutes calmly trying to explain to him that he can use his mobile phone to tether whilst he kept butting in to rebut everything without even listening to what I was trying to teach him I ended up snapping at him Fine You know what If youre going to have that attitude when I try to help you then Im not going to bother checking on the internet He didnt say anything went into his room and angrily slammed the door I didnt care and just left the house He spent the rest of the day gaming without internet and knowing that was deeply satisfying for me Not only that but I intend on doing this to him every time hes at home from now on I cant wait for his school holidays to start where hell be at home all day without internetAlso I found out later that day that his mum didnt even know he skipped school until she got a call from a teacher Apparently he just decided to take the day off to play games so what little remorse I had for what I did all went down the drainEdit Holy shit woke up to so many comments Will begin replying now Sorry for the delay  scratch that will reply in an hour or two after I do some errands firstEdit Whilst most of my comments show how bad my nephew and my sister his mother can be I do want you to know that this isnt a constant thing They can be very nice and loving and caring people sometimes and I still love them they just drive me insane sometimes haha,Okay you can play in offline mode then,947.0,pettyrevenge,new

wellingtonbear,27.0,52.0,1qzeqs,221.0,I got my petty revenge sorta indirectly during my first job working at OfficemaxI worked the furniture department and on all the desks chairs etc I would print up the little pull tags and place them in holders on each item in the department  There were hundreds of items and thousands of tags since the store didnt want the number of tags to match the actual inventory we could order an item if we were out of stock and most desks were sold in parts so we had multiple sets of tags for one desk   Id print these out daily due to the number of people who are just browsing and take home tags of stuff they were interested in but didnt actually buySo one Saturday afternoon this couple comes in with this little brat that is just running wild all over the store  Yelling screaming picking up and slamming the handsets down on the display phones and fax machines taking merchandise off the rack and throwing it onto the floor etc  Just being a general terror and the parents just completely ignoring herA different customer came in and bought a desk so I went to the back and found the item loaded it on a flat bed cart and wheeled it up to the front desk to carry it out to their car from them   Our entrance was at the very end of the shopping center and customers had to walk PAST the exit door to get to the entrance door  This was very annoying because if the exit doors opened when they walked by it they would walk in through the exit while i was trying to wheel out heavy furniture so whenever I would see this happening i would turn off the sensor on the door so it would not open from the outside and theyd naturally continue to the next doorI saw the father of this nightmare outside talking on the phone and was pacing back and forth and i saw the door open  I instinctively walked over to shut off the outside sensor  As I was walking to where the switch was thats when I saw it the brat was running out to meet her father and was double fisting a giant stack of pull tags she had removed from nearly every single desk in my department  Just as she exited the carpeted area of the furniture dept she threw them up into the air like confettiShe ran right past me and out the door and sat down on the curb next to her dad  I was flabbergasted and fucking pissed that i now had to pick up all that shit sort them out and find the appropriate desks  Since the parents obviously didnt give a shit all I could do was flip the switch turning off the outside sensor so at least she couldnt get back inThen it happened  I walked back to take my place behind the cart with the desk on it and the little girl turned around and spotted her mom at the next register  She stood up and yelled mommy and darted towards the door which had just started to close  With the censor off it was not stopping as she approached  She got there just in time to stick her fat head through the crack of the door as it closed pinning it up against the door jamb  She immediately tried to fall but for a good second and a half the door held her up BY HER HEAD as her body dangled then the door opened because it was obstructed and dropped her right on her faceA coworker who was uncouth to say the least literally pointed and laughed at her and her mom and she scooped up her daughter and make a quick exit probably on their way back to hell,Brat gets her comeuppance,273.0,pettyrevenge,new

ksquid,32.0,116.0,1qytdq,413.0,My first job was in a bowling alleyarcade I originally worked at the prize counter and then switched over to the food court Theyre not the best stories of revenge but they felt pretty good for  year old meThe first tale of revenge comes from a real prick of a coworker During my first week he constantly left me alone behind the counter to go hang out in the food court with some other employees If I had a problem and went to ask him for help he would refuse to move if I didnt have every minute detail leaving me running back and forth between Prick and a now annoyed customer There were many times where he left the counter to go play games on the clock something I had been told was a fireable offense He constantly had a problem with anything I said or did or enjoyed When introducing me to other employees or regulars he would always say Thats ksquid the lesbian because I had a short hair cut He also would refer to me as retard or call anything I liked retardedYou may be wondering whether or not I went to management I did Multiple times I told them exactly what Prick was saying and doing but they either ignored it or laughed and said something like Yep thats Prick for you I tried going to the arcade manager to get different shifts but there were none available I was stuck working with Prick all the timeEventually we all found out that Prick had dropped out of high school In May of his senior year No intention of continuing elsewhere or getting a GED Wat On this particular night some of Pricks friends had come in to say hi and play games and Prick started making fun of everything about me his friends joining in and all of them having a good laugh at my expense Finally Prick says Ksquid youre such a fucking retard Without skipping a beat I replied Yeah I may be a retard but at least I wont have to work here for the rest of my fucking life He stared at me slack jawed while his friends were rolling with laughter He never called me retarded againThe second story of revenge took place after I switched to the food court to get away from Prick and while I was planning on putting in my two weeks notice A friend from school had gotten me an interview at the coffee shop he worked at and it seemed definite that I would be hired I was in the endBeing that the bowling alley was my first job ever I was a total model employee suck up Id be there early every day stay late do whatever the managers asked without complaint or question and took shifts for people whenever they asked After switching to the food court it was also rather common for the food court manager to schedule me from pmm and then come to me at pm the day of to say that she was leaving to see her boyfriend and that I was to stay until close at am I did this without complaint and often without a break even though it was illegal to have someone under  working past midnightI had put in a request off for a particular weekend well in advance I was promised that I would have it off with no issue Lo and behold I get scheduled both Saturday and Sunday I went to the food court manager who told me that she and her boyfriend had decided to go away for the weekend so I would just have to work I went to the GM who told me there was nothing he could do I had to find someone to cover both shifts Of course not a single person was willing to take my shifts Even though Id taken at least  shifts for each of them I went back to the GM who told me Its not my problem I dont careDefeated I went home at the end of my shift and just bawled I was so sick of being treated like complete shit of being talked down to and taken advantage of It was then that I decided my revenge Cue to Saturday afternoon  pm Im sitting comfortably in my PJs at home The bowling alley arcade and food court were likely already swamped with customers and it would only continue to get more and more busy I called the food court and said I wouldnt be coming in Id quit The guy I was supposed to work with immediately got the GM on the line You cant quit now Its the busiest night of the week Male coworker is the only one weve got Food Court Manager is out of town and I know you couldnt find anyone else to work for you What do you expect us to do I took a breath steadied my voice and said Its not my problem I dont care  then hung up,Two stories of Petty Revenge from my first job,529.0,pettyrevenge,new

neenerneenerboo,69.0,498.0,1qw75b,1267.0,Sorry this is long But oh so sweet This guy that went to my high school Jimmy was the absolute worst He was the typical asshole jockeveryone let him get away with shit But I acted cordial around him because we shared mutual friends and classes I would sometimes call him out in a teasing way so he thought we were even friends My main beef with him was the way he treated girls Though Jimmy wasnt very attractive he coasted on popularity and our school was very small with more girls than boys He mostly preyed on underclassmen my first interaction with him was turning him down as a freshman because he seemed creepy but he was a great charmer and manipulator when he wanted to be so I witnessed over and over again as hed suck in one of my friends who would be convinced that hes changed for her and being genuinely nice this time and then turn on the assholery once she was emotionally invested He dated one of my friends Jane who is the sweetest person in the world She was going through some tough times at home with a prolonged family illness and Jimmy just would not give her a break Telling her shes gaining weight flirting with other girls in front of her general toying of her emotions You could tell she was super stressed out and finally she broke up with him Wahoo But it didnt end there We had assigned seats in computer class and I sat between Jimmy and Janes sister Beth who is equally sweet On the other side of Jimmy sat all of his jock friends close to Mr Teachers desk so he could try to keep them in check where they would act obnoxious and talk loud so that the whole room could hear about how awesome they were Right after the breakup Jimmy talked about how hes over it and already has a few public school sluts lined up lols private school lifethis was the equivalent of having a girlfriend you met on vacation so she lives in a different city and other stuff that was really disrespectful to Jane and it seemed very intentionally done in front of Beth who was not a confrontational person I plotted Jimmy was very insecure about his intelligence Since he was put in the spotlight so often it was easy to see that while he could get an A at getting girls to send him nudes he struggled academically So I left lunch early one day to get in the computer room before everyone else I hooked up an extra mouse and keyboard into his computer pulling the cords behind and underneath the desk so that the mouse and board could rest hidden under my pullout keyboard there was a lot of hidden room they sat just out of view above my own keyboard Jimmy made a loud and unnecessary entrance as usual but when he tried to log in to his computer to start the assignment he just could not get it right This is because I would sneakily tap a key as he would type in his student password He tries a few more times before yelping for help from Mr Teacher who looks annoyed after typing in Jimmys information just fine Maybe you had your password wrong he says but Jimmy is insistent that he isnt that stupid and something is wrong with the computer I tormented Jimmy for weeks pushing the extra keyboard and mouse as far up as I could to hide it in between classes He would put his mouse icon over a button and then Id slightly wiggle my extra mouse before he clicked on it infuriating Jimmy that he could not select something Inputting passwords and other information was often impossible His documents were full of typos He would type a word and I would just press one letter to throw him off and then hed try again only for the same thing to happen Pretty soon he just used spellcheck instead but rightclicking that function was difficult for him when I was paying attention Open the task manager while hes in a program Hed look away and Id close a window or document or just press backspace until he turned around I was careful to be pretty inconsistentwhen other people were looking Id back off to make him look crazy Whatever hed been trying to do would always work when Jimmy called the teacher over My movements were minute and mixed in seamlessly as I typed on my real keyboard I started to punish him this way Wandering eye Wandering mouse while hes trying to play a game Distracted as he bragged to his friend about texting with that naïve freshman Oh look his PowerPoint text boxes somehow all got rearranged Ignore new girlfriend because its funny Unexpected shutdown because losing unsaved work is funnier One time he tried to reset a password where the characters are replaced with dots for privacy and I put a number at the end of his new password and the same thing when he confirmed the password This new password then didnt work and he couldnt reset it again without knowing the current password Jimmy was going nuts but it was all so subtle that his complaints made him look like a crazy person who didnt know how to use a computer He insisted over and over again that something was wrong with the computer His assignments took longer so he had less time to horse around with his friends People started to talk about how irritable and unpleasant he was during computer class and people would even tease him about not being able to use technology if he had any problems with his iPhone or anything One time when I was sure that no one else was looking and Jimmy didnt even have his hands on anything I wiggled the mouse slightly back and forth as he stared at the screen His eyes widen and he shouts Look interrupting Mr Teachers lecture I stop It was doing it My mouse was moving and I wasnt even doing anything We all look at each other in disbelief over Jimmys delusions as he keeps yelling myself and Beth included although we were laughing on the inside giddy at the thought of telling Jane later about Jimmys meltdown Thats it Mr Teacher said worn thin over Jimmys incompetence No one else is having problems with that computer Youre just not compatible I guess Move to that one He points to a computer far away from his buddies and any other students which is usually used by people giving presentations or student teachers Jimmy protests suggesting Mr Teacher just fix it but at this point Jimmy is pretty done with that computer too We werent bothered by Jimmy too much the rest of the year in that class But to my surprise Jimmy still had problems Almost all the stuff I was doing He stopped complaining since it made him look like he was just hopeless with simple tasks but he would still ask me questions about what it could be after class since he thought I was relatively good with computers One day alone in the computer room I was inspecting the computer that Jimmy used when Mr Teacher comes in He sat down at his desk and got a sly look on his face as he messed with a cordless mouse which wiggled around on Jimmys screen Wifi he explained Turned out Mr Teacher knew what I was doing all along He hated dealing with Jimmy too and distracting him meant less class disruption But after his meltdown Jimmy just raged quietly in his corner as he failed to engage his faraway friends Tldr Guy is a douche to my friend plug a secret mouse and keyboard into his computer and mess with him He goes crazy and everyone talks about it Edit for more info We had a pretty relaxed atmosphere our teacher was a young lad who just taught an easy class in order to be a coach and he was Jimmys track coach so even though Jimmy annoyed the shit out of him during class they joked around a lot At our school the real authority was with the coaches so a prank like this between them would have been a big deal He was the kind of teacher that let us spend a lot of time playing games and helped us with senior pranks as long as they were tame enough He was just a few years out of college and only really messed with jimmy when he was a disruptionJimmy really actually was bad with computers At one point he thought his MacBook was totally broken because he accidentally leaned on the dim screen button so his screen was black He would never notice anything unusual plugged into his computer I know that using Bluetooth doesnt always require a USB and it has been many years since I was in high school so perhaps thats what the teacher meantI am really not that great with that stuff myself Jimmy only thought I was good with computers because he was amazed by things like keyboard shortcuts ,The time I played with a high school player,1765.0,pettyrevenge,new

fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax at midnight on the th of July and New Years EveFREE STUFF  Im convinced that reddit is the best community on the net and Im trying to kick start Christmas by giving away free TShirts from my company When youre done with this story please read this posthttpredditqnfi to find out how you can help out a child for Christmas and get a free shirtSTORY  In Florida we get our fair share of rain especially in the summer During light showers its business as usual but when the wind and the rain really pick up we batten down the hatches We lower the sides of the tent and use plastic to cover any shelving or product that may be getting dripped onOne afternoon we got the typical fast moving heavy thunderstorm with wind rain and lightning It really came up on us fast and we had a load of people in the tent shopping at the time I grabbed all of my help and we went crazy trying to get all of the sides down and boxes off of the floor before stuff was ruinedWe managed to get everything down and covered before we had gotten much damage We did however get totally soaked while all of this was going on my cashier was still ringing out customers and new customers were running through the rain and lightning to get INTO the tent No offense but in a lighting storm I dont even want to be in a tent in a parking lotOf course thats about the time we lost power It was early afternoon so we didnt really need lights inside of the tent and I actually have my registers on small uninterruptible power supplies UPS so they dont cut out every time the power fails My cashier is still churning and burning trying to get people out of the door About  minutes later the power still hasnt come back on its still pouring outside and the UPSs give up the ghost and run out of juiceNot a problem I was a boy scout and I have a backup plan for my backup plan My parents RV has a generator so I can switch over my critical power to that if I need to It does require us to reroute some power cords and stuff like that so I cant just flip a switch and make it happen but its doableMy dad and I brave the rain and wind to start getting stuff ready for the switch While Im out in the storm one of my employees comes out to tell me that they need me in the tentAt my counter screaming at my cashier is uber bitch UB Shes pissed off that my cashier has refused to ring up her purchase just because the registers are dead My cashier was nicely trying to explain to her that the power should be on shortly and they would ring her up as soon as possible but UB didnt want to hear about itThis particular cashier had worked for me for five years or so at this point and her father is one of my best friends Shed actually graduated high school and was home from college on summer break working for me I always joke with her that shes the boss and Im just there to do her biddingMy cashier is keeping her cool but I felt bad for her so I stepped in to try and defuse the situation UB demands to check out NOW because she has somewhere that she needs to be and I need to take care of itIm soaked to the bone and I just want to get this bitch out of my tent so I pull out my phone and ring up her purchase on that She actually had a pretty big purchase and when I told her the total she didnt believe it She wanted to see my phone to verify She then went down the list of stuff at least  items and questioned each price When she was doing this she actually found a mistake I had made I had entered in an item as  when it should have been  The only reason I knew this is that she was making me verify the price item by item as she called them out from my phoneYou should have seen the look on her face when it dawned on her that the only mistake she found was where I had UNDERCHARGED her I grabbed my phone back and happily told her I would fix the price for her and then gave her the new HIGHER total I should mention that the entire time theres a crowd of people around watching the scene and a couple of them started to openly laugh when this happenedWhen I told her the new total she lost her GD mind She started screaming at me that it was my fault and that she shouldnt have to pay for my mistake In fact she should get a discount for having to wait so long I let her yell for a good two or three minutes just standing there expressionlessIm tired Im soaked to the bone and my dad is outside in the rain trying to get the power switched over by himself because of this bitch I called to one of my employees and told him to put her stuff back on the shelf then I turned to uber bitch and told her Youre going to need to go somewhere else because youre not allowed to shop here anymoreI turned to my cashier in front of the customer and told her Dont sell that bitch anythingShe left screaming obscenities and threats the entire way out and into the rainONE YEAR LATERThe same cashier grabs me from the floor and points out a customer shopping in the tent Its the same uber Bitch lady that I had thrown out the year before and shes shopping with three or four other people To be honest even after seeing the lady I didnt place her face If my cashier wouldnt have recognized her Id have never noticed she was thereCASHIER What would you like me to doME Its up to you Youre the bossThe lady and her party finished shopping and got in line at the counter to checkout When UB got to the register my petite  year old female cashier stood her gound looked her dead in the eye and told her Im sorry you may have forgotten but youre not allowed to shop hereStone Cold BabyThe lady actually walked out of the tent without saying a word I think she was embarrassed because she was with a group In the end one of the people in the group paid for the stuff

ksquid,53.0,62.0,1qon92,325.0,During the th grade I met a boy the same age but from another school We became fast friends and started hanging out all the time I even developed a bit of a crush on him though nothing ever came of itWhen we got to high school he started pulling away and hanging out with people who actively bullied me He eventually began to slowly bully me as well We had both been relatively disliked during previous school years and this was not something I was unaccustomed too However I was finally coming out of my shell and decided to get some revenge It was one thing to have classmates bully me simply because they didnt like me but Id had enough of people being my friend or pretending to be my friend and then turning on meI started small Id show up to his parents house bringing CDs or movies that hed asked me to hold onto for him because he knew they wouldnt approve or tell them that I was worried that he may be falling into a bad crowd because Id overheard some of his new friends talk about the pot That seemed to settle things for much of the school year We just stopped talking or acknowledging each other in the hallsTowards the end of our freshman year he came up to me in the hallways and apologized for acting the way he had and said he hoped we could start over as friends over the summer I didnt believe a word of it but decided to play along He said he and some friends were going to see a movie and asked if I wanted to come I agreed and he told me to meet them up at the front doors after I got my stuff I didnt trust them so I snuck out a back door and slowly made my way around the building in order to sneak a peek before making my approach Sure enough I saw them standing at the front door all with an armload of water balloons and laughing about how they were going to get that bitch I wasnt even that close they just really were that loud and obnoxious I was pretty pissed though and immediately stormed back the way I had come my plan for revenge already forming At the beginning of the year he had told me the combination to his locker Hoping he wouldnt remember I took the stairs two at a time up to the third floor Luckily everyone had gone already leaving only me and my revenge I opened his locker to find  of his textbooks inside Being that it was the end of the year there wasnt a lot of homework assigned Before anyone could show up I grabbed all  books and shoved them into my backpack before rushing down the stairs and out of the building I always passed this small strip mall on my way home from school so I made a detour to the back and tossed the textbooks into a dumpsterHis total end of the year fines  Summer spent grounded and working to pay his parents back,It costs to be a douche,387.0,pettyrevenge,new

djchair,2.0,16.0,1qn392,61.0,Been lurking on this subreddit for a while now and figured Id share a story with yall  Sorry the sheer size of this I hadnt expected this initially  EnjoyBackground My first job was a nonprofit retirement home we didnt offer assisted living or other end of life services  For the most part the residents were all in good health and lived active lives  I worked in the food service area starting as a busboy and progressing to waiter head waiter and then opting to move into the prep area as a dishwasher and finally assistant line cookThis is a story of my revenge on a coworker who refused to follow basic etiquette when I was a dishwasherThe Layout Coming from the dining room the dishwasher bay was immediately the the right of the doubledoors  For those who arent too familiar with a dishroom its pretty straightforward  Waiters and busboys can empty trays of dirty plates dishes etc onto a flat metal shelf about three feet deep and five feet wide  The shelf then bends away from the open bay and follows the inside wallhttpiebayimgcomtHobartCommercialDishWasherSyswSinkFeedDraintableRtoLRemovedsMTIwMFgxNjAwKGrHqJlQEEBRgGBPwkVlyQJPG where the dishwasher would store a bin for dirty utensils this is important for later as well as the huge doublesinks and finally the actual dishwasherhttpcommonswikimediaorgwikiFileHOBARTDISHWASHERJPG where everything goes for a superhot bath for about three to five minutes before exiting the machine and cooling offWe had tried a number of different techniques to move the dishes through the system as quickly as we could to prevent running out of plates or glasses  One of the rules that had stood the test of time was to have the busboys or servers take the food and scrap it into a huge bin before putting all the dirty stuff onto the shelf and then to put the utensils into the bin to soakThe Setup One of the waiters was often in a rush cant blame him Id been there before and understood that sometimes rushes happen  He would frequently scrape and then as he pushed the dirty plates onto the shelf he would toss the spoons knives and forks into the bin of cleaning solution and water  The resulting splash would then hit the dishwasher as he or she bent over the sinks and scrubbed the muck off the plates prior to putting them into the dish washing machineI had warned him a couple of times that it was disgusting and that he needed to watch his splashback  I presume he didnt think much of it and probably presumed that I was all talkThe Revenge As luck would have it this guy lets call him Jake and I ended up working the same night shift  Just as the first wave of diners had finished Jake comes rushing in with a tray full of plates  He quickly dispatches with the food and paper waste before shoving the entire tray onto the shelf towards me making a terrible crashing noise and knocking over glasses and whatnot that I had set aside to put into the machineI gave him a warning but not ten minutes later he came in again with a ton of dirty dishes and chucked a hand full of utensils into the bin splashing me with luke warm dirty cleaning solution and food bits  I grab the power hosehttpcrystalrayneauthorfileswordpresscomjpg and with a quick jerk shot him square in the chest with about  ounces of water  Soaking him through his apron dress shirt and undershirt in a second  He was shocked and with a smile I went back to work cleaning  He couldnt find a cleandry apron anywhere and ended up working the remaining three hours with a soaked shirt clinging to his chest before having to step out into a brisk New England January night to get homeTLDR Splash me with dirty soapy sink water  Work the rest of the night in a soaked shirt and walk home in freezing cold New England January weatherEdit Added images to better explain what Im talking about,Fail to follow the rules enjoy the rest of your shift soaking wet,77.0,pettyrevenge,new

scordatura,11.0,24.0,1qezdt,42.0,I had the misfortune of going to this high school that was brand new  My grade  class was the first  Because this was a brandnew school the principal decided that this was his chance to really make his mark  To mold an entire school in his image which he proceeded to do with tons of goddamn stupid pointless rules  I only stayed at this fucking school for two years before I couldnt take it any more but during those two years I took revenge on a regular basis  I will share my tales with this subreddit if theres interest  Tale  was posted earlier  Heres tale A few months into grade  I was already pretty pissed off  The school uniform  The religious shit it was a Catholic high school  I think the thing that was bothering me the most at that time was the big fat zero I got on my Thomas More was no saint and deserved to be executed essay  Zero  Seriously  More was a judge and sentenced heretics to death  They were subsequently burned alive  So when the king chopped off his fucking head for treason well done I wrote  But the teacher didnt share my view and when I complained about the mark the principal got really annoyed because More was this catholic hero and saint etc etc and gave me detention  So now I was really pissedSchool was boring as hell anyways and I learned lots more on my own just screwing around with stuff and reading  Sometimes I learned stuff that really helped in the mischief department  For example one afternoon I was at home fiddling around with electrical shit in the garage  I took an old broken kettle and cut off the electrical cord  I stripped the wires plugged the cord in and stuck the live wires into a jar of water  The rather violent electrolysis was really neat to watch  That is until the wires crossed with dramatic results  A big spark and a blown fuse  Shit  Ran out to the hardware store bought a fuse and replaced it before mom and dad would find outThe blown fuse thing was really neat I wondered what possibilities this would have for school   I took the kettle cord and cut down the wires so they were much shorter  Just a few inches  I intertwined the wires and carefully covered them up with lots of electrical tape    Voila  An instant fuse blower  I knew what to do nextThe next morning at school I get there a little early as usual Time to try my fuse blower  I find an empty classroom  Plug in the fuse blower  Boom  Lights out in that class  I walk down a hallway  No one looking Plug in my fuse blower  Boom  No lights in the hall  I did it in a few other places and felt like I had this mighty superpower  It was great  The only problem was that this didnt really cause too much trouble   Classes continued teachers taught and before the end of first period the lights were all back on  So from a mischiefrevenge standpoint not a lot was accomplishedThe weekend came and I considered whether there was some way I could increase my fuse blowing mayhem  Another trip to the store a trip to the dump to do some garbage picking needed some old appliances that I could cut the cords off of and I was ready  By the end of Saturday I had ten electrical cords to make ten fuse blowers  That was good  But even better was I had appliance timers for each one of them  I knew about these timers already I had one in my room that clicked on the coffee pot each morning so that I had my own coffee ready for me when I woke up  And I thought Hey if I put these timers on these fuse blowers then I can plug it in walk away and be nowhere near the thing when it goes off  In fact I can set up tons of them all over the placeAnd so thats what I did  I waited of course until there was one of those goddamn boring as hell useless assembly things that included a fucking mass in the gym  I hated church and disliked having to go to mass in my school  So that morning I set these things up in various places in an around the gym and set the timers to go off just when I figured the priest would be droning on with the religious stuff  It was beautiful  Priest is blabbing away when suddenly some lights go off and theres a bad smell Id put some match heads inside the fuse blowers before sealing them up  They evacuate the fucking school  Fire department called  These firefighters go in  Awesome  But it got even better because of course those diligent fire fighters quickly honed in on the problem  They found the fucking fuse blowers  I wish I could have seen the principals reaction when he got the news  I loved the fact that he  knew that there was a student who a really really really pissed off and b didnt give a shit and c would do whatever the fuck he wanted with impunityThere was this announcement the next day about how what happened the day before wasnt funny no not at all and there could have been a fire and whoever did this was in real trouble and they knew who it was anyway so if he would turn himself in now they might give him a break blah blah blah  I retired the fuse blower thing after that but had lots of fun with other stuff   ,My petty revenge tales part ,66.0,pettyrevenge,new

CGecko,28.0,50.0,1pycav,259.0,Hey guys I just discovered this sub and Im having a blast reading all of your stories so I thought Id contribute one of my own Now as a preface it does involve frightening a child so Ill leave it up to you guys as to whether or not it was justified Its also a bit of a long read so I apologize for thatBackground InfoI worked at a summer camp for kids aged  starting when I was a sophomore in high school The season lasted for eight weeks and during that time a kid could stay anywhere from one to four weeks at a time It was an awesome job and I had a great time and met a lot of awesome people its also where I met the girl Im now engaged to but there were a few parts of the job that were bothersome The primary issue was that dealing with viciously awful campers was something of an uphill battle as the higherups of the camp could rarely help you The head counselor or director would usually have a chat with the camper but then send them right back to you to be more of a terror The owner told us we were never allowed to call the kids parents to pick them up unless there was a medical emergency or they endangered a camper or staff member So basically some kids got a relatively free pass to be little monsters for up to a month at a time as there was nothing we could really do The other important things to know are that the campers slept in the same cabins as the staff members usually  campers and  staff and that I was legendary across camp for my bedtime stories I have a million of them and they come in three primary types humorous stories to make kids laugh boring historical stories to make them fall asleep quickly and ghost stories to give them a good fright My policy is that I never tell ghost stories to any campers younger than  and only if the cabin agrees they all want to hear it However during my second summer at camp there was a camper who temporarily changed that policyThe NightmareThis kid was around  years old and Im going to call him Tyler Tyler was staying for a oneweek session which meant that we was dropped off Sunday afternoon and would be picked up on Friday afternoon On most weekends the camp is closed and staff get the day off but this week was coming off a stayover weekend so most of us were already exhausted As the new kids for the week arrive most of us are keeping the kids from the weekend entertained while the others including me are awaiting the fresh campers for the coming week to check in Tyler was checked in accompanied by his mom and older brother and brought his things down to my cabin to get settled After making typical counselor small talk with his mom I made my way over to his bunk to introduce myself Our first interaction went something like thisMe Hey man My names CGecko whats yoursTyler Bite meHe then spit at me and ran out of the cabin I stood there kind of stunned and my cocounselor ran after him His mom apologized profusely and I let it slide because I figured he was nervous about being away from home first time camper you see Big mistake Side note Bite me turned into his catchphrase I later learned that he learned it from his older brother who I also had as a camper and was also a pain though not as severeThe rest of the day is uneventful we introduce ourselves to the new campers play a few standard gettoknoweachother games and have a good time Im starting to think more and more that Tylers behavior was the result of nerves Until we get to the campfireEach week at camp begins with a campfire The kids gather around and watch as the staff amuse them by leading songs and performing skits We do the same ones every week and it can get a little stale but my fellow staff were awesome so it was still a fun time However controlling the kids especially younger ones can be tough Some might fidget a bit ask to go to the bathroom seemingly dozens of times or try to wander away from the campfire but thats typical kid behavior and were used to it Tyler took things to another level He complained loudly that every skit or song was boring and no amount of coaxing would convince him to stop When he wasnt doing that he asked me to go to the bathroom a little less than a quarter mile walk back up the hill to camp no fewer than nine times I dont care how little you are you dont need to use the bathroom nine times in  minutes Finally the last straw came when Tyler picked up a decentsized stick and threw it directly into the fire causing a huge shower of sparks Throwing anything at or into the fire is the number one nono of campfire and we tell the kids that at the beginning of the event Plus he could have easily hurt one of the staff with the stick or the sparks At this point I received the covert headnod from the director which means bring that little toilet squirt to my office nowI met up with the director in the head office with Tyler The director explained carefully that what he did was dangerous and that the owner of the camp was going to come talk with us It was getting late now and I asked the director if I should return to my cabin and the other campers he said no So I stayed in the office for over an hour while Tyler poked and prodded me Every time I looked over to ask him to stop he just turned and gave me the biggest shiteating grin youve ever seen The owner finally arrived she is a piece of work but thats another story and basically told us that since it was only the first day they didnt want to send Tyler home because it was obviously just firstday jitters and he was acting out No shit he was acting out But it was obvious that they didnt want to send him home because they would have to refund his moms money I escorted Tyler back to the cabin now furious Not only was he being a little shit but he had also made me miss the last part of campfire and putting the kids to bed Bedtime on the first day is a crucial time and I always make sure to visit each child and talk about their day Now I wouldnt get to do that or tell a good story Not only that but after I put the little booger to bed he kept me up until midnight asking for multiple cups of water The next day i was in a bad mood but still put on my best happy face to start leading activities being a camp counselor you learn to deal with being tired as a way of life Each day the children go to five activity periods of their choosing with lunch in between Each staff member teaches four onehour activity blocks and gets  hour off My activities that week were clay sculpting archery canoeing and improv games I was excited because improv and archery are my favorite activities But lo and behold who is in both of those blocks Fucking Tyler Over the next three days he continuously caused disruptions in both classes and his other three activities from what I heard He whined constantly when he was told it was another campers turn to lead improv games constantly stepped over others lines and made rude and terrible jokes which ruined the scene On Tuesday he picked on a girl so relentlessly that she cried During archery he often pretended he didnt hear my instructions and fired his arrows off turn when kids are that young we have to tell them exactly when to let the arrow go Theres no way I can prove it but Im also sure he fired at least three arrows into the woods on purpose Over the course of the week I took him to the directors office three more times for unruly behavior during an activity or meal period All three times the director gave him a stern talking to which of course did nothing I could have done that I was getting more and more frustrated as Tyler was ruining an otherwise awesome week as the other eleven campers in my cabin were all model kids who were fun to teach Finally I snapped when Tyler actually endangered another kids life at the archery range As I said we have to give kids instructions on when to do everything which includes retrieving arrows Obviously firing at the target while a kid is down range retrieving arrows is very dangerous and completely illegal So naturally on Wednesday of that week while Im telling the kids to go down range and retrieve arrows Tyler fires a fucking arrow down range I immediately lose it Tyler is not the best shot and he could have easily injured the kid at the target next to him I snatch the bow away and tell him to wait in the shack the small storage shedoffice next to the range and to not move He fucking smiles at me as he heads over there I am absolutely furious so I leave the other campers with my coinstructor and take a deep breath and drink of water before entering the shack Im not even calling the director Im calling the owner and getting this fucker thrown out  I call the owners direct line and after talking for ten minutes she tells me to bring Tyler to the office She then tells me that because of the nature of the incident they are going to take away Tylers snack for the rest of the week When I remind her that he could have killed a kid she tells me that she wants to not pursue it because its my word against his and that the other kids parents could sue As she talks I am continuously trying not to smack her I think she could see my face getting red because she tells me to bring Tyler back to the cabin and to take the rest of the hour off At this point I am fuming During my hour off I vent to my cocounselor and nearly start crying After Ive calmed down I go to dinner and tell myself that I did everything I could do As soon as I sit down though Tyler sits at my table I ignore him but he tells me that he had an awesome time at archery earlier and cant wait to do it again Now its onThe RevengeAt this point I start thinking of anything I can do to make this kid feel some consequences for his actions I can bring him to the director until my shoes wear out but he doesnt care So I need to do something more subtle After thinking about it I realize that the perfect weapon in my little revenge act will be my ghost storiesNow as I mentioned before I never tell ghost stories to kids younger than  because they get scared really easily Older kids love my stories because they feel a little creeped out but overall enjoy the story and just go to bed after With little kids it can be a disaster If they dont stay up all night freaked out then they become catatonic at breakfast the next day and act really jumpy Thats why I never tell scary stories to small children except when they deserve it ie Tyler So over the next few days I start doing a little research I want to find out what Tyler is scared of and get into his head It has to be perfect something that will scare the absolute shit out of Tyler but not mess up my other kids who as mentioned are model campers So after observing him the rest of the day and the next day I think I might have something During my hour off I know that Tyler has an activity in the artsandcrafts building So I take my hour off making friendship bracelets with some other kids near the building which if youve never received a friendship bracelet from a kid is just about the most adorable activity ever Plus Im earning some bonus points with my director for using my hour off to watch kids so its a winwin So Im keeping one eye on my group of kids and one eye on Tyler at the craft table The pivotal moment happens twenty minutes into the period Tyler freaks the fuck out when a spider crawls across his paper He screams like a baby and yells at the counselor in charge to kill it for him The counselor flicks the spider off onto the ground and Tyler is wary of that spot for the rest of the period So bingo hes afraid of spidersI knew that night would be my last chance as Tyler would be leaving the next afternoon So I spend the rest of the day crafting an absolutely beautiful scary story about a giant spider catching a kid in his web During dinner I half paid attention to kids and half thought of the details for the story Id tell that night It was not my best counseling but the payoff made it worth it in the end Finally that night I asked the cabin if theyd like to hear a spooky story Everyone said yes enthusiastically especially Tyler So I let him have it telling a ridiculous twenty minute story about a child who looked suspiciously like Tyler getting caught in the web of a giant spider I embellished the shit out of this story making creepy spider noises and using my best overlydramatic voice The best part is that every other camper thought it was hysterical while Tyler looked like he was going to shit his Pampers My cocounselor who figured out exactly what I was doing was roaring with laughter the entire time That night Tyler stayed up for a long time He continuously asked my cocounselor to come over and talk to him I waited eagerly each time for him to return to the counselor room to tell me what he was saying He told me that Tyler asked him multiple times if The Giant Spider of Redacted County was actually real We stifled laughter and eventually everyone drifted off to sleep peacefullyThe next day was moveout day and Tyler was absolutely miserable He didnt say anything at breakfast or lunch which is always pizza on moveout day I asked him what was wrong and he kept telling me nothing Ironically this was the day he was bestbehaved out of the whole week Finally his mom and dad arrived to pick him up along with his brother Everyone on staff was looking forward to this and I saw more than a few other counselors watching the action from the porches of their cabins Tylers mom comes up to the porch says hi and we exchange pleasantries Tyler comes out of the cabin with his stuff and his dad asks how his week at camp was Tyler immediately starts crying hysterically His mom hugs him cooing softly and telling him its ok he can come back next year Tyler doesnt say anything just keeps crying After ten minutes or so of this his dad gets fed up apologizes to me and grabs Tylers shit He then tells him theyre going to the car I watch and wave politely as they leave and cant help but put on a giant shiteating grin as Tyler looks back at the cabin The best part for me though was something I actually heard from another staff member apparently when Tyler was being dragged to the car crying his dad told him he would never come to camp again if he kept acting up like he was I dont know how much justice it served but I certainly felt vindicated Tyler never did come back to camp although his brother did and I would happily trade Tyler for his brother any day Sometimes when his brother came to camp later I would see Tyler and he would always look away from me immediately His parents were great though No idea how such hellspawn come from nice parentsTLDR Kid nearly gets away with everything

AdriaticWhaler,10.0,17.0,1prah8,63.0,Ive been in this apartment for two and a half years now and I have the most interesting neighbors next door As far as I could see through their door their apartment is clean and tidy but they use our really small hallway as their storage for excess furniture and trash that is to be thrown out My landlord told me they were like this all the time I dont know how it goes in other countries but in mine its ok to put your trash on the hallway for say a night and then throw it in the container But these people wereoverdoing it at the leastOn the right side of their door is some old raggedy cupboard and on the left two or three boxes with tiles and similar stuff stacked on one another which I never fail to bash with a traveling bag in silent protest when Im going to and returning from a trip And although its only a family of three they use probably the biggest trash bags they can find So  if there is only three of them and one of them being an obnoxious child they need days to fill that mansized bag which means the trash is already rotting inside Add to the equation that were on the top floor and you get a nice full bouquet of rot and mold every summerThe thing that did it was when they bought a new washing machine and although they had two workers to bring it up the stairs we dont have an elevator and install it they asked the workers to put the old one at the bottom of the stairs instead of letting them takebuy the old one for spare parts recyclables etc That washing machine ended down there for more than two months so now I had to dodge their furniture enjoy the smell of decay if their trash was out and then almost squeeze past the washing machine in between the floors I used a subtle tactic of annoying them with opening the door on the machine every time I had to pass it by but to no avail They were closing it for some time then let it stay open Last week they changed their double bed mattress and put the old one on the stairs and leaned it on the wall Thankfully it was there only for a few daysSo last weekend I head out with my friend to do grocery shopping for the next month As Im a powerlifter and he is training to become one too a lot of food has been bought and brought to my apartment including  kg   pounds of meat When I finished trimming the fat and intestines off the meat that left me with about  kg   pounds of it I put that in the trash bag and put the bag in the hallway It was Saturday night and I intended to throw it out in the morningHowever when I got out the next morning I felt pungent stench of meat fat and intestines that had started to rot With a grin from ear to ear I came back inside and closed the door Tightly As most people do my neighbors do a lot of cooking on the Sundays and since they dont have any opposing windows they have to open the door to vent it By the lunch time the stench was unbearable So now they had to choose between having the apartment full of moisture and cooking odors turning their AC on in the end of October or nourish themselves with the stench of hells asshole on the day when whole family is finally togetherI left it there almost till midnight Even the next morning it could be smelled faintly Although I dont think they will learn anything from it I was delighted all day while thinking about the gas chamber I created both outside and inside their apartment since they couldnt properly air the apartment and all that on Sunday when they rest and enjoy together and usually annoy me with psychedelic rock music and Nazgûl shrieks of their playful read retarded sonTLDR scumbag neighbors use the hallway as an extended part of their apartment often reserved for trash I respond in the same manner but with WMD counterpartAlso English is my second language so I apologize for potential errors,Fighting fire with fire,80.0,pettyrevenge,new

ashlya,34.0,100.0,1pookd,471.0,So yesterday was Halloween There was a party and as a result I felt like crap this morning I still have to work though with it being Friday Anyway while on the train this morning I saw a woman get up and move to an empty seat across from her I took the opportunity to take the empty seat since anyone who had taken the morning train at rush hour knows they are hard to get I noticed the woman who moved glaring at the guy on my left but he wasnt a bum nor did he smell so I ignored it    Then I found out why she was glaring at him He was pretending to be asleep and proceeded to maneuver his arm so his elbow was jabbing into my side under my arm His legs were also spread apart constantly pushing against mine The jist was he was trying to get as much space to himself as possible by forcing the people sitting next to him to move due to the discomfort    You know what I was really tired and felt shitty I was not going to move out of the seat because of some jerk Two can play this game Slowly my arm began to move back until I was pushing his arm against the seat Every jerk of the train resulted in my arm moving back even more I also pushed my leg against his creating more space for myself Mind you I didnt have it affect the person sitting to my right The guy realized what I was doing and began trying to push back but I was a fucking wall He couldnt move me unless he wanted to make it really obvious And guess what  I was taking the train to the last stop    He finally gave in and moved his arm but then proceeded to put his hand on his thigh with his pinky touching mine Another attempt to make me uncomfortable and move I still wasnt going to give in and move So when he got to his stop after he tried to push me one last time while getting up I stuck out my foot and made him stumble on his way out The glare he gave me pure gold,Morning Rush Hour Train Pettiness,571.0,pettyrevenge,new

MoonshineBaby,285.0,791.0,1pnwh6,1928.0,I was at my parents house last night when my mom answered a call on their landline I perked up when I heard her say with a worried look on her face my computers infected I knew immediately this was a scam call so I told her Id handle it and took the phone It was a guy from India in a call center saying he was with Microsoft and I needed to follow his stepbystep instructions to clean up all the viruses on our pc ie give him remote control steal whatever info they can get install malware turn it into a zombie or whatever else they do with this scam Now I hate scammers with a passion but Im especially pissed off because my mom is getting up there in age and isnt as sharp as she used to be and wouldve fallen for this had I not been there In fact she did fall for this exact same scam about a year ago I had to wipe the computer and told her very plainly that no one will ever ever call from Microsoft or for any other internet related issue Unfortunately her memory isnt so hot these days   In a very thick Indian accent this guy tells me how bad the computer is with all its viruses and infections Oh no Really I have viruses How do I fix it I say He assures me hell walk me through the clean up process and I express my relief and gratitude Sweet  I dont have shit to do at the momentOk sir I need you to hold down the Windows key and the R key at the same time Ok I did that Now what do you see My computer is off now Sir no why is your computer off You should see a menu Please power the computer back on I actually had turned it off so I would be able to blare the Windows logon sound to make it convincing Now this is like an  PC my mom has so the start up time is NOT exactly fast So after a good while I tell him Im back up and ready Ok sir Now look at the keyboard and find the WINDOWS KEY and the R KEY Please hold these down at the same time Now please tell me sir what do you seeHmm My computer turned off again I held down the main Windows button and the R key just like you told me and it turned off again Im sorry I just dont know what Im doing wrong Hes getting a little frustrated now But the beauty is Im thinking this guy probably has to call hundreds of people before hes got a sucker on the line as willing and eager as I am to remedy this particular computer problem So I do this cycle a full four times each time giving him more little hints that I think the Windows Key is actually the power button By the fourth time I thought for sure he would get it because I was calling it something like the main Windows power button on my Dell but sadly he never did figure it out He gives up on that and moves on to try something elseOk sir forget that we will try something else He goes on to explain that were going to do a bootup sequence where I have to press the F key while the computer is booting back up Obviously this could not have worked out better The chance to continually miss hitting the F key in time has me absolutely giddy inside I assure him Im ready to hit the key and restart the machine I let it fully boot up and blare the Windows login sound again and say OK Its back on and Im hitting the key now He sighs with more frustration You have to do it WHILE THE COMPUTER IS STARTING BACK UP he explains So I apologize again and feign frustration myself while holding back my unfettered delight The next round he is more careful to make sure Im hitting the key during the bootup sequence So Im punching away on the space bar key as loud as I can during the bootup and after a couple minutes or so here comes that beautiful Windows start up sound again and he lets out an even louder more frustrated sighSIR Did you hit the F key Well Ive gone this far I think to myself I may as well lay on another level of frustration by insulting his English Yes I was hitting the S and H keys the whole time I dont know what went wrong Yep that did it No no no the F key The F   key Sir look at your keyboard Do you see the F key OHOhthe F key I say Yes I see Ill try again We sit there waiting a few more minutes I repeat the whole process this time after the startup sound I tell him I hit the F and  keys but again nothing happened Holy Shit Hes fuming at this point but trying as hard as he can to hold it back Right then I heard my mom call that dinner was ready Normally I would have blown off dinner for something this much fun but wed grilled out these beautiful ribeyes and I wasnt about to let mine get cold I tell him Im really sorry I have to go to dinner now and I will have to fix it later And with that after this  minute phone call I just hang up I sit at the table admiring this beautifully marbled steak and tell my folks it was all a scam and I was just wasting his time The phone rings My mom jumps up and says I got it In the sweetest voice my mom said Im really sorry but we are having family dinner at the moment and I have a rule that everyone has to sit down together and after a moment listening to his reply she hangs up and sits back down Whatd he say I ask Mom replies He said Fuck your family dinner,Try to scam my mom and I will ruin your day,2719.0,pettyrevenge,new

frothyplease,18.0,52.0,1petwc,301.0,For those who dont know the tube trains in London the trains rock from side to side sometimes quite violently and its most advisable to hang onto something if you are standing up like one of the handilyplaced rails which are there just for that specific purpose and in easy reachBut if you are going to the financial sector Canary Wharf theres a lot more arrogant people They try to tube surf  stand upright without holding on to anything Usually while reading and holding the book or newspaper with both hands And they can never suppress their smirks as they show off nor avoid casting glances around to see who has noticed and is impressed Heres a clue nobody is impressedWhy Because everyone in the carriage knows the sort of idiot who does that And knows that they only remain upright because the carriage is so packed They really rely on falling against other people  not very hard but quite often and its highly annoying to get the constant thudthudthud against youAnd every other commuter knows this because its happened to all of us You tubesurfer you are not big and you are not clever You are a selfish arse failing to show off by using other peoples bodies as cushions to break your fallSo when I commuted there I developed a habit check if the people next to me are holding on to anything If not position my elbow so that if they move in my direction enough that they are going to make contact then their head collides with my elbow before any other part of them touches me Its quite easy to do it and still look natural just hold the rail at whatever point gives the desired elbowlocationFor those occasions when an overhead rail isnt available jutting the elbow out slightly behind one serves almost as well Or if one has an umbrella the handle can be used to great effect and still be tucked tightly against one so as not to inconvenience others It just has to be an inch in front of whatever part of ones body will be the designated targetcushion by the surfer I recommend a good solid wooden handleIt was so satisfying to feel the bump and then to see that all of a sudden they decided that holding the rail was in fact a sensible idea who would have guessed and that their violent swaying had thus been replaced with a much more stable arrangement Some of them took two or three bumps to get the message But they generally got the message The ones with their backs to me who didnt expect it were the most gratifying Good solid thuds they enjoyed when they were expecting the usual soft cushioning fall of another commuters bodyNot today my friend Not today,Think you can use me as a buffer when the tube rocks from side to side Heres my elbow,353.0,pettyrevenge,new

MHCII,72.0,221.0,1oq671,821.0,I worked in the service department at a certified German auto dealership for a year It was fun job because I got to drive some amazing cars I was the guy that handled all the money in the service department and took care of the loaner cars This meant that every customer in the service department got funneled to me When I wasnt handling clients cash I made sure every loaner car was clean and fueled up Its a simple job but were constantly busy I was able to keep up with the work and keep customers happy so the manager was always happy to have my back when I needed himWe had some pretty cool customers For example we had a guy with a Carrera GT invite us onto his yacht to watch the th of July fireworks We also had a nice little lady that brought in a plate of better than sex cake for us every time she visited this cake really was better than sex The vast majority of our clients were pleasant but Ive had my fair share of difficult customers as wellOther than getting to drive s and Ms all day the best part of my job was the petty revenge I got to dish out on the difficult customers Normally the car I loaned you depended on the car you brought in Mercedes gets a C class Porsche gets a Panamera BMW gets a i Audi gets an A However the management gave me discretion to deal with customers that were a pain in the ass We had a couple of Hondas that we kept around just for the difficult customers If you gave me shit I might run out of Mercedes and give you a Honda Accord instead Hondas are great cars but theres something about going from German to Japanese that annoys entitled pricks Of course its never my fault that we ran out of Mercedes so theres nothing they can do about being stuck with a Japanese car other than huff and puff about itIf petty revenge were a competition I had a winning streak that would have put George Foremans boxing record to shame No difficult customer went unpunished Like George Foreman however my winning streak had to come to an end Our new service writer told me that an outoftowner hambeast needed a loaner car while we serviced her Mercedes the new guys always got the new customers so they could build up their clientéle By outoftowner I mean this lady drove twoandahalf hours north from Irvine to reach us Kinda strange but whateverHambeast walks over to my department where I go over the rental car agreement with her dont damage the car no pets  flat fee etc When I got to the loaner fee she flipped her shit Everybody in proximity turned their heads as she shouted about the  fee Jesus Christ lady If you can afford a Mercedes you can certainly afford a  rental car Im given discretion to waive the loaner fee if its a really good customer but I refuse to give her a free car She storms off to New Guy and makes him waive her loaner feeWhatever She got her way and didnt have to pay for the car Hope she enjoys her free Honda OH SHIT We ran out of Hondas and only had a Mercedes left for her I had to give her the Mercedes now there was nothing I could do about it I knew I was defeated so I downtroddenly handed her the keys to the Cclass loaner car She snatched the keys from my hand grabbed her dog out of her car and placed it into the loaner car NO PETS and drove off victoriouslyLater in the day New Guy handed me a pair of loaner keys to check back into the system They belonged to Hambeasts loaner car I went over to inspect her loaner car and found the front seat covered in fur and vomit Im only  sure it was the dogs fault Hambeast was nowhere to be found New Guy ringed her out while I was busy with other customers and gave her back her own car This was a huge nono because I have to check the rental cars for damages before giving the customer back their own car Hambeast circumvented the loaner car inspection got her own car back and escaped before I could discover the dog vomitAs soon as I told my manager what just happened and have him ask me why the hell I didnt give her the Honda he picked up the phone and called her He demanded she come back to the dealership and pay to get the car cleaned she refused You can fuck with the employees all day but never EVER fuck with the manager He banned her from the dealership on the spot When she heard this she shrieked in a fit of rage and hung up on usRemember how she lived  hours away from us Well we called the dealership in Irvine and asked if they knew about her They laughed and told us she was banned from their dealership They told us that she moved on to the next closest dealership When they got sick of her shit she got banned and had to get serviced at the next dealership Then the next one Then the next one She pissed off so many dealerships that she had to drive  hours north or jump the border to Mexico to get to a dealership she wasnt banned fromUnfortunately for her the next closest dealership was a  hour drive north of us This was great for our business because we covered a large geographical area But for Hambeast that meant that if she needed her car serviced she would need to take another  hour drive on top of the  hours she had to drive from Irvine Five hours of driving just to get to the northern dealership Jokes on her though We warned the northern dealership about her and they preemptively banned herWe never heard from Hambeast again Mercedes customers are fiercely loyal to the brand so theres no way she would sell the car just so she could get another brand serviced in Irvine Some say Hambeast is still driving up the coast of California looking for a dealership thatll put up with her shit Others say she traveled to Nevada to get her car serviced Either way New Guy learned a valuable lesson and never made that mistake ever againTLDR Unlike Jesus I speak of my own Accord,Treat your loaner car like shit Your closest servicing center is now  hours away,1042.0,pettyrevenge,new

MexicanDPrinter,4.0,17.0,1onf8m,61.0,After working as a graphic designer for over a year my bosses decided to give me this side position to do tech support for a D printer It turned my quiet behind the scenes job into something a little more chaotic but it came with a raise potential for travel and a little more job security And like most customer service jobs it has its fair share of belligerent andor whiny customersTheres whiny and then theres melodramatic cheap bastards Thats where Larry comes in Larry was a pretty cool dude I met at a trade show in Las Vegas He owns a jewelry factory in Mexico and was extremely excited at the potential this D printer has He went ahead and purchased a printer and  to  weeks later he received it damaged Somehow either UPS or the Mexican Customs caused some issues with the printer so I spent the next few days working with Larry over the phone to repair it The whole time I put up with his incessant whining and complainingAt the end of this ordeal I found out he didnt purchase material specifically sold with the printer because he wanted to be cheap and use questionable resin he found in bulk The approved material he should have bought comes with an RFID sticker that assures that he must only use our material for the printer to work In essence no RFID sticker no printing I told him this and he freaked and even threatened to call the Better Business Bureau He went on and on how important he is and how successful he is and that this shouldnt happen to him blah blah blah I didnt sell him this printer so I couldnt blame him if someone told him otherwise so we sold him a bottle of material Ill call it castable material A with the sticker He then demanded we not send the bottle so customs doesnt hold it indefinitely and he also demanded the invoice be marked at  so he isnt taxed much He would pick up the bottle next time hes in the states Three weeks later he calls me up whining that customs held the trays which is costing him business I didnt realize this or the fact that this printer is the answer to all his problems but he was starting to tick me offSo Larry finally gets the printer to function properly with the new RFID tag and he called again complaining that he is having trouble with the material Im starting to not appreciate this guy anymore Hes hot then hes cold Nothing can please him unless its absolutely perfect and I find it hard to believe that Larry Mr successfulfactoryownerextraordinaire has never hit snags like this before Either that or he his exaggerating all his problems I simply told him that he must use our material I cannot support other materials because the machine is engineered to work with certain viscosities opacities and other specific properties of our specific materials For me to support and troubleshoot knockoff resin over the phone would be a waste of my time I still have graphic designing to do He flipped out again and hung up on me The only way I could reach out to him is via email He refuses to give out his phone number so I must email him so he can call our  number very cheap I emailed him such a waste of time to explain what I needed to tell him about adjusting the machines settings to see if he can get his knockoff resin to workA week later Larry emails me that he needs urgent help or he will return the machine I email him immediately saying he can call me but it must be soon because I will be traveling for business soon I dont hear back from him for weeks He of course decided to call me at PM just as I was leaving so I can explain how to use the machine Excuse me  How long has he had this machine Such a bastard I didnt go home til  No overtime for that because Im salaried A few weeks after that he decides to visit the states so out of the blue he calls my boss asking him to send the castable material he purchased to his hotel room At this point there is an updated material castable material B that builds a little cleaner He asked me some time ago if he can exchange material A for material B I was already pissed off enough with him so I told him to make that deal with my boss Im in no position to make deals let alone with this shady prick Of course my boss sent material A because Larry NEVER asked my boss what I told him The next day Larry calls screaming that we sent the wrong material My boss came into my office and screamed at me that I made a deal with Larry and we should have sent material B not material A I told him I made no such deal but it seemed Larry lied to my boss to get what he wants He even demanded that because we made such a mistake we should send him a free bottle of material to compensate for the time he lost which I believe my boss agreed to Thus making me the bad guyWhen Larry got back to Mexico today he called me because his RFID reader apparently stopped working although I think he was tampering with it so he can use is cheap resin Knowing what the solution might be I told him I need to discuss this issue with the manufacturer and that is would take a day or more He of course went on one of his monologues about how successful he is and how he needs this printer to work so he doesnt lose production for the holidays but I dont care Hes just a shady slimy con artist using Mexico as a way to outsource cheap labor Screw him If he wants to put words in my mouth and get me in trouble after all I did for him he can wait til MondayTLDR  Slimy business man who lies and cheats the system to get what he wants needs my technical expertise until he betrays me Now he can just

TechRiporte,37.0,57.0,1ocakb,257.0,A while back I worked for a small ish employees manufacturing company doing their IT My manager was actually managing quite a few departments due to cutbacks and was not specifically involved with IT so I was essentially a oneman department  a combined sysadmin tech support developer asset provisioningtrackingreplacement guy etc etc etcSo most of the business was on PCs of course but some of the managers got Macbooks Im fairly sure this was mainly decided because they looked pretty as they were all bootcamped anyway and all the company phones had been iPhones for some time The company was going through some rough times as everyone was at the time a few years back but the fancy read expensive apple tech predated me As a result though nothing had been replaced in a long time much of my work was centered around keeping equipment running long past its usedby dateSo one morning a manager walks into my office well it was the server room but I squeezed a table in there and it beat a cubicle lets call him Dick Dick waltzs in and says to me I need a new phone and laptop Im leaving again tomorrow so make it snappy then turns around and starts walking back out of the room immediately without waiting for a responseHold up Dick whats going on is there a problem with the current ones I can come have a look and see if we cant get them working if youId say theres definitely a problem TechRiporte he cuts in theyre goneNo further explanation No shame whatsoever If anything he seems to be getting annoyed at me now for the gall of not reading his mindTheyre wait Where are theyWell they were stolen of course while I was in Country redactedNow Dick has been overseas for roughly  weeks in Country redacted and in the next few minutes I discerned from him that he had left them in a conference room in the hotel while he went for lunch and when he returned they were gone This had been on day  of his trip and this was the first I was hearing of it Before he left he made sure to angrily let me know how difficult it had made the rest of the trip to be without a phone or laptop in a tone of voice that suggested there was something I had not done to prevent thisSo after swallowing hard and politely assuring him wed get him sorted out before he had to leave again I went to see my manager  this was the first stolen equipment I had dealt with and I needed some information on the insurance process Now my manager was a top bloke  I havent worked for better  and when I mentioned the way Dick had announced the situation he was as shocked and annoyed as I was but he had a far better response for meIs that old Lenovo still kicking around The oldest laptop we had with  out of  USB ports broken the top right corner of the screen distorted from being dropped and slow as a wet walrusWell yeah I mean I had been planning on giving him the last  MB we dont have anymore of the  that he had beforeNah screw him He can use the equipment we can afford to go without until he proves he can look after it like a big boy A few months down the track if he still has them well look at getting him a Macbook See if you can get one of the old blackberries up and running for him tooI was speechless I checked a few more times that he wasnt joking that I had his blessing to go ahead with this and he assured me that if Dick had a problem with it I could send him to ask my manager about it Barely concealing my mirth I delivered to Dick his ancient laptop and a blackberry getting old enough that the back was visibly distorted from the bulging battery He wasnt happy but I put on my best mournful face and apologized that This is the best we can do until business gets betterI almost felt guilty for feeling that good while at work but the next month it got even better He lost the blackberry on a flight and once again appeared across my desk demanding another phone And make it an iPhone this time He got a blackberry and that same day I deployed the last Macbook to one of his direct reports When he noticed he went to my manager to complain who told him exactly what he had told me  he would get decent equipment when he started taking care of itTLDR a manager at my work is a dick and consistently loses his equipment He gets his toys taken away from him for a time out I ride out on a unicorn cigar in hand and blow smoke rings in his face while he cries and rocks in the cornerEdit So I re read the text looking for grammar twice and miss the screwup in the title I now cant fix typical,Be rude to my and careless with your equipment Enjoy your replacement,314.0,pettyrevenge,new

RabbitsRuse,12.0,37.0,1o5zvw,19.0,So as you may be able to guess this is a story my dad told me years ago that always made me laugh Back when my dad was in college he was living in an apartment building The building had four levels of apartments with three stories above ground and then a basement level of apartments My dad and his roommates would sometimes go the the field outside of the gated area around the apartment to play Frisbee The apartment allowed pets and the woman who lived by the stairs in the basement level of the apartment had a dog Somehow this dog always knew when my dad and his friends were outside playing Frisbee and it had no problem getting out of the apartment through the doggy door and squeezing through the bars of the fence going around the building to play with them Unfortunately the dogs favorite game was to steel my dads Frisbee and play keep away until it could chew it up I dont know if they ever went to confront the woman about her dog before they came up with the plan but it kept happening and they were getting pissed about this dog Finally they decide to teach the dog a lesson They all knew that the dog loved tennis balls just as much as Frisbees so the next time they went out they took a tennis ball with them plus a large new bottle of Tabasco sauce They threw the ball a few times and sure enough the dog comes running They then completely doused the ball in Tabasco until it was completely red and threw it for the dog The dog snatches the ball and starts to play its game of keep away when suddenly it drops the ball and stands there barking at it They walk over and pick the ball back up and douse it again before throwing it for the dog Again the dog takes off after the ball picks it up drops it and starts barking at it unable to figure it out My dad and his friends being college guys are laughing hysterically by now and keep repeating the cycle By the time they call it a day they have literally used about half of the large bottle of Tabasco Everyone goes to bed that night thinking that they have had their fun and that it is all over but of course it wasnt Sometime that night the Tabasco finished running its course through the dogs digestive track and it really had to go Something interesting about dogs that you may or may not know is that they will do anything in their power to not poop where they sleep The dog left the basement apartment and made its way up the stairs One feature of the building that is important to this story is that the stairs connecting each level of the building went up along the outside of the building but there was in fact about an inch wide gap between the staircase and the wall they ran parallel to The dog made it all the way up the the third floor of the building before it decided that it had gone far enough an turned its back end to the wall of the building If you have guessed watery diarrhea at this point then you are correct and because of the gap between the stairs and the outside wall of the building it ran all the way down the side of the building and puddled outside of the womans apartment The next day my dad woke up to the sound of the woman shouting at the poor dog and felt really guilty about everything Not enough to confess about it though so the woman had to clean it off the side of every floor of the building I guess she should have trained the dog to be better behavedTLDR Three floors of dog diarrhea for owner to clean up,My dads revenge runs from the third floor all the way down,56.0,pettyrevenge,new

Callanson,9.0,23.0,1nzsqs,141.0,The apartment I live in shares a small parking lot with two other buildings There is a narrow driveway with parking spaces along the sides running between my building and the neighboring building widening out in back with the third building along the back edge This building only has street access through the driveway All the buildings are owned by different landlords but luckily my neighbors are all nice and stick to their assigned spots My spot is the last spot along the side of the building before the lot widens out and is the only one perpendicular to the building rather than parallel As such my spot is a bit of a choke point and I am always very careful to make sure I am not sticking out and blocking the drivewayThe family who lives in the back building has a young son who takes the bus to school The city I live in doesnt use regular buses but sticks a school bus sign on top of a van and requires the busses to pick up students from their door  Unfortunately this bus is driven by an absolute shrew of a woman Every morning right as I am leaving from work she blasts down the driveway screeches to a halt and leans on the horn until the kid shows up Most mornings shes waiting as I walk to my car so I always wave and if her window is down say good morning I have never gotten anything but the most baleful of glares in return Even a surly grunt of acknowledgement would be an improvement Last week I hear her pull up as Im tying my shoes Much to my surprise instead of honking I hear the door open and slam shut again Thinking the kid was on time for once I am surprised to see her still sitting there when I go to my car  Even more surprising I find shes left one of those obnoxious snarky bad parking job cards under my windshield wiper She gives me an extra spiteful glare as I pull it off I was parked fine there was less than an inch between my bumper and the building and if I was crooked you would have needed a protractor to tell but whatever Shes always surly and not worthy of my attention After I got home from work I ran into my upstairs neighbors and much to my surprise find out that she has left those cards on everybodys car including cars that are nowhere near the driveway This pisses me off as this lady is obviously a busybody looking for reasons to be annoyed at others parking and has appointed herself the queen of the Parking Judgement Bureau After running my plan by everyone who shares the lot I sprung into action Every morning I get up ten minutes earlier repark my car so it really is sticking out and go back inside By the time any of my neighbors need to get out Ive already left so the only person inconvenienced is the bus lady Ive got quite a collection of those cards now and every time I see the bus lady fuming at me as I remove another card and give a cheery wave warms my heart Tldr You bought a bunch of those expensive and snarky bad parking cards Ill be a friendly neighbor and make sure you have a car to leave them on,Reverse bad parking revenge,164.0,pettyrevenge,new
Mnementh,29.0,143.0,1nzsmi,296.0,Original Post with this story is herehttpwwwredditcomrAskRedditcommentsfngrredditwhatisyoursilentunseenactofpersonalchdgwv  and its not mine  Its two years old so some of you might not have seen it  Thus Im sharing it for you here nowIm about  so even when Im just trying to be friendly ie not farting on a stanger kids head and meeting a family members or friends kid for the first time Ive noticed they get very hide between their mothers legs intimidated on sight if Im not sitting down So its not hard for me to silenceintimidate a child especially when Im trying toHowever a few times Ive been called out One time I was pretty drunk with a friend at a Target buying Risk and no we never finished playing the whole game This little mexican  year old with a mohawk was being an insufferable little shit in the action figure section I heard him from like  aisles over and it was like nails on a chalkboard I tell my friend Im gonna fart on this kids head Watch and learnI saunter on over to the aisle in question and see the vile little prick calling his mom an idiot for not buying him a huge fucking GI JOE The Movie vehicle which pissed me off even more considering how awful that movie was BUY SOME GOOD TOYS I already bought that one for you and you broke it by throwing it down the stairs SHUT UP I NEED IT ITS THE ONLY ONE I DONT HAVE NOW The mother was younger than me Im mid twenties and gave a defeated look I dont have enough money right now YOU ARE AN IDIOT and continued to just berate and publicly shame this womanAt the time I was on a strict Chipotle carnitas burrito diet And while I was watching all this my stomach gave me an initial warning gurgle very courteous stomach telling me I was about an hour away from punishing the toilet Serendipity DestinyI inch a bit closer to my prey inspecting some wrestling toys and pondering the weird homoeroticness of the whole sport in general The kid shouts FUCK YOU I HATE YOU The mom rolls her eyes and turns her back to the kid to ignore him And could you believe it the kid gets on his hands and knees and starts taking the toy out of the box Its go time motherfuckerI position my back towards him and at this point am like  feet away from him His head is down getting frustrated with those god damn twisty tie things and I go for the kill I bend down to reach for the one of the toys on the lower shelf At this point my ass is INCHES away from this kids headNow generally speaking the best way to go about this is to act casual drop your belly bomb then walk away after a few seconds like nothing is out of the ordinary I usually go one aisle over and listen to the kids reaction in delight However today I couldnt help myself I have my head tilted back looking at this kid out of the corner of my eye to ensure accuracyIm so close that from a distance it looks like Im about to sit on him My friend sees this happening and can no longer contain himself Hes covering his mouth but his heehaw hyperventilating donkey chortle is fairly audible over the late s pop muzak playing on the loudspeakersThe kid immediately looks up towards the laughter but cant help but notice there is an ass now directly in his face Now Im trying not to laugh but also panicking as I just made eye contact with him He furls his brow and I look over in the mothers direction still back towards us I relish in the moment and the look on this childs confused and naive faceThe initial blast was mighty and boisterous I swear I saw his hair blowing in the wind so to speak If I wasnt wearing jeans I think it could have probably blown over an empty soda can I would call it a very fun fart A would buy again However what immediately followed that out the chamber was truly horrifying The farts implication changed without notice and swiftly It went from a joyous dry airhorn squeal to a nefarious hissing mephitis I think the little moppet noticed the hateful metamorphosis before even I did because he wretched his neck violently trying to get away from the personified evil being fumigated into his soul Because of his positioning hovering over the toy hands and knee it was all in vain as the only way out was forwardand forward would mean certain death I had positioned myself well on the higher ground free to escape or relent at any time and him poor and immobilized biding his time until the cruel attack was over Obviously this child needed to reread Sun TzuIn total it lasted about  seconds but for that kid it must have seemed like time was frozen The longterm severe brain damage which he no doubt suffered only added to that effectWhen I finished with my bidness ie forcing a little boy to huff my farts there was a silent pregnant pause The kid was clearly shocked and stunned No one had ever stood up to this dwarf sociopath in his whole life I had taken the words out of his mouth and filled it with fartI make my move first picking up the toy I was reaching for off the low shelf take a few steps forward and stare at it for a few seconds On  alligator the only thing the kid could manage to do was burst into tears My friend senses danger the jig is up and his head darts for cover The mom turns around to see her kid with an open toy crying on the floor and me minding my own businessShe walks up to him and asks whats wrong but the kid cant speak All he gets out is BAWAWAAAWAFARTBAWAWA It took every fiber in my body not to laugh I put the toy back on a middle shelf turn around give a final nonchalant looksy and then begin to take my exitSensing that his assailant was getting away scotfree he somehow managed to compose himself for a moment He shouts HE FARTED ON ME I could feel him pointing at me but I continued to act like I was just browsing I was ALMOST around the corner when the mom goesExcuse mesirSIRI turn around nonplussed Uhwho Me while pointing to myselfYes Did YOU just FART on my sonWeighing my options I played dumb What I mean I did fartOn my sonWell I mean technically speakingI meanwhat is onWhy did you fart on my sonAt this point the little kid has the look of schadenfreude on his face happy to see me in trouble Fuck you IM A MAN I WILL FART ON YOU IF I PLEASE I turn my attention to the little kid and stare at him Because the whole store could hear him being a little rotten asshole to his mother so I thought Id come over here and treat him like oneThe mom looks at me her son and the scattered GI JOEwrappersbox on the floor The mom is puzzled as to what to do and says Justjust go Thats my cue I turn around walk away with little extra step I look up to see the black orb of security cameras and all the stories on reddit about unjustly having to register as a sex offender flash before my eyes As soon as I turn the corner I book it outside as fast as I can while dialing my friend Like a true friend he is right out front with the engine running and Risk in the trunkWe laugh on the car ride back about the whole scene With a slight hint of seriousness in his tone my friend asks meDo you do that a lotAhhh not that much Like once every  months or soWe both knew I was lying We got to our other friends house played risk until  in the morning while drinking scotch Overall I would say it was a preeeetay preeeeetay good day Edit  This isnt my original story  the link to OP is at the top    Im happy so many of you have enjoyed reading it but I cant claim credit,Kid acts like a little shit gets treated like one  fart on his head,439.0,pettyrevenge,new

Raveynfyre,5.0,9.0,1nwu01,8.0,I tried to post this under a different username my apologies to the mods if this ends up being a double post due to itSo my husband and I have three cats We love them all dearly and all of them are under  years old even though each one was adopted separately The middle child of the three is a monster Maine Coon weighing in at lbs You may think well thats not that big  but he is a lean mean muscular biting machine of death who will not stop growing until hes  years old His name was inspired by his bloodletting tendencies Chewbacca or Chewie Hes very rarely drawn blood with his claws and only then its usually when were trying to clip those needles of doom This is a two person job unless I can sneak up on him while hes asleep Chewie really is that strong When he goes full Superman laying down his length is from my feet to my chest Im  and its all solid freaking muscleThe first day he was home he bit my husband on the face and drew blood The second day it was my turn on my arm Typically the biting only occurs when Chewie is being handled or petted against his will I know fuck me for wanting to show my pet I love him Ill spoil the end a little and say that the method to our madness has worked and Chewie has really toned down how bitey he is since we adopted himWe stopped yelling at the bites except to say OW this is important you have to let them know it hurts but not by escalation or retaliation Smacking a cat around does not tell them what they are doing wrong it only escalates the anxiety factor and makes things worse and instead we would cuddle him Months and months and months have gone by using this tactic Instead of dropping Chewie and screaming at him or other punishment methods used by less savory people we cuddle him He really didnt like this at first now he just puts up with it because hes learned we WILL get our way The more he bit us the more we cuddled him before letting him get away from us To be fair we never held him against his will if he really had a freakout spazattackNow he rarely if ever bites us when we pick him up carry him or pet him against his will He has almost completely stopped his bloodletting tendencies and if he bites now its more of a warning nip and doesnt come close to breaking the skin,Pet Revenge Sometimes my revenge works out in the long run,17.0,pettyrevenge,new

TerrytheMerry,46.0,120.0,1nwsvb,566.0,So a friend and I went to a concert last Friday and got some awesome spots in the middle right near the barricade separating the crowd from the stage Unfortunately next to me was a trio of late  something or  year old drunks two men and a slutty woman who was wearing a strapless corset top that was way too small for her The first opener comes on stage a few awkward older locals who were obviously very nervous After their first song the woman starts yelling loudly about how shitty their sound is and how she cant hear shit because an amp is directly in front of her Annoying but not my problem Then the second opener comes out and the slut is obviously much more excited by them as they are more young attractive than the first and about half way through their set she begins jumping against me whenever the singer gets near while sloshing her beers all down my back Im pretty pissed now and thinking about how I hope there isnt a police checkpoint on my way home but Im still in a forgiving mood since the woman is horribly drunk and I know shes probably not all that self aware Then the second group wraps up and were all waiting on main band who everyone really showed up for to set up Im talking with my friend when we hear the other drunks trying to calm slutty down about something I start listening in and I hear this woman threatening to punch that skank in the face Curious I listen more and find shes telling the other two that I was roughly slamming into her since the first set and about how she was going to break my teeth Shocked I turned about and as politely as I could apologized but said that she must have me confused with someone else to which she replied fuck you fat ass bitch put your fake ass tits up This perplexed me for a moment as I thought she meant fists rather than tits then I realized she was accusing me of lording about my chest for attention strange considering my top came up to my neck As her companions decided to cheer her on and throw more insults my way perhaps in hopes of a cat fight I simply nodded and turned away thinking okay its my problem now A few minutes later one of the band members walked out and she began hopping up and down saggy flesh a jiggling and I took my opportunity I took a slight step back so that she slid right in front of me and as she bounced I caught hold of the thin bit of ribbon that held her teensy corset top together and watched as she jumped up one last time pulling loose the knot in the ribbon herself and all of the flesh that had been packed so tightly burst forth as the top slid to the ground The hag let out a high pitched screech and briefly searched the ground for her cover before realizing she couldnt find it among the legs of the crowd and littered beer bottles She then grabbed on of the men and fled the establishment never to be seen again I waited for someone to point me out or a bouncer to kick me out before gleefully realizing that with the excitement of the band entering no one had seen me do it Shame the woman was such a bitch it was a spectacular concertit is rather long my apologies,Now you dont get to see the concert,686.0,pettyrevenge,new
deleted,12.0,31.0,1nwojz,143.0,BackgroundI used to work at a highend electronics retail store and we would often have customers come in to purchase cell phones at their discounted price by signing up for a contract Obviously we had customers that would do this for real but a majority of them were identity thieves using stolen credit cards Management told us that we had to go through with the transaction if everything checked out and to let the phone company handle it because they needed better security It pissed me off to no end that they were valuing money over someones identity and just refusing to sell those guys the phonesThe scammers are easily picked out of the crowd  They always entered the store in groups and split ways stood in the wrong section to purchase a phone asked for the most basic phones with the most basic plans and we usually saw the same people over and over purchasing contract phones if they had business accounts we wouldnt have seen them in our store While opening a new contract or upgradingadding a line to existing contracts we had to go through a vigorous approval process usually involving their social security cardID card The StoryOne day a repeat offender i helped him upgrade the week before came in and held a spot in our electronic queue Usually it was firstcome firstserved unless we were assigned to the particular section they were in I saw a couple of people ahead of him but I went for him instead to eliminate him We went through the process of picking out which phone he played stupid by trying to ask which one he should get and started the process While I was going through the line of questions he started hitting on me I wasnt very happy with this and let him know right away I didnt take too kindly to his behavior Despite my objections he kept doing it and even reached out to touch me at one point Because of the type of environment I worked in it took a lot of self control to not punch him in the face and cause a sceneWhen the time came for me to check the ID andor social security number he handed me a legitimate ID I started to copy down the numbers when I got hit with an ideaaccidentally add some numbersletters so I will be prompted for a credit check with the phone company It worked We had to call the phone company and I had to hand over the phone so that he could answer some questions His first reaction This never happens to me what the hell But he went through with the questions anyway Once he handed the phone back to me the agent on the other end told me he was approved to move forward I knowing that his name changed sometime from this week and the last told him he was not approved to move forward and he didnt get his phones that time or every time afterTLDR Scamming customer made me feel uncomfortable he didnt get his goodsEdit I accidentally a word,You are not approved,174.0,pettyrevenge,new

my shyly quiet and wellbehaved self every teachers pet regardless of how little I cared was a super fast developer never wore a training bra went straight to a B cup when I was  in fourth grade prompting nicknames like Jolly Green Giant and endless brasnapping and because we didnt have much money back then my parents dressed me in the grandma clothes that hipsters have deemed popular in recent years NO one in the midnineties thought they were remotely cool Add in that we were super religious and I attended private schools and you get an awkward young girl who had books and animals as friends instead of people This obviously made me an easy target for bullying and in third through fourth grade the Bitchface McGee that made my life a living hell until we upgraded to a better school had a posse of emptyheaded dipshits who likely upped the teenage pregnancy rates in their later years I spent a good deal of time wondering why she was popular but private schools can be so weird She was short I guess everyone was to me back then fat facially ugly by traditional standards wore glasses and was super loud and annoying But her dad drove one of those long white vans that transported kids from far away to and from school eight to twelve of us and she was outgoing deriving most of her popularity by her willingness to be a bitch to people less loud and outgoing than herself so Id resigned myself to my fate For the better part of two years BM and her coweyed posse did everything they could think of to fuck with me for no reasons other than that I was so shy and unpopular due to the reasons listed above and they knew that I wouldnt tell on them simply because I never did Theyd trap me on a merry go round and spin it violently fast while I begged them to please stop so I could get off and other times theyd run up and shove me off of it while I was playing alone then laugh at my skinned knees and torn skirts Theyd hit me over the head with their hardbacked textbooks if I was sitting somewhere and no teachers were around And they LOVED teaming up to have one knock my knees forward while I was drinking at the water fountain while the other jumped up grabbed the back of my head and slammed my face into the water fountain then theyd kick me while I was holding my bleeding nose and run off laughing like the addleheaded twats they truly were Cut to three semesters in where Valentines day is coming up and of COURSE everyone had to give everyone else a Valentine whether you really liked that person or not I was in a stew over having to give my precious Hello Kitty Valentines that Id saved allowances to buy to BM and The Shits but a few nights before our class Valentines Day party a petty idea crept into my mind and made its home there So I filled out my cute little valentines one for everyone in the class as was required then dug through the closet until I found the remaining few valentines from a box my brotherd used two years prior at a different school One of the really romantic crush ones was left and I just knew the universe was on my side for this one Immediately I went to my older sister who was also bullied by girls in her class for similar reasons but in different horrid ways like hitting her repeatedly with a sock containing a bar of soap in the locker room and laughing about it explained to her my devious little plan she agreed to help and we both had a good evil laugh about it Knowing my handwriting would have been recognizable by my teacher my sister was kind enough to use her stereotypically girly handwriting to write out my words on the card for BM They went something like Im your secret admirer and today is the best day to tell you how I feel Youre incredible Beyond description So much so that when I walk down the hall and see your face every day my heart stops because youre so amazingly hideous Seriously how did you accomplish getting so ugly Hope you die in a fire bitch She wrote small enough that it fit on the inside of the big card and I sealed it with old heart stickers that I put all over the valentine having Big Sis sign the from box as lt Your Secret Admirer  lt Then we wrote one for BMs  in The Shits her best Queen of Mean pal but Id exhausted my creative energy so she just wrote I hope you do something great with your life like falling down a flight of stairs and improving the population by dying A little harsh Maybe but the first year I knew them these girls once wrote all kinds of mean things about me and my family on a quiz of mine they were supposed to be grading for the teacher then begged my crying ass not to tell on them swearing theyd make it up to me at lunch by letting me into their secret club My sad lonely heart believed them did not tell and at lunch the gigglecows lead me into the tall grass of the field next to the school where they pelted me with everything saucy from their lunches hit me repeatedly and ran away laughing that I was a stupid loser so theyd had it coming for awhile in my book Ill never forget BMs eyes lighting up when she got to my fake valentine or the crushed horror and tears that happened when she got to the gutpunch lines Both bullies cried most of the day and were depressed for days after which cut down on the amount of bullying I had to put up with at the time and that was nice The principal came and told whoever did it to come forward  I was such a good kid and so full of guilt at the time I almost raised my hand but didnt and they never caught me A lesson at a young age that sometimes simply not speaking up means youll get away with something Weeks and weeks later right before Easter weekend BM and The Shits had gone back to their usual harassing ways but I knew at that point that I was swapping schools the following year so I put on my brave face and endured That particular friday BM and The Shits were wearing their new Easter sunday outfits to school to show them off of course being poor I didnt have one and that seemed to be the Bully Theme of the Day The cafeteria served super sketchy enchiladas rice and beans for lunch that day and I was feeling sick but found an unmanned merry go round on the back playground there were three where I could just sit in the middle and keep reading Nietzsches Twilight of the Idols a favourite at the time BM and The Shits show up and spin spin spin while I quietly cling and hope theyll stop laughing and go find someone else to pick on Needless to say I was nauseous as could be from the lunch already and the spinning was not helping Finally afternoon break was over the bell rang we lined up and went in for last period and then I piled into the back of BMs dads van with the other kids still feeling violently ill BM and  sat on the seat directly in front of me and chatterboxed their pieholes off for twenty minutes of the hourlong ride back to the place where wed all meet our parents Every bump every pothole I could feel the puke building inside me but Id avoided puking so long that I didnt want to be a quitter now you know Then I got really hot saw my skin going red and felt the puke coming up and promptly vomited in my lap filling the van with the most rancid Mexicandump smell you can imagine The girl sitting two seats down from me saw me puke and proceeded to vomit in her OWN lap Im sure you see where this is going Everyone was screaming including BM and  who were turned around in their seats mouths agape like they thought a piece of cake was imminent and after seeing the other chick puke I knew Id be vomiting again Bing Like a firework going off in my mind the idea hit me square in the face I made eye contact with BM smiled and projectile vomited directly in her face dousing her face including her open mouth in my spuntacodelight and coating some of her new Easter outfit too Her reaction wiping her face madly she turned screaming and spewed all over s Easter outfit and face and suddenly there were seven kids in this van just coating the interior and each other with exlunch The following forty minutes was a horrorfest as her father refused to stop just opening the window and telling us to hang in there that we were almost there but I had the joy of watching BM and  crying and screaming about their ruined new clothes the whole way back while I smiled quietly to myself not even giving a fuck about my lap full of grossness in light of the beauty of it all The rest of the year  refused to forgive BM for ruining her special dress with red enchilada sauce puke and The Shits split off into Twin Turd groups Anytime BM tried to be a bitch to me in front of others Id simply quip Hey remember that time I puked in your mouth and all over your white flowery dress to watch her go red with rage and make the other kids laugh Id finally found my voice My petty opportunistic revenge voice anyways gt tldr My fourth grade philosophy Bully me and Ill fuck up your psyche then ruin your beautiful new dress The memory still fills me with warm fuzzies Thanks for reading D ,Vomit and a Valentine,132.0,pettyrevenge,new

MysticRequiem,5.0,34.0,1nuk0i,83.0,Yay first post Warning Wall of text aheadSo I work in a hotel and was at work last night I start at  and dont get off until  so I was ready for the evening I see that we have about six checkins so I was fully prepared for a slow evening and brought a book to read while there Mind you I am the ONLY person at the front desk for the night and the manager has left for the day so I basically run the show that night We hardly ever have a nd person on second shift so Im use to making the calls and do call the manager when I need special permission for something  rolls around and our bartender shows up  comes and no cook We check the schedule and it turns out that the cook who was scheduled for Saturday and Sunday no longer works for us and nobody else is on the schedule So we are flipping out trying to get a cook here but one isnt answering his phone and the other isnt at home and at an event So its a nightmare At about  I get a call from the fire department demanding to speak to a manager and inform him that the manager has left and he thinks quit I tell him theyre gone for the evening and offer to assist He demands to speak to the supervisor and once again inform him that there isnt one Im getting pretty irritated because he is doing nothing but yell The bartender was at the desk trying to find the numbers for the cooks and could hear him yelling He says that hell be there shortly and hangs up I run back to the back for something and the bartender had answered the phone and is explaining that there is a front desk associate he could speak to and hands it to me Im pretty sure it was the same guy because of the voice and how he spoke but not sure He says that hes a Platinum member meaning hes part of our rewards program and basically the top tier His flight has been cancelled and the voucher was for a different chain but they arent answering so he wants to try and use it here I say we cant do that and he asks for out government rate and I tell him its  as opposed to the  for the night He says hes at the airport and needs to be picked up meaning Id be the one who has to get him because Im the only one who knows the shuttle there Hell Im really the only one there with power He asks how long I say    minutes depending on traffic He says to make it  because the others are too long He hangs up and Im just like What the fuck at the conversation And I leave after about  minutes to go and pick him up cause he was acting like a bastard I wanted him to have to wait  minutesSo I pick him up and make small talk doing my best to not snap at him for being an asshole We get back to the hotel and I unload his bags and he asks if we have a restaurant and I say we do but our cook hasnt shown up and are trying to find one He didnt like this and starts complaining about how he had better get a steak or he was leaving Obviously I dont like this guy at all and just want to be done with him We get in and the bartender is still at the desk trying to get a hold of a cook but to no anvil I start checking this guy in and is asking about the cook I tell him that its a toss up as to whether or not well have one and he starts bitching and moaning and then the owner calls He can tell that Im on the phone with a person with more power than me and figures out its the owner He asks why arent they getting off their ass and coming in to cook for him and I tell him that the parent company told them that they are not allowed to work the desk or restaurant or else they would pull the brand from the hotel More yelling and complaining and he demands a discount in order to stay here I just want to be done with him and drop his rate to  dollars for the evening which is not a major loss He is also demanding some free drinks and now if it was from the draft then we could do that But he doesnt like beer and is demanding free drinks from our selves I told him I have no control over what happens at the bar but I did tell the bar tender to not give him anything for free I dont know what happened with his paying but I bet she wouldnt budgeNow we have  floors in the hotel and the th floor is the member floor It doesnt have much more but it does have an extra water heater so the water has less chance of going cold And whenever we have a Platinum member we HAVE to upgrade to a suite if we have the availability to do so Now we have two different kinds of suites One that is two bedroom SK and really nice and one thats one larger room and OK STK They both have pull out sofas and the STK only has one TV and kinda awkward to use if you want to sit on the sofa due to the layout The SK has a TV per room and is a pretty nice room l We also have a fast food place right next door and that side can get pretty loud some nights So I out him on the th floor which is just another floor in one of the STKs all the way at the end of the hall he was a large man and said he doesnt want to walk and put him right next to fast food place I havent heard anything but I really hope that the place next door got loud and bothered him all evening couldnt watch TV easily and got his exercise In the end the managers who left had to come in and cook and I saw they were catering a bit to him but it sounds like he calmed his ass down tldr Entitled large man demands that I retrieve the holy grail and bath him with it whilst feeding him fruit from the Tree in the Garden of Eden while singing ancient African Tribal hymns I place him in an OK room not on our member floor all the way at the end of the hall way facing a fast food joint that can get loud and might keep him up ,Yell at me cause the cook hasnt shown up No top floor for you,117.0,pettyrevenge,new

toofarfromnothing,6.0,54.0,1nqnov,268.0,Just found this subreddit and Ive been reading it for hours I have a story of my own that I thought would fit well hereWhen I was in college I worked as a cashier at one of the dining halls on campus Students had all different types of meal plans but there were only three types of currency punch dining dollars and flex dollars Punch  a meal eg sandwich chips drink roughly equivalent to  Dining dollars could be spent on food only but allowed you to buy things a la carte Flex dollars could be used for anything food books even some off campus stuff The most popular meal plan was to have two punches every day and then a few dining dollars to supplement if you just wanted a snack or somethingSo every Wednesday night this arrogant meathead would come in to our dining hall and order two meals worth of food then proceed to the register and ask to double punch if you had two punches a day on your meal plan and you didnt use any before pm you could use them both at the same time after pm ie double punch Of course he would only have one punch left that day and hed always say I havent used my other punch I should have two blah blah This smug bastard knew that many of the cashiers werent likely to make him throw away one of his meals it was always prepared food that couldnt be used again so wed often let him through without paying in full Once I noticed he was making a habit of this I formulated a plan to make him payI decided to become his favorite cashier the one that always let him through without a hassle I discretely checked the balance on his Flex account and realized he had about  wasnt really supposed to check balances except at the customers request Every Wednesday for almost a year I would charge him for exactly what he ordered using his punch first and putting the rest on Flex dollars I would hassle him a little every time about not having the other punch and then pretend to try the card to make it work  but in reality I was swiping a second time to charge his Flex accountBy the time he stopped coming on Wednesday maybe he realized what was going on or maybe he movedleftgraduated who knows his Flex account was about  lighter feelsgoodmanjpgTLDR Guy thought he was getting meals for free was actually paying for them out of funds that he likely set aside for books,Cashier Revenge On College Campus,322.0,pettyrevenge,new

FierceFox,68.0,87.0,1npqx0,388.0,The other week I got some new neighbors in my apartment complex A nice elderly couple and their douchey manchild son I like the parents theyre the sweetest folks Ive met in KC yet but their son their terminally unemployed douchebag son is a different story This guy loves his Edd Hardy bullshit shirts cologne  and spiked hair like its cheap liquor which he also loves judging by the bottles left on the porch He also has a penchant for playing shitty rap as loud as possible once everyone else goes to work for the day This isnt a problem for the other two units because theyre at work but Im home during the day and usually asleep since I work nights The first day I ignored the loud music because I was tired from a crappy night at work and not in the mood to deal with his shit I turned on my own ambiance white noise stuff and tried to get some sleep His music kept going until about pm when folks start coming home after which he turned it off I got some real sleep after that which was nice When I woke up that evening and went outside to have a smoke and let my dog run around and potty I caught the douchey son having a smoke too We made a bit of chitchat and learned this guys parents paid for all his shit so he didnt have to He was recently divourced so his parents had taken pitty on him and taken him in He bragged about the shiny blue hatchback with the bitchin rims that belonged to him which was double parked at the bottom of the lot and shity stereo system he liked to bump in the day This was great a perfect segway into what we needed to talk about so I asked him to maybe turn it down during the day sighting the fact that hes not the only one here during the day that I live next door and sleep in the day and common fucking decency His response was for me to go fuck myself and my shitty rat dog shes a Belgian ShepherdGrey Hound mix so she isnt rat sized but she is shit colored He said he had a right to play his music as loud as he wanted to during the day and to mind my own businessInstalling youdunfuckedupassholeexeInstallation completeOkay chief Ill play your game I then spent my night at work trying to figure out how to get back at him My first idea was to burn the building down whith him in it because I hadnt leveled a building in a while but I like my place so that was out the window His car was next on the list and I thought about torching that too which would have been fun just too over the top With fire still on my mind I decided to fight fire with fire and shitty music with one the greatest pieces of music ever written Beethovens th Symphony on repeatWhen I got home that morning I unpacked my surround sound system and placed all my speakers right up against the wall These arent tiny little things either These are four foot tall speakers and I have six of them When their volumes are maxed out these things will leave your ears ringing for day and a half For whatever reason Douchey McGee didnt bump his beats for a few days and I started to think that maybe he had just had a bad day when I first talked to him When Im in a bad mood I can be a pretty gaping asshole so it wasnt too far fetched to me And then Friday rolled around and at about noon he started his shit againI roll out of bed put my robe and moccasins on and went next door to try and resolve this shit I knocked on the door a few times and then pounded on it before he answered smelling of liquor and bullshit I asked him to turn the music down once and was called a faggot for the pink robe I was wearing I then demanded he turn the music down before this gets serious He took that as the threat it was and got all up in my face like we where back on the block and chest bumpedme in an attempt to intimidate meLolgoodluckgifSix years in the Army and Afghanistan have made me immune to this kind of shit so I just shrugged it off and put my plan onto motion I put my CD in the player cranked the volume and brewed some coffee I listend to my music for a couple of repetitons before grabbing my ear muffs out of a tough box Now these things are awesome theyre basically military grade noise cancelers so once they go on I cant hear anything After about an hour of the Beethoven barage the Douchemaster came and pounded on my sliding glass door with the most pissed off expression he could he could muster Expecting a surrender I turned the music off and opened the door I was immediately assaulted with a torrent of profanity and threats because he couldnt hear his shit music He went on for a few minutes before losing steam once he realized I was more interested in my coffee than his tyrade Once he stopped I let him know in no uncertain terms that I can do this longer than him and that it will continue until he starts acting like a reasonable neighbor He swore at me a bit longer before storming away He turned his crap down so I turned mine off and minus two other times his music got too loud in the day things have gone swimingly Tl DRDouchlord bumps his beats at an unreasonable volume during the day so I bump back with Beethoven,Mess with my sleep I hope you like the

cakisyummy,13.0,26.0,1npa15,91.0,So this happened last week or soI was driving on an interstate and it got pretty busy The normal speed limit is  mph for cars and  mph for big truckssemis so cars usually go anywhere around  It got so busy that all of traffic was going the same speed There are two lanes that you can drive in the fastleft lane or the slowright lane The semi drivers stayed in the slow lane which was nice because when traffic did start to pick up nobody had to get held up in the left laneNow I had been driving in the fast lane for the last twenty or so minutes following a pickup truck no big deal I give them lots of space because tailgating is dangerous The white car wc behind me was kind of close to me but not too close they left about one car length of space between us Well I look up in my rearview mirror in time to see some jerk driver jd get into the slow lane and speed up and dangerously cut off wc I say dangerous because if they had stayed in the slow lane they would have rear ended the big semi in front of them and if they had gotten in front of wc any sooner it would have been a big accident There was from what I could see about only a few inches between the jd and both the wc and semi Now this jd is tailgating me so bad that when traffic slowed down again I honestly thought they were going to hit meI know that jd is just waiting for enough space in the slow lane to be able to pull around me When that opening happens he of course pulls into the slow lane Well at this point Im pissed I hate it when people think they can drive recklessly just to get ONE car ahead Seriously in the next  minutes the road will turn from two lanes to four So when he gets into the slow lane and starts to speed up I speed up with him He sees me and tries to go faster He only had enough time to go around just me if I was going to stay at the same speed that is so when I sped up he wasnt able to The car behind me sees what I have done and they speed up so he cant get back in front of them So this guy gets stuck behind the next semi I look back in the rear view mirror and notice that there were at least five more cars in the fast lane that hes going to have to wait for because now hes going to slowly to gain the momentum he needs to get into the fast laneThis is why I drive in the fast lane and dont try to wrestle to be one car ahead It usually just turns out to be faster and safer to just stay where you are unless youre holding up traffic,Dont drive recklessly,117.0,pettyrevenge,new

Prestidigitalization,13.0,12.0,1nmeg9,56.0,This is incredibly long and I apologize for thatI work as a manager in training at a somewhat local grocery store There are  levels of employees Customer Assistant Team Lead Assistant Store Manager and Store Manager Im inbetween a Customer Assistant CA and Team Lead TL basically Im a CA so I cant actually do anything but Im training to be a TL so Im in the know about everything that goes on in management Our Store Manager SM has a stupid idea about how the spreading of information works he tells the Assistant Store Manager ASM or ONE TL very important vital information and expects it to be passed on to every single worker both on and off the clock within a few hours Needless to say this doesnt happenEver since I started my training four months ago Ive had the displeasure to discover that our SM will regularly send group text messages to all of the TLs and myself because Im inbetween and need to get used to it at five in the morning bitching about how such and such wasnt done right An example is at  one morning we all received a picture message of our meat section with the message I thought we talked about this No more than  high or am I missing something Also why would we put  product racks in front of the end cap Half of us hadnt worked the day before most of us hadnt been part of the we and he expected a response from everyoneI know it probably doesnt seem that bad but getting a text like that every other day at  in the morning really starts to get on a persons nerves especially when it isnt balanced with texts like We got waste down yesterday Great job guys or We made over  yesterday Woo We always get negative texts about how we fucked up but never any positive texts even if we work our asses off with two people calling out of their shifts and still managing to get everything done by close which has happened I digressThe one unique thing about my store is that we mark items down to a lower price if they are a day away from expiring that way we have a greater chance of selling it My store manager changes the way we do these markdowns both in order and in percentage on a nearweekly basis so its a little bit difficult to keep up especially because he will tell one person a new policy change and expect that it gets around One week after a ton of bickering with everyone SM had the ASM write up a Markdown Sheet that basically told us what when and how much That was all peachy for about a week until word of more changes started getting aroundA month after this initial sheet was handed out all of us had written and rewritten notes all over our personal copies in order to try and keep up with the constant changes I would upload a picture for you guys but it is a storespecific document and I am the only inbetween person at my store so I cant risk it Suffice to say that it was at least  original document  handwritten changes So one morning at am when I was snuggled up in bed with my boyfriend I work the closing shift so I normally sleep till am or noon I get a group message from SMgtCan all of you tell me what we decided on the egg markdowns I need a response from everyoneI was and am sick and tired of the earlymorning texts so I ignored it Eventually a TL answered the question incorrectly this is important but SM said it was absolutely correct so why are we so off our waste budget I ignore this and go into work later that afternoon for my shift This is where it gets interestingI talked with the TL on duty that night about what had happened and we decided that it would be beneficial to get a new printout of the markdown guidelines The TL decided he would ask since he had more power as an official TL He wrote back to the SM in the group conversationgtI think it would help if we got another set of guidelines printed out and then they dont change It can be difficult to remember everything when it is all constantly changingThe SM respondedgt Well that sheet hasnt changed except changes that u guys wanted for percentages so there no reason it shouldnt be done Those are just excuses and really at the end of the day wont help our bonusThe bonus he was referring to is the bonus that the Store Manager and the Store Manager only gets if our Markdown sale numbers are within a certain range Somewhat irked that his bonus was now the main concern we then sent the SM a copy of my horribly abused Markdown Sheet to help explain the changes we are referring to and he responded withgt I dont know what youre trying to prove but most of those notes dont even make sense to me I dont know how long I am going to tolerate your guys lack of respect anymoreHe then sends another text to the TL telling him that even if the TL wasnt being disrespectful he had to act like a dick in the group message or else the rest of the team wouldnt respect him as a Store Manager because he wouldnt be sticking up for himself Exact Words So TL and I are pissed Like beyond pissedIn the meantime the ASM sends us all a separate group message asking us how long he is going to have to hold our hands why didnt we ask questions if we had them in the first place and why was I an inbetween the only person smart enough to take notes I decided to break away with this conversation and texted him back that everyone else had notes too and they were all different We were just showing an example of what we were talking about I then went on to explain that we were only requesting a new Markdown Sheet so that we would all be on the same page I said this politely calmly and phrased as since you always say to come to you with questions and problems this is a problem Im seeing However his response wasgtWe do have paper at the store You really cant rewrite what you need to do on a new piece of paper SeriouslyBoth the TL and I stopped talking to our SM and ASM and we devised a plan The TL would do both our jobs which hes managed to do before when people called out and I would take as much time as needed to write up a brandnew copy of the Markdown Sheet I spent hours on that puppy and eventually had a packet of information checklists todo sheets You name it I made it And printed it And printed it And printed it Oh and remember how I mentioned that in response to the original text a TL had answered the question about egg markdowns incorrectly Well I made certain to put that misinformation in the packet since you know the SM said it was right Anyway I stuck the stack of packets in the break room with a sign stating that this was in no way official that the information may be inaccurate and to direct all questions about it to the SM and ASMThese two have a spine over texts but not in real life so they just ignored the pile of packets Occasionally theyd move them to a different location in the break room Regardless the packets started disappearing one by one All the TLs took them Even the CAs took them In fact the only thing left in the break room now is the sign I posted over the original stack I received compliments from all the TLs in front of the SM and ASM about how helpful it was and how awesome it was for me to help everyone get on the same page like that even though I was just a lowestlevel employee The SM and ASMs faces when they kept hearing that over and over it felt goodThe best part is about two days ago the SM bitched to the TL who originally helped me out that my packet explained the dairy procedures wrong However I decided that Im not changing a goddamn thing until the SM tells me to my face that the Markdown Packet that I created for the entire team has some incorrect information in it To which I will reply that I will be more than happy to email him the original Word DocumentsHell never do it though FuckerSo

when I asked for one and only ever giving me one  minute break during any given shift whether it be five hours or nine a clear violation of California State law And also quitting the second I get a new job by not coming into work Ive already told the TLs this plan and theyre more than happy to pick up a couple extra hours of work to see the SM and ASM squirmTLDR manager is a douche about

Antigon,232.0,1617.0,1nmb5m,2497.0,So a friend of mine well call him Daniel is deaf and has been his whole life Daniel was fired from his job by a manager that openly mocked him for being deaf So when he needed to go to the unemployment office he asked me to go with him because I have been trying to learn sign language and we can communicate pretty well We get there and theres only us and a very elderly old man EM sitting in the waiting area All of the chairs are set up so that we are facing the only receptionist in the room There seems to be some sort of issue with EMs paperwork so every few minutes EM would walk up to answer a question of the receptionists or to sign what she asked him to sign and then he would sit back down Daniel being the sweet guy he is would reach forward and hold the mans chair every time he went to sit back down So me and Daniel are signing back and forth just shooting the shit when a few other people come in including a very loud obnoxious white trash couple Now as I previously stated I am just learning sign language so I was concentrating on what I was signing and understanding what Daniel was signing so at first I didnt notice white trash couple plop down in the seats behind us Then I heard it derrr derrr Im a deafiederr I glance behind me without moving my head and in my peripheral vision I can see white trash male mocking Daniel and imitating the noises that Daniel makes when he laughs or gets into a story White Trash bitch apparently thinks this is hilarious I realize that because I am super concentrating I havent said anything or given them any idea that I am not deaf  I take a look at the receptionist who looks mortified but seems not to know what to do Now nothing would have made me happier than to cause a huge scene but I knew Daniel was already self conscious about getting fired so I did the next best thing I waited until EM went to sit down again Daniel reached forward to hold his chair I spun around in my chair looked white trashy  amp  and yelled as loud as I could WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR PROBLEM White Trash douches jaw drops in shock and the bitch went white as a sheet I just stared at them Daniel suddenly realizes I am looking at the white trash couple and signs Whats wrong I told him they kicked my chair He signs Asshole and glares at them I guess they felt uncomfortable enough that they decided to slink out of the building Fuck you and your unemployment check  Edit  Concerning the amount of posts regarding legal action against Daniels workplace At the time Daniel couldnt prove that he had been fired for his disability The Manager claimed it was for him being lazy and tried to say that Daniel had drawn a penis on the white board in the back that he sometimes used to communicate which he hadnt So Daniel went for unemployment while his friends back at his job pulled some strings I want to get Daniel to post his revenge story for getting his job back bc I dont think I could do it justice Its pretty greatThanks for the great responses Edit  Omigosh Reddit Gold Thank you so much ,I can hear you Asshole,4114.0,pettyrevenge,new

Otadiz,20.0,22.0,1nh6tl,59.0,Oh do I have a revenge story for you Reddit but first I need to dive into some back story so it all makes sense the reasoning for my revenge  Originally it was just between my friend and his boss but later involved me which was a big mistake and I am not a man to be fucked withSo my friend and his boss had known each other for  some odd years and throughout this time all the boss ever did was ask my friend for translating help  See this BOSS is actually a foreign rich man who was sent over here to learn English and better himself in good ol AmericaHe has money LOTS of money so he thinks he can be a douche and get away with it not happening Pokey but more on that later  So Bossman contacts my friend and offers him a job in another state from where he currently was  It has better pay work conditions and hes going to be a manager  Uh Yah sign us up  The one condition was that the business plan would have to approved for franchising  My friend wrote the plan and it was approved  Venture Capitalism here we goEverything is going well and pay is good   a week actually an agreement for a vehicle and monthly payments and its just a positive situation for all involved  However months go by and Bossman changes he starts to overwork my friend  My friend tells him that he needs to go easy on him and give him some breaks but he doesnt listen  My friend has a stroke and gets hospitalized for a weekWe lose our apartment and end up in a shithole We ended up stuck for  years while trying to rebuild our lives  But it doesnt end there in response to my friend being overworked Bossman cuts his hours his pay and his title  He went from wk salary to hr and barely  hrs a week and was henceforth known as a GLORIFIED CASHIER  He could no longer afford to make those car payments and Bossman knew it he said nothing he let him keep using the carThroughout the next  years my friend put up with harassment in various forms for orientation age and health  He was mocked and ridiculed called stupid overworked and treated like crap  His checks were also garnished for items that were brokenstolen on his shift that he is not responsible forMy friend even wrote a SECOND business plan for another store to be franchised for Bossman which was ALSO approvedAfter the  year period my friend gets a challenge from Bossman to find a new job but that he couldnt because he was too old and stupid  Little did Bossman know but that my friend was given a personal recommendation by the police captain of the city and from this recommendation got a new jobWhen Bossman found out he was FURIOUS  He could no longer dictate my friends income level to make he and I suffer nor could he boss him around  They had an agreement to have him work a schedule between the two stores until transfer period had taken hold but as expected Bossman broke it and promptly fired my friend illegally might I addRemember that car Well now Bossman wants it back and is being a jerk about it tries to get the police involved but its not stolen because he entered into an agreement with us and under the law its not stolen  This makes Bossman even ANGRIER  He threatens to come and get the car and take no prisoners  He cant find us we moved and didnt tell him the new address  After a week of ranting he shuts up and goes away for a bitMy friends SSI finaly came in and Bossman wanted to strike a deal about payments on the car however given the past experience and all other broken promises I tell my friend that it would be VERY unwise to trust him any farther and just hold out until we can get a newer better vehicleFast forward a few months and we finally get a new car so Bossman can have his piece of shit back and we can FINALLY be done with him  My friend was just going to drive the car back to him he lives  some odd minutes away from us  I told my friend nah I have a better ideaNow we get to the good part the revenge Bossman lives some  odd minutes away Bossman REALLY wants his car back because hes pissed off he can no longer boss my friend around and dictate his income  He has control issues for some odd reason probably because hes one of those rich assholes Theres an abandoned parking lot a few miles away from our home The tags arent current on the carThe idea is bornI tell my friend to park his car in the abandoned lot lock it drain the gas and drop the key behind one of the tires  I will then text the GPS COORDINATES not the address to Bossman and tell him where he can pick up his car  I told him that he needs to hurry before it is towedstolen he will have to put gas in it and that the key is behind one of the tiresBossman is even more pissed doesnt understand why would we do this says that he is going to have a talk with us in the morning about it face to face  I told him You step  foot on my doorstep I will have you arrested and hauled away for trespassing  He tells me he doesnt understand GPS  I told him to drop it in Google he gets frustrated  I tell him Not my problem and perhaps you should have treated my friend with more respect and not been a dickbag  I also told him You are lucky we do not sue your ass into the ground and take that store out from under you  You might be able to get away with that shit in your country but this is America and that is illegal bub and as far as Im concerned Im letting you off easyBossman never showed upThe car is goneBossman wont answer my texts anymoreThat is my revenge story Reddit  Tell me what you thought in the comments below,So you want your car back do you

lostsocrates,6.0,27.0,1nf2m8,66.0,So the video store near my house has a handicapped space in front of it just like most others do  When I went up there tonight some dildo in a rust bucket had parked not only IN the spot but ACROSS it  Now from time to time Ive seen people pull up in the spot jump out to drop a movie in the box and then go on their way and while that annoys me it doesnt warrant revenge but this dildo this piece of suburbanite white trash deserved everything they had coming to them  On to the revenge   I reached into my glovebox and found a piece of paper and a pen and left a nice little note that said something along the lines of you arent handicapped but if youd like to be it can be arranged  I snuck up to the car and slipped it under the windshield wiper and then went to my car to wait   I was about  spots away from the car and so I knew I would get to see that oh shit face when the idiot came out    minutes later I was surprised to see not one but TWO pieces of toothless hillbilly byproducts of cousin banging come strolling out the door   The woman saw the note first and grabbed it and read it and when she did her eyes got big and her jaw dropped   She gave the note to her boyfriend who read it and then started looking around the lot screaming and yelling about whos ass he was gonna kick After about  seconds of stomping around the two possum fed morons jumped back into their car and sped off   But I wasnt done there   I pulled out behind them and followed them from a distance just for shits and giggles  About  miles down the road they stopped at Kroger  Im assuming it was for Spam grits and Busch Light   Once they were well inside the store I wrote another note that saidWatching you stomp around like an ogre brought a smile to my face I hope your dog dies on your birthday  Have a good night I was going to stick around for a reaction but I was already running behind but just picturing this slack jawed yokel losing his mind has kept me smiling for the last  hours Seriously kids handicapped spots are for the people who really need them  I understand the temptation I understand the convenience and I even understand the argument that many people who use them arent justified but when those people who do have a rough time actually need that spot it makes all the difference   Now you know and knowing is half the battle ,Park in a handicapped spot Welcome to your bad time,93.0,pettyrevenge,new

RadicalChic,179.0,567.0,1ne9m5,1660.0,I work at an upscale restaurant that is half bar Last night a group of pretty well dressed women in their thirties strolled in about  and demanded a food menu When I explained that our kitchen closes at midnight one of them angrily pointed at another table and screeched Well THEY have food When I tell them that that particular table ordered their food twenty minutes prior and that is why they in fact have food on their table she waved me away telling me to ask the kitchen what they can doThe kitchen relents and the ladies get a hummus I set it down and they descend upon it nary a thank you They dont order anything else and I keep enough of an eye on them to make sure they are taken care of without me actually having to interact with them more than I have to The last time I check up on them asking if they need anything I get a curt no Five minutes later theyre gone My annoyance turns to glee when I go to clear the table One of them has left behind her iPhone I drop it into my apron and walk up to a guy that I saw chatting them up earlier and ask if he knew them He tells me no that they were horrendously bitchy and that he got the fuck out of that situation as soon as possible I tell him my experience with them and he asks how much their bill was it was  He then shoves  into my hand telling me hell cover it and I can keep the rest I try to refuse it since it wasnt his fault that they walked out but he insistsI go to the office and explain the situation to my manager who is as pissed off as I am When one of the womans friends calls the phone my manger answers it up and tells her that she is welcome to come by to pick up the phone and pay her tab otherwise she will have to wait until Monday at  PM to get it were closed on Sunday If it had been any other customer we would have worked something out to get her phone to her earlier but fuck herWell apparently this woman has a friend who knows one of our bartenders This friend calls our bartender who Im fairly close with and knew about the situation asking if he could bring the phone to her on Sunday He tells her no that the woman skipped out on her bill and will need to personally come in to get her phone The woman never came in that nightSo basically this woman will have to come back into the restaurant she essentially stole from is going to be without her phone until tomorrow and looked like a complete twat in front her friend in the process Bet you wish you paid that  tab now bitchUPDATE The bartender relented and brought the woman her phone on Sunday night on the condition that she pay her tab According to him she was a huge entitled bitch who just shoved a  at him and didnt apologize for skipping out on the bill And yes I could have thrown the phone away but I felt like that was a bit much I think the inconvenience of having to go nearly  hours without her phone and the embarrassment of acting like a complete shithead was punishment enough,Skip out on your bill Probably shouldnt leave your phone behind,2227.0,pettyrevenge,new
