javastripped,81,,101,1rhfdo,,477,"This happened a few years ago.

My GF and I are car shopping for a Nissan.... it's about $35k... 

We're going back and forth and she steps away and he says some crude shit about my GF:

""Is that your GF? If that was my GF I'd bang the fuck out of her!""

... and other just really fucking crude shit.

It all happened so fast it was like a fucking drive by.

So I'm fucking PISSED at this guy... now... but my GF is back and I don't want to make a scene.

So I say... ""baby, why not get this $95K GT-R instead...""

Well his eyes light up.

I tell him to give me a test drive.  Super fucking fun.  NICE car.. super fast.

I fake argue with my GF (but she lets me have the car - it's my money).

I tell him it's a done deal.  Don't even haggle really... just tell him I want some options thrown in and he's good.

Guy's thinking ""cha ching""... I tell him to draw up the paperwork and we'll be right back to finalize.

... the GF and I just leave the dealership and drive off.

No sale for you motherfucker.

We ended up buying a regular Nissan sedan at another dealership closer to home.",Make cheap comments about my girlfriend? No sale for you!,578,pettyrevenge
LovesEwoks,72,,67,1ri9iq,,385,"I have a recipe that my (now deceased) grandmother had always used for a potato dish. Over the years, I perfected this recipe, experimenting with ingredients and seasonings, creating a nearly perfect dish. (it's always a hit at parties, dinners, and gatherings)
After I was married, I brought this potato dish to one of my spouse's family gatherings. People raved, and immediately requested I bring it to every gathering.  I am happy to oblige, since the dish is inexpensive to make and very quick and easy to put together. The potato dish quickly becomes known as ""LovesEwoks Potatoes"" (well, my actual name, not screen name, Although, I always refer to them as ""my grandmothers potatoes"")

Over the next few years, I bring these potatoes to every family function and every holiday. (mostly by request) I share this recipe many times with my spouse's family, every aunt, uncle, cousin, and sibling who asks. I even give some tips for best results.

A week before Thanksgiving, my sister-in-law calls me, explaining she wants to take the potatoes to her in-laws house, and asks for specifics on the recipe. (the exact brands of products I use, where I purchased the pan, etc) I go into great detail, giving her step by step instructions for perfect results.

A few days later, my mother-in-law calls me, asking what dish I planned on bringing to the extended family gathering. ""Oh, I thought I would bring the potatoes?"" She informs me that my sister-in-law, Kelly, is bringing potatoes, and I should bring something else. This is not a problem for me, since I have a collection of exceptional recipes from my grandmother.

We gather for Thanksgiving, and in walks Kelly with her potato dish. She removes the cover, and it's funny, because it looks exactly like the dish I always bring. I had just assumed she was going to bring something else. Nope, exact same recipe, exact same pan. She walks around telling everyone ""you MUST try Kelly's potatoes!"" 
At first I thought this might have been a joke, so I let it go. (this is not the first time she has acted very jealous, and did things for attention. In the past, she had made comments about not liking the potatoes to family members who complimented my cooking skills)

Christmas gathering, same situation. I decide to ignore it, and let her have ""Kelly's potatoes"" - just not worth dealing with her. I had brought along a dessert, again people raved, and requested I bring it again, at Easter. (thanks grandma!) It seems I might have a new ""signature dish."" 

My sister-in-law calls me a few days before Easter, asking for the dessert recipe I brought at Christmas. (can you believe it?) I give her the recipe, except this time, I leave out a very small, but critically important ingredient. 

Easter gathering. I bring my the dessert, as requested by the host. Just as I suspected, in walks Kelly with the exact same dessert. I was actually starting to feel a bit guilty, until she said, ""everyone must try this, I found the recipe on pinterest..."" Needless to say, they were terrible.

squirrelboy31,7,,15,1rhb3g,,22,"I live in a pretty scummy college house with 7 other guys. It isn't nice, but when it is clean it can almost feel like home.

Unfortunately one of my roommates, let's call him LB (for Lazy Bum), as his name suggests, is incredibly lazy. He doesn't accept any responsibility for the mess he contributes to the house.

Among many other offenses he produces more dirty dishes than the rest of the house combined. What I find even more irksome is that LB regularly complains about the mess in the kitchen. ""Hey, somebody's got to do the dishes."" They're all HIS! I told him flat out, but he refused to do them.

I usually use my own dishes. (I have 1 plate, 1 spoon, 1 fork, and 1 bowl. I use my pocket knife and drink out of the bottle so I don't need a knife or cup.) I wash each as soon as I am done eating. I can't stand dirty dishes.

So, for the petty revenge: muwhahahaha! 

I began planning how to exact my revenge a few months ago. I bought a large plastic container and a gallon of bleach from Walmart (I totally looked like a serial killer!) I took them go the full sinks and proceeded to place every dish into the plastic bin while LB watched. I could tell he didn't like this at all, but he couldn't say anything because he knew they were all his.

Unfortunately this didn't stop him from doing it again. After one of my other roommates washed all of LB's dishes he began to fill the sink again.

Tonight it shall end. I used my plastic bin &amp; bleach trick again, but this time I took one of his ceramic bowls with me in my car. I had to drive on the interstate to get to work, and on my way I rolled down the window at 75mph. It didn't matter that it was 15 degrees F. I took the bowl, threw it out the window, and watched it shatter into a thousand pieces. That was one of the most satisfying things I have seen. I will continue doing this until he has no dishes to fill the sink with.

LovesEwoks,72,,67,1ri9iq,,385,"I have a recipe that my (now deceased) grandmother had always used for a potato dish. Over the years, I perfected this recipe, experimenting with ingredients and seasonings, creating a nearly perfect dish. (it's always a hit at parties, dinners, and gatherings)
After I was married, I brought this potato dish to one of my spouse's family gatherings. People raved, and immediately requested I bring it to every gathering.  I am happy to oblige, since the dish is inexpensive to make and very quick and easy to put together. The potato dish quickly becomes known as ""LovesEwoks Potatoes"" (well, my actual name, not screen name, Although, I always refer to them as ""my grandmothers potatoes"")

Over the next few years, I bring these potatoes to every family function and every holiday. (mostly by request) I share this recipe many times with my spouse's family, every aunt, uncle, cousin, and sibling who asks. I even give some tips for best results.

A week before Thanksgiving, my sister-in-law calls me, explaining she wants to take the potatoes to her in-laws house, and asks for specifics on the recipe. (the exact brands of products I use, where I purchased the pan, etc) I go into great detail, giving her step by step instructions for perfect results.

A few days later, my mother-in-law calls me, asking what dish I planned on bringing to the extended family gathering. ""Oh, I thought I would bring the potatoes?"" She informs me that my sister-in-law, Kelly, is bringing potatoes, and I should bring something else. This is not a problem for me, since I have a collection of exceptional recipes from my grandmother.

We gather for Thanksgiving, and in walks Kelly with her potato dish. She removes the cover, and it's funny, because it looks exactly like the dish I always bring. I had just assumed she was going to bring something else. Nope, exact same recipe, exact same pan. She walks around telling everyone ""you MUST try Kelly's potatoes!"" 
At first I thought this might have been a joke, so I let it go. (this is not the first time she has acted very jealous, and did things for attention. In the past, she had made comments about not liking the potatoes to family members who complimented my cooking skills)

Christmas gathering, same situation. I decide to ignore it, and let her have ""Kelly's potatoes"" - just not worth dealing with her. I had brought along a dessert, again people raved, and requested I bring it again, at Easter. (thanks grandma!) It seems I might have a new ""signature dish."" 

My sister-in-law calls me a few days before Easter, asking for the dessert recipe I brought at Christmas. (can you believe it?) I give her the recipe, except this time, I leave out a very small, but critically important ingredient. 

Easter gathering. I bring my the dessert, as requested by the host. Just as I suspected, in walks Kelly with the exact same dessert. I was actually starting to feel a bit guilty, until she said, ""everyone must try this, I found the recipe on pinterest..."" Needless to say, they were terrible.

So, for the petty revenge: muwhahahaha! 

I began planning how to exact my revenge a few months ago. I bought a large plastic container and a gallon of bleach from Walmart (I totally looked like a serial killer!) I took them go the full sinks and proceeded to place every dish into the plastic bin while LB watched. I could tell he didn't like this at all, but he couldn't say anything because he knew they were all his.

Unfortunately this didn't stop him from doing it again. After one of my other roommates washed all of LB's dishes he began to fill the sink again.

Tonight it shall end. I used my plastic bin &amp; bleach trick again, but this time I took one of his ceramic bowls with me in my car. I had to drive on the interstate to get to work, and on my way I rolled down the window at 75mph. It didn't matter that it was 15 degrees F. I took the bowl, threw it out the window, and watched it shatter into a thousand pieces. That was one of the most satisfying things I have seen. I will continue doing this until he has no dishes to fill the sink with.

LovesEwoks,72,,67,1ri9iq,,385,"I have a recipe that my (now deceased) grandmother had always used for a potato dish. Over the years, I perfected this recipe, experimenting with ingredients and seasonings, creating a nearly perfect dish. (it's always a hit at parties, dinners, and gatherings)
After I was married, I brought this potato dish to one of my spouse's family gatherings. People raved, and immediately requested I bring it to every gathering.  I am happy to oblige, since the dish is inexpensive to make and very quick and easy to put together. The potato dish quickly becomes known as ""LovesEwoks Potatoes"" (well, my actual name, not screen name, Although, I always refer to them as ""my grandmothers potatoes"")

Over the next few years, I bring these potatoes to every family function and every holiday. (mostly by request) I share this recipe many times with my spouse's family, every aunt, uncle, cousin, and sibling who asks. I even give some tips for best results.

A week before Thanksgiving, my sister-in-law calls me, explaining she wants to take the potatoes to her in-laws house, and asks for specifics on the recipe. (the exact brands of products I use, where I purchased the pan, etc) I go into great detail, giving her step by step instructions for perfect results.

A few days later, my mother-in-law calls me, asking what dish I planned on bringing to the extended family gathering. ""Oh, I thought I would bring the potatoes?"" She informs me that my sister-in-law, Kelly, is bringing potatoes, and I should bring something else. This is not a problem for me, since I have a collection of exceptional recipes from my grandmother.

We gather for Thanksgiving, and in walks Kelly with her potato dish. She removes the cover, and it's funny, because it looks exactly like the dish I always bring. I had just assumed she was going to bring something else. Nope, exact same recipe, exact same pan. She walks around telling everyone ""you MUST try Kelly's potatoes!"" 
At first I thought this might have been a joke, so I let it go. (this is not the first time she has acted very jealous, and did things for attention. In the past, she had made comments about not liking the potatoes to family members who complimented my cooking skills)

Christmas gathering, same situation. I decide to ignore it, and let her have ""Kelly's potatoes"" - just not worth dealing with her. I had brought along a dessert, again people raved, and requested I bring it again, at Easter. (thanks grandma!) It seems I might have a new ""signature dish."" 

My sister-in-law calls me a few days before Easter, asking for the dessert recipe I brought at Christmas. (can you believe it?) I give her the recipe, except this time, I leave out a very small, but critically important ingredient. 

Easter gathering. I bring my the dessert, as requested by the host. Just as I suspected, in walks Kelly with the exact same dessert. I was actually starting to feel a bit guilty, until she said, ""everyone must try this, I found the recipe on pinterest..."" Needless to say, they were terrible.

squirrelboy31,7,,15,1rhb3g,,22,"I live in a pretty scummy college house with 7 other guys. It isn't nice, but when it is clean it can almost feel like home.

Unfortunately one of my roommates, let's call him LB (for Lazy Bum), as his name suggests, is incredibly lazy. He doesn't accept any responsibility for the mess he contributes to the house.

Among many other offenses he produces more dirty dishes than the rest of the house combined. What I find even more irksome is that LB regularly complains about the mess in the kitchen. ""Hey, somebody's got to do the dishes."" They're all HIS! I told him flat out, but he refused to do them.

I usually use my own dishes. (I have 1 plate, 1 spoon, 1 fork, and 1 bowl. I use my pocket knife and drink out of the bottle so I don't need a knife or cup.) I wash each as soon as I am done eating. I can't stand dirty dishes.

So, for the petty revenge: muwhahahaha! 

I began planning how to exact my revenge a few months ago. I bought a large plastic container and a gallon of bleach from Walmart (I totally looked like a serial killer!) I took them go the full sinks and proceeded to place every dish into the plastic bin while LB watched. I could tell he didn't like this at all, but he couldn't say anything because he knew they were all his.

Unfortunately this didn't stop him from doing it again. After one of my other roommates washed all of LB's dishes he began to fill the sink again.

Tonight it shall end. I used my plastic bin &amp; bleach trick again, but this time I took one of his ceramic bowls with me in my car. I had to drive on the interstate to get to work, and on my way I rolled down the window at 75mph. It didn't matter that it was 15 degrees F. I took the bowl, threw it out the window, and watched it shatter into a thousand pieces. That was one of the most satisfying things I have seen. I will continue doing this until he has no dishes to fill the sink with.

YourFederalOverlord,52,,217,1rg4z6,,812,"When I was in middle school, many years ago, I had a Digital Arts teacher who's job it was to teach us about computers and how to use them correctly.  She did not do that at all, instead opting to give us the same typing routines several times over and call it a class.  She was also obsessed with the Philadelphia Phillies, so she was immensely pleased when they made it to the World Series one year (this being back in 2008).  She attempted to get tickets but the website was overloaded so instead she did the logical thing and forced her classes to get them for her, telling us all to reload the page until it came back online so that she could get her tickets.  Failure to comply would mean no credit for the day as well as a black mark on our record.  

I wasn't pleased by this so I, having figured out her administrator's password a few days earlier, (she had it on a sticky note on her desk like a chump) surreptitiously logged into the system and added the tickets page to the list of blocked websites before changing her password to '1234', logging out and feigning shock at the sudden block to the page.  

It took her almost a week to figure out how to unblock the page (though the school did figure out the password pretty quickly) and she never did end up going to the World Series.

javastripped,81,,96,1rhfdo,,483,"This happened a few years ago.

My GF and I are car shopping for a Nissan.... it's about $35k... 

We're going back and forth and she steps away and he says some crude shit about my GF:

""Is that your GF? If that was my GF I'd bang the fuck out of her!""

... and other just really fucking crude shit.

It all happened so fast it was like a fucking drive by.

So I'm fucking PISSED at this guy... now... but my GF is back and I don't want to make a scene.

So I say... ""baby, why not get this $95K GT-R instead...""

Well his eyes light up.

I tell him to give me a test drive.  Super fucking fun.  NICE car.. super fast.

I fake argue with my GF (but she lets me have the car - it's my money).

I tell him it's a done deal.  Don't even haggle really... just tell him I want some options thrown in and he's good.

Guy's thinking ""cha ching""... I tell him to draw up the paperwork and we'll be right back to finalize.

... the GF and I just leave the dealership and drive off.

No sale for you motherfucker.

We ended up buying a regular Nissan sedan at another dealership closer to home.",Make cheap comments about my girlfriend? No sale for you!,579,pettyrevenge
LovesEwoks,72,,67,1ri9iq,,385,"I have a recipe that my (now deceased) grandmother had always used for a potato dish. Over the years, I perfected this recipe, experimenting with ingredients and seasonings, creating a nearly perfect dish. (it's always a hit at parties, dinners, and gatherings)
After I was married, I brought this potato dish to one of my spouse's family gatherings. People raved, and immediately requested I bring it to every gathering.  I am happy to oblige, since the dish is inexpensive to make and very quick and easy to put together. The potato dish quickly becomes known as ""LovesEwoks Potatoes"" (well, my actual name, not screen name, Although, I always refer to them as ""my grandmothers potatoes"")

Over the next few years, I bring these potatoes to every family function and every holiday. (mostly by request) I share this recipe many times with my spouse's family, every aunt, uncle, cousin, and sibling who asks. I even give some tips for best results.

A week before Thanksgiving, my sister-in-law calls me, explaining she wants to take the potatoes to her in-laws house, and asks for specifics on the recipe. (the exact brands of products I use, where I purchased the pan, etc) I go into great detail, giving her step by step instructions for perfect results.

A few days later, my mother-in-law calls me, asking what dish I planned on bringing to the extended family gathering. ""Oh, I thought I would bring the potatoes?"" She informs me that my sister-in-law, Kelly, is bringing potatoes, and I should bring something else. This is not a problem for me, since I have a collection of exceptional recipes from my grandmother.

We gather for Thanksgiving, and in walks Kelly with her potato dish. She removes the cover, and it's funny, because it looks exactly like the dish I always bring. I had just assumed she was going to bring something else. Nope, exact same recipe, exact same pan. She walks around telling everyone ""you MUST try Kelly's potatoes!"" 
At first I thought this might have been a joke, so I let it go. (this is not the first time she has acted very jealous, and did things for attention. In the past, she had made comments about not liking the potatoes to family members who complimented my cooking skills)

Christmas gathering, same situation. I decide to ignore it, and let her have ""Kelly's potatoes"" - just not worth dealing with her. I had brought along a dessert, again people raved, and requested I bring it again, at Easter. (thanks grandma!) It seems I might have a new ""signature dish."" 

My sister-in-law calls me a few days before Easter, asking for the dessert recipe I brought at Christmas. (can you believe it?) I give her the recipe, except this time, I leave out a very small, but critically important ingredient. 

Easter gathering. I bring my the dessert, as requested by the host. Just as I suspected, in walks Kelly with the exact same dessert. I was actually starting to feel a bit guilty, until she said, ""everyone must try this, I found the recipe on pinterest..."" Needless to say, they were terrible.

godzirrrraaa,16,,18,1rh8ro,,62,"I work at Costco and it is incredibly crazy there, especially with the holidays.  Most people are on their best behavior when it's time to check out.  I do my best to make sure they found everything and we take care of them as quickly and painlessly as possible.  

And then there's these assholes, the ones who had to take this **SUPER IMPORTANT** phone call that's usually some bullshit.  Now I'm no saint, I've taken a call while in line with a cashier if it was truly important.  But when I do my attention is first on the cashier and second on the call.  If it's just a friend or family member, I'll tell them to hold on for a minute, or I hang up and call back.


But *these people* put their phone call first, basically ignore me and make no eye contact.  I'm just a door mat to them getting all of their worthless shit.  I hope you choke on your jalapeno poppers.


My petty revenge on these people is I talk extraordinarily loud, over their conversations.  I intentionally mess up their train of thought.  After a minute or two of this they either get it and hang up the phone. or they're so flustered they're babbling and sounding like a complete moron.
