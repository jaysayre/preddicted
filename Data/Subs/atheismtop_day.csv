mikevilla,13,2,1rogr9,19,After waking up and getting ready for Turkey day I called my mom and wished her a happy Thanksgiving We talked for a while and talked about how life has been so far which was a cheerful talk When the conversation was over I asked her if Dad was around she said yes and passed the phone over to him      Pausing the story here to explain a few details of the past I came out to my family this past spring which went very well with the exception of my conservative father He did not approve and defended his decision with religious justifications also expected and not surprising Back to the conversation     I start talking with my dad and said happy Thanksgiving to which he responded back happy Thanksgiving as well I ask how theyre all doing up north and he goes into the typical dialog youd expect with a sonfather relationship Later he decides to turn the conversation around and tell me that I need to find the Holy Ghost to rid me of my gay ways All these people coming out thinking its OK but its unnatural son I live across the since country from my family and since the last time I visited them all my dad wanted to do is argue with me about how I need to conform to his way of life Mind you Im  have a very stable career which I am confident in have a happy relationship with my boyfriend and no religion He was not happy with these for some reason and feels the need to drag me down Anyone else have their Thanksgiving shot down    Edit Spacing,1385686218.0,So I tried to wish my father a Happy Thanksgiving,21,atheism,top_day

Michael,9,0,1rprta,9,It is tradition on Thanksgiving every year that one person from the family reads a prayer before dinner and the person who read this year chooses the person the next year My mother read last year and she asked me if I wanted to read it even though she knew I was an atheist Im only  so Im guessing she thinks this is just a phase and that Im being a typical rebellious teenager and the dialogue went something like thisHey do you want to read the prayer this year on Thanksgiving I wanted to ask you even though your denying God at the momentNo thank you mom Im an atheist but if you would like I could write something and read it if you wantThen she sort of stopped and looked at me and saidWait youre not going to write about how there is no God and evolution and stuff are you because your grandmother will have a heart attackI felt sort of insulted that she thought I might try to convert my entire family over Thanksgiving dinner Im aware this is anticlimatic I just wanted to share Her mentioning evolution was especially strange to me because we never grew up in a necessarily religious household we went to church around Christmas and Easter at best I did not expect to hear something like that especially in the progressive state of MassachusettsEdit More insightBefore Thanksgiving I had a conversation about my atheism beforehand with my mom my grandmother and my great aunt so I would not have considered me being an atheist a real bombshell because that was at minimum  months prior but I do believe I am the only family member who defines myself openly as an atheist The funny thing is I had a conversation with my aunt and two uncles about religion during Thanksgiving and I was lent a Bible and a book called Proof of Heaven They did seem more open about it then I would have previously thought though my aunt had past alcohol problems and recently found Jesus To clarify I would not consider my family fundamentalist Christians but religion is definitely a large part of their lives my aunt MAY be an exception she goes to church multiple times a week and is in training to become a minister or whatever the correct title is rest of my family that is not direct goes to church weekly,1385741980.0,Something that puzzled me on Thanksgiving I know Im late,9,atheism,top_day

darthbarracuda,45,2,1ror9x,8,Im an atheist but Im not really sure what I think about Jesus other than that hes not the son of god since there is no godHe did preach some pretty humanistic thingsI dont really see the problem of following what he preached unless people start corrupting itSo who exactly was he Did he even exist Was he a conartist or a schizophrenic or just a hippie who had some crazy followersWhy would his followers die than give up the truth as what apparently happenedThe Gospels are most definitely biased but are there any other sources that talk about him I find it extremely suspicious that Jesus did some miracles that went undocumented except for the Bible and are a little bit of a letdown being from the sogI wish to know others ideas and opinions preferably based upon sources because it is the primary belief of Christians and one of the best ways to shake their belief is to hit it in the core,1385696548.0,Opinion of Jesus,10,atheism,top_day

aaqucnaona,11,0,1rqgkk,7,This never used to be a problem because the issue could always be delayed to an afterlife concern The issue is this  its equally unsettling to me to die or live forever In the first case especially if I am just passing the time browsing something it suddenly hits me that these moments have little value to me but at some point in time they will end for me Even if we somehow manage to stave off aging death is just an accident away And nothing can get past the heat death anyway This all is very abstract but I get this image in my head of closing my eyes and seeing the world for the last time Of moving my last muscle or taking my last breath And no matter what I do how well I take care of myself that moment is coming Even the time taken to write this has only brought me closer to it And then I will not exist No perception no thoughts and nothing Everything that happened good or bad will simply cease to matter All my successes and failings will be for nothing All so that some fucking genes can pass onto to another generation The panic is strong enough to bring to tears and keep me up for the better part of the night This happens every few dozen days regardless of my mood or other activities in my life I dont know what to do where to find solace or a way out of this mental torment Any help or advice on what to do Any similiar experiences to sharePs I know of Dawkins We are going to die and that makes us the lucky ones but I cant get myself to agree Its like asking if its better to give nothing to a child or give it an icecream and then snatch it back,1385762118.0,Its been two years since I lost my faith I still get panic attacks went contemplating my own mortality Any helpadvice,7,atheism,top_day

ZombineTM,9,2,1rpnxt,0,Today in breakfast i was watching a documentary on how much the church in the UK wants to either ban samesex marriage or simply let churches make gay marriages only if they want toThis conversation was amazing on how Jesus told my parents to love me including when i was felt fucking horrible on how i argued with my dad about homophobia where he offered us to counterprotest people outside clinics of changing sexual orientation in my city lots of protests against it btw but then i said that Lev  the shit that most religious nutjobs use to say that gay people arent normal doesnt says for you to create a gaytostraight clinic and make gay people become normal it says for you to kill a person on sight if she is gayBut just look at it with detail dad the bible doesnt says for you to think that homosexuals are confused about life or if the devil is trying to take over their life and that you must help them it says for you to kill them on sight with no warningsSince then he approved that letting gay people die in ACCIDENTS and ILLNESSES ONLY is okay and needed since were in  and lashing and stoning people in public is no longer Normal fucks sake i need to keep my mouth shut sometimesMom said me to change channel because this was disgusting and against the laws of God and Nature i then told her the amazing tales of love and tolerance in the Bible that i ripped of some websites On how women need to wear headscarfs while praying that slavery is perfectly fine that raping women is okay as long as she is not married that women must be quiet in the church and other incredible bible love storiesShe then replied Look i know we had to do these horrible things in the times of Peter and Jesus Noah even had more than  grandsons back then but we now follow what is normal until it is overSo when homosexuality is considered normal in the future we may hate eating prawns and might legalize eating them in some countriesWow mom just wow you just said basically what all our politicians sayHow many of your religious friends or parents say the exact same this and that were just for the times of Jesus it doesnt applies today anymore but this and that applies,1385738286.0,How many of your parents or friends respond to evil Bible teachings with It was just for the times of Jesus it doesnt applies today anymore,2,atheism,top_day

hulbhen,66,14,1rpxdg,0,Id like to start off this post with giving a brief background on my religious views or lack thereof I grew up in a very liberal household who fell into more of a CalvanistLutheranist ideaset As such with the freedom of choice I found myself not to believe in any theistic religions as they are todayHaving said that I subscribed to this subreddit as more of a provision to be a part of this community with a similar mindset and its only been recently that I have spent time really looking through this subreddit and to be frank I see a lot of bashing of religious people mainly Christians While in ideologies I do disagree with much of the Christian faith I think its important not to forget what that specific organized religion has done Namely I think its important not to remember that many local churches hold fundraisers lead disaster relief and provide shelter for the homeless And I do think that thats a very important part of the Christian religion itself as being a wholesome person a good Samaritan if you will is a central part of the religiontldr Im an atheist and see a lot of hate towards religious people on this subreddit while some of its warranted theres a lot of good that I feel like there is a lot of good from organized religions thats being overlookedEDIT I created this post in the hope to have an open discussion on the merits of organized religion that are so often overlooked and overshadowed by the indoctrinating acts of the church but it seems as if there is an overwhelming hatred towards organized religion that people are unable to put aside for even an instant which was the main point of this posting in its origins I would like to reiterate a few keynotes from the few replies I have given out in that I dont think there is more good than harm being done by organized religion but quite the contrary I also dont want these few acts to rationalize the poor decisions made by organized religions And finally I dont think that these few acts of good should be the main focus but they do exist and many people forget thatI personally dont have an existential hatred towards those who believe in organized religion and I find myself to be tolerant in the face of organized religion I wanted to bring an air of tolerance to this seemingly hatefilled subreddit and I suppose in that endeavor I have failed to communicate this to a group of people that are stuck in their mindset Because of that I wont be responding to any more of the comments left on this posting unless its clear that the commentor is willing to cast aside hisher prejudices to have an intellectual conversation on the matterEDIT  Yes I understand my comment is very unpopular That much is clear thanks guys,1385746845.0,As an atheist seeing a lot of bashing Christians on this subreddit,5,atheism,top_day
