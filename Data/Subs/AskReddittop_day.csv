seanj,31,3,1rogvc,9,TLDR Version Im years old and father to a year old boy  I have very little visitation with him and want to be a better parent than Im worried his mother and stepdad are and than my parents were for me but Im afraid I dont know how  Being broke makes figuring this out even harder and more stressful but I dont want to be one of those parents that plants their child in front of TV or video games all the time  What are some lowtono cost ways people engage bond and interact with their children while both educating them and keeping them entertainedAbout Me  Im freshly years old single living in a mediumsized college town in central IL  Im currently unemployed and living with family  My son is years old and in nd gradeAbout Him  I see so much of myself in him  hes so bright and intuitive and he loves stories  He watches TV and plays video games for the story line and character development as much as he does the entertainment  He loves to learn and read but like a lot of kids his age has a bit of a short attention span and gets really frustrated when he hits a mental wall  His current interests include all things super heroes specifically Batman and SpiderMan Star Wars legos and SpongebobMy Worries  The thing is I dont want to be the cause for him falling into the same traps I did developing not innately possessing an introverted nature being satisfied with less and being overwhelmed with the lack of time to explore a world that has so many fascinating aspects  I want to teach him I want to show him things I want to introduce him to the world I want to be as active as I can in his life for as little as I see him and be responsible for his greatness  Im not bitching or putting blame on her but his mother has always been lazy and his stepdad falls in line with anything she wants or does  Im tired of thinking that not having any custody and only a sliver of visitation goes handinhand with having a passive role in his life  When my parents divorced my mother did the same thing to me his is doing now which is to recognize his intelligence and imagination and use that as an excuse to leave him to his own devices  My own father was in prison during the vast majority of my childhood and when my mother remarried my stepdad certainly tried but was kind of a handsoff dad  I want desperately to break that cycle  My son doesnt deserve that life and the future I fear awaits him  Im kind of afraid to admit it but I think I dont know how to be a good active fatherThe Problem  As I mentioned Im currently unemployed I was attending college on the GI Bill but the social isolation I felt due to the age disparity between myself and my fellow students exacerbated my depression  and my counselor said made it harder to help me with treating my PTSD so I dropped out  Additionally the IT training I received in the Marine Corps  and the combat experience itself  makes me overqualified to flip burgers or mop floors but my lack of civilian testing or certification makes me ineligible for any job in my field but I digress  We used to do things like make crafts or play with toys and things I would buy for him for us to do but thats out right nowWe go on walks sometimes he rides his bike we go to the park we watch TV and play video games sometimes I have him play sous chef while I make mealsbut I worry that bores him and I know its not enough  The little money I have from donating plasma goes toward food for the two of us and gas to pick him up drop him off and search for employmentMy Question  FINALLY  Basically what Im hoping for is to glean from Reddit some ideas for lowtono cost activities that he and I can engage in together that will help him learn while keeping him entertained as well  I dont have a lot of possessions after losing my apartment so we cant do many arts amp crafts things  I wish I could take him to the Childrens Museum  Planetarium or anything else that requires an entrance fee but I cant  So are there any good activities that parents or people who have cared for children can recommend for my son and I  Any websites that offer games or activities that could help him excel in school and are also entertaining  Maybe some giveaway sites that offer toys or games for kids his age that I could use to rebuild his toygamebook collectionOur Time TogetherI see him one day each week  he spends the night with me usually Wednesdays and I take him to school the next day  and I have him for  hours every other weekend  His mother and I arrange a yearbyyear policy for major holidays oddnumbered years she takes him for NY EveDay his birthday July th Halloween and Thanksgiving while I have visitation on evennumbered years  She is Wiccan so she has him every Yule in addition to Mothers Day her birthday and the Labor Day weekend  I am an atheist but my family is mostly agnosticChristian so I have him on Christmas in addition to Fathers Day my birthday and Memorial Day,1385686334.0,Reddit I

BoBertBleh,4,1,1rqcqs,6,Did anyone else know other than you What was the aftermathTo make everyone feel comfortable Ill start off with my storyI was like  and I had been at home waiting for my parents to come  Usually my aunt would babysit us when my dad went to pick up my mother My sister and I had been at the table doodling on some paper together Then we hear some tires screech outside followed by yelling this was normal where we lived so we didnt give it too much thought Then we heard our front gate open and the yelling continued into the yard  I went to the bathroom since I had to go  From the outside I can hear my parents at each others throats with my partially crippled aunt trying to be a peacekeeperI walk outside and am met with the screeches of my father  He had this face full of anger disgust disappointment just wrapped into one  He started yelling  Sarah Do you know what your mother and sister did the weekend when you stayed with your grandma I said No daddy  At this point I was shitting bricks and crying since my dad was in my face and spittingHe then shows me this picture of my mother and my sister followed by my mother and some guy with my sister in the middle and then a picture of them kissing with my sister staring blankly into the photo booth camera I started freaking out even more when he started saying FUCKEN LOOK Look at the tramp that your mother is My aunt tried to get between him and I but couldnt  So did my mother She had tears streaming down her face and was saying dont believe him Sarah dont Honestly I was fucken heartbroken I thought when people loved each other they wouldnt do anything bad to one another but I couldnt help think maybe if I had gone with my mother she wouldnt have done anything or maybe she wouldve continued  My dad cut her face out of all our pictures and he would openly tell me my mom was a whore  Still breaks my heart thinking about itFAST FORWARD FOUR YEARS LATERMy mom became faithful to my father again and it was summer She was still working at the same job but had gotten promoted and my dad was still the house husband to his dismay  I will never forget the moment he tried to play it off  The bastard  So I come in to see what my moms doing in her room and I start jumping on the bed and tossing the covers about  Then I find these pair of white thin underwear and I ask mommy whyd you put your undies in the bed  She stopped a moment stared at me and asks what underwear And so I showed them and she said those arent my undies Sarah Go ask your dad So I played messenger and then my father tried to pin the blame on the crippled aunt I have who was ALSO PREGNANT I asked her and she was like what Sarah look at how fat I am I wouldnt even be able to put that over my butt  So I tell my mom  The fighting soon commences and I take my younger siblings outside to my aunts house out of fear  My dad denies it all Then I finally meet the fucken girl at the pool near my house  Shes fucken jailbait Im not sure though and my sisters supposed babysitter  I didnt think anything of it until my dad put his arm around her waist that was the moment I wanted to gouge out their eyesEventually my dad comes clean with the whole thing Turns out the girl was kicked out by her mother and was the neighborhood whore  And she needed a place to stay so my mother the generous woman she is allows her safe haven in our living room  So my sister shared our stuff with her and I gave her pads  We fell asleep okay but I will not forget the scream my mother let out I sat straight up and seen my mom punching My father tried to deny he had sex with the girl since he had blood on his underwear but my mother didnt believe him  My mom didnt notice me watching and she started saying take your whore Leave my house Get the fuck out of my life and leave my children out of this My dad took his fucken thing and left in his van whilst my mom was throwing his clothes into the alley  I wake up to hear my mom making police reports and saying that my father was with a minor in a stolen vanMy dad came in like an hour You know the fucked up thing about it my dad fucken loved that girl more than my mother And he was willing to abandon us for her Eventually some fucken dude who she had fucked before my dad picked her up and left The nasty ass girl gave my sister and I lice my sister had to get her hair chopped off and I went through hell because of that shit  FAST FORWARD NINE YEARS LATERIts today and I recently found out that my mother has been talking to one of her exboyfriends  She had told me at least a year or two ago and I didnt think they continued talking  But apparently they are  I found some messages and honestly Im fucken pissed and betrayed since Im the only one who knows other than her She told me that she was going to go to the gym and she was going to pay me to accompany her  You dont have to fucken pay me  I told her that I didnt trust her  And then she said she was going at night and I agreed to accompany since she didnt know that I knew of her upcoming event  Honestly I think Im going to tell both of them off since I rarely even speak and my mother thinks good of me in every way  Truth is Im her daughter and not her friendSo I will not be standing for this dammitTLDR Mother had affair father had affair and mother has yet to begin her next affairEdit switched question

online troll where I would submit fake promo and Redbox codes like NDBUT HDUY SKYU and etc I noticed reports of scam and underground crime from Craigslist and curiosity got the better of my friend and I on posting a fake wanted ad Now CL charges a fee to minimize this Friend and I each posted an ad for a big movie shooting and our emails got flooded with tons of inquiries We laughed it off and never cared to log back in afterwardsAfter randomly checking some of the email responses out of the hundreds I see one from someone I knowAdam I had a class with Adam and we became somewhat friends but soon after I was left to join the club that have been burned by him He owed me  at the time but always made excuses to not be able to pay me back Lesson has since been well learned to never ever lend friendsfamily money He was well received with the popular crew and was once a child model in a sears catalog but he grew to have a lot of enemies where he came around to push others down to feed his ego mooch and owe everyone money and downright arrogance Two incidents occurred where I never wanted to associate with such people st incident I asked if he could pay me back  No I had to pay a speeding ticket blah blah blah While  hours later a friend asked if he is going to come clubbing with her including me as we associated with the same group of friends and he responds to her Totally  just got paid I needled him at the club but he just ignored me the whole time The nd incident was where he laughed and joked about a fellow friend Stacey whose father recently had a stroke that left him partially paralyzedI was an immature prick and felt some petty justice revenge needed to be served Now back to the email This was going to be a long con as I didnt want to scare him off too easily I pretended to be the Executive Casting Manager and we got him to send his portfolio hoping to embarrass him later but it was just him wearing Aeropostale sweatshirts and sears photo shots  lame After
