abbeyinreallife,162,107,1rotqh,431,I work in the guest service box for your friendly neighborhood fabric and craft store My job description includes doing returns special orders taking complaints fixing prices answering the phones and cashiering at my station when the line is long among other things  BACKGROUNDBecause we are nearing the dreaded Black Friday my store has been having our Daily Deals doorbusters Popular items are steeply discounted for one day only We also have a coupon set out that gives people a certain amount off based on how much their transaction comes to  off for  spent  for   for  etc The problem is that people never read our fine print coupons do not work on our daily deals Another important piece of background information is that I struggle with anxiety issues  Ive been working hard to manage them in order to work and deal with customers without panicking One of my anxiety triggers is unexpectedunwelcome physical contact I usually dont get touched by anyone so it is easy to avoid freaking out This story though is one I never thought I would have to tellSTORYOn this specific day one of our daily deals was on those Cricut CartridgeshttpwwwcricutcomshoppingproductsImageLibraryaspx everyone is going crazy about The line was overflowing with people getting their last minute Thanksgiving shopping in before having to scurry home to start preparing for the big day People were antsy It was about PM and Im sure their bellies were grumbling for dinner Because of this I was cashiering to get the line to shrink A nice looking middle aged lady came through my line with about  of those cartridges as well as  rolls of wrapping paper which were on sale with the rest of our Holiday Inspirations product line I started to ring up her items and she seemed harmless enough Until that is I asked for coupons Her total was about  and she wanted to use the transaction discount coupon  off for this amount as well as a  off your total purchase of craft items coupon There were a few problems with this First off none of her items counted as craft itemsSecond you can only use one total transaction coupon per transactionThird the coupons wouldnt count towards the cartridgesI tried explaining this to her but she suddenly became upset and condescending explaining that she drove all the way over here just because of that  off coupon WITHOUT READING THE FINE PRINT and wanted it to work Okay Well I rang it and showed her it wouldnt work She wanted to try to  off one I had to start the whole transaction over because we cant void coupons on our primitive system and she would not take no for an answerObviously the  one did not work either Cue irate coupon monster She told me I either had to override it which I couldnt or call a manager I called a manager and figured hed tell her the same I was wrong She started telling him that I was the one who screwed up and didnt know anything and it was my fault and blah blah blah Average bitchy customer words that just flew in one ear and right out the other for me My manager pushed a few buttons and entered his code and password and overrode it for her giving her  off her transaction In hindsight I know he was doing this to try to save my ass from that woman At this point the crazy was starting to leak out of her like sewage wrapped in a fancy box normal looking until you start to open it and see whats inside And this is the moment everything spiraled out of controlWith a glint of crazy in her eye she stood in a statuesque state until my manager got out of earshot Once he was a few aisles down she looked at me and came behind my counter and snatched up my wrist squeezing it with talonlike fingernails She looked at me with the most condescending smile and said You need to learn how to do that so we dont have this problem next time Like a deer in the headlights all I could do was try to pull away at first But there was no escape She clamped down harder bruising me The pain cleared the clouds in my head and I said pointedly Maam I Do NOT Have A Managers Code I cant fix it I pulled my arm away and snapped Your total is But not so fastShe was still behind the counter with me Trying to pay me standing over me like a vulture I waited a moment and said You need to get back onto the other side of the counter Luckily at this point she had somehow managed to stuff all that crazy back into her tiny little skull and return to normal so she obliged paid and left as if nothing had happened I went to lunch and had a panic attackTLDR My worst nightmare came to me in the body of a  year old woman,1385698832.0,The Day A Customer Touched Me,538,talesFromRetail,top_day

abbeyinreallife,162,111,1rotqh,426,I work in the guest service box for your friendly neighborhood fabric and craft store My job description includes doing returns special orders taking complaints fixing prices answering the phones and cashiering at my station when the line is long among other things  BACKGROUNDBecause we are nearing the dreaded Black Friday my store has been having our Daily Deals doorbusters Popular items are steeply discounted for one day only We also have a coupon set out that gives people a certain amount off based on how much their transaction comes to  off for  spent  for   for  etc The problem is that people never read our fine print coupons do not work on our daily deals Another important piece of background information is that I struggle with anxiety issues  Ive been working hard to manage them in order to work and deal with customers without panicking One of my anxiety triggers is unexpectedunwelcome physical contact I usually dont get touched by anyone so it is easy to avoid freaking out This story though is one I never thought I would have to tellSTORYOn this specific day one of our daily deals was on those Cricut CartridgeshttpwwwcricutcomshoppingproductsImageLibraryaspx everyone is going crazy about The line was overflowing with people getting their last minute Thanksgiving shopping in before having to scurry home to start preparing for the big day People were antsy It was about PM and Im sure their bellies were grumbling for dinner Because of this I was cashiering to get the line to shrink A nice looking middle aged lady came through my line with about  of those cartridges as well as  rolls of wrapping paper which were on sale with the rest of our Holiday Inspirations product line I started to ring up her items and she seemed harmless enough Until that is I asked for coupons Her total was about  and she wanted to use the transaction discount coupon  off for this amount as well as a  off your total purchase of craft items coupon There were a few problems with this First off none of her items counted as craft itemsSecond you can only use one total transaction coupon per transactionThird the coupons wouldnt count towards the cartridgesI tried explaining this to her but she suddenly became upset and condescending explaining that she drove all the way over here just because of that  off coupon WITHOUT READING THE FINE PRINT and wanted it to work Okay Well I rang it and showed her it wouldnt work She wanted to try to  off one I had to start the whole transaction over because we cant void coupons on our primitive system and she would not take no for an answerObviously the  one did not work either Cue irate coupon monster She told me I either had to override it which I couldnt or call a manager I called a manager and figured hed tell her the same I was wrong She started telling him that I was the one who screwed up and didnt know anything and it was my fault and blah blah blah Average bitchy customer words that just flew in one ear and right out the other for me My manager pushed a few buttons and entered his code and password and overrode it for her giving her  off her transaction In hindsight I know he was doing this to try to save my ass from that woman At this point the crazy was starting to leak out of her like sewage wrapped in a fancy box normal looking until you start to open it and see whats inside And this is the moment everything spiraled out of controlWith a glint of crazy in her eye she stood in a statuesque state until my manager got out of earshot Once he was a few aisles down she looked at me and came behind my counter and snatched up my wrist squeezing it with talonlike fingernails She looked at me with the most condescending smile and said You need to learn how to do that so we dont have this problem next time Like a deer in the headlights all I could do was try to pull away at first But there was no escape She clamped down harder bruising me The pain cleared the clouds in my head and I said pointedly Maam I Do NOT Have A Managers Code I cant fix it I pulled my arm away and snapped Your total is But not so fastShe was still behind the counter with me Trying to pay me standing over me like a vulture I waited a moment and said You need to get back onto the other side of the counter Luckily at this point she had somehow managed to stuff all that crazy back into her tiny little skull and return to normal so she obliged paid and left as if nothing had happened I went to lunch and had a panic attackTLDR My worst nightmare came to me in the body of a  year old woman,1385698832.0,The Day A Customer Touched Me,537,talesFromRetail,top_day

Mafferick,9,3,1rq10v,14,Hey guys  first time posting here and been subbed for a whileThis is a story from a little while ago and its bugged me for a while  and I think I need to get it off my chestI used to work in a currency exchange bureau in a supermarket here in England Everything was hunkydory until a few months into my role a woman came to visit me in my little box and asked me if she could have  worth of USD No Problem says I I then tell her how much the transaction would be and turn around to unlock the safe which for security purposes is on a two minute unlock timer Two minutes go by and I open the safe  locate the bag with the  in it  sign the bag out  go through all the procedures required and start to count out   worth of  for the ladyIts at this point that she tells me that she would like them in  bills because she is travelling to Africa to give the money to charityAh I say as I bundle all the bills back together  reseal the bag and go through all the procedure againI tell the woman that unfortunately we dont stock that many  so Id have to order them in for her specially  she agrees and I tell her they should be in within a couple of daysThe days pass and the delivery comes in Now when a currency delivery comes in at one of these places youve got to count ALL the money and bundle them into s for easy use so Im there and counting like   bills along with the rest of the delivery of USD Euros Canadian Australian etc etc Upon doing all THOSE procedures I telephone the  bill lady and inform her that her dollars have arrived and that if shed like to pay via card shed have to bring a form of ID such as a driving license or a passport company policy  ALAS this was my first mistake   brownie points if you can tell what it isThe lady arrives a couple of hours later and I count out her money for her  ETC Its at this point the lady pulls out her credit card and pops it into the machine  I ask the lady if she brought her ID and she hands me her old paper driving license Im sorry but I need some photographic ID like a driving license or a passportThis IS my driving licenseIm sorry but it needs to be photographic have you brought your passportThis is ridiculous Im not bringing my passport here you said on the phone that I need to bring my driving license I have brought my driving license and I expect you to honour your agreementIm afraid I cant do that its company policy to only accept card payments with a valid photo IDNo  you said on the phone to bring my driving license and this IS my driving licenseIt started to get heated and she started to shout at me in my little box At this point I try to diffuse the situation by pointing out that there is a cash point behind her that she can use to draw the money out and then I dont need the ID However she is still adamant that she will use her card along with her paper driving license Store security slide on over as theyre stationed about  feet away from my box and he asks the lady to calm down and asks what the problem is  she explains the situation and he basically tells her what I told her Its at this moment that old people get involved and point out that they still have their old paper driving license and no passport so how would they get moneyBasically whats happening now is a big massive argument right outside my box at the exact time the bureau manager is starting her shift Somehow she manages to handle the situation and the lady goes and withdraws  from the cash point and says its my fault that the children in Africa will only be getting half of her original donation She asks to complain to the store manager and tells me bluntly that She will have my jobSo to put it one way  the bureau is left with  worth of  bills we dont want  the poor African children dont get as much money and I lose my job Thanks ladyIf anything needs clarifying let me know or if you want to know anything else give me a shoutEdit  my D key isnt great so I missed a few and also I accidentally the layout,1385749857.0,So I got sacked,17,talesFromRetail,top_day
