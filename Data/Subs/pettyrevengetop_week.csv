LovesEwoks,395,711,1ri9iq,1733,I have a recipe that my now deceased grandmother had always used for a potato dish Over the years I perfected this recipe experimenting with ingredients and seasonings creating a nearly perfect dish its always a hit at parties dinners and gatheringsAfter I was married I brought this potato dish to one of my spouses family gatherings People raved and immediately requested I bring it to every gathering  I am happy to oblige since the dish is inexpensive to make and very quick and easy to put together The potato dish quickly becomes known as LovesEwoks Potatoes well my actual name not screen name Although I always refer to them as my grandmothers potatoesOver the next few years I bring these potatoes to every family function and every holiday mostly by request I share this recipe many times with my spouses family every aunt uncle cousin and sibling who asks I even give some tips for best resultsA week before Thanksgiving my sisterinlaw calls me explaining she wants to take the potatoes to her inlaws house and asks for specifics on the recipe the exact brands of products I use where I purchased the pan etc I go into great detail giving her step by step instructions for perfect resultsA few days later my motherinlaw calls me asking what dish I planned on bringing to the extended family gathering Oh I thought I would bring the potatoes She informs me that my sisterinlaw Kelly is bringing potatoes and I should bring something else This is not a problem for me since I have a collection of exceptional recipes from my grandmotherWe gather for Thanksgiving and in walks Kelly with her potato dish She removes the cover and its funny because it looks exactly like the dish I always bring I had just assumed she was going to bring something else Nope exact same recipe exact same pan She walks around telling everyone you MUST try Kellys potatoes At first I thought this might have been a joke so I let it go this is not the first time she has acted very jealous and did things for attention In the past she had made comments about not liking the potatoes to family members who complimented my cooking skillsChristmas gathering same situation I decide to ignore it and let her have Kellys potatoes  just not worth dealing with her I had brought along a dessert again people raved and requested I bring it again at Easter thanks grandma It seems I might have a new signature dish My sisterinlaw calls me a few days before Easter asking for the dessert recipe I brought at Christmas can you believe it I give her the recipe except this time I leave out a very small but critically important ingredient Easter gathering I bring the dessert as requested by the host Just as I suspected in walks Kelly with the exact same dessert I was actually starting to feel a bit guilty until she said everyone must try this I found the recipe on pinterest Needless to say they were terribleSteal my grandmas recipes and call them your own Hope you like recipes that are missing an ingredient,1385486987.0,You followed the recipe and it still tastes different How strange,2444,pettyrevenge,top_week
voxxtelum,102,466,1rkmnj,1287,As a child like many before me and countless more after I was told that I could grow up to be whatever I wanted to be You can imagine my surprise when I find myself standing in the rain at a bus stop at a school where I have been for seven years not feeling any more grown up or any closer to knowing what I wanted to beI go to a school with an offcampus parking lot Since there are about nine million commuters and seven parking spaces on campus and considering the parking permits are much cheaper parking offcampus and riding the bus to one of the two stops on campus is an attractive option On the hour as classes end dozens of students will be waiting at the stop for a bus whose schedule is determined by a slightly challenged baboon rolling a sided dieIts really raining today Its really the last day before Thanksgiving break and everyone just really wants to get home However everyone is really wet because everyone really forgot their umbrellas Everyone at the stop is huddled together under the covered portion I have an umbrella Black rosewood handle  inches my God it even has air ventsWhen the bus arrives everyone turns into third graders really needing to take a piss bouncing up and down just waiting for everyone to get off the bus so they can rush the doors and get a seat out of the rain I quickly count about sixteen people waiting and a few still on the bus waiting for the next stop and knowing that there are about twentysix seats I knew I would be able to get one of them So I stand next to the door fully aware of the panic that could ensue and hold my umbrella over everyone in line People are smiling people are saying thanks Crisis avertedThen she comes running down the sidewalk No umbrella no hood no foresight she locks her eyes on the door and picks up momentum Surely you cant be serious She isnt going to stop She isnt stopping She is pushing everyone in line out of the way She is better than everyone else She really needs to get on the bus right now She is BitchNobody wants to deal with Bitch Everyone backs up a little and lets her get on The seats on the bus are arranged against each side so that the two long rows face each other Bitch grabs one of the first seats I can see her through the windowAs the last student boards I carefully collapse my umbrella I walk up the stairs and make eye contact with her She was so proud that she finally took the advice of her horoscope and was more assertive today I see my seat in the back I walk by Bitch and as I pass her I give my umbrella an ever so slight shake I cant make it obvious but I knew that she knew that it was me who flung all that water right in her Bitch faceI grew up a little holding my umbrella out for everyone Perhaps I dont feel it because these little acts of immaturity that keep me sane are also what are preventing me from completely growing up Or perhaps realizing the distinction is what growing up means I think again about the words I heard as a child  whatever you want to be  and smileI have become Umbrella Man,1385562646.0,Something something enjoy water in your face,1753,pettyrevenge,top_week

YourFederalOverlord,57,244,1rg4z6,881,When I was in middle school many years ago I had a Digital Arts teacher whos job it was to teach us about computers and how to use them correctly  She did not do that at all instead opting to give us the same typing routines several times over and call it a class  She was also obsessed with the Philadelphia Phillies so she was immensely pleased when they made it to the World Series one year this being back in   She attempted to get tickets but the website was overloaded so instead she did the logical thing and forced her classes to get them for her telling us all to reload the page until it came back online so that she could get her tickets  Failure to comply would mean no credit for the day as well as a black mark on our record  I wasnt pleased by this so I having figured out her administrators password a few days earlier she had it on a sticky note on her desk like a chump surreptitiously logged into the system and added the tickets page to the list of blocked websites before changing her password to  logging out and feigning shock at the sudden block to the page  It took her almost a week to figure out how to unblock the page though the school did figure out the password pretty quickly and she never did end up going to the World Series  God Im horrible    ,1385416765.0,No tickets for you,1125,pettyrevenge,top_week

MrsQuess,26,126,1rawsw,495,I seriously did not get along with my sister growing up  She moved back into my parents  bedroom apartment when I was   She was four years older  So we had to share a room and I didnt even like the chick I was the angsty artsy type and she was the prep  We just clashedSo my parents refused to get me a stereo that had a CD player on it because they thought CDs were just a passing trend  It just wasnt a logical birthday or christmas gift for me I had finally saved up enough baby sitting money to buy my own stereo and I didnt want to share it with my sister   Id come home from school and she would be listening to it loudly on some country station  I hated anything she did so I was always shitty with her   One of the reasons I chose the stereo I did was because it had a remote control with it and I thought that was coolest  It was poorly designed because if you hit mute on the remote you could not unmute the stereo from the stereo itself  It had to be unmuted by the remote control  Once I figured this out I just put my stereo on mute whenever I left the house and took the remote control everywhere I went just so she could not use it,1385235664.0,Took the remote with me,621,pettyrevenge,top_week

murrhurr,26,57,1rbsaq,204,Back in  RuneScape was one of the largest freeplay MMOs It also used to be the most popular MMO before WoW hit RS was blocked at school so kids often went to the library to play in their free time I was one of those kids I couldnt really play at home since my parents were afraid the game had a virus LolSo Id see this kid at the library also playing RS He was pretty highleveled at the time ish and had lightblue rune armorthe best in the free game I would choose the computer next to him and logon to my character Id talk to him and he seemed friendly enough He saw I was lower leveled and offered to help me level up As a noob I was level  at the time I gladly took on this offer However as a noob I also was more immune to the more clever scams I would attend the library regularly and after about a week of gaining my trust the guy offered to trim my adamant armor Of course since he was so helpful to me before how could I refuseIn RuneScape like other MMOs players trade items through a specific screen So the trade screen popped up and I offered up my  addy armor which was expensive for a noob like me A friend loaned me some money to buy it which was about  coins or k Even though it cost so much I trusted my new friend enough to just hand my stuff to himWe completed the trade and I asked him how long it would take to trim my armor He said depending on your crafting level it can take a few minutes because you had to trim each part by itself He suddenly had the urge to piss and excused himself for the bathroom I naively believed him and patiently waited for his return Meanwhile his avatar on the screen beside me stood still Then it autologged meaning the game automatically loggedout his account after a period of inactivity Now it had been over  minutes since he left I wondered what took him so long After waiting a bit longer I went to check up on him Checked the male bathrooms on both floors He wasnt there It hit me that he simply left with no intention of returning my shit Well I wasnt going to have that Lucky for me there was a particular computer this kid always used probably because it was closest to a rack of teen magazines or something I hatched a plan You see in a game as popular as RuneScape was there were private servers many of questionable quality These servers hosted ripped code from the actual game client but came with many modifications like X normal XP rate and player commands that in the real game only admins JMods could use One of these shitty private servers was frequently advertised by autotyping bots in the game You could tell it was a scam because many of the accounts advertising it were highlevelmeaning that other curious players checked out the site and got their main accounts hijacked with malware No pro player would actually advertise a private serverthey were already far ahead in the real game I was gonna infect this kid with malwareMy plan was simple I went on the kids computer and created a disposable account on the real RuneScape Then I typed in the URL of the private server website I did as much fishy shit as I couldclicking on flashing advertisements and downloading whatever free Viagra came my way At this point I figured the computer was fucked but functional On the outside everything seemed normal Until it was too late I wanted to test if the computer was infected now I logged onto the disposable account and logged off I figured a hidden keylogger would record the password I hopped back to the uninfected computer and logged onto my main account It was in Varrock a popular trading city for players and spammers Now to play the waiting game I added the disposable account name to my friends list so I could be notified when it logged in Sure enough five minutes later my disposable account logged in and started spamming the server URL Satisfied I logged off and went home When the kid came back the next day I confronted him I asked him why he left without trimming my armor Guy said Oh dude I forgot Im real busy Of course youre not busy youre in middle school Guy was pulling lies from his ass I told him I forgave him and that he could keep my armor actually He didnt seem to care Fair enoughI took my seat beside him and watched him log onto the infected computer Thats all I needed to see I said I had to leave guy still didnt seem to caretoo busy killing other players in the wildernessI wanted to check the progress on my plan away from his sight I went home and disobeyed my parents rules to not play RuneScape To my delight I saw his account at Varrock West Bank spamming the URL My plan was a success The neat thing is that these bots could spam  until they were muted andor bannedthat was a bonus I only needed to ensure he couldnt access his account I returned to the library the next day Guy was furious I pretended to care as he ranted about how he couldnt logon to his accountpassword was changed He didnt have recovery questions so his account was pretty much fucked I dont know what happened after that but I hope his main was banned for botting TLDR I tricked a kid into losing his RuneScape account after he scammed my items No regrets PS To those who wonder if other innocent users got infectedI prepared for this I used a USB stick to load extra malware onto the computer Complained that it ran slowly to library staff Got it replaced like the day after the kid lost his acc ,1385262143.0,Petty RuneScape Revenge,261,pettyrevenge,top_week

ksquid,14,22,1ra14h,140,I was just reading a petty revenge story involving the movie theater and thought Id post one of my ownMy boyfriend and I used to live in a college town While there my boyfriend worked at this really shitty theater In reality it was just really old and they were only able to get second run movies As a result there were barely ever many customers On a weeknight the average amount of customers would be around  for two sets of three movies My boyfriend basically ran the place while the owners son Well just call him OS screwed around and did nothing but fuck up anything he touchedAnyway we were watching the end of Movie A which was running a bit late OS allowed people who bought tickets for Movie B it was running after Movie A to come in and get situated so long as they were quiet about it Surprisingly people were usually pretty good about being quiet if they went in That night a small group of older men and women came in talking loudly making a shitload of noise while finding seats and then removing their coats Already sick of them I turned around and said Excuse me were still watching this movie Youre only supposed to come in here if youre going to be quiet They quieted down and I thought that was the end of itI was wrongAny time something funny happened in Movie A a few of them would laugh in a way that was incredibly loud and fake sounding The ridiculous laughing only got more frequent even when what happened on screen was barely worth a chuckle I turned around again and asked if it was really necessary for them to do that and one of them spit back You need to learn to respect your elders Were only laughing at how dumb this movie really is To which I replied It sounds like you need to learn some respect yourselfThe movie was over soon after that so my boyfriend and I went out to the front of the theater OS was going home leaving my boyfriend to start his shift I started plotting my revenge immediately Movie B was more of a serious movie and that only helped my plan along After my boyfriend started up Movie B I went up into the projection booth As luck would have it the group of noisy elders were the only ones in the theater so I didnt have to worry about ruining the show for anyone elseFor those of you unfamiliar with projection booths they tend to have an extra window or two next to the big window through which the projector shows the movies This way the projectionist can get a good view of the screen for focusing and such At the shitty theater the windows were basically plexiglass that you could easily remove I took out one of the pieces and waited Whenever Movie B got to a serious part in the movie Id poke my head through the window and start laughing in a similar loud and fake fashion From up there my laugh pretty much echoed through the theater The lights were off in the booth so these assholes couldnt even see me I saw one get up a couple of times but I remained in the booth faking laughing at least every  minutes or so When the movie was over and they left my boyfriend called me back downstairs when the coast was clear He told me that one of them had come out a couple of times to complain about me hiding in the theater somewhere but boyfriend refused to help them because they couldnt show him exactly where I was He said they didnt seem to recognize him in the light so they didnt even connect him with mePlease be kind to your fellow theater patrons ,1385197626.0,Revenge on annoying movie patrons,162,pettyrevenge,top_week

Crescelle,9,33,1rj711,121,When I was growing up there were this family that lived next door to me that loved to put up what I imagine to be an illusion of a perfect plastic family There was a husband and wife a little girl and a little boy They had the latest and greatest in everything and unfortunately they were all too happy to show it off These kids were a little younger than me but they were always arrogant little shits They knew they had the best toys and thought they were the prime jewels of everything If any of the other kids had something to be proud of maybe their family just got a pool or they got a good grade on something they had to be better even so far as to make things up Like oh you have a pool We have TWO pools at our other houses You get the idea  The spotlight had to always be on themOn this day I was raking leaves in my front yard because unlike them my parents didnt spoil me rotten They toddle out of their playroom in their garage and start making fun of me for doing work They have people for that of course Im like whatever and continue on my business Seeing that Im ignoring them and wanting to make things more difficult on me they start stealing the leaves in my pile and throwing them around I was pissed until I had an idea I talked aloud about how much fun I was going to have when I got my leaves all into a pile and I got to jump in them They had apparently never heard of playing in a leaf pile and begged me to tell them about it After some time explaining the concept they decided that it would be awesome to steal my leaves and put them in their yard so they could have this super cool thing and I couldnt Out of the kindness of my icy heart I start helping them rake up the leaves into their yard until theres a sizable pile in their yard I watched with evil glee as the little girl jumped into the pile JUST as her mom walks into the front yard to see her do it The mom freaks out presumably over how gross and dirty leaves are and makes her kid go inside I laugh and go back to my house with a perfectly clean front yard knowing that the leaves are their problem now,1385509260.0,It didnt change a thing but for that moment I felt so much better,154,pettyrevenge,top_week

Cawkii,29,31,1rdk0e,105,After watching a video on YouTube it reminded me of this story that me and my Dad had a great laugh too TLDR at the bottom for anyone that doesnt want the build upMy Dad is a lover of his back garden and in the best interests of the birds he put up a variety of bird feeders in this one big tree We can see this tree from our windows and my Dad loves watching the birds eat from his study windowAfter a while we notice a fat squirrel doing the rounds on the lawn and sometime later I notice the squirrel eagerly watching the birds eat out of the feeders probably thinking he wants some too  minutes go by and I look out again to see fat squirrel on the branch of where the main big feeder is hung My Dad had thought of this so he used garden wire instead of rope which he first thought about using The wire isnt very thin about as thick as a pencil I knew the squirrel would be able to get down it and sure enough after  minutes of betting we notice the feeder flying all over the place with one squirrel getting as many nuts in his mouth as he can before my Dad scares him off the hoseThe next day I find my Dad taking down the feeders I think probably to save the money on buying nuts since the squirrel can get into them easily enough now But oh no My Dad is one that he will have his fun with pesky animals such as this squirrel as long as it doesnt well kill them the only animals I could see him kill are pigeons and I dont blame himI go into the garage to find him rubber gloved up thinking that hes going to be removing all the nuts and storing them away oh no he wasnt I find that he practically lathers up all this engine grease all over the wire and then sets them back up with a nice evil smile days go by without any sightings of a squirrel until one day I spot the same fat squirrel come back with his eyes on the prize another bird feeder my dad bought earlier in the day to fit peanuts in but lathered up with the same engine grease he used minutes of chatting in the study watching out the window and we see the fat squirrel go onto the wire one foot two hands then as he leaves the safety of the branch THUMP he slides off the wire and with no chance of catching the basket flops into the bush with a small crash me and my Dad are in tears and laughing and we have a toast to engine greaseThe height from the bird feeder to the bushes is only  foot or less I am sure he got away ok although we never saw him again until a week later when he had managed to get inside a ball shaped feeder that my Dad had bought later on In that case he put chicken wire all around the ballTLDR Squirrel got into my Dads bird feeders so he got his revenge and put engine grease on the wire connecting it to the branch we saw a squirrel fall off and laughed really hardEDIT EDIT EDITPlease people it was one Grey squirrel that may or may have not been injured in this case I DID see it a week later and it moved perfectly fine If you want to go on about animal cruelty you might want to read up on the Grey squirrel and what their species did to our native Red Squirrels,1385332255.0,The evil uses of Engine Grease,136,pettyrevenge,top_week

MechanicusAnimus,7,19,1rl043,53,So this may not necessarily be considered revenge but its definitely petty and was surprisingly satisfyingI pull into the office parking deck yesterday and proceed to idle down one of the main lanes of traffic at my usual leisurely  mph There are several smaller lanes branching off of the main one each of which has a huge red and white STOP sign painted onto the ground and both pillars that straddle the lane giving right of way to the main laneWell as you might imagine not many of my coworkers seem to think those signs mean anything which is why I slow roll instead of doing the more commonly observed  mph through the deck Today though this bitch was attempting to shatter the subterranean land speed record apparently She flies through one of the stop signs obscured by the other parked cars until the very last second to make a right turn and pulls out in front of me and misses my front bumper by mayyybe one foot If she hadnt been going so damn fast Im positive Id have hit her for lack of reaction time On top of that I noticed that she had her phone up to her left ear and appeared to be staring intently at something in her lap What The Fuck Did I mention that this is all happening underneath the Verizon office where Im currently working onsite There are fucking posters and signs all over the god damned parking deck imploring employees to stay off their effing phones You literally cannot walk to your car from the elevator without seeing a dozen of these things Thats because theres an average of one or two retarded fender benders a month in this jointSo a few seconds later I arrive at my usual parking area collect my coffee and jacket and happen to walk right by the woman as shes getting out of her car still yammering away on her phone I slow my pace and fix her with the most evil stinkeye I can muster deliberately craning my neck to maintain eye contact as I keep walking She finally notices me attempting to use the Force to set her hair on fire and just looks at me as if I have three heads zero recognition or remorse on her face just genuine confusion blissfully unaware that she was just inches away from totaling both of our carsWell thats fucking infuriating so naturally I spend the next couple hours fuming over it having memorized her plate numberparking spot and envisioning various forms of revenge like removing the cores from her tire valve stems so the tires go flat and are unable to hold air even if refilled or reaching under the car and snipping a brake or fuel line with my multitool or just walking by casually and accidentally allowing the zppers on my work bag to be dragged across her paintWhile these are all satisfying thoughts to entertain the reality is that Im a contractor here and there are security cameras all over the place So I eventually realize that any act of vengeance would most likely result in my getting caught probably fired from the position and probably prosecuted somehow as well EDIT not to mention she didnt actually harm memy car so any of those courses of action would have been a bit excessive Despite that I was still unable to let go of my rage I was bent on somehow showing this woman that she had been an inconsiderate jerk and endangered someones safety in doing so I eventually concluded that I should just tell her so Unfortunately the office employs several hundred people and I had seen this woman multiple times in the parking deck but nowhere else on the campus I wound up drafting the little note linked below and stuck it to her driverside mirror during my lunch breakhttpiphotobucketcomalbumsfExceedOrbitzpsdfjpgContents of note for anyone having trouble viewing the image This morning you pulled out in front of me after running a stop sign You were talking on your phone and didnt seem to notice Please be more careful in the future for your own safety and the safety of everyone around you Enjoy the weekendWhile this may not be considered revenge by most people it was surprisingly satisfying to do Immediately after posting the note I found myself able to let go of most of my anger at the womansituation And I had done so without stooping to the level of property damage which would have been contradictory as I was angry in the first place that she almost wrecked both of our cars or personal threats To boot Ive since noticed that she now tends to park at the complete opposite end of the deck near the entrance and extremely far away from the elevatorsstairwells that allow quick access to the first floor of the officeTLDR Woman almost wrecks my car while being oblivious on phone I left her a note instead of enacting vengeance and she now parks far away from everyone else in the most inaccessible area of the parking deck,1385572918.0,Stupid oblivious woman almost hits me in office parking deck,72,pettyrevenge,top_week

Cawkii,29,33,1rdk0e,105,After watching a video on YouTube it reminded me of this story that me and my Dad had a great laugh too TLDR at the bottom for anyone that doesnt want the build upMy Dad is a lover of his back garden and in the best interests of the birds he put up a variety of bird feeders in this one big tree We can see this tree from our windows and my Dad loves watching the birds eat from his study windowAfter a while we notice a fat squirrel doing the rounds on the lawn and sometime later I notice the squirrel eagerly watching the birds eat out of the feeders probably thinking he wants some too  minutes go by and I look out again to see fat squirrel on the branch of where the main big feeder is hung My Dad had thought of this so he used garden wire instead of rope which he first thought about using The wire isnt very thin about as thick as a pencil I knew the squirrel would be able to get down it and sure enough after  minutes of betting we notice the feeder flying all over the place with one squirrel getting as many nuts in his mouth as he can before my Dad scares him off the hoseThe next day I find my Dad taking down the feeders I think probably to save the money on buying nuts since the squirrel can get into them easily enough now But oh no My Dad is one that he will have his fun with pesky animals such as this squirrel as long as it doesnt well kill them the only animals I could see him kill are pigeons and I dont blame himI go into the garage to find him rubber gloved up thinking that hes going to be removing all the nuts and storing them away oh no he wasnt I find that he practically lathers up all this engine grease all over the wire and then sets them back up with a nice evil smile days go by without any sightings of a squirrel until one day I spot the same fat squirrel come back with his eyes on the prize another bird feeder my dad bought earlier in the day to fit peanuts in but lathered up with the same engine grease he used minutes of chatting in the study watching out the window and we see the fat squirrel go onto the wire one foot two hands then as he leaves the safety of the branch THUMP he slides off the wire and with no chance of catching the basket flops into the bush with a small crash me and my Dad are in tears and laughing and we have a toast to engine greaseThe height from the bird feeder to the bushes is only  foot or less I am sure he got away ok although we never saw him again until a week later when he had managed to get inside a ball shaped feeder that my Dad had bought later on In that case he put chicken wire all around the ballTLDR Squirrel got into my Dads bird feeders so he got his revenge and put engine grease on the wire connecting it to the branch we saw a squirrel fall off and laughed really hardEDIT EDIT EDITPlease people it was one Grey squirrel that may or may have not been injured in this case I DID see it a week later and it moved perfectly fine If you want to go on about animal cruelty you might want to read up on the Grey squirrel and what their species did to our native Red Squirrels,1385332255.0,The evil uses of Engine Grease,138,pettyrevenge,top_week

MechanicusAnimus,7,21,1rl043,53,So this may not necessarily be considered revenge but its definitely petty and was surprisingly satisfyingI pull into the office parking deck yesterday and proceed to idle down one of the main lanes of traffic at my usual leisurely  mph There are several smaller lanes branching off of the main one each of which has a huge red and white STOP sign painted onto the ground and both pillars that straddle the lane giving right of way to the main laneWell as you might imagine not many of my coworkers seem to think those signs mean anything which is why I slow roll instead of doing the more commonly observed  mph through the deck Today though this bitch was attempting to shatter the subterranean land speed record apparently She flies through one of the stop signs obscured by the other parked cars until the very last second to make a right turn and pulls out in front of me and misses my front bumper by mayyybe one foot If she hadnt been going so damn fast Im positive Id have hit her for lack of reaction time On top of that I noticed that she had her phone up to her left ear and appeared to be staring intently at something in her lap What The Fuck Did I mention that this is all happening underneath the Verizon office where Im currently working onsite There are fucking posters and signs all over the god damned parking deck imploring employees to stay off their effing phones You literally cannot walk to your car from the elevator without seeing a dozen of these things Thats because theres an average of one or two retarded fender benders a month in this jointSo a few seconds later I arrive at my usual parking area collect my coffee and jacket and happen to walk right by the woman as shes getting out of her car still yammering away on her phone I slow my pace and fix her with the most evil stinkeye I can muster deliberately craning my neck to maintain eye contact as I keep walking She finally notices me attempting to use the Force to set her hair on fire and just looks at me as if I have three heads zero recognition or remorse on her face just genuine confusion blissfully unaware that she was just inches away from totaling both of our carsWell thats fucking infuriating so naturally I spend the next couple hours fuming over it having memorized her plate numberparking spot and envisioning various forms of revenge like removing the cores from her tire valve stems so the tires go flat and are unable to hold air even if refilled or reaching under the car and snipping a brake or fuel line with my multitool or just walking by casually and accidentally allowing the zppers on my work bag to be dragged across her paintWhile these are all satisfying thoughts to entertain the reality is that Im a contractor here and there are security cameras all over the place So I eventually realize that any act of vengeance would most likely result in my getting caught probably fired from the position and probably prosecuted somehow as well EDIT not to mention she didnt actually harm memy car so any of those courses of action would have been a bit excessive Despite that I was still unable to let go of my rage I was bent on somehow showing this woman that she had been an inconsiderate jerk and endangered someones safety in doing so I eventually concluded that I should just tell her so Unfortunately the office employs several hundred people and I had seen this woman multiple times in the parking deck but nowhere else on the campus I wound up drafting the little note linked below and stuck it to her driverside mirror during my lunch breakhttpiphotobucketcomalbumsfExceedOrbitzpsdfjpgContents of note for anyone having trouble viewing the image This morning you pulled out in front of me after running a stop sign You were talking on your phone and didnt seem to notice Please be more careful in the future for your own safety and the safety of everyone around you Enjoy the weekendWhile this may not be considered revenge by most people it was surprisingly satisfying to do Immediately after posting the note I found myself able to let go of most of my anger at the womansituation And I had done so without stooping to the level of property damage which would have been contradictory as I was angry in the first place that she almost wrecked both of our cars or personal threats To boot Ive since noticed that she now tends to park at the complete opposite end of the deck near the entrance and extremely far away from the elevatorsstairwells that allow quick access to the first floor of the officeTLDR Woman almost wrecks my car while being oblivious on phone I left her a note instead of enacting vengeance and she now parks far away from everyone else in the most inaccessible area of the parking deck,1385572918.0,Stupid oblivious woman almost hits me in office parking deck,74,pettyrevenge,top_week
