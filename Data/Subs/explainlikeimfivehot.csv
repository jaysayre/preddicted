ipegara,60,87,1rpfj9,130,Im familiar with the general idea of what Black Friday in America is  its the day when the holiday season sales start But what I dont understand is how it seems to inspire such excitement and sometimes riotous behaviour as an example see this video httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvxLrEDTgtHere are some related questions In such videos people always seem to be grabbing items at random Is this true Or do they have specific items in mind If theyre grabbing items at random just because theyre cheap what is the rationale behind that Do people grab and buy lots of things they dont even actually want If people arent grabbing items at random do they decide beforehand Do places like Walmart advertise lets say iPads as  off and then the riots happen because everyone had a premeditated goal to grab that one particular item Why are sales such a big deal to begin with Sure I like to save money as much as the next guy But mostly I cant be bothered going out of my way for the sake of a sale I dont mind paying a bit more money for the sake of convenience  even though I only work parttime and have a low income I certainly wouldnt go into a crowded and panicked situation like in that video just because of a chance to save a little money Maybe this is just me but I would have thought most people would not risk a dangerous situation like that Other countries have equivalent days to Black Friday as well For example most Commonwealth countries including here have major holiday sales that start on Boxing Day But although a lot of people certainly go shopping on that day they dont run through the front doors They dont run around the store grabbing items or battling each other They just shop in a regular fashion So I guess my question is  what makes Black Friday in the US so different to the equivalents in other countries What inspires all the excitement,1385726752.0,ELI For nonAmericans  Why does Black Friday incite such excitement What is going on in the typical riot videos each year What are they buying,217,explainlikeimfive,hot
