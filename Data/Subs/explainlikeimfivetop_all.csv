looking at the Social Security Act it looks like its currently a mishmesh of various qualifications one being that a person is under  of the poverty line So this will make for a pretty huge number of people who Medicaid grows to encompass This section also increases federal funding to support the increase However it should be mentioned that a recent court rulinghttpwwwsupremecourtgovopinionspdfcapdf amongst other things made it clear that individual states could opt not to do this However in Justice Roberts opinion Congress may offer the States grants and require the States to comply with accompanying conditions but the States must have a genuine choice whether to accept the offer so in other words States cant be forced to do this but they can be given incentives to do thisPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act so that starting in  Medicaid covers former foster children under

states insurance exchangesPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act From what I can tell it looks like this allows a hospital to choose whether they want to be able to make a determination whether or not a patient is covered under Medicaid Im just guessing here but I think that this is to streamline things and make it easier for hospitals to sign patients up for Medicaid if a patient looks like they might qualify for Medicaid Page  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act to allow Medicaid to cover Freestanding Birth Centers which look like they are essentially an establishment which is not a hospital but which provides services to mothers giving birth So picture a

is to develop standards for the care given to patients and doctors who can reduce the costs of care for their patients while still meeting these standards will get incentive payments  is set aside for this program from  and the Secretary is to report to Congress on its progressThe next few sections focus on reducing readmissions where a patient keeps coming back for the same problem Apparently this

start to phase in changes to the amounts paid to caregivers for home health services based on a number of factors including the type and cost of services whether the caregiver is rural or urban whether the caregiver is forprofit or nonprofit etc The phasein is to be across  years to make sure the shift in payments isnt too much of a shock to the market In addition this section directs the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission to conduct a study on the effect this has on access to and quality of care This report is to be given to Congress by January   On top of that this section makes a number of smaller edits to indicate that the Secretary is to limit the amounts paid to these caregivers in a number of different ways This section also alters another bill the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of  to increase the payments made to rural home health services by  from April   to January   The Secretary is to conduct a study on home health agency costs for Medicare beneficiaries The Secretary is to present this report to Congress no later than March   Also after seeing the results of this study the Secretary may conduct a demonstration project to test

data on payments for hospice care starting no later than January   At some point after October   the Secretary is to revise payments for hospice care This section also says that a hospice care provider can only continue services if every  days they have a facetoface meeting with the patient to determine whether that patient still needs hospice carePage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act so that starting in  the method for determining disproportionate share hospital payments payments to hospitals who treat indigent patients will change to be determined by a number of factors outlined here Its a bit complicated but the short version is that it looks like itll be cutting these payments by about  give or take This is probably because it is expected that these hospitals will have far fewer uninsured patients to treatPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to identify which services are misvalued that are more expensive than they need to be or can be made more efficient through bundling The Secretary is to make adjustments to the amount we pay hospitals for these services This section also repeals a part of another bill the Balanced Budget Act of  that seems to direct the Secretary to just accept the generally accepted costs for these services It also repeals a part of the Social Security Act that Im having difficulty finding but looks like it was something similarPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act I had to do some looking around online to get a feel for just what this does but from what I see herehttpprimaryimmuneorgwpcontentuploadsXImagingPaymentUPDATEDpdf it looks like starting in  its increasing from  to  a rate used in determining expenses related to costly diagnostic imaging equipment and reduces the payments for the use of this equipment by  This section also directs the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare amp Medicaid Services to report on whether this change in payments will reduce costs by  That report is to be made available no later than January   That strikes me as an oddly specific number so I suspect that they expect that this

treatments made from living organisms like vaccines and biosimilar refers to products that are effectively the same as existing products This section says that Medicare will pay  of the cost of existing products for these biosimilar ones It looks like the idea is to give upstart drug companies a chance to break into the market so they can compete with major drug companies that already existPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a Medicare Hospice Concurrent Care demonstration program which will last for  years As I understand it hospice care is care for patients who are dying that doesnt attempt to treat the ailment that the patient is dying from it only tries to ease their pain Generally Medicare recipients have to choose one or the other The demonstration program this section creates will allow for some patients to choose both This demonstration program is intended to be costneutral and the Secretary is to report to Congress on how this affected quality of care and costeffectivenessPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Directs the Secretary of Health and

nothing in the PPACA will reduce home health benefits guaranteed in the Social Security ActThe next series of sections is all about Medicare Advantage For those unaware Medicare Advantage also known as MedicareChoice and Medicare Part C is an optional Medicare program for those who want to get their insurance through a private provider However since it was created Medicare Advantage costs have ballooned to be over  more than costs for comparable services under traditional Medicare  sourcehttpcbogovsitesdefaultfilescbofilesftpdocsxxdocsprattltrpdf  The following sections in a few different ways seek to bring Medicare Advantage costs back in line with normal Medicare costs The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that from  to  this will save  billion

the PPACA was passed by another bill the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of  HCERA However the new text has been entered here It amends another bill the Social Security Act Its got a lot of talk about numbers but the gist of it seems to be that its going to be lowering the amount paid for Medicare Advantage until the costs are more in line with the costs of normal Medicare This section seeks to bring those costs back down to something comparable to normal Medicare costsPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage   Alters another bill the Social Security Act to specify that starting on January   some specific services under Medicare Advantage cannot cost more than those under Medicare Part A and B This is essentially just additional details on the costsaving stuff in section  Also a lot of numbers talk regarding Medicare Advantage rebatesPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage   Another section repealed and replaced by HCERA The current section alters another bill the Social Security Act to make it so that adjustment of costs for Medicare Advantage services continues on a yearly basis previously it only continued

of comment noting that the Secretary of Health and Human Services is to extend service area waivers for Medicare Advantage plans for providers who contracted with the Secretary for those waivers prior to October  Page  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act to make permanent senior housing facilities created under a specific demonstration project as of December  Page  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act to clarify that the Secretary of Health and Human Services has the right to reject bids for plans by a Medicare Advantage organization and bids for plans by a Prescription Drug Plan sponsor if those plans propose significant increases to costs or reductions to servicePage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to request the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to revise standards for supplemental Medicare benefit plansThe next group of sections deals with Medicare Part D the Medicare Drug Prescription ProgramPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act Firstly it says that starting January   any drug companies wanting to continue to work with Medicare Part D must participate in the Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program outlined in this section Secondly it outlines the actual Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program which also starts January   This section addresses the infamous Donut Hole in coverage which plagued Medicare recipients who purchased enough drugs to surpass the prescription drug coverage limit but not enough to qualify for catastrophic coverage It does so by making the drug companies that work with Medicare give discounts to those who fall within that gapPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act so that the lowincome benefit for Medicare part is calculated without taking into consideration discounts and rebates received under Medicare Advantage This way those getting discounts like that wont be penalized for it when purchasing drugsPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act From what I can tell starting January   it makes it so the Secretary of Health and Human Services can allow a prescription drug plan to charge lowincome beneficiaries the lowincome subsidy if the plans premium is more expensive than the lowincome subsidy plus a de minimis amount That amount is apparently   sourcehttpwwwcmsgovMedicarePrescriptionDrugCoveragePrescriptionDrugCovContraDownloadsMemoDeMinimisClarificationpdf Page  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act This section deals with widows and widowers on lowincome assistance Normally Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services check beneficiaries financial status on a regular basis to make sure they still qualify for lowincome programs and if someone is making too much money in a given timeframe they may no longer qualify as low income However generally when someones wife or husband dies they inherit their significant others stuff This section says that that check on beneficiaries status can not happen within a year of the death of a spouse so someone isnt dropped from Medicare or Medicaid just because they lost a loved one This section goes into effect January  Page  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act so that no later than January   when the Secretary of Health and Human Resources reassigns someone to a different Medicare drug plan apparently due to a change in their economic status they are to be informed of the differences between their old plan and the new one as well as being informed of their right to request a coverage determination exception or reconsiderationPage  Sec

Benefits and Outreach Enrollment from  through  The Secretary of Health and Human Services can request support from the entities funded by this section for wellness and disease prevention outreach programsPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act As I understand it starting in  Medicate Advantage insurance companies must include coverage for specific categories of drugs designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services Until the secretary designates which drugs are to be covered these categories are to include anticonvulsants antidepressants antineoplastics antipsychotics antiretrovirals and immunosuppressants for the treatment of transplant rejectionPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act From what I can tell starting on January   if you make over   for couples filing taxes jointly your Medicare Part D monthly costs will increase in a fashion similar to Medicare Part B This amount will be taken out of your social securityPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act so that on a date no earlier than January   if youre eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid and receiving home or communitybased services instead of going to a hospital you cant also qualify for costsharing under Medicare Part D From what I can tell this is because they can most likely get costsharing by other meansPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act so that starting on January   drug plans for patients in longterm care facilities must be more efficiently managed and drugs given to patients must be dispensed in a more efficient manner using uniform dispensing techniques to reduce wastePage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create and maintain a complaint system to be made available on Medicaregov and the Secretary shall report yearly to Congress on this system It looks like thishttpmedicaregovclaimsandappealsfileacomplaintcomplaintshtml is the page for complaintsPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act to make a standard and uniform appeals process for those who feel their claim should not have been denied This is to happen by January  Page  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Directs the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a study about the type of drugs used by those in Medicare Advantage plans which the Secretary of Health and Human Resources is to present to Congress no later than July  every year starting in  The Inspector General is also to conduct a study on the  most frequentlyused Medicare Part D drugs and their pricing under both normal Medicare and Medicare Advantage That report is to be given to Congress no later than October  Page  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act This one is hard to parse but from what I can tell it makes it so that starting on January   drugs paid by AIDS drug programs and Indian Health Services count towards calculations for determining qualification for Medicare Part D catastrophic care I imagine that this is because someone with AIDS definitely needs catastrophic care Not sure what Indian Health Services has to do with anything thoughPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This section was repealed by another bill HCERA However it replaces it with similar text which is mirrored here It alters another bill the Social Security Act to give a  rebate to Medicare recipients who fall into that donut hole that I mentioned above in Section  Its only in effect for Page  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This section alters another bill the Social Security Act It reduces the increases in payments that many various types of medical facilities and services were going to be getting through Medicare undoubtedly to keep down Medicares ballooning costs For some of these services it reduces those increases gradually starting at a quarter of a percent less than what those payment increases were going to be gradually going up to threequarters of a percent less than what the payment increases were going to be For some it reduces increases in payments based on a productivity assessment which from what I can tell is based primarily on what operating costs are For some it reduces the increases in payments by a flat amount And for some it reduces the increases in payment using some combination of those three methods It bears note that this is undoubtedly what some alarmists believe is a reduction in Medicare services but none of these reduce Medicare payments below what they are now they only slow down the speed at which Medicare costs are rising and it seems like its largely trying to keep payments close to the actual costs needed by these facilities and servicesPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act to say that from January   through December   income thresholds if you earn more than that amount a year youre considered highincome for Medicare Part B will be frozen at their  levels rather than being tied to inflation like they previously had been Looking around apparently those thresholds are currently at  if youre single and  if youre filing taxes jointly Freezing the thresholds means theyll stay at those dollar amounts instead of rising with inflationPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Social Security Act to create the Independent Medicare Advisory Board This is one of the sections that brought up talk of death panels but the truth is its pretty benign The board is to be comprised of  experts who cannot hold any other employment while they are part of the board so theres no conflict of interest who are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate as well as the Secretary of Health and Human Services the Administrator of the Center for Medicare amp Medicaid Services and the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration who will be nonvoting members The presidential appointees serve year nonconsecutive terms The boards purpose is to reduce Medicare spending per person by submitting proposals to be enacted by the Secretary unless Congress says otherwise These proposals must cut costs must not ration health care and must not increase costs to Medicare recipients must not cut Medicare benefits and must not modify eligibility criteria In addition until  these proposals must not reduce payments for hospitals and services probably because the ACA already does some of that It can cut payments for administrative expenses The board is also to try and make its proposals increase Medicare solvency improve quality of care improve access to services and reduce spending in areas with excess growth in costs while also taking into consideration the needs of care providers Before these proposals go to the Secretary they are to be reviewed by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission Then the Secretary reviews them and then they are brought to Congress Starting in  these proposals are to be brought to both houses of Congress and the President by January  each year The President will review this proposal for two days before bringing his own proposal to Congress A few different committees in Congress are to review this proposal and report back to Congress on it by April  Congress is not allowed to make another bill to repeal or alter congressional consideration although the Senate may waive Congressional consideration by use of a threefifths vote thats subject to appeal This section goes into all sorts of Congressional rules for how the proposal is to be considered before deciding whether to pass it Anyway Congress votes on whether to pass it and the President may choose to veto it if it is passed like any other bill If the proposal passes it is to be implemented by August  Additionally in  Congress can vote on whether to discontinue the board If the board didnt create a proposal in a given year it is still to report to Congress on matters relating to Medicare and every year regardless it is to create a public report as well They are also to do a yearly advisory report on recommendations for ways to improve health care outside of MedicarePage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Public Health Service Act to add the next sectionPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Okay Ive had a damn difficult time trying to find the actual text of the Public Health Service Act Everything I come up with doesnt seem to fit the text that this bill is inserting into it This section directs the Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to research create and to put into practice quality improvement practices

CarlH,166,175,jauzj,866,A number of people have asked questions on ELI related to how stocks and stock market work Here goes Part One  Stocks First lets imagine that down the street there is a toy store Mr Jones owns the toy store and he has owned it for the last ten years The toy store is a company which sells toys and all the kids love to get toys from Mr Jones toy storeLets suppose we wanted to buy Mr Jones toy store from him so that all of the kids would buy toys from us instead Would we be able to buy it for a dollar No of course not It is worth a lot more than that How about ten dollars A hundred dollarsWell how exactly would we find out how much we need to pay in order to buy Mr Jones toy store The most important thing to consider is simply how much money is the toy store making If the toy store is making  every day that means it is making roughly   days of  every month or  every year  months of  Lets suppose we are able to figure that the toy store should be able to keep making this much for the next ten years Then we could consider that the entire toy store is worth  which is  for ten years Now in practice this is a lot more complicated But the basic principle is simply to figure out how much money a company can be expected to make in a certain time frame Fortunately we dont have to figure it out ourselves There are big companies whose job is to figure out how much other companies are worth and they do all of the hard work for us They will tell us just how much Mr Jones toy store is really worth and then we can decide to buy it or notSo lets consider that the toy store is worth  If we want to buy it and if he is willing to sell it we can pay Mr Jones that much money and now the toy store is oursNow this is all well and good if we have  and we want to own the entire company But lets suppose we only have half that much we have  What can we do now Well as long as Mr Jones is willing we can buy half of his company instead of the whole thingThis means that we will own  or half of the company and he will own the other half That means that instead of all of the money from selling toys going to Mr Jones half will go to him and the other half to us Another way of saying that we own  of the company is to say that we own  of the stock in a company When a company is set up in a way that you can buy pieces of it those pieces are called stock There are two ways to think about stock percentages and sharesWhat we just talked about are percentages We can buy  of the shares in Mr Jones toy company for  Similarly we could buy  of the shares in Mr Jones toy company for  assuming the total value of the company was  or we could buy  of the shares for  and so onWhen you hear people talk about stocks you will hear them talk about shares of stock What exactly does this mean Well lets imagine that Mr Jones has a lot of people who want to buy a piece of his company What he can do is say Hey everyone I have  different pieces of my company for saleIn this example there are  total pieces he has for sale each one being worth  of the stock To buy all  pieces would cost you  and this would mean you own the entire company This would mean that whenever the company makes money you get all of the money But lets suppose we only have  to use This means all we can afford is one piece of his company but that one piece is worth  which means that every time the company makes a hundred dollars we will get one dollarSo in this example Mr Jones looks at the situation and realizes it is very hard to find people to buy pieces of his company because each piece costs  which is a lot of money So he decides rather than just have  pieces or shares he is going to have a thousand pieces Now it takes ten shares to have  of the company but each share is only  That is a lot more affordable He could even decide to make  shares which means that you could buy a share for only So this is the basic concept Companies cut their value into pieces or shares and then sell the shares to people who will buy them The people who buy shares are called investors and the act of buying a share is called investing This means that they are buying shares in a company because they think that eventually they will make back more than what they paid because they are getting a piece of all of the money that the company makesWhen a company is enormous worth billions of dollars even a thousand shares is simply not enough They need to have many many shares in order to make sure that shares are affordable Some companies have millions of shares of stockNow we have covered one aspect of what it means to own stock in a company You are able to keep some of the money the company makes based on how many shares you own But when you own part of a company you dont just get some of the money it makes You also get to make decisions Everyone who has shares in a company has the right to vote for what the company will do next The amount of voting power you have is equal to the percentage of shares you have Imagine that a company is owned by three people Billy Melissa and James Imagine that Billy owns  of the total shares and that Melissa and James each own  which is less than what Billy owns Lets suppose that the toy company is trying to decide whether to sell a certain toy Billy thinks it is a good idea but Melissa and James think it is a bad idea Well even though Billy has more shares of stock in the company and more voting power he will still be out voted by both Melissa and James This is because together Melissa and James have  compared to Billys  When a company has a lot of share holders people who own stock in the company they will have meetings called shareholder meetings In these meetings everyone gets to vote based on the shares they own The company will do whatever the prevailing vote decidesSo then this brings up a question What if there are a lot of people who own shares but one of them owns more than half of all the shares Would that person be able to outvote everyone else no matter how many other people there are The answer is yes If a single person owns more than half of all the shares then they have what is called controlling interest in the company This means that they can decide anything for the company and outvote everyone else  Part Two  The Stock Market So by now you should have a pretty good idea of what stock is Now lets imagine that there is also a video game company owned by Mr Smith Now Mr Smiths company is doing a lot better than Mr Jones We had said that Mr Jones company is worth  based on how much it is expected to make over ten years but Mr Smiths is worth twice that His video game company is worth  Lets imagine that Mr Jones company has  total shares of stock each valued at  per share Lets also imagine that Mr Smiths company also has  total shares of stock each valued at  per share This means that if we had  we could choose to either buy two shares in Mr Jones toy company or one share in Mr Smiths video game company Lets suppose that we already own two shares of stock in Mr Jones toy company Our two shares are worth  which is enough to buy one share of stock in Mr Smiths company We looked at both companies and we decided that Mr Smiths company seems like it is doing the best so we decide to sell our two shares in Mr Jones toy company and buy one share of stock in Mr Smiths company And this is the basics of stock tradingNow here is where things get interesting How much a company is really worth changes constantly Mr Jones company has been making  every day for ten years but all of last year his company was only making  per day Is it still worth   Maybe it is losing value or maybe it is just going through a rough period If we owned stock in the company we would have to decide which it is If we decide the company is losing value then we will probably want to sell our stocks and buy stocks in a company that is doing better There are a lot of reasons to assume that a company is doing better or worse We might have heard a rumor that Mr Jones toy company even though it has only been making day is about to start selling a really really cool toy We say Wow if he sells that toy lots of kids will buy it and so we decide to buy a lot of stock because we think that the stock is actually worth more than Mr Jones says Similarly we might have heard a rumor that an even better toy company is going to be opening up a store right next door to Mr Jones toy store In this case we might say Oh no we have a lot of shares of stock in Mr Jones toy company and we better sell it fast If we dont we will lose money because the kids will all shop at the new toy store instead You can see that emotion plays a big role in this  Now lets imagine that instead of two companies Mr Jones Toy Company and Mr Smiths Video Game Company there are hundreds of companies Lets also imagine there are thousands of people all trading stock in each company at the same time Now you have what is called a stock exchange If you take the value of all of the companies and add them together and then divide that by the total number of companies in your stock exchange you get an average that you can track over time to see how well on average all of the companies are doingLets suppose that all of the companies combined are worth a million dollars and that there are only ten total companies in the stock exchange Then we would say that the average value is a million divided by ten which is  Remember though that how much companies are worth changes over time so the very next day it might turn out that all ten companies combined are now worth two million dollars which means our average is now  If we keep track of this average over time we can create a graph We can watch this graph to get a good feel for how the companies in the stock exchange are doing This can also help us decide whether or not investing in more companies is a good idea or a bad idea There you have it the basics of stocks and the stock market I hope you enjoyed it,1312648169.0,explainlikeimfive  Stocks and the Stock Market Explained,1041,explainlikeimfive,top_all

get starting in  no bigger than  for individuals and  for couples On top of that this establishes that plans should fall into BronzeSilverGoldPlatinum levels with each corresponding to a different level of benefits For Bronze insurers pay for  of the costs of the benefits Silver is  Gold is  and Platinum is  A plan thats not one of those could still be okay if its a Catastrophic plan which is only for people under  or with special tax exemptions and it only has to cover three primary care visits Additionally any plan created for adults must also be available for children under Whew That was a long one Okay lets move onPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  A state may choose to fund plans that include abortion coverage or they may not Its up to each state to decide that Basically the folks who wrote the bill knew what a hotbutton issue abortion was and they wrote this section to pass the buck on to state lawmakers without siding one way or anotherPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This section defines a bunch of termsOkay now were about to get into health insurance exchanges which allow plans to compete across different areas The idea if Im getting this right is that by having more insurance companies competing across a larger area prices will be driven down due to competition As I understand it this is what they ultimately ended up doing instead of having a public option optional staterun insurance to compete with the others Since the public option got shot down before the bill was passed this was seen as another way to encourage more competition in the marketIt bears mention that in the  Supreme Court rulinghttpwwwsupremecourtgovopinionspdfcapdf on this bill it was declared that states are not required to establish health insurance exchanges and that they cannot be penalized for refusing to do so by reducing the funding they get for Medicare and Medicaid However if any states choose to optout of the creation of these exchanges the Secretary of Health and Human Resources may simply create the exchanges for those states directly or even go as far as to create a multistate exchange encompassing any number of states that refuse to create their own This is just speculation of course but in any case the court decision shouldnt greatly impact the creation of these exchangesPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Another big one This section sets aside money to the states so they can start up health insurance exchanges The Secretary of Health and Human Services determines how much to keep giving the states based on how much progress theyre making States only have until  to get their act together though  after that they get no money However states must have something ready by  States can choose to require insurers to have benefits that go above and beyond what this law requires but they have to figure out how to pay for anything they come up with that requires more government money by  the exchanges need to be selffunding States can even team up to make multistate exchanges if they wantPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Individuals can get any plan they qualify for If you qualify for it you can get it if you dont you cant This section seems to be talking about different ways people can get insurance through employment through a broker etc and making sure they get it Also Congress has to make use of the same plans us ordinary taxpayers havePage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  States need to keep track of the money these insurance exchanges are using make sure theyre working right financially and watch out for fraudPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  The Secretary of Health and Human Services is to set the standards that these insurance exchanges are supposed to follow If any state fails to follow them satisfactorily fails to get it set up in time or chooses not to do it at all the Secretary will set one up for themPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This sets up the rules as well as instructions for loans and grants for the creation of nonprofit memberrun insurers called Coops Basically what credit unions are to banks this aims to be for traditional insurance companies This section aims to make it easier for a bunch of people to band together to start their own nonprofit insurance company to provide insurance all the people who banded together The idea is to give people more options and more competition in the marketPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This option is stricken and no longer exists Looks like it was probably the public option back before it was kicked off of this billPage  Sec  same number different section httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Allocates money specifically for territories that arent states like Puerto RicoPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This says that Coops have to work under the same laws as normal insurance companiesPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This allows the government to create a lowcost insurance option for people who make too much money to qualify for Medicaid but who still make less than  of the poverty line which is a number that depends on your age and how many are in your household but this amount at its lowest is a little over yearPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  If any state can come up with their own plan one which gives citizens the same level of care at the same price as the PPACA they can ask the Secretary of Health and Human Services for permission to do their plan instead of the PPACA So if they can get the same results without say the mandate they can be allowed to do so Vermont for example has expressed a desire to just go straight to singlepayerPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  In  states can work with insurers to allow them to make plans available in multiple states with different laws and regulationsPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  A different way for an insurer to do a multistate planPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Starting in  states must either create or work with an alreadyexisting nonprofit reinsurance agency Reinsurance agencies basically buy insurance plans from insurers when they are deemed to be highrisk This helps to keep premiums for other customers down since otherwise insurers would have to raise prices to offset that risk This section talks about some of the rules for these sorts of agencies  medical conditions are to be identified as highrisk conditions that insurers can offer up to reinsurance agencies Partly to offset the risk these agencies are taking by taking on these highrisk customers reinsurers are taxexemptPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  In  the government will create Risk corridors basically saying that in the first few years while insurers adjust to all these new rules the government will help with some of the risk associated with insurance payoutsPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Each state will charge insurers who take on less risk and make payments to insurers who take more risk acting as an equalizer so that the companies that succeed arent just the ones who cater mostly to demographics with a low amount of riskPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another document the Internal Revenue Code by adding the following sectionPage  Sec Bhttphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Starting in  gives a refundable tax credit to everyone who makes too much to qualify for Medicaid but makes less than  of the poverty line which again is based on your age and how many people are in your household Depending on how much you make this could save you up to  a year A refundable tax credit is basically a discount on your taxes and if its more money than you pay in taxes you actually get the extra money back as a refund This is the bills answer to the question How will I afford insurance if I make too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford insurance on my ownPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  If Im reading this right insurers must reduce costs both copays and overall costs for everyone who makes too much to qualify for Medicaid but makes less than  of the poverty line which like I said last time is based on your age and how many people are in your household Depending on how much you make your copay costs could be slashed by up to twothirds the normal price and your overall costs could be covered up to  If youre an Indian presumably Native American Indian making under  of the poverty line you have no copay This section specifically says it only applies to citizens and legal aliens living in the US so no illegal aliens allowedPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  It looks like this section instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to set up a way to check whether people are eligible to buy insurance It looks like its basically in a roundabout way trying to keep illegal aliens from being qualified for insurance and setting up penalties for anyone who lies on insurance formsPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This section instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to set up a way to check whether people are eligible for the tax credits and the insurance cost reductions that up to  stuff Basically instructing him to set up a system to determine what people qualify for based on their income And also no illegal aliensPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This section instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to set up standard forms and enrollment procedures for statelevel programs like Medicaid and Child Health programsPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  The Secretary of Health and Human Services is allowed to share relevant tax information with those who need it in order to verify what people qualify forPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  All these tax credits and refunds wont count as income So they wont be taxed or anythingPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  The Secretary of Health and Human Services is instructed to conduct a study into the possibility of adjusting poverty levels based on where people live Because making year in rural Kansas is a hell of a lot different than making year in San FranciscoPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another document the Internal Revenue Code by adding the following sectionPage  Sec Rhttphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Businesses with  or fewer employees can get a tax credit worth up to  of the cost of the health care they provide their employeesThe following parts deal with The Requirement to Maintain Minimal Essential Coverage AKA The Mandate This is one of the big parts that people have taken issue with and the very same one that the Supreme Court recently ruledhttpwwwsupremecourtgovopinionspdfcapdf is constitutional as long as its seen as a tax and not a penalty for all those lawyertypes out therePage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This is a big fat explanation for the reasons behind The Mandate Basically without the mandate people might just decide not to pay for insurance which places a huge risk not just on themselves but the hospitals who will eventually have to treat them when they get sick or injured The economy loses a ton of money due to uninsured people needing emergency care which in turn makes insurance premiums more expensive as that cost is passed on Whats more medical expenses account for  of bankruptcies which introduces even more stress into the economy And with this bill getting rid of preexisting conditions if there was no mandate people would just wait to buy insurance until they need it which pretty much defeats the whole point of insurance In addition requiring people to get insurance will make millions of people healthier and live longer Besides the more healthy people who have insurance the less of a risk insurers are taking which lowers everyones pricesPage  Sec Ahttphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This is the actual mandate If you can afford healthcare if it costs less than  of your income but dont get it you will be hit in your tax return with an annual tax of  or up to  of income whichever is greater This will rise to  or  of income by  This section makes an exception for those with religious exemptions the Amish members of Indian tribes and prison inmates It also specifies that no ones going to be charged with any crime or anything its just a new tax if you dont complyPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Insurers need to tell the government who theyre insuring either directly or through employers in which case they need to tell the government which employer theyre working through tooPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This one is changing another bill the Fair Labor Standards Act of  by adding in the following sectionPage  Sec Ahttphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  If an employer has over  employees and offers a health plan to those employees new employees will be automatically signed up for

employ parttime employees their hours are to be added together to see how many fulltime employees theyd represent in other words its not a simple head count The Secretary of Labor is to conduct a report to see what effect this has on employees wagesPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another document the Internal Revenue Code by adding the following sectionPage

where you specifically pick what is and isnt covered I think this is saying that if youre well enough off that youre going to nitpick the details of your insurance policy you can buy all of the elements of that policy directlyPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  This section has to do with Free Choice Vouchers Judging from news reports it looks like it has since been repealed It would have required employers to provide these vouchers to employeesPage  Sec Dhttphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  More on Free Choice Vouchers Again looks like it was killed off after the bill passedPage  Sec httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Says that this part of the bill uses the same definitions as another bill the Public Health Service

doing soPage  Sec  Same number different section httphousedocshousegovenergycommerceppacaconpdfpage  Alters another bill the Public Health Service Act by making many small changes It looks like most
