And while I read the book primarily for it's literary merit and beautiful prose, I wanted to know how true this statement was: ""Well-to-do persons in [Roman] Britain lived better than they ever did until late Victorian times.""

Extended quote:
""For nearly three hundred years Britain, reconciled to the Roman system, enjoyed in many respects the happiest, most comfortable, and most enlightened times its inhabitants have ever had.
In this period, almost equal to that which separates us from the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, well-to-do persons in Britain lived better than they ever did until late Victorian times. From the year 400 till the year 1900 no one had central heating and very few had hot baths. A wealthy British-Roman citizen building a country house regarded the hypocaust which warmed it as indispensable.
For fifteen hundred years his descendants lived in the cold of unheated dwellings, mitigated by occasional roastings at gigantic wasteful fires. Even now a smaller proportion of the whole population dwells in centrally heated houses than in those ancient days. As for baths, they were completely lost till the middle of the nineteenth century.In all this long, bleak intervening gap cold and dirt clung to the most fortunate and highest in the land""

Shadowcat770,2,,0,1rhzht,,7,"[Here](http://imgur.com/a/Lyynx) is an album with pictures of the scrimshaw.


The scrimshaw was passed down through my dad's family, and my mom recently took it to the New Bedford Whaling Museum to have it looked at. I guess the people at the museum were very impressed with the piece, and said they'd never seen this artist before. Ultimately, we would like to figure out when it was made and try to find the artist's name.


The family story goes that the tusk was given to my father's great-grandfather as a wedding present from the captain of a whaling ship. We aren't sure which set of great-grandparents it was given to, and unfortunately any family members that could possibly add more details to the story have passed away.


Originally, because of the drawing of Jenny Lind, the experts at the museum thought that the tusk was made around 1950. However, according to our genealogy, my dad's great-grandparents got married in 1881 (Andrew M. Palmer and Orletta ""Lettie"" Cragin) and 1869 (Benjamin F. Peabody and Ann Eliza Dare). The date will be key in attempting to determine the artist's name. In order to pinpoint the date the scrimshaw was made, it was suggested that we try to find the original photos that were used to trace the pictures onto the tusk.
The people at the museum said that the picture of Jenny Lind was likely from an actual photo or playbill because the scrimshaw shows her with a big nose. I guess artists would usually try to correct her nose when they drew a portrait of her?



For the other photos, originally my dad thought that they came from Godey's Lady's Book. However, the people at the museum also suggested looking in Harper Collins Monthly. I found a plate titled ""The Elopement"" in the table of contents of the February 1850 issue of Godey's Lady's Book, but I haven't been able to find a scanned copy of the plate to confirm that it's the picture on the scrimshaw.



Basically, I have hit a dead end in my research. It would mean a lot to my dad to find the artist's name and learn more about our family history.

There is a great mythology in the south about the unbelievable evil and brutality that the Yankees - ""Lucifer's legions"" - brought in their victory campaigns towards the end of the war - the obvious examples being, of course, Sherman's ""March to the Sea.""

As I understand it, Sherman's ""March"" was composed of several similar acts; the Battle of Meridian, in which he practiced the sort of total war he would later commit to entirely; the march across Georgia from Atlanta to Savannah; and the march across the Carolinas, which was both the worst (South Carolina) and the most lenient (North Carolina).

I am trying to figure out how bad, *really,* these campaigns were for the south. Does it live up to the mythology - raping, pillaging, plundering, roving bands of criminals, mass starvation - of horror and unthinkable tragedy?

The fact that the south rebuilt so quickly makes me think it wasn't really that bad, and that the mythology was deliberately and easily built up out of a fairly civil - if not terribly wasteful and destructive - campaign. 

Can anyone weigh in on this topic? How bad *were* Sherman's marches? How bad did the worst of life get during the war, and where did that happen?

What were the words for these?

I was thinking since we use numbers to tell us what a number is our words don't represent them in the same way as a symbol would. The Latin alphabet had I-V-X-L-C-D-M so I just assumed there would be words given a similar meaning as the letter, since C is pronounced /keː/ [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet) one would assume the word for 100 is something starting with the pronunciation /keː/, witch I assume centuria or what ever the the correct Latin word is pronounced something like Kenturia!? 

also come to think of it, how would a Roman say he was born 30 years ago, I was born ""XXX annus"" ago? or did they have word to define this. I am Norwegian and we just combine the words for 3 and 10 into three-ten (NO: tre-ti), this goes on ""four-ten"" etc. until one hundred, where we say ""et"" (one) ""hundre"" (hundred).

The primary issue that seems to arise is opposition to Shirer's thesis that German people were complicit in the rise of the Nazi party. To me one of the most interesting aspects of Shirer's account were the instances of German capitalists and military officials trying to undermine the Wiemar Republic and institute something closer to a monarchy or military autocracy, but that ultimately Hitler got the better of them all.

""For nearly three hundred years Britain, reconciled to the Roman system, enjoyed in many respects the happiest, most comfortable, and most enlightened times its inhabitants have ever had.
In this period, almost equal to that which separates us from the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, well-to-do persons in Britain lived better than they ever did until late Victorian times.

A wealthy British-Roman citizen building a country house regarded the hypocaust which warmed it as indispensable.
For fifteen hundred years his descendants lived in the cold of unheated dwellings, mitigated by occasional roastings at gigantic wasteful fires. Even now a smaller proportion of the whole population dwells in centrally heated houses than in those ancient days. As for baths, they were completely lost till the middle of the nineteenth century.In all this long, bleak intervening gap cold and dirt clung to the most fortunate and highest in the land""

Shadowcat770,2,,0,1rhzht,,7,"[Here](http://imgur.com/a/Lyynx) is an album with pictures of the scrimshaw.


The scrimshaw was passed down through my dad's family, and my mom recently took it to the New Bedford Whaling Museum to have it looked at. I guess the people at the museum were very impressed with the piece, and said they'd never seen this artist before. Ultimately, we would like to figure out when it was made and try to find the artist's name.


The family story goes that the tusk was given to my father's great-grandfather as a wedding present from the captain of a whaling ship. We aren't sure which set of great-grandparents it was given to, and unfortunately any family members that could possibly add more details to the story have passed away.


Originally, because of the drawing of Jenny Lind, the experts at the museum thought that the tusk was made around 1950. However, according to our genealogy, my dad's great-grandparents got married in 1881 (Andrew M. Palmer and Orletta ""Lettie"" Cragin) and 1869 (Benjamin F. Peabody and Ann Eliza Dare). The date will be key in attempting to determine the artist's name. In order to pinpoint the date the scrimshaw was made, it was suggested that we try to find the original photos that were used to trace the pictures onto the tusk.
The people at the museum said that the picture of Jenny Lind was likely from an actual photo or playbill because the scrimshaw shows her with a big nose. I guess artists would usually try to correct her nose when they drew a portrait of her?



For the other photos, originally my dad thought that they came from Godey's Lady's Book. However, the people at the museum also suggested looking in Harper Collins Monthly. I found a plate titled ""The Elopement"" in the table of contents of the February 1850 issue of Godey's Lady's Book, but I haven't been able to find a scanned copy of the plate to confirm that it's the picture on the scrimshaw.



Basically, I have hit a dead end in my research. It would mean a lot to my dad to find the artist's name and learn more about our family history.

jamie_byron_dean,2,,0,1rindw,,11,"I am interested specifically in the personal, day-to-day life of the individual Southern civilian.

There is a great mythology in the south about the unbelievable evil and brutality that the Yankees - ""Lucifer's legions"" - brought in their victory campaigns towards the end of the war - the obvious examples being, of course, Sherman's ""March to the Sea.""

As I understand it, Sherman's ""March"" was composed of several similar acts; the Battle of Meridian, in which he practiced the sort of total war he would later commit to entirely; the march across Georgia from Atlanta to Savannah; and the march across the Carolinas, which was both the worst (South Carolina) and the most lenient (North Carolina).

I am trying to figure out how bad, *really,* these campaigns were for the south. Does it live up to the mythology - raping, pillaging, plundering, roving bands of criminals, mass starvation - of horror and unthinkable tragedy?

The fact that the south rebuilt so quickly makes me think it wasn't really that bad, and that the mythology was deliberately and easily built up out of a fairly civil - if not terribly wasteful and destructive - campaign. 

Can anyone weigh in on this topic? How bad *were* Sherman's marches? How bad did the worst of life get during the war, and where did that happen? What was the most ""horrifying"" part of the war - both in terms of military (like Pickett's charge) and civilian life (life in the aftermath of Sherman's march).

What were the words for these?

I was thinking since we use numbers to tell us what a number is our words don't represent them in the same way as a symbol would. The Latin alphabet had I-V-X-L-C-D-M so I just assumed there would be words given a similar meaning as the letter, since C is pronounced /keː/ [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet) one would assume the word for 100 is something starting with the pronunciation /keː/, witch I assume centuria or what ever the the correct Latin word is pronounced something like Kenturia!? 

also come to think of it, how would a Roman say he was born 30 years ago, I was born ""XXX annus"" ago? or did they have word to define this. I am Norwegian and we just combine the words for 3 and 10 into three-ten (NO: tre-ti), this goes on ""four-ten"" etc. until one hundred, where we say ""et"" (one) ""hundre"" (hundred).

The primary issue that seems to arise is opposition to Shirer's thesis that German people were complicit in the rise of the Nazi party.

Shadowcat770,2,,0,1rhzht,,7,"[Here](http://imgur.com/a/Lyynx) is an album with pictures of the scrimshaw.


The scrimshaw was passed down through my dad's family, and my mom recently took it to the New Bedford Whaling Museum to have it looked at. I guess the people at the museum were very impressed with the piece, and said they'd never seen this artist before. Ultimately, we would like to figure out when it was made and try to find the artist's name.


The family story goes that the tusk was given to my father's great-grandfather as a wedding present from the captain of a whaling ship. We aren't sure which set of great-grandparents it was given to, and unfortunately any family members that could possibly add more details to the story have passed away.


Originally, because of the drawing of Jenny Lind, the experts at the museum thought that the tusk was made around 1950. However, according to our genealogy, my dad's great-grandparents got married in 1881 (Andrew M. Palmer and Orletta ""Lettie"" Cragin) and 1869 (Benjamin F. Peabody and Ann Eliza Dare). The date will be key in attempting to determine the artist's name. In order to pinpoint the date the scrimshaw was made, it was suggested that we try to find the original photos that were used to trace the pictures onto the tusk.
The people at the museum said that the picture of Jenny Lind was likely from an actual photo or playbill because the scrimshaw shows her with a big nose. I guess artists would usually try to correct her nose when they drew a portrait of her?



For the other photos, originally my dad thought that they came from Godey's Lady's Book. However, the people at the museum also suggested looking in Harper Collins Monthly. I found a plate titled ""The Elopement"" in the table of contents of the February 1850 issue of Godey's Lady's Book, but I haven't been able to find a scanned copy of the plate to confirm that it's the picture on the scrimshaw.



Basically, I have hit a dead end in my research. It would mean a lot to my dad to find the artist's name and learn more about our family history.

There is a great mythology in the south about the unbelievable evil and brutality that the Yankees - ""Lucifer's legions"" - brought in their victory campaigns towards the end of the war - the obvious examples being, of course, Sherman's ""March to the Sea.""

As I understand it, Sherman's ""March"" was composed of several similar acts; the Battle of Meridian, in which he practiced the sort of total war he would later commit to entirely; the march across Georgia from Atlanta to Savannah; and the march across the Carolinas, which was both the worst (South Carolina) and the most lenient (North Carolina).

I am trying to figure out how bad, *really,* these campaigns were for the south. Does it live up to the mythology - raping, pillaging, plundering, roving bands of criminals, mass starvation - of horror and unthinkable tragedy?

The fact that the south rebuilt so quickly makes me think it wasn't really that bad, and that the mythology was deliberately and easily built up out of a fairly civil - if not terribly wasteful and destructive - campaign. 

Can anyone weigh in on this topic? How bad *were* Sherman's marches? How bad did the worst of life get during the war, and where did that happen? What was the most ""horrifying"" part of the war - both in terms of military (like Pickett's charge) and civilian life (life in the aftermath of Sherman's march).

XplodingLarsen,3,,2,1ri4qy,,1,"So tried to find something on this, i know the counting like V=5, X=10 etc. But what does the letters mean, i can guess that the word century comes from Latin and means 100 and Mille(nnium) is M but what is L and D, and X, I for that matter? What were the words for these?

I was thinking since we use numbers to tell us what a number is our words don't represent them in the same way as a symbol would. The Latin alphabet had I-V-X-L-C-D-M so I just assumed there would be words given a similar meaning as the letter, since C is pronounced /keː/ [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet) one would assume the word for 100 is something starting with the pronunciation /keː/, witch I assume centuria or what ever the the correct Latin word is pronounced something like Kenturia!? 

also come to think of it, how would a Roman say he was born 30 years ago, I was born ""XXX annus"" ago? or did they have word to define this. I am Norwegian and we just combine the words for 3 and 10 into three-ten (NO: tre-ti), this goes on ""four-ten"" etc. until one hundred, where we say ""et"" (one) ""hundre"" (hundred). Now remember kids English and Scandinavian languages share word because of Vikings invaded your homes! like husband comes from husbondi witch means house farmer (male form) [More words coming from old Norse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_words_of_Old_Norse_origin), but French and Spanish (Latin languages) would say ""cent"" and ""ciento"" respectively for ""hundred"" (derived from Latin)

Shadowcat770,2,,0,1rhzht,,7,"[Here](http://imgur.com/a/Lyynx) is an album with pictures of the scrimshaw.


The scrimshaw was passed down through my dad's family, and my mom recently took it to the New Bedford Whaling Museum to have it looked at. I guess the people at the museum were very impressed with the piece, and said they'd never seen this artist before. Ultimately, we would like to figure out when it was made and try to find the artist's name.


The family story goes that the tusk was given to my father's great-grandfather as a wedding present from the captain of a whaling ship. We aren't sure which set of great-grandparents it was given to, and unfortunately any family members that could possibly add more details to the story have passed away.


Originally, because of the drawing of Jenny Lind, the experts at the museum thought that the tusk was made around 1950. However, according to our genealogy, my dad's great-grandparents got married in 1881 (Andrew M. Palmer and Orletta ""Lettie"" Cragin) and 1869 (Benjamin F. Peabody and Ann Eliza Dare). The date will be key in attempting to determine the artist's name. In order to pinpoint the date the scrimshaw was made, it was suggested that we try to find the original photos that were used to trace the pictures onto the tusk.
The people at the museum said that the picture of Jenny Lind was likely from an actual photo or playbill because the scrimshaw shows her with a big nose. I guess artists would usually try to correct her nose when they drew a portrait of her?



For the other photos, originally my dad thought that they came from Godey's Lady's Book. However, the people at the museum also suggested looking in Harper Collins Monthly. I found a plate titled ""The Elopement"" in the table of contents of the February 1850 issue of Godey's Lady's Book, but I haven't been able to find a scanned copy of the plate to confirm that it's the picture on the scrimshaw.



Basically, I have hit a dead end in my research. It would mean a lot to my dad to find the artist's name and learn more about our family history.

There is a great mythology in the south about the unbelievable evil and brutality that the Yankees - ""Lucifer's legions"" - brought in their victory campaigns towards the end of the war - the obvious examples being, of course, Sherman's ""March to the Sea.""

As I understand it, Sherman's ""March"" was composed of several similar acts; the Battle of Meridian, in which he practiced the sort of total war he would later commit to entirely; the march across Georgia from Atlanta to Savannah; and the march across the Carolinas, which was both the worst (South Carolina) and the most lenient (North Carolina).

I am trying to figure out how bad, *really,* these campaigns were for the south. Does it live up to the mythology - raping, pillaging, plundering, roving bands of criminals, mass starvation - of horror and unthinkable tragedy?

The fact that the south rebuilt so quickly makes me think it wasn't really that bad, and that the mythology was deliberately and easily built up out of a fairly civil - if not terribly wasteful and destructive - campaign. 

Can anyone weigh in on this topic? How bad *were* Sherman's marches? How bad did the worst of life get during the war, and where did that happen?

What were the words for these?

I was thinking since we use numbers to tell us what a number is our words don't represent them in the same way as a symbol would. The Latin alphabet had I-V-X-L-C-D-M so I just assumed there would be words given a similar meaning as the letter, since C is pronounced /keː/ [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet) one would assume the word for 100 is something starting with the pronunciation /keː/, witch I assume centuria or what ever the the correct Latin word is pronounced something like Kenturia!? 

also come to think of it, how would a Roman say he was born 30 years ago, I was born ""XXX annus"" ago? or did they have word to define this. I am Norwegian and we just combine the words for 3 and 10 into three-ten (NO: tre-ti), this goes on ""four-ten"" etc. until one hundred, where we say ""et"" (one) ""hundre"" (hundred).

And while I read the book primarily for it's literary merit and beautiful prose, I wanted to know how true this statement was: ""Well-to-do persons in [Roman] Britain lived better than they ever did until late Victorian times.""

Extended quote:
""For nearly three hundred years Britain, reconciled to the Roman system, enjoyed in many respects the happiest, most comfortable, and most enlightened times its inhabitants have ever had.
In this period, almost equal to that which separates us from the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, well-to-do persons in Britain lived better than they ever did until late Victorian times. From the year 400 till the year 1900 no one had central heating and very few had hot baths. A wealthy British-Roman citizen building a country house regarded the hypocaust which warmed it as indispensable.
For fifteen hundred years his descendants lived in the cold of unheated dwellings, mitigated by occasional roastings at gigantic wasteful fires. Even now a smaller proportion of the whole population dwells in centrally heated houses than in those ancient days. As for baths, they were completely lost till the middle of the nineteenth century.In all this long, bleak intervening gap cold and dirt clung to the most fortunate and highest in the land""

Shadowcat770,2,,0,1rhzht,,7,"[Here](http://imgur.com/a/Lyynx) is an album with pictures of the scrimshaw.


The scrimshaw was passed down through my dad's family, and my mom recently took it to the New Bedford Whaling Museum to have it looked at. I guess the people at the museum were very impressed with the piece, and said they'd never seen this artist before. Ultimately, we would like to figure out when it was made and try to find the artist's name.


The family story goes that the tusk was given to my father's great-grandfather as a wedding present from the captain of a whaling ship. We aren't sure which set of great-grandparents it was given to, and unfortunately any family members that could possibly add more details to the story have passed away.


Originally, because of the drawing of Jenny Lind, the experts at the museum thought that the tusk was made around 1950. However, according to our genealogy, my dad's great-grandparents got married in 1881 (Andrew M. Palmer and Orletta ""Lettie"" Cragin) and 1869 (Benjamin F. Peabody and Ann Eliza Dare). The date will be key in attempting to determine the artist's name. In order to pinpoint the date the scrimshaw was made, it was suggested that we try to find the original photos that were used to trace the pictures onto the tusk.
The people at the museum said that the picture of Jenny Lind was likely from an actual photo or playbill because the scrimshaw shows her with a big nose. I guess artists would usually try to correct her nose when they drew a portrait of her?



For the other photos, originally my dad thought that they came from Godey's Lady's Book. However, the people at the museum also suggested looking in Harper Collins Monthly. I found a plate titled ""The Elopement"" in the table of contents of the February 1850 issue of Godey's Lady's Book, but I haven't been able to find a scanned copy of the plate to confirm that it's the picture on the scrimshaw.



Basically, I have hit a dead end in my research. It would mean a lot to my dad to find the artist's name and learn more about our family history.

There is a great mythology in the south about the unbelievable evil and brutality that the Yankees - ""Lucifer's legions"" - brought in their victory campaigns towards the end of the war - the obvious examples being, of course, Sherman's ""March to the Sea.""

As I understand it, Sherman's ""March"" was composed of several similar acts; the Battle of Meridian, in which he practiced the sort of total war he would later commit to entirely; the march across Georgia from Atlanta to Savannah; and the march across the Carolinas, which was both the worst (South Carolina) and the most lenient (North Carolina).

I am trying to figure out how bad, *really,* these campaigns were for the south. Does it live up to the mythology - raping, pillaging, plundering, roving bands of criminals, mass starvation - of horror and unthinkable tragedy?

The fact that the south rebuilt so quickly makes me think it wasn't really that bad, and that the mythology was deliberately and easily built up out of a fairly civil - if not terribly wasteful and destructive - campaign. 

Can anyone weigh in on this topic? How bad *were* Sherman's marches? How bad did the worst of life get during the war, and where did that happen?

What were the words for these?

I was thinking since we use numbers to tell us what a number is our words don't represent them in the same way as a symbol would. The Latin alphabet had I-V-X-L-C-D-M so I just assumed there would be words given a similar meaning as the letter, since C is pronounced /keː/ [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet) one would assume the word for 100 is something starting with the pronunciation /keː/, witch I assume centuria or what ever the the correct Latin word is pronounced something like Kenturia!? 

also come to think of it, how would a Roman say he was born 30 years ago, I was born ""XXX annus"" ago? or did they have word to define this. I am Norwegian and we just combine the words for 3 and 10 into three-ten (NO: tre-ti), this goes on ""four-ten"" etc. until one hundred, where we say ""et"" (one) ""hundre"" (hundred).

Would you simply retire to a dinner of turnips or would you go about town with friends for a drink, or see a play? Would you be fairly independent? Would you have any time off? 

If not sufficiently knowledgeable about the blacksmithing then any contemporary craft or trade would do e.g. tailor, peddler, etc..

rlaw68,0,,1,1rha7c,,0,"So over this past week I've heard a number of programs around (of course) JFK's assassination...in these, two things came up that I'm interested in this subreddit's perspective on:

1) That JFK's assassination more or less gave Johnson the cover to push through things like the Voting Rights Act that would otherwise have been a much tougher sell for maybe a decade and...

2) That MLK's assassination more or less gave Walter Mondale (and George Romney) the cover to push through the Fair Housing Act that would otherwise have been a much tougher sell for maybe a decade...

I find it interesting to think about these tragic events as having some very unintended consequences that ultimately may have furthered these two men's legacies in ways that might have proved difficult in the moment had they lived.

MurkyBurky,0,,2,1rg5qa,,0,"This is a crosspost from a question I posed in a comment.

A very long time ago I read about the appetite European royalty had for story's from the ""orient"" after Marco Polo's famed adventure. The article I read told of a Rasputin character who would return from the east with amazing objects and remarkable story's of Germany's (or whatever it was in the mid 1800's) connection to the ancient Aryan people of northern India. This Rasputin-like character turned out to be a fraud. But the stories he told to hungry ears left a lasting effect on the German psyche and was even purported by the article to fuel Hitlers obsession with the occult. I've searched again but I'm unable to find such a story

EDIT: (tail between legs) I got upset about this question being downvoted without comment. However after a terse comment reply I was reminded of the politics of running such a useful subreddit and I apologize for any disparaging remarks. Ok can we History now?

Canuck147,0,,1,1rg4tz,,1,"This question has come up [before](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/19fsby/opinions_on_shirers_rise_and_fall_of_the_third/), but I find that answer somewhat vague - it mostly contends that it's views differ from historians without actually elaborating on those differences.

The primary issue that seems to arise is opposition to Shirer's thesis that German people were complicit in the rise of the Nazi party. To me one of the most interesting aspects of Shirer's account were the instances of German capitalists and military officials trying to undermine the Wiemar Republic and institute something closer to a monarchy or military autocracy, but that ultimately Hitler got the better of them all. Obviously I'm not able to evaluate the validity of this narrative.

So, keeping in mind that Rise and Fall was written for a wide audience, and not as academic history, what are it's faults? I'd appreciate any specific examples you can point to. ",What are specific criticisms of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich?,2,askhistorians
