boogerflinger,9369.0,10247.0,15ivs8,4003.0,Edit Woah obligatory front pageThanks chefs cooks and homecookers lots of great tipsHere are some of the top tips Use good tools Things are better and easier when you use good pans and knives Whenever youre sautéing frying or woking dont crowd the pan Prep all of your stuff before starting to cook Read the whole recipe before you begin cooking Meat continues cooking after you take it off the grill ButterAwesome steak technique from ironicouchMy friends mother taught me how to cook steak a few months back so far it has not failed me You have to make sure your steak is dry use a paper towel to dry it off Heat the skillet before putting the steak on you want to hear it sizzle when you place it in the pan Rub the steak down with just a little olive oil and some sea salt and then place it in the pan for until it starts browning so it doesnt take long on the stove then put in the oven at  degrees F for  minutes or even less depending on how rare you like itEveryone has their own method but this was the simplest way I have heard it being made and it always tastes fantasticAnother great steak cooking tip from FirstAmendAnonAlright this is a great method but leaves out a few important details Heres the skinny on getting you perfect steakhouse quality steaks at homeBuy a thick cut of meat like a porterhouse If its more than  thick its usually better Look for a lot of marbling little white lines of fat through the meat The more the betterStick the meat unwrapped on a rack in the fridge overnight watch out for crosscontamination make sure your fridge is clean This ages the meat and helps dry it out Then like an hour before you cook take it out of the fridge pat it down with paper towels and leave it out until your ready to seasonPreheat your oven to really hot like F and stick your ovensafe pan in there That will ensure your pan is super hot and get a sear on your meat quicklySeason both sides of the steak with coarse salt and like a teaspoon of oil I find peanut oil to be better than olive oil but it doesnt really make much differencePan out of the oven using a thick oven mitt Stick your steak in there it should hiss loudly and start to sear immedietly This is the goodness  minutes on both sides then stick about three tablespoons of room temperature butter and three sprigs of fresh rosemary on top of the steak and throw that baby in the ovenafter about  minutes open the oven there will be lots of smoke run your fan and flip the steak  or three more minutes pull it out If you like it more on the well done side leave it a little longer Do not leave it for more than like  minutes because you might as well just make hamburgers Take it off the heat Using a wooden spoon or large soup spoon tilt the pan and repeatedly spoon the butter and juices onto the steak Baste in all its gloryLet the meat rest for about five minutes I use that time to make the plate prettified Mash potatoes or cheesy grits on the bottom Brussel sprouts on the side Maybe some good goats cheese on top of the steak Be creativeThis method is guaranteed to produce a bomb diggity steak Like blowjobinducing  of the time Its really highheat and ingredient driven though so be careful and spend that extra  on the good cut of meatEDIT As a couple of people below have mentioned a wellseasoned cast iron pan is best for this methodAlso the th bullet is slightly unclear You take the hot pan out of the oven place it on the stovetop with the stovetop on full heat and sear the steak for min ish on both sides Then cut off the stovetop and put the steak in the oven,Chefs of Reddit what are some some tips and tricks that everyone should know about cooking,14250.0,AskReddit,2868,1428,top_all

suggestionsCurrently the most upvoted comment isnt a song suggestion but rather a suggestion to listen to the music from the beginnings of its orgins Heres the original comment below as submitted by GiraffeKiller This is like introducing an Alien to the music of Earth I wouldnt know where to start Once youre through your kick on Classical I might start with music from the s and progress through each decade You can really see the growth of modern music like thatI think its a wonderful idea and will be blogging about my journey into the world of music As many of you have pointed out music didnt start in the s so Im going to start with the earliest written form of music Im going to start with Guillaume de Machauts Agnus Dei Composed sometime between  and I am still posting my top  next week It will be a difficult task considering all the submissionsThis week I am going to rewatch my favorite film of all time Baraka This will be my first time being able to hear the soundtrack of the film I will be posting about that as wellAlso for all of those asking the hearing aids I got is the Phonak Naida S PremiumAgain thank you for all the kind words and sharesEven if youre not hearing music for the first time ever I suggest looking through the suggestions and expanding your musical tastes You never know how much more days you have left to hear Trust me on this one you dont want to miss out on a great songIve never understood itMy whole life Ive seen hearing people make a fool of themselves singing their favorite song or gyrating on the dance floor Ive also seen hearing people moved to tears by a single song That was the hardest thing for me to wrap my head around I was born profoundly deaf and all music sounded like trash through my hearing aids That is until a couple days ago when I put on a new pair of hearing aids for the first time in years The first thing I heard was my shoe scraping across the carpet it startled me I have never heard that before and out of ignorance I assumed it was too quiet for anyone to hearI sat in the doctors office frozen as a cacophony of sounds attacked me The whir of the computer the hum of the AC the clacking of the keyboard and when my best friend walked in I couldnt believe that he had a slight rasp to his voice He joked that it was time to cut back on the cigarettes That night a group of close friends jumpstarted my musical education by playing Mozart Rolling Stones Michael Jackson Sigur Ros Radiohead Elvis and several other popular legends of music Being able to hear the music for the first time ever was unrealI realized that my old hearing aids were giving me a distorted version of music they were not capable of distributing higher frequencies with clarity instead it was just garbled gibberish When Mozarts Lacrimosa came on I was blown away by the beauty of it At one point of the song it sounded like angels singing and I suddenly realized that this was the first time I was able to appreciate music Tears rolled down my face and I tried to hide it  But when I looked over I saw that there wasnt a dry eye in the carI finally understood the power of musicObviously I did the only sensible thing and went on a binge of music Below are my top  favorites from my limited exposure to the world of sound Mozarts Lacrimsoa The soundtrack to Eleven Eleven I can see how this comes off as narcissistic it being my own film and all but its such a personal work that when I listened to it for the first time I broke down I felt like I was truly seeing the film for the first time ever Im grateful that Cazz was able to capture the tone perfectly We discussed the film and specific scenes with essaysized reasoningdeliberations on what should be conveyed The critical response to the film surprised me and I still didnt quite get it until seeing the visual images coupled with the soundtrack  Sig Ross Staralfur  IL PostinoLuis Bacalov  Minnesotas A Bad PlaceIronically enough Im turning my hearing aids off more often than before because most sounds are even more annoying and the only times I have it on is when talking to people or listening to musicbirds Silence is still my favorite sound When I turn my aids off my thoughts become more clear and its absolutely peaceful I hope that one day hearing people get the opportunity to experience utter silence What exactly changed between my old hearing aids and my new ones My previous hearing aids were only  years old but technology has gotten cheaper and better at an exponential rate since then Before I could almost hear the low frequencies at a hearing persons level but not as crisp higher notes on the other hand I didnt hear at all I never realized how little of a range my hearing aids picked up compared to hearing people until a telecommunications class in college We were learning about radio equipment and the guest professor told us about how high human ears can hear and also compared to various animals He turned around and turned the dial down to the lower pitches I could still hear nearly all the low frequencies  like rest of the class When he turned the dial in the opposite direction I blanked out at about  and the rest of the class stopped between  Its an odd feeling learning something so profound about yourself at twenty one But its not as odd as the things I can hear nowIt was during Lacrimosa that I realized I was truly hearing pitches Ive never experienced before It was like seeing a color Ive never seen beforeI honestly never thought I would really be able to hear my own soundtracks because I have accepted my deafness I have always been and still am grateful for all Ive been blessed with so it was never a big deal to meNow Im overwhelmed and beyond grateful But this is just the beginning Thats why Im asking you to give me the name of the most beautiful songs to you Ive posted the question on reddit and will listen to the top  upvotes and then post my top  from that batch Original post over at

BunsOfAluminum,2108.0,16798.0,t4gyp,2937.0,Link to originalhttpwwwredditcomraskredditcommentsreSo amazingly crustlessmist and jwild determined the correct license and created a damning visual aid to show it within hours of my original submission I gave the information to the police who took over a week to respond to me but said that they located the owner of that license and served papers to themMeanwhile I had given the same information to my insurance provider Geico They ended up telling me that the other party was also insured with Geico and had submitted a claim just after the accident happened claiming that they were involved in a hit and run I asked and the agent told me that they claimed the car was parked and unoccupied when it was hit The other agent got a recorded statement from me over the phone which was extremely formal She was all business until she asked if she could stop recording and I said yes after which she said Woooooow I havent had one like this in a long timeAfter some talking and investigation by Geico they determined that I was the innocent party and I finally got a car rental from them after a month of sharing a van with my wife and three kids which is a pain when you need to get to work early They didnt want to give me the rental earlier because they didnt know whether MY uninsured motorist insurance should pay for it or if we would find the other party and make their insurance pay for itGeico found out that the insured persons son had been driving that night and decided to lie about the accident when they got home I still figure he must have been doing something illegal at the time since he had insurance and still didnt stop I dont know though The police never told me his name and havent contact me further regarding the issueYesterday they finally inspected and estimated the repairs my car would need Today they told me that they were declaring it a total loss and they will give me  and change for my  Buick LeSabre Ltd Im not a car guy but I remember him saying something along the lines of the rails being warped and the quarterpanels being bowed out and some other things They were just looking at body damage and it was over the value of the car its not counting the mechanical damage that was done I have until Friday to determine if I want to accept the offer for the titleGeico also said they would pay for my medical bills but its a one time payment after treatment is ended I have to give them HIPAA permission to get my bills from my medical providers and they will pay them They also mentioned something about mental anguish and suffering but never mentioned a number I guess a month without my normal convenient mode of travel and initially not being able to walk without immense pain after the accident count as anguish and suffering so how much is that worth I cant really think of an amount that Id be happy to take if it were going to happen to me againSo one day Im sitting at a red light minding my own business and a month and a half later Ive lost my primary vehicle for an amount of money that cant cover a comparable vehicle Still it was exciting to hunt down the offender and at least get him to be held accountable for his prevarications and douchebaggery Thank you for all of the help redditEdit saw the wall of text after I submitted and determined I should add a tldrTLDR Cops found ass who hit me and ran Geico also found him Ass had claimed hitandrun on his own vehicle Geico determined I was right and he was wrong Geico says it will pay for my medical bills Geico totals my car and offers me  I have until Friday to accept I now have no carEdit It is amazingly difficult to keep up with the waves of people crashing into this thread I just want people to know that Im doing my best

Taodeist,6092.0,3908.0,142uxm,2430.0,I admit I had one when he asked me Back when I was about  or  my cousin and I were walking out of a restaurant in central Washington It was late in the evening and already dark There was a very large river nearby us and I saw a light in the sky that appeared to follow low above the it Now there was a small airport across the river so I gave it not another thought to being anything other than a plane But instead of turning left to the airport it suddenly increased in speed and appeared to shoot upwards and quickly across the town Then it flew off to the right towards a smaller town about  miles away It then stopped and hovered above it for just a few seconds before a smaller light came up from the ground appeared to hit the first light and then both zoomed away in the distance I turned to my cousin and he just looked at me and asked did you see that tooTo this day is it the only thing I have seen in my life I can not explain What about the rest of you What is your weirdest unexplained event in lifeEDIT Well I have learned two things from this The first was that the guy was right about a lot people having one weird story The other is that I really should not have tried to read all these replies before bed because now life is terrifying Some of you have apparently seem some scary shit,A man once told me if you want a good story just ask any random person if there was ever an event in their life they can not explain Someone almost always has one weird thing that has happened to them So reddit regardless of whatever you belief about the world do you have a story as such,6338.0,AskReddit,31023,7143,top_all

BunsOfAluminum,1650.0,6214.0,r0e88,2420.0,Here is an albumhttpimgurcomaHzYJT of some pictures taken the night it happened and pictures taken this morning in the daylight The officers tried figuring it out but none of their guesses brought back any drivers I live in Virginia but this happened in a small city that has a university with  resident students so the license could be from any state or even Canada I supposeI have liability insurance on this vehicle Geico told me that if they cant cover me that I can at least get coverage through the Virginia Uninsured Motorist fund or something to that effect My concern is that my back is very screwed up from this it was a massive jolt Ive had moderate trouble walking sitting and moving today because of the pain My car also started cutting off while driving to where I suddenly lose power steering breaking acceleration etc while driving Shifting into neutral and starting the engine fixes it for a while but I only did that enough to get home TLDR Got rearended while stopped at a red light and the guy drove off My car is broken and my back is pretzeled and my only hope to find this hitandrun class act is to decipher the license plate smudge he left on my bumper Please helpEDIT  Remember that the imprint is backwards from what the license actually saysEDIT  The Virginia DMV has an apphttpswwwdmvvirginiagovdmvnetplatepurchaseselectplateaspPLTampPLTNO for trying out different license plate messages if it helps It seems to tell you if a license number is available tooEdit  Thank you to whomever gave me a month of Reddit GoldEdit  Oh my goodness I just crawled out of bed and saw that the comment count has risen from  to  Time to start reading Thanks everyone for lookingEdit  crustlessmist figured out the plate numberhttpwwwredditcomrAskRedditcommentsrelastnightiwasrammedwhilestoppedataredcxem and jwild made a convincing graphic showing how that plate number matches up with the impression on my bumperhttpwwwredditcomrAskRedditcommentsrelastnightiwasrammedwhilestoppedataredcytb Following that amazing stuff the following unexciting update I attempted to leave a voicemail for the officer on my case but the voicemail system was not letting me in for some reason so I called nonemergency and talked to an officer there who offered to give the officer a message for me Im going to try later today to call again With this being a smaller city and it being the weekend Im thinking I might not have luck until Monday but Ill keep tryingEdit  No updates from anyone yet I figured Id go ahead and put the part number from the pieces I found on the ground here One of them says      ITW    UP TSOPG    gtPPEPTlt    R TOYOTAand the other one says UP     TSOPG   gtPPEPTlt TOYOTAThe ITW on the top one looks funny like it was scratched in by hand Im trying to get a picture up but imgur is having problems Here is a picturehttpiimgurcomFkSjpg had trouble focusing with the cellphoneEdit  Update The officer on the case called me and I gave him the information that Ive gotten here He told me that he is actually off this weekend so hes going to run the tag information on Monday and see if he finds anything So I guess Ill have to wait until Monday to learn anything new I did give the same information to my insurance company so maybe theyll get back sooner I dont knowEdit  Update The officer on the case works nights I believe I was hit at night so I dont think hes going to run the plate number until tonight sometime My insurance company wanted to wait until today to see what the police came up with although Ive let them know about all of the work you guys did too I havent heard anything today The officer said he would try the plate number and see if anything came back Obviously we all know somethings going to come back because the report someone ran came back with a VIN number and Ive had some anonymous reports PMed to me that point that license back to a town that is only  miles away from here so Im confident that MRTNS is the guy Now I just need to keep the officers and insurance agents on it Ill report back once something more significant happensEdit  Didnt hear back from anyone Tuesday Wanted to give the officer a chance to call me I believe he works nights and wanted Geico to get a chance to do their own thing and call me back I called Geico and the office on my case today around am Left a message with the officer telling him that Im following up on the lookup he said he was doing because theres a felon out there and Ive been going to the doctor and my car doesnt work so Id like to get insurance rolling Im going to call again later this afternoon I think I need to be annoyingEdit  Ive been calling Havent gotten a call back from the police yet and I cant get the officer on the phone to speak with only voicemail Geico let me know that they got the guys address from the plate number and sent him a letter telling him to contact them I told them Hes the offender in a hit and run What makes you think hell call you My case worker is currently trying to get permission to run a report cross referencing their entire database to see if the guy has been involved in other claims and who his insurance provider is I feel like theyre probably doing what they canI just left another voicemail for the officer and told him that Geico was able to get the guys address from their database so I would assume that he should have been able to as well and to please contact me to let me know whats going on and gave him  different phone numbers he could reach me at Im going to keep calling and am considering the current advice of getting the local news involvedEdit  I left a voicemail a few days ago with the Investigations Office informing them that I was not getting any calls back from the officer on my case and could someone please let me know whats going on That night a Sergeant called me at home and told me he would be leaving messages with the officer and the officers training officer letting them know that I need to be contacted This morning I finally got a call from the officer letting me know that they found an address for the plate but havent been able to contact the person yet He said hes hoping to be able to charge the person by this afternoon and that hell let me know either this evening or tomorrowPossibly humorous sidenote He started his message to me I was at work and he called my house yay online voicemail with I just wanted to shoot you a message the first part of which caught me off guard PEdit  The officer called my house again a few minutes ago He said he served papers to the guy and according to my wife said that the individual seemed like he was just going to plead guilty and get it handled of course speaking to a lawyer may change his mind The officer said that I probably wouldnt be needed in court unless the guy went for a trial in which case Id be subpoenaed but for now my insurance company should have enough to be able to pursue the guys insurance All in all it feels rather anticlimactic,Last night I was rammed while stopped at a red light and then the guy took off leaving me with a LOT of back pain and a significantly damaged car but nobody to take the blame Does anyone out there have the skill to decipher the guys license number from the imprint it made on my bumper,8634.0,AskReddit,12484,154,top_all

for my shitty evening with Mr Revolutionary Lifestyle So now I just popped open a beer for all of you wonderful people and going through the comments I feel almost lucky Fucking hell some people are awful Hope youve all had better luck since then As for myself I just chalked it up as a lesson part of my screening for dating now would include asking the guy if hes into health supplements haha Really thanks to all of you last night roughly at this time I was moping around after getting home from that date Now I have countless hilarious stories to read through while drinking and kind messages from you awesome bunch worth itStorytime warning wall of textSo Ive known this guy for almost a year now not really good friends or anything more of casual acquaintances we have a bunch of common friends and see each other from time to time parties etc A couple of months ago he started messaging me first on Facebook then by text he got my number from a friend he didnt ask me for it and most of the time I responded just to be polite Hes nice enough but not really my type so when he started dropping hints about meeting up I just turned him down and said Im busy or wed just catch up the next time theres a gathering with our friends that sort of thingFastforward to last week and he asked me out again which IIRC is the th time in the past  months I finally decided to at least give him a chance cos hey what could go wrong anyway and who knows what Im missing and all that jazz Worstcase scenario it would be awkward but weve talked more than a few times so I was thinking it cant be that bad and we could actually have a pleasant timeDate night comes and we meet up in the city after work We have dinner nice cutesy Japanese place conversation was okay I was certain at this point that its really not going to take off he really isnt my type but I was having a pleasant enough time and he was a total gentleman and not bad to talk toThe bill comes and I was going to suggest a quick coffee before heading home However he said that theres something hed made an appointment for us for and we need to rush off to make it in time I was a bit intrigued and excited was it a movie or a show a play he knows Im into theater So we hurry off and he took me to a highend luxury mall with an attached wing for offices we went up wait this is an office lobby what theIt was a fucking weightloss centerSo he explains that hes part of this company he works for them on a parttime basis as a distributor and he wanted to introduce me to their products which would revolutionize my lifestyle and make the healthier Ive ever been in my entire life FYI Im  and lbs I was totally stunned at this point so I was just nodding like an idiot the whole time we were walking inside He then left me with his smarmy teammates who proceeded to give me an orientation about their company and a runthrough of their health supplements when he got to the part where the weightloss products are the smarmiest one said Oooh now this is what youve been waiting for I saved the best for lastI just sat through it because I knew that if I started to say something I was definitely going to burst and make a spectacle of myself there was a seminar ongoing and we were at a little table to the side After I flatout said that Im not interested in any of the products and frankly dont believe that I need health supplements I eat well and exercise regularly they started on the nd phase introducing me to the business aspect of it Basically it was a networking model of business where you not only sell the products you also recruit people to sell them and they would be under your team and you get a commission for every sale they make They rhapsodized about the wonders of the product how easy it is to sell and how much money I could be making because they could tell I have the right kind of personality and network for it Registration was only  and it was consumable in products which I could either use or sell to get my registration money back immediatelyI wish I could say I flipped the fucking table and screamed at them to fuck themselves with their health supplements and hope they overdose on their products but no right after the talk I just said I should head home since it was getting a bit lateThe guy actually messaged me to say that he had a good time and he hopes to see me again and that I would reconsider their products and the business opportunity I called some friends up and went out for drinks because fuck your health supplements thats whyTLDR Went on a date guy brought me to weightloss seminar tried to sell me  worth of weightloss products and then tried to recruit me to join their networking business ,Dear Reddit Last night I finally went on a date with

blindwithworry,525.0,1086.0,ak2b8,2341.0,I posted this here originallyhttpwwwredditcomrAskRedditcommentsprfksoistumbledacrosssomensfwpicturesofmykid and then this updatehttpwwwredditcomrAskRedditcommentsswtsomykidsisterwasputinamentalhospitalby back in OctoberSummary I innocently stumbled across naked pictures of my little sister on the Internet From advice I received here on Reddit I confronted her about them I found out after spying on her that the issue was much larger than it first seemed She ended being put into a mental hospital because of me and I hated myself for thatOkay so my little sister Julie was in the hospital for almost two months During that time she refused to see me My mom my dad even two uncles and one aunt She saw them at visits But she refused to see meI was convinced the entire time that the reason she didnt want to see me was that she hated me I must have reread my second post about this a hundred times just to reenforce my belief that I had done the right thing by telling our dad about the situation Believe me the comments in that second post really did sustain me Ive never loved Reddit so much as I have during some of the worst sleepless nights Ive gone through nights where I felt like the shittiest brother ever Reading your assurances that I had done the right thing really helped me get along through this very difficult timeWe were told two weeks ago that she was scheduled to be released on the st of December This had nothing to do with money or insurance my parents were paying out of pocket for her stay there but cost was never an issue Apparently she has adjusted well to her new medications and is in much better more sober state of mind now I was thrilled to learn shed be home for Christmas I dreaded seeing her only because I have not seen her since the intervention that led to her being hospitalized in the first place I was so worried she hated me that I even told my mom upon hearing the news of her release that I would gladly crash at my friends house for a whileMy moms response Are you crazy She wants you to be the one to pick her upSorry I still get tearyeyed when I remember thatSo it turns out that the reason my sister didnt want to see me that entire time two months was that she was embarrassed She didnt mind seeing our parents or our uncles and aunt but she just couldnt handle seeing me She felt like shed let me down or somethingI drove nearly  hours out to the hospital last Monday only the second time Id ever been there alone and greeted her in the reception area She literally ran over and jumped into my arms when she saw me I cried like a baby Reddit and Im not embarrassed to admit as muchWe talked a ton during the drive home She has a much firmer grasp on her condition now then she did before Best of all and Reddit was right about this she does not hate me for turning her inShes healthy Shes safe Shes on medications to deal with her Bipolar disorder And she actually thanked me for intervening before she did something stupid like meeting up with that one guy aka AssholeI worried so much for so long for nothing My little sister still loves me And I did do the right thing Thank you Reddit for all of your thoughts and comments during this time Ive been feeling miserable for so long because of all this but your thoughtful comments and suggestions helped me from going into despairThis is why I love this site Thank you againedit A few things First to all of you wellwishers thank you so much for the kind words and good wishes They mean so much to me you have no ideaSecond to the antimeds crowd Get a job Sure meds are sometimes overprescribed I wont argue that But my sister didnt have an episode or a temper tantrum that was misdiagnosed as Bipolar Type I Disorder While Im sure that happens sometimes you are in absolutely no position to gauge what my sister was going through You dont know her but I do and trust me the girl who was posting those long crazy messages on those image boards The girl who confronted me and threatened me with all kinds of crazy nonsense the day after I talked to her The girl in short who was off her medications That was not my sister That was my sister in a manic episode If you have to ask the what the difference is between a manic episode and typical teenage angsttemper youve never seen one I hope you never have to too because they are scary Scary scary Sorry I didnt mean to go on a tirade about that Its just frustrating to read some of the holierthanthou you do realize Bipolar is the ADD of the s right type of messages this post has garnered So fucking annoying Go give L Ron Hubbard some money but STFU on this post pleaseAgain Im sorry The vast majority of the responses here have been so supportive and uplifting but the few trolls who managed to get a bunch of upmods for being contrarian did sort of piss me offDone being angry Reddit Oh as for her long term care Shes going to be in IOP Intensive Out Patient for the foreseeable future That means starting in January daily visits to a local clinic where shell receive both group and individual therapy Shes also going to see the psychiatrist she took a huge liking to at the hospital once a month until she finds a new doctor to replace her Shes fine with all this and is actually excited about it She has this journal she keeps showing me that she writes in when she starts to feel unbalanced She says its like her own private group therapy but she cant wait to be in the real thing againOur dad took away her computer but he set it up in the living room right next to the television set and shes free to use it whenever she wants She has absolutely no privacy on it but she seems to be okay with that I think the biggest test will be when she goes back to school She lost an entire semester because of her hospitalization and shell be needing to go to summer school to make up for it and while she says shes fine with that I know it sort of bums her out Plus school is usually a trigger so Ive noticed for her bad depressive and manic periods But I really believe shes ready this time Ive never seen her so strong and resolved to handle her condition as she appears right nowWell thats it This is most likely the last ever thing I type using this account As I mentioned in my original post I have a real Reddit account that I often use and I simply created this one for this particular issue I am very glad that I did too Reddit came through for me in a big way I hope that others out there who are in any kind of strangeheartbreakingetc type of situation look to this experience and find inspiration to share their own story whatever it is The trolls and the assholes try to grind us down but Reddit is good at fighting back I so fucking love this place I love you all yes even the trolls and the assholesAdieu adieu from blindwithworryedit the last Okay forgot to mention as to the AssholeBelieve me like most of you I want to go after this prick I really do I actually had a huge argument with my father about this about a month ago When I calmed down though I realized that the legal advice he was getting was correct fanning flames risks spreading fire What my sister needs now what our family needs now is time to heal Would it feel good to crush that motherfucker Sure Would it draw everything out though Definitely That would not be a good thing Sometimes what feels good is actually bad or at the very least can make a situation worse than it already is Let me put it like this Say I posted his Gmail username here And Reddit went to town crushing him in all sorts of ways So he decides Heck that bitch ratted on me Ill show her and he ends up reposting the obviously selfshot images to every site and imageboard maybe even here on Reddit Not only would that humiliate her but it might have legal ramifications for herWhats done is done Trust me I know its a bitter pill to swallow Id like nothing better than to meet this asshole someday and do things to him that would get me life in a state prison But when you think on it logically what good does that do for my sister For myself For my familyAs tempting as it is to send his wife an anonymous letter too theres just one problem I dont have his address In short Im just going to have to leave my revenge fantasies to my imagination and Tarantino movies This assholedouchebag will likely slit his own throat one of these days anyway In the meantime no fanning the flames Doing so spreads firesand those are the final words I swear this

other workers could not stop smiling All of them seemed really excited about what they just witnessed and honestlyI was really stunned that  of us had independently decided to pay for the car behind us  After the madness that was Black Friday and the horrible behavior that usually accompanies it I just couldnt help but be amazed at what I had inadvertently been a part of Ive paid for peoples mealsgroceriescoffee before especially around the holidays but Ive never been on the receiving end of a pay it forward chain or somebody that helped keep one going I know the  of us didnt solve any major world crisis this morning or really help anyone out and the woman behind me may not have actually liked having her drinks purchased by mebut the semianonymous gesture of buying your neighbors coffee on a cold Sunday morning justmoved me I just couldnt stop smiling It was as if kindness was contagious this morning D And just thinking about a possible pandemic of kindness leaves me breathless Im sure this isnt even the most impressive pay it forward scenario that people have encountered so I want to hear your tales Maybe some of us have all been a part of the same chain of kindness  Edit So far it looks like drivethru cafes and tollbooths are common places for this type of maskedgoodwill haha Though Im really impressed with how uDrunkdillweed may have started a

a typical American drive thru you will pull into a driveway that wraps around your favorite caferestaurant Shortly after pulling into the driveway you will roll up to a giant menu with a microphonehttpblogskudlcomfilesstarbucksdrivethrujpg and this is where we place our orders Then you pull up to the window to pay and pick up your beveragetreatshttppulsecomwpcontentuploadsdrivethrujpg Once you or any other car pulls away from the giant menu the baristawindow worker has the orders totaled up So if you notice a long line of cars behind youhttpbpblogspotcomJIvGDgSTUTUwNVtghDIAAAAAAAABKUCopWCapfZZssStarbucksDriveThrufsjpg and youd like to do something nice for the person behind you you can tell the worker that youd like to buy the other drivers order too No guess work is needed about the amount since its already been totaled Hope that clears some stuff upEdit  While Im still planning on updating the above list to help folks navigate around this incredible thread this will likely be my last ramble First thank you for sharing your wonderful stories I enjoyed reading all of them  Second thank you to the anonymous gifters for the reddit goldNow I know several of you are still critical of this kind of behavior and I definitely apologize if youve ever been a recipient of one of my errant coffeecup gifts and just dont get the point of all this I think the biggest concern is that this type of act conflates helping people in need with giving a superfluous gift to someone who doesnt need it I never wanted there to be a weighing of the two types of acts especially since one is obviously more significant than the other but I dont believe the latter is totally inconsequential I mean one can never be  sure that the person standing next to you isnt suffering somehow That they arent trying to cope with a terrible loss or struggling through a horrible bought of depression But still a coffee cup doesnt do any substantial good for those folks either but it may just brighten their day a bit which I think does everyone a bit of good At the worst it was a free annoyance What ultimately makes this experience and others like it so beautiful for me and why I think so many others love the concept is that no one was harmed nothing was solicited and the only thing that connected a bunch of strangers for a brief moment in time was a piece of shared kindness in the form of a cup of coffee  These moments are also poignant reminders of just how important it is to give to those who are struggling If a prepaid cup of coffee toll charge carwash bar tab or meal can make such an impact on so many of us I cant imagine how life changing having someone providing for your actual needs can be Thank you again for these wonderful stories and Ill still try to add newhidden ones to my list above Take care Reddit,The car ahead of me paid for my coffee this morning so I decided to return the favor by paying for the person behind me I was then told that I was th person in a row to pay it forward Any of you experience an unexpected pay it forward moment like that recently

DomPolanco,4494.0,9391.0,dm89e,2300.0,Alright my GF whom I live with  A redditor as well if it matters  walked in on me while i was having a little five on one time and she immediately walked out after seeing me in an awkwardly wrench like position  You guys know how it is literally  seconds before youre about to clear the snorkel and you dont want to get it on anything in front of you so you make a little  degree turn to the left or right Ok so she walks out  and like the guy that I am I finish saying goodbye to the colonel of love and continue browsing the web like its no big deal right I start hearing SOBBING outside the door I go outside and she goes OFF on me She goes APE SHIT how could you do that thats disgusting thats not normal you have a fucking gf why do you do this to me do you not love me am I not attractive anymore do you want me to be some porn slut She then left the apartment and I have not heard from her yet  its been  hours  I love my gf dearly but im not sure what just happened Is it really that big of a deal  Like am I a douche for wanting some self diddling time   WTF DO I DO REDDIT Im afraid when she comes back I wont be able to say anything to say should I apologize  Say itll never happen again  HELP ME REDDITEDIT Please dont make this a front page post my gf is a redditor too I just wanted some quick answersEDIT She called me was sobbing a little I told her we need to talk She said ya and said shell be home in a couple of hours shes with her mom  IS SHE GOING TO TELL HER  EDIT  I just received a text from her my mom is coming over with me clean up a little Im leaving going to a friends house I do NOT want to deal with that if she told her  I smoked a little to calm down and I dont think Im ready for a parental confrontation EDIT  Im at my friends house now and you guys made this front page wow FU Ok to clear some things up though between us We have an AMAZING relationship we NEVER argue we have fun together just her and I I love this girl to death I hate seeing her unhappy To clarify our sex life is amazing Whenever shes in the mood Im down And yes there are times when Im in the mood and shes not that I give her the space needed This is normal though  Guys do generally want it more then women  It doesnt bother me and weve been together for about a year and a half and I have Waxed the Winnebago before but she has NEVER caught me This is actually the first time Ive ever been caughtAnd Ashley since I know youll read this ILY I know youll hate me for doing this but please read some of these comments Im sorry that you felt it inappropriate and im sorry for not talking to you about it ever I think youre the most amazing girl in the world and again im sorryEDIT  She read this the stupidest shit gets to the front knews so now I have to go over there Today rgonewild gets me in trouble then reddit finishes me with a front page fatalityEDIT  Guys the whole FU  reddit getting me in trouble stuff is not serious I just say stuff like that to lighten the topic Im saying it sarcastically I love reddit and agree with most of youI understand shes overreacting which is why I am going to talk to her but you guys need to understand as well that its someone I care about Someone I care about felt hurt due to something I did Sure it might have been an overreaction nonetheless someone I care about felt hurt Also Im not apologizing for making the cyclops fight a  headed monster Im apologizing to her for posting it here  Even though logically to you guys its a story you dont know us so it shouldnt really bother her because its not like Im going to my moms housePun intendedAlso this conversation just has never really been brought up personally between us I never thought about bringing it up because Ive seen it normal since i was  years old And she just never brought it up eitherI am  years old she is EDIT  I have not read all of the comments posted to many for me to keep track of but I know It pisses me off when I read a story that is happening and the author doesnt update it so ill do my best to update it and keep it private at the same time So I go home unlock the door try to open it The little chain is on the door Her mom comes towards the door and says hi with the stupidest smuggiest look I have ever seen in my life  Her mom never liked me to begin with  and says thats disgusting straight away and walks away from the door leaving the fucking chain in Im not the kind of guy to lose my temper specially when its regarding women but me and her mom have never had good blood between us so the way she said it pushed me over the edge I guess Well anyways she walks away and I kick the door and break the stupid little chain and I told her in a louder then average voice that it wasnt her fucking business and I needed to talk to her daughter in private  to clear things up between us  sooooooooo she gets her bag calls Ashley over and she calls me an aggressive sex deviant Then she tells Ashley  were leaving  and I look at Ashley then ask her if shes actually going to let things get to this point over nothing after everything weve been through She says you didnt have to kick the door open like that Dom you need some time to calm down  and they leaveAnd thats where I now draw the line Im done with this you and your mom Ashley Ive done nothing but be nice to you treat you with respect ALWAYS go out of my way to make and keep you happy You should honestly let her read this thread so she can realize what a fucking CUNT she is Tell her to stop using the fucking tanning bed because her skin looks like the leather off of an Alligators asshole I kicked the door open because its MY FUCKING APARTMENT Honestly Im glad you caught me making my baldie puke because if it wasnt for this I wouldnt have realized how much like your mother you are My phone is OFF dont call or text me Im going to SMOKE AND MASTURBATE ALL NIGHTPRE UpdateFor all of you who say this is fake I would like to help you guys out Tomorrow morning Ill take pictures of the door incident and post them here as update  I still have my phone off so no updates on her I havent even touched gtalk or msn either Now I would also like to say that if she does message me tomorrow I am definately going to consider what she has to say because we have been together for a long time and I have never seen this side of her shes still someone special to me As mad as I may get those kinds of things dont change overnight But dont get me wrong if she tries to defend any of her actions I will as you guys say masturbate on her things while looking directly in her eyes like a boss jokeMaybe she will realize it was an extreme over reaction and come to her senses If not honestly the thought of being single is not that bad of a thing Good night for now redditors and reddettes Thanks for everything if this post is still going in the morning ill make sure to post an update on the situation If it gets boring ill just leave it beUpdate  and probably the last updateI did as planned last night even though I felt like shit about it It hit me that I could seriously lose someone I care about over something miniscule Its just eating at me even though YES I know shes at fault she may be immature shes over reacting shes socially uneducated about the general populations  including my own  beliefs in certain things but shes also an amazing talkerlistener fun person to be around shes smart witty  and ill stop now before this gets too stupidSo yea I turned my phone on and there were  messages The first two were we need to talk please call me the other two were call me now Dom Im serious  and the last one stated that if I can so easily turn my phone off and vent about our relationship on reddit instead of talking to her then we need to take some time apart to reevaluate things  Now I know most of you will say See you shouldnt have been immature and turned your phone off but the truth is had I not done that I would have said things I probably would have regretted she may have as well in return I wanted to wait for me to calm down before talking to her evidently that was a mistake and now she will be coming over on Saturday to pick up some of her stuff with her mother Maybe its for the best and maybe you guys are right and I did dodge an emotional trainwreck of a bullet  which I still find hard to believe due to how our relationship was prior to this incident   but it still feels like SHIT It feels like theres a blender inside of me This is it Reddit you have just witnessed a relationship go to hell due to an overly obsesed piece of shit mother who will ruin her daughters life if she doesnt realize what shes doingI feel helpless right now Im still kind of like wtf Im tempted to publicize her mothers contact information so that you guys can have a go at it But after reading some of the comments left here I will indeed take the high road and let it be No work today and im single So Ill just smoke away my stupidity of feeling bad and play the  shitty games I have on steam  CS and CSS I think     IF any of you redditors would like to join me in steam dont hesitate to add me if you dont mind playing shitty games to pass time my steam account name is FjufjuAnd I bid you farewell from this post at least Ill always be amongst you redditors upvoting and spending  sleep hours a week on reddit Thanks for everything the insightful posts the comments that made me laugh and even the harshreality posters I guess I need to open my eyesOne last time for redditLIKE A BOSSbut lifes a bitch,My GF walked in

plzbecrazythrowaway,6390.0,15652.0,pcidy,2294.0,Regarding missing information I do not know what happened I messaged mods about it a few hours ago when  my post disappeared along with  comments I just woke up from a nap and checked my phone luckily my browser still had the page open so starting now I am going to start transcribing the info from the phone to the post DONE Everything repostedSo I may just be paranoid but I came home last night after being gone all day to find my exterior garage door keypad was left open my remote then would not close the garage door the garage door remote when I clicked the close button would just flash the light on the garage door opener three times The door did close when I pressed the wall openerNow this alone is not that big of a deal weird stuff happens with electronics But then my mind started racing with all of these things that have happened over the years so I started thinking about those things and went to investigate around my Town House I present to you my list of evidence to you convince me I am crazy or tell me Im not Regardless give me some ideas on how to test if there is someone in the attic I have never been in the attic I tried to open it once I had a step ladder and I could not get enough leverage to lift it up it seemed stuck so I just put the box in my extra bedroom I investigated the attic entrance last night and noticed  scuff marks on the wall a finger print on the door below the attic entrance There was also a fair amount of dust that had dropped from the attic entrance onto the door that is where the fingerprints were I have never noticed anything out or place or food or drink missing The only exception to this is the door knob on the door that goes out to the garage I noticed on day that it was coming apart I had assumed that I had simply slammed the door while leaving and broke it myself but I have no recollection of anything like that Yesterday when I come home the door handle looked more broken I rarely lock this door  Twice that I can think of I have heard a loud noise upstairs when this happened I slowly found a big knife and went upstairs to look around each time something had fallen down a closet door once and some boxes the other time I live alone and work crazy hours Often  AM to  PM and another  hour days on weekends I love my job So there is plenty of time for a person to exit and enter the house I never did a home inspection when I purchased the property because of time constraints with a tax credit As such since the last person moved out the attic has never be accessed Speaking of the previous resident The property was a short sale and was being rented to someone for  a month When I went on a tour of the house the house simply had a sleeping bag and some clothes in a bedroom I have lived here for  yearsHoly shit I think my have just convinced myself but I feel crazy calling the cops cause all of the evidence can be explained in one way or another But there is no way in hell I am knocking on the attic door What can I do to prove someone is in my atticI just ordered a Wireless IP camera system but it will not be here to TuesdayEdit Uploaded Pictures of Attic Door Knob Scuff Marks Finger Prints in dusthttpimgurcomaeLhUpdate  Just called the Cops So yeah This is either going to make me feel like an idiot or make me freak out cause someone is living in my atticUpdate  Well this sucks I only own a step ladder As such the Deputies listened to my story stood on the step ladder and could not climb into the attic Then they told me its probably nothing and suggested I replace the locks reset the garage keypad entry and put tape on the attic door or nail it shutSo I guess I am where I started but feeling more like an idiot The deputies did appear to understand my concern that was niceNow to tape the shit out of that door close the door the bedroom and build a fort of boxes in front of the door And I guess I am borrowing a ladder from work tomorrow Update   AM  I finally went back up stairs taped the door closed the door to the room where the attic entrance is taped that door and positioned a bunch of heavy stuff that will fall if they open it I am not trying to trap the person in I just want to know if they left I also setup a USB webcam on my computer downstairs that will record to a online location if it detects movement I also deactivated the keypad on the garage door I am now going to my workplace I will be returning after work with a ladder and coworker with a handgun and a tripod with a videocamera and a led strip to provide lighting Update   AM  I am now at work in my locked office with the door looked and the building security system on and honestly kinda still freaked out about this whole thing Im going to try and get some sleep   Update   PM  I am at work right now but since so many people are asking for an update I got here at work and sat in my office locked with the security system on and I was honestly still freaked out and could not sleep I took that time to get a tripod setup with a flashlight and video camera so I can look up there without having to put myself in much danger I am going home early today so expect the next update to be around  PM CST   Update   PM  Going upstairs to check this outUpdate   PM CST Sorry for not including this before I headed up stairs with a ladder and camera attached to a tripod and light attached I was honestly too embarrassed to ask a coworker to come and help me look so I took the advice of my fellow Redditors and I manned up I went up stairs and used the ladder to move the hatch and then I used the camera to look up there without having to stick my head up there And There was nothing I climbed up the ladder and had to stand on the nd to the top rung to see over the ledgeIm  foot  inches tall And there was nothingSo end of the story is there is no one in my attic Would I have done anything different if I could redo this entire experience YESI tell people all of the time to stop letting fear hold you back and cause you to be inactive So why did I not just act Call the cops earlier Get a ladder sooner Find a Camera Do something but give in to my fearThank you Reddit for your jokes your distractions your honest advice and your motivational rudeness I think in some way shape or form I needed all of it As my Thank You to each one of you I promise to read each and every comment and take them to heart but even more so I promise to be a man of action not inactionVideo httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvMonWVMfiUampfeatureyoutube,I think someone may

FURTHER The matter is being taken seriously now and everything can move a lot quicker if the school isnt being flooded with email and concern I promise you action has been taken Thank youI am not asking for therapy but help in gaining momentumSince the beginning of the school year I have been harassed both inperson and online by the schools bully It is hard to use the word because almost everyone knows and loves him I tried not to let it get to me until it escalatedGo kill yourself No one would care if you died Why arent you dead yet This was said to me multiple times online and in the middle of class As a teenager dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts I could not laugh this off I went straight to the office and demanded to see a vice principal I was sobbing uncontrollably and visibly a danger to myself but they just sat me down and had me fill out a form I called my Dad who cancelled his flight outoftown to come be with me He was furious that he was not called in a situation like this We had a conference with the vice principal and we were told there would be consequences if it happened againIt has been months Multiple people have gone to the office with complaints about his bullying and absolutely nothing has been done Not so much as a detention He is now attacking the leader of our schools GSA members and myself through twitter Curiosity got the best of me and I decided that I needed to go through his history to get hard evidence Here are a few gems I found some submitted by other people There are actually over  screen shotsLife has its

want to be on this planet and people are taking time out of their day to wish that I would die I think this has passed what the school can do They lost my faith when they didnt help everyone else who begged for some sort of relief after me I live in Anne Arundel County How can I get my story and the others out there so that we can see some real change before it is too late TLDR The bullying isnt worthy of school attention unless I die Edit Its not just me I have screen shots of him saying things about a TON of people who I am sure have no idea it exists Going to bed for tonight I will NOT let

this morning and I see an unusual amount of cops around the school I find the group who was going with me into the office and we sat in guidance waiting for the counselor to see us all There were about six of us Next thing I know someone asks me if Im Sarah They had been looking for this Sarah all morning and had even called down another girl by the same name I get taken into one of the counselors rooms and a BOOK of these comments is placed in front of me She tells me that she has gotten a ton of emails and that the page has been forwarded to several teachers and the principal I was shocked Thankfully she was not upset about the emails though some of them were a little nasty I learn that my Principal has been up all night trying to deal with all of the emails she has been getting Though she seemed a little mad at first we quickly settled everything I was taken into a room with the principal the counselor and an administrator to share my story again I printed off every tweet and the cops collected any threatening ones They might be able to do something about it which is amazing because I wasnt expecting it at all Im still shocked that many of the school officials were just now learning about this kid but I know now that they know every body knows Nothing can happen immediately but the process is starting and consequences will happenI am slightly scared about the possible backlash but I feel amazing knowing that even if people dislike me for it I stood up for my own safety I have a ton of support both from you guys and my friends Thank you everyone who sent an email they kept mentioning some guy from Montana There is no need anymore to contact the school or the county about this issue I will be checking in every morning with the counselor and she will give me a pass to see her if I ever feel like Im being harassed over the next few days You guys made this all happen overnight and sped up the process tenfold I dont think I can say thank you enough for helping me and everyone else finally deal with the school cyber bully I love you Reddit,The cyber bullying has gotten to the point where the school will not take any action unless I kill myself Reddit

searchingforolivia,847.0,7383.0,f1saj,2157.0,When I was four or five years old there was a girl in my class who had very few friends My mom always told me to try to make friends with everyone at school so one day I walked up to her and and asked her if we could be friends I would play with her on the swings and sit next to her during class I remember her being very shy but a great friend I had so much fun playing with her and we would make believe about swinging all the way out into outer space  we even made up a song One day suddenly she stopped coming to school  our teachers told us she moved away to another state I was sad to know I couldnt see her anymore but I accepted that she had leftRecently while talking nostalgically about the past my mom was able to tell me the truth about what happened to my friendHer name was Olivia though we both cannot remember her last name She attended Dallas International School and was in the same class as me in preK this must have been circa  I couldnt remember this but my mom told me that Olivia always came to school in tattered clothing looking very unkempt My mom remembers that when attending birthday parties her mother would drop her off and only pick up her daughter many hours after the party had ended and all the other children had been picked up These were little things that the other parents noticed but that could very easily be concluded as an unfortunate financial situation where the mom worked and therefore could not pick up her child on timeHowever one morning my mom was watching the morning news and she was shocked to find out that Olivias mother had murdered her childrenfamily and then killed herself Reddit I know that this happened over a decade ago but it still deeply deeply saddens me to find out that my friend died I tried to research her story online but I figure there must not be very many reports from the s Also because these are only my moms memories we cannot remember how she killed her children how many children she had etc I know this is an extremely long shot given how little information there is to work from but I wanted to try my best to pay my respects to Olivia after all these years If you could help in any way to figure out what her story is I would be incredibly grateful EDIT  Reddit I cannot thank you enough  within fifteen minutes of posting Olivia and her story were found thanks to jacques and a few other posters several moments later You have proven to me once again that this is a truly wonderful community and I am very grateful I am not sure where to go from here  I feel as though I am mourning a loss many many years after the fact  though I know I can finally rest knowing that she will never be forgotten Once again Reddit  thank you EDIT    hours and this thread has reached the front page of Reddit I am overwhelmed with emotion and am so happy that Olivia and her story have incited such a response from this community that never ceases to amaze me I apologize for my lack of replies  I broke down after reading her story and have sought some immediate solace in the company of very close friends who have made this easier to bear I will get back to as many of you as I possibly can Once again Reddit you are all truly amazing  never forget it,My mom recently sat me down and told me the truth about my childhood friend Can you help me research her story,9540.0,AskReddit,1455,1,top_all

alcimedes,7283.0,9212.0,hqyxq,2105.0,So Ill give my example here I was reminded after reading the post about someone warning a kid buying from an undercover copBack when I was in school the University newspaper ran a story about undercover cops using a younger cute girl to camp outside the liquor store just offcampus and ask people to buy her beer  Shed give the people money then ask them if they wanted to come back to her vehicle and share one as a way to say thanksGet back to where her car is supposed to be van door opens up cops inside and youd get a ticket for underage buyingLater that evening my friend and I were going to this same liquor store to get some beer when we were approached by a cute girl who asked us if we could buy her a six pack of beer since she was underageBeing a dumbass I said sure took her money and we went inside  About  seconds later I remember the piece about the undercover cops and realized we were about to get arrested  At that point we decided the best thing to do was to buy a  pack of super expensive root beer blowing  of the  she gave us and we put it in a paper bagWe walked back out and she asked us did you get it to which we said yeah of courseShe invited us back to her car to have one each as a thankyou  Sure enough we head to the back and theres the black vanThe door opens up cops sitting in there with headphones on etc and they tell us youre in a world of trouble nowI put on my best trollface and said really  I really thought you guys could use some root beer sitting out here in that cramped van all nightThere was an awkward pause and then they opened the bag  Root beer nothing elseThen they told us to get the fuck out of there and we were interfering with a police investigation and if we didnt leave wed get arrestedWe walked across the street to our apt building went into the various laundry rooms and yelled out the window every time she approached someone that it was a sting  They left after  min of thattldr  cops tried to trick us into buying beer for an underage girl we took their money and bought them root beer insteadedit  For those saying this would have been entrapment it wouldnt have beenhttpwwwlectlawcomdefehtmgtA person is entrapped when he is induced or persuaded by law enforcement officers or their agents to commit a crime that he had no previous intent to commit and the law as a matter of policy forbids conviction in such a casegtHowever there is no entrapment where a person is ready and willing to break the law and the Government agents merely provide what appears to be a favorable opportunity for the person to commit the crime For example it is not entrapment for a Government agent to pretend to be someone else and to offer either directly or through an informer or other decoy to engage in an unlawful transaction with the person So a person would not be a victim of entrapment if the person was ready willing and able to commit the crime charged in the indictment whenever opportunity was afforded and that Government officers or their agents did no more than offer an opportunity I would have been screwed because of the three things required for entrapment they didnt do gtSecond the government agents then persuaded or talked the person into committing the crime Simply giving him the opportunity to commit the crime is not the same as persuading him to commit the crimeShe just asked she didnt persuade  She offered the opportunity thats it  If Id said no and she proceeded to badger me it would be entrapment but I just say sure,Trolling law enforcement  whats your story,11317.0,AskReddit,21944,2458,top_all

iaacp,3704.0,11199.0,x0tpe,2106.0,So for the summer weve had an intern He started around June Hes a pretty cool guy and he gets along well with the office The first few weeks he was fine We gave him simple tasks to ease him in which he picked up on Over time we gave him more and more but nothing too hard or too high a work loadNow for the past month or so hes been completely slacking off I noticed the work flow coming from him has slowed dramatically and he seemed a bit more lazy in general So I asked my friends in the IT department to give me a report on his internet usage Surprise surprise Browsing the internet plenty of reddit even some youtube here and there All times of the day at a high volume When we last talked I brought up that work had slowed and asked why His response was that he felt his work had gotten more difficult  which is BS because hes very qualified for what Ive assigned to himIm not a tough boss and Ive never had to confront a worker before  our office has always had really great employees So how should I go about this Give him a stern talking A friendly one A joking message through reddit that says Get to work anonymously Hes a good kid hes just been lazy latelyEdit OP has not abandoned you all dont worry As for all the comments about interns shitting yourselves  good It might be you I call into my office later today or tomorrow Straighten up and get to work The more I from interns here the more I want to prank himYes I plan on talking to him either this evening or tomorrow morning Yes I will update Some have asked how much he makes and if its for free definitely not free labor  THEN I would probably understand He makes around hour if I recall correctlyEdit  The hour of reckoning is nearhttpwwwvhcomcelebritybweimagesprairiedoggifEdit  Edited the poor bastards name out because the sound of so many interns shitting their pants in this thread is too beautiful Unfortunately there wont be time to call him in today  a meeting came up and I have other stuff to do by the end of the day Hell be called in first thing tomorrow morning and I will update you beautiful sons of bitches Going to try and keep it light hearted but at the same time keep firm that he does need to get more work done and that his browsing needs to decrease drastically We are okay with some browsing just not the amount he does One last gem called friend in IT had him check again since he did earlier today Looks like he  cleared his browsing cache and cookies probably upon seeing this thread Stay tunedEdit  Guys we arent hiring right now Im sorry  Please dont PM me I cant get you a job If I could I would  but youd probably go on reddit as much as this guy And then Id have to come to raskreddit on how to deal with the situation And then Id get more PMs asking to be hiredEdit  Really we arent hiring I promise I cant get you a jobUpdate after our talk So I met with him in our small conference room this morning He seemed really nervous Asked how he was doing how work was going etc Asked if he had anything to air out if he was happy with his work interested in it etc etc He gave me mostly small answers like yes and no while remaining a little nervous So I asked the okay well do you know why I asked you here while remaining friendly not stiff heh or anything He had this shit eating grin on his face and said uhh you dont go on reddit do you to which I also had a shit eating grin on my face We laughed and I said how browsing the internet is fine and I dont want to have to monitor him but we need more work coming from himSo then I asked if he has trouble focusing or is bored with work or whatever It mostly came down his lack of focus which I can completely relate to I was very recently diagnosed with ADHD as an adult and we are close in age We talked about things that would help him stay on track I recommended getting up out of his cubicle every hour for  minutes or walking around on our floor and drinking plenty of water Maybe take  minutes at lunch and go for a walk He responded well to all of my suggestions and I feel like the talk went great Then I had to inform him where we go from here like someone suggested here I told him were not here to baby sit but to help him grow and learn as a programmer We need to make sure his time is being used appropriately If I notice another decrease in work thats when the the punishments are going to have to get serious and Im going to have to inform my boss about all of this which will likely result in early termination You know to let him know were cool but we are still professional and work has to be done I also told him if he feels like hes drifting again or needs more assistance to contact me before he goes back into this loopAs we parted I said to take  mins to browse reddit or whatever and then continue on his assignment Little did he know I had my IT friend redirect reddit to his own GET BACK TO WORK page just for a short whileI believe the problem is fixed Thanks to

PDub,1793.0,1236.0,ag96s,2088.0,So one hour after I finished my last final my mom calls to tell me she has just been suspended She was told that she would get the remainder of her contract which is payment until August and was then ordered off the premise I thought this was kind of shitty but at least she has  months payToday the principal that fired her she is a teacher said they are breaching the contract and not paying her Normally this would be something she could take to her union but she couldnt afford insurance and the union so this was the first year she has not been in the unionThe first year she is not in the union and they fire her on christmas and breach contract She called her old union rep and he said that they are fighting this kind of thing all over the place but they wont represent her because this is the first time in  years that she was not paying union dues She was even promised by the secretary that was going to handle the paperwork that she would get full pay on wednesday That secretary was fired todayThe principal said If you want to fight it hire a lawyer I think that collectively we have  dollars between me my brother and my mom and the lowest that we have heard from a lawyer initally is  grandthere is a tiny mortgage on the house about  grand or so but if she cant pay that she is going to lose the entire houseI dont know what to do my mom doesnt know what to do and my brother is in the Navy so he is completely oblivious to the problemIn summation My moms school district fired her broke her contract because she was not in the unionFrankly I only post this here because Im desperate I have no idea what can even be done I wrote I dont know what to do twice here This is effecting my posting skillsAlright this is against all my better judgment and I feel like a pandering idiot for even setting this up but a lot of people are telling me to do it so here a donate

have  emailsD make that  emailsI thought Id update you all on the plan that has come up from all this The NLRB keeps unions in check and apparently what my moms union has done may have been against the rules and I have the form to submit to the NLRB concerning the union rep If the union thing does not work someone has contacted me with a lawyer they know that may take the case Pro Bono oh how many times have I written that today and wanted to write ProBoner At the very least a scary letter from a lawyer may do the trick and get the contract reinstated If all else fails your donations will at least keep things afloat for some time Alternate If All else fails taking this to the press I list this as a last resort because I dont see my mom going for it She feels really bad about the whole experienceThat is all for right now Being Friday night not much can be done over the weekend in regards to this whole mess so any real action will have to wait until Monday I think this is why they

DrRob,7036.0,37300.0,xf5c2,2071.0,Hi all  Im a psychiatrist  My main area of clinical work is emergency psychiatry and my main research interest is functional brain imaging  Id like to start a discussion about the rapist thread which I see as a serious danger  In a nutshell Rape is a crime which sometimes hinges directly on feelings of power over the victim   That power often loses its meaning if the victim is unconscious  Many rapists typically need a victim who knows they are being victimized   This victim is the rapists audience  This is crucial The audience gives the rapist pleasure euphoric delight from unfettered witnessed suffering  That euphoria is intense and is possibly driven by the same neurobiology involved in a drug high Now when Reddit invites rapists to retell their stories they offer an audience of thousands  The possibility that individuals reading these stories will be horrified afresh is very appealing to some rapists  Its neurobiologically very much like anticipating drug useNote  the audience doesnt actually need to be horrified  In the mind of the rapist the possibility of horrifying an audience is what is appealingEver wonder what makes addicts keep using  A major factor is the craving that comes from recalling the feelings associated with the pleasurable activity or drug  Cocaine addicts active or in recovery who are asked to think about using cocaine have measurable brain changes precisely when they report cravings  We havent actually measured this in rapists but we suspect its highly analogousThus the Reddit rape forum is very possibly triggering rape cravings in rapists  It is also teaching rapists how to rape better via shared stories the same way we teach new participants to improve in any field by sharing our experiencesI plan to be available to discuss this so jump in  For those more curious about the guy behind the message Im a frequent guest on the Caustic Sodahttpwwwcausticsodapodcastcom PodcastEdited at  pm to eliminate gendered language  My apologies for insensitivity  I was pretty anxious when I was writing this and my bias showed  Any gender can rape any genderSecond edit at  pm Pacific  My credentialshttpwwwredditcomrAskRedditcommentsxfcredditareyouawarehowdangeroustheaskarapistclubgxcontextThird edit at  pm  Edit  Caustic Soda has confirmed my identityhttpswwwfacebookcompermalinkphpstoryfbidampid on their Facebook pageFourth edit  pm  July  My point is that speech has power and it can be dangerous  I wanted to outline why it might be dangerous in this instance  Is censorship the answer  No  Responsible and accountable speech is the answer  I dont know what the answer is  That question is in the domains of law and philosophy for it is a question of values a question about how the world ought to be  My point is about how the world is and it stands whether or not there is free speech  Also yes I fully agree that rape is a complex phenomenon with multiple motives  Im speaking specifically about sadistic serial rape which can indeed involve euphoria and the triggering of cravings  Ive made edits above as well to soften the tone  Also removed the distracting asterisksFifth edit  a number of people have requested links to research about rape and rapists  All links are to free fulltext articles so you can read in depth if you wish  Here we go Male rapists in this sample were x as likely to have been physically violenthttpwwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlesPMCtoolpubmed to a female partner Male rape is x more likelyhttpwwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlesPMCtoolpubmed in societies where gender inequity is normalized In this sample of  men  had raped a woman and  were multiple rapistshttpwwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlesPMCtoolpubmed  The most common motivation stemmed from ideas of sexual entitlement Men do indeed get raped and they have enormous difficultyhttpwwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlesPMCtoolpubmed disclosing this In this sample of  men  reported forced sexhttpwwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlesPMCtoolpubmed a finding consistent with assessments from Western countries In violent offenders there are close relationships between substance abuse and consequent criminal offences such as physical assault rape armed robbery attempted murder and homicidehttpwwwhdbporgpsychiatriadanubinapdfdnbvolnodnbvolnopdf Highly psychopathic individuals including serial rapists have measurable differences in brain morphologyhttpwwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed compared to controls Not available as free full text,Reddit are you aware how dangerous the askarapist thread is,39371.0,AskReddit,4639,15,top_all

aphroditewhities,6211.0,15809.0,13km6a,2032.0,I was  and two girlfriends and I had gone to the theatre in my neighbourhood to see Ghost Rider my first mistake I know We had gone to the pm show so it let out around midnight Its the only large theatre in the area so its always filled with moviegoers but there is very little staff and the hallways are deserted when any movies are in progress This is all especially true for the late night showsWhen our movie finished my friends went to the bathroom as is necessitated by the female movie theatre ritual and I elected to wait out in the secondary lobbyThat was probably my second mistakeThis theatre due to its lack of staff often has more people sneaking into the theatre than people paying for tickets It is very very easy to simply waltz in through a side door when another person is walking out I was the only one in the hallway which made me a target for an extremely large homelesscrackedoutlooking  year old black man only relevant because Im pale as fuck and he could not pass as my dad He was built like a truck Generally Im extremely outgoing and can talk with strangers easily however the moment I noticed this fellow approaching an overwhelming sense of fear washed over me and my brain kept telling me to get out of there fast My naive yearold self decided to stay where I was thinking Theres no way in hell anything bad could happen to me since Im obviously invincible to the world Bad shit only happens in the news Dont judge a book by its cover aphroditewhities Hes probably a lovely guyHe approached and asked me if I had any cigarettes I said no and that I didnt smoke when he suddenly reached out and grabbed my hand He stood there shaking my hand saying how he was just dying for a cigarette increasing his deathgrip every time I tried to pull my hand away He kept closing the distance between us while strangling my hand and eventually he had me backed into a corner all the while he keeps fiddling around with something in his pocket I dont know what it was he never took that hand out of his pocket the entire time He kept saying how he wasnt even there to see a movie just wanted some cigarettes He was insistent that we go get cigarettes and kept trying to steer me towards the side doorI was so scared that I was probably on the brink of pissing myself I looked to see if anyone was around only to notice my two friends standing outside the bathroom door  not doing anything while this man was forcing his body onto mine in a public place They were the only people around and they were just standing there Understandably they later said they were confused as to what was happening and didnt know what to doThankfully a movie lets out right in front of where the man has me trapped Every single person passed by without so much as a second glance Shit I thought Im gonna get kidnapped This man wouldnt take his eyes off of mine for a second and pushed his chest against mine every time I looked around for help I was too afraid to yellSuddenly a group of three guys probably only around  or  years old came straggling out of the theatre They didnt notice me at first but just as they were rounding the corner out of the lobby one of them turned around and stared at me oddly He mouthed do you need help and I nodded as discreetly as I couldThe guy came running up and threw his arm around my shoulders saying things along the lines of thanks for waiting babe You ready to go That was a great movie huh Im glad we went in the end Whos this guy The man instantly lets go of my hand keeping his other hand in his pocket and backs away quickly mumbling how he just wanted a cigarette and then he ran out of the emergency exit at the back of the lobby My guy escorted me outside and I was in such a state of shock that I think I just hugged him and ran away to my mom who had been waiting in the parking lot I had been so sure that no one was going to help me not even my friends and in such

YamaRoo,1851.0,4878.0,142m0f,2010.0,I think its only fair that I start if Im going to ask others to share things that may be personalIm male  and have had HIV for  years When I was  I moved out from San Diego to Kansas City to be with my boyfriend of  years He just had heart surgery he is only a year older than I am it was due to a faulty valve and wanted to move back home to Kansas City I followed him and a month later he dumped me I was stranded out here financially and trusted people I shouldnt have After a couple quick failed relationships I gave up on love and looked for lust hey it was still attention I went online to find someone to play with and we played bare and thats all it tookI didnt cope well Most of my close friends backed away or abandoned me at the time I stopped going to school quit work didnt pay the bills and found myself on the streets A friend took me in and told me to get my shit together and I didRight now Im going to college full time work in web design full time been in a relationship for  years with someone who is HIV negative and am taking life one day at a timeStatistically Ill die before my friends but it has made me appreciate life a lot more and enjoy their company It sucks but Im still alive and thats what counts right TLDR Boyfriend of  years broke up with me went looking online for sex got HIV Have had it for  yearsEDIT Couple of things since Ive found similar questions being asked and feel its best to answer them hereWhats life like with your HIV negative boyfriend Its fine Small things have to be remembered When playing with each other we do things that are low risk Oral no swallowing use condoms jerk each other off Those sorts of things Im a bottom so it is a very low risk but low risk doesnt equal no risk Other than that when I get injured I play rugby and I rock climb or hurt myself I have to remind people not to get near my blood if they can avoid it Why is HIV more prevalent in the gay community Many reasons Mostly that anal sex will usually tear part of the inner walls causing blood Those pipes werent meant for that kind of abuse ultimately Thats why its such high risk for bottoms The vagina is a little more resilient but its still an exchange of fluids Nothing is  remember thatWhy did you have sex without a condom Because I was caught up in the moment didnt want to ruin it and Im an idiotWhy did I talk about this I dont look for sympathy in posting this Ive come to terms pretty easily It was my fault and I deserve it Im doing this so others out there dont feel alone Though we might have contracted HIV differently most of us are dealing with the same things Its good to let others know theyre not aloneEDIT  More things I missedHow do you feel about people who make jokes about HIVAIDS I have no right to complain honestly I make jokes about it to make it easier and Ive used it to jokingly guilt trip someone into small things You cant just eat my yoghurt But Im dying God damn it Fine you can have it Ive also made jokes at the expense of others due to their plights so Im not sure I have room to complain Regardless Ive always had a sunny disposition about things so honestly I prefer humour over not talking about things If you can make me laugh about whats trying to kill me you must be an alright person And yes I laughed at the AIDS song in Team America because that was a very good parody of RENTWhy were you getting tested so often Everyone should If youre sexually active its the smartest thing to do It protects you and it protects those around you that you play with I know it may seem a bit odd but asking people for proof of their last test shouldnt be so damn hard in our society Between offending someone for asking them for their resent STD test results or getting HIV because you trusted someone Id pick the option that doesnt try to kill me Get tested and get the people you know to be tested Awareness and education about these things are important It shouldnt just be for the gay communityWhy dont you fix your title I know I know I messed it up and you cant edit titles This is what I get for rushing the title to get to the body of the post Ive made a horrible mistake LAST EDITWhy not do an AMA I wanted this to be more about everyone else and an outlet for them to tell their stories just in case they felt like no one else would listen to them and the ability for people to read others stories Nothing about me is special There are plenty of people who have HIVAIDS and have just as much if not more to say than I do I dont feel theres really a demand for it and since I have no scientific answer but merely personal ones I dont see how it would help othersThere is an overwhelming number of positive posts in this thread and it makes me happy I appreciate the sentiments For those who just spout of the first hateful thing you can Id love to refute the things you say but it simply isnt worth the time I dont know you and you dont know me It seems itll stay that wayFor those that shared their stories I thank you It isnt always easy and I appreciate it For those letting others know theyre loved and not alone thank you And for those who generally wanted to know more and read this thank you You guys are good peopleSadly its that time for me to pass out so I wont be able to respond I hope people keep up the discussion and keep up the awareness If this can keep even one person from having to go through the same thing it was worth it already Have fun but be smart about it,Since today World AIDS Day I thought it would those who feel alone and isolated if we talked about it For those of us on Reddit who are HIV how did it happen to you How did you cope How is life for you at the moment,6888.0,AskReddit,0,0,top_all

Jonnism,5470.0,11458.0,11ofxj,1977.0,It was six years ago when I was eighteen I had been in my first year of college so needless to say my student diet wasnt that great My boyfriend and I were house sitting for a friend and on the third night there I was awoken to the most terrible stabbing pain in my stomach I tried to get to the bathroom but I ended up collapsing on the floor in a near fetal position barely able to breathe and sweating profusely My boyfriend hears me fall and gets up to see what is wrong I cant speak the pain is so great and I am having a hard time breathing so he painstakingly leads me to our friends car and drives me to the hospital At this point Im in so much pain from him not really knowing how to drive a stick and jerking and stalling along the way that he has to go in and ask for assistance Im loaded onto a gurney and strapped in because the outstretched position nearly kills me with pain and I start lashing out After the doctor cuts off my clothes and sees no outward injuries on my stomach he begins to compress on my stomach which nearly makes me pass out He thinks my appendix must have burst or that I had a ruptured intestine Im administered IV Morphine and finally get some relief They roll me down the hall and take some instagrams of my stomach To get the Xrays back takes a while so while we were all awaiting the pics I was administered more morphine Eventually a big woman with a Texas accent enters the room and exclaims Youre full of shitWhat I ask completely confused and holding my stomach Im serious Im in a lot of painOh no doubt she said and pulls out an Xray of my stomach See all that white in your guts She points with her pen and traces all the way from my anus up through my large intestines You are LITERALLY full of shit I have never seen someone so full of shit in my lifeMy boyfriend erupts in laughter and the nurse is trying her best to hide her amusement as she has been tending me through the hours and knows that I am obviously in a lot of pain I groan but am a bit amused myself It WAS pretty funny after all I ask the doctor what they were going to do about it and she said that they were going to do an enema and see how that went I was given laxatives and a ton of water and told to wait  minutes I can feel my stomach rumbling a bit at this point and it hurts me a lot when it does Eventually a nurse wheels in what looks like a dominatrix sex rack complete with ankle and wrist straps My boyfriend again erupts into a fit of laughter I am not amused this time Im starting to get a bit embarrassed so before we begin I ask that he leave He pretty much begs me to let him stay but Im having none of it After he leaves the nurse wheels in what looks to be some sort of futuristic pressure washer Im pretty much right She straps my ankles and wrists to the rack in an upright position and proceeds to insert the tube into my ass Its uncomfortable and cold but hey Im gay so its like whatever She then turns it on and like the first mate on the Titanic begins to slowly increase power and pressure I can feel and SEE my stomach begin to inflate slightly and OH MERCY does it hurt like nothing else It felt like knives were pushing OUT of me now ever so slowly I cry out but she insists MORE POWER and I keep filling up like a balloon hollering in agony After a minute or so of constant pressure she turns it off and tells me to clench up because she was removing the tube I want nothing more than to do just the opposite but I assume she knows what shes doing and follow orders She then attached another tube to a hose and inserts it This one is MUCH bigger and the lube is cold as fuck but Im gay so its still whatever She then proceeds to Hoover my mother fucking insides After  seconds I hear a hmmm I ask her what the problem was and she told me nothing was coming out but I beg her not to pressure wash my guts again At this time the doc comes in as shes pulling out my butt plug and informs me that the shit packed in my colon is too wide in girth to be machine enemad out She was going to have to do this manually She has the nurse grab a bucket a plain white janitors bucket and puts it underneath me She then puts on the latex gloves completely lubes up her hands and begins what I consider to be some sort of medical fingerbang to loosen me up After a while of this I was trying to keep my mind focused on something other than this butch PE teacherlookin southern woman giving me assplay legally so I wasnt keeping track of time she brings out a stretching device and begins to open me with it At this point I feel so ashamed of myself but Im also doped out of my mind The pain begins to come back in full force and I start shouting for more painkillers but Lady McGuyver down there tells me that they cant administer more because it will stop me up even more Im just going to have to deal with it until they can unclog me So I endure as Im being stretched It hurts like hell down on my asshole too I feel her fingers in there and she tells me to push So I push I push so hard that I feel like the blood vessels in my face are popping My head starts to bang Im pushing hard and shes telling me to push more I must have been screaming my head off I cant imagine that I wasnt Finally I felt something give She told me to push more and I did I could feel things moving So I push some more After a minute I finally feel myself deflating as water and shit debris tumble out into the bucket It all happened very quick after that I was unobstructed and gushing hot lava a minute later and finally felt complete utter blissful relief I was told after I woke up in the hospital  hours later around  PM that the doc literally helped deliver my shit child I had never been more embarrassed in my life But as time passes and my humor evolves I find myself laughing about it I changed my diet immediately after and have a good healthy bowel movement at least once a day I found it strange how my depression lifted a lot after that I had been severely depressed for a couple of weeks before that and I found out that being constipated does that So your turnTLDR Got severely constipated so much that I had to go to the ER where enemas and laxatives didnt work A woman doctor had to crank my asshole open and help me deliver a shit baby with her handsEDIT GRAMMARZEDIT  GriftyGrifter recorded my story on audio for
