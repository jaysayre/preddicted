Princess_Honey_Bunny,114,,165,1rg853,,565,"BACKGROUND: I work at a mattress store. Selling(whatelse) mattresses. The law in North Carolina says that we cannot sell used mattresses. We follow this law strictly. To avoid angry customers being stuck with something they dont like, we offer a 'comfort guarantee' where you have 90days to decide you dont like it and come exchange it for something else. This comes with a fee of $200 as we have to throw the like new mattress out.  

STORY: In comes a guy. Hes visibly upset, all I can think is [""here we go""](http://i.imgur.com/8MmamRX.gif) lets call him Angry Asshat(AA)

AA: I hate my mattress! 

ME: Im so sorry to hear that sir woul-

(he cut me off)

AA: I want my money refunded immediately, and I want you to come get that shit off my property **Today**

ME: Im very sorry but we cant refund your money. 

AA: [WHAT?! WHAT DO YOU MEAN](http://i.imgur.com/HouBhTG.gif)

ME: Well sir its illegal in the state of North Carolina to take used mattresses and we cant take it back. 

AA: WELL I WANT IT THE FUCK BACK NOW I DONT RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE([he was just yelling nonsense at me about how this is whats wrong with the world and its all the dirty liberals fault](http://i.imgur.com/OudLd7s.gif))

ME: Sir, I cannot break the law for you. Not only is it the store policy its **the law**

Now hes raging, but Im trying to salvage the situation

ME: What we can do for you though is our 90 day comfort guarantee swap out. Can I have your name Ill look your ticket up and well see what we can do. 

He seems to calm down a little bit and he takes a seat across from my desk and he gives me hi name. I look up his name and pull up his ticket as Im explaining the comfort guarantee I look at his ticket. And then at the date he bought it(ya know to make sure its at least close to 90 days) I was willing to be flexible to make this guy happy when I notice he bought this mattress 9months ago!! Im flexible but not *that* flexible

ME: Uhh Sir, Im sorry to say this but you bought this mattress 9months ago, that 6months over the 90days. Theres nothing we can do for you. 

That when he became absolutely IRATE with me. Screaming something about how this is bad business practice, he deserves to get a refund, we owe it to him. Blah blah blah. [Im done this this shit](http://i.imgur.com/InDPcFn.gif)

ME: SIR. There is nothing we can do, the comfort exchange policy was explained to you when you bought it, if you didnt like the mattress you should have come back 6months ago, now Im going to have to ask you to leave the store. 

Well he didnt like that very much. He was becoming increasingly angry and hostile. Hes leaning over my desk pointing his finger right in my face([Which I hate](http://i.imgur.com/u77ThfE.gif)) but I keep my cool, and as sternly as I can say

ME: Sir if you dont leave immediately I will be forced to call the police and have you removed from my store. 

He paused for a moment with sheer rage in his eyes. Then he SLAPS!(yes slaps) the coffee on my desk across the 5mattresses that are close to my desk, gives me the finger and walkes out! I was in shock I composed myself quickly, called the police, and then my boss and explained everything that happened. 

I guess that asshat forgot that he gave us his address to deliver the mattress to, he ruined about 5beds which he was made to pay sticker price for on all of them(sticker price is close to $300 more than what we normally sell for) 


Although I was scared I made a great commission on all the beds he had to replace. There was justice that day and it was great.

jessajuhanabi,30,,92,1rhnqp,,398,"As of last Thursday, I am the head manager of a retail outlet and cafe, answering only to my boss, since the only girl above me quit. All people that walk in, call or email come through me. My boss is normally around but he works on coffee machines most days. 

As backgound for this story: His brother is a c*nt. I live in Australia, so that term seriously fits him. He owes a bunch of people money, is generally an asshole, and my boss is very sad his brother has changed so much. It stresses my boss out as their finances are tied due to a trust. 

Today, a lady walks in around 11:30, and walks up to the front desk. Politely, she asks me, ""Is (boss) in?""

In my mind, she was another person that he knew since he's been running this business for 20+ years, or a rep from some company that I didn't care about. He turned around to look at her, and I pointed in his direction. 

She immediately starts spouting about how boss's brother, we'll call him AH for asshole, owed her money. This is not a surprise to boss. He knows her. He's heard from her over email before. In which he told her he has no access to the trust and he's also fighting AH for money. 

This does not please the lady, henceforth known as douchecanoe. DC repeats over and over, despite pleas from my boss to chase down AH, ""I'm not leaving without my money. Get it for me.""

Now, DC wants a hefty sum. A couple thousand dollars. My boss offers her a coffee while he tries to reach AH. A water. A chair. Nothing. She stands in front of our stock and repeats herself over and over. ""Give me my money. Give me my money. I don't care its not my problem. YOU pay me.""

Why is she going after my boss? Because she's gone through the courts, they told AH to pay, and he still hasn't. Her response? Come into my store and stand there all day every day until HIS BROTHER, pays her. 

Now, my boss tries and tries to get her to understand he has no access to the money. No go. So instead she stands in our store, silent, for 4 fucking hours. Four. DC stands there so long my boss gets fed up and stressed, and leaves. 

The difference is, he's a peace keeper. I was itching for him to leave. I was just going to have the cops come eject her. I was EXCITED. 

Unfortunately she realized rather quickly I was not the ""nice cop"" type so she stood out the front, called in a few friends and intermittently yelled ""YOU KNOW THIS IS SO SILLY I JUST WANT MY MONEY FROM THE (BUSINESS)"" and ""I KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE IN XXXX SUBURB I COULD RUIN A BUSINESS IF I WANTED TO."" through the window at me. 

Oh god. You scare me so much. I might pee my pants. 

Anyway she eventually gave up and left without coming back inside, probably since I was watching her and smiling, willing her to come inside so I could call the cops. 

Oh well, another day I suppose! Maybe she'll be back tomorrow...

SS_material,103,,92,1rhs01,,304,"I work in a Pet store, and had a lady check out, take her stuff to her car, come back in, ask for the bathroom directions, and came back to me asking for a manager.

Now when I was calling my managers phone, I had asked her if there was a reason and she replied, ""Oh yeah, there's a reason alright.""

Hmm..okay. I told my manager and she came to the front to talk to the lady. She had stepped to the side, away from me and talked to her. Then she began to tell another customer what happened sayinf ""that's just anti christian! Can you beleieve that?""

So I think to myself, oh boy what sign pissed her off. Because we have celebrate the season everywhere. Later, I asked my manager what she had complained about and she told me that she was upset because I didn't tell her Merry Christmas.

What...it's not even Thanksgiving yet! My manager did say it's fine, and that I'm not in trouble. I don't have to tell her Merry Christmas, or Happy Holidays unless I wanted to. I started my first retail job in August of this year, so it's gonna be fun during the holidays when people get angry at me for ""offending"" them.

I will tell you merry christmas if you tell me merry christmas. I will say happy holidays when the time is right. Or I will just wish you a good day. Sigh.",So it has begun. The war on Christmas by Christians for saying happy holidays.,396,talesFromRetail
DolfyuttSrednaz,58,,45,1rh8hc,,204,"I have got to say, after working 4 years in retail, parents should be responsible for their children's actions. I have seen so many kids acting like demons that have just spawned from a dimension full of pointy sticks being shoved up their asses, but I never blame the kids. I usually don't even blame the parents, because kids are kids, but when customers blatantly let their kids run around like Sonic on meth, I blame the parents. that is why we have an announcement that plays every few minutes, reminding customers to keep their little shits in line. So when a customer like the one I had comes in, I usually inform my manager (who will be called Jared) of the situation and he watches the kid from a distance. 

A middle-aged couple stumbles into the store with their 7 year old son. They head off to furniture, but their son makes a bee-line to toys. I immediately call Jared, and let him know that this little tornado is heading to toys and he should try to contain the damage as much as possible. Before the kid makes it to toys, he stops over in the Halloween section and starts putting on masks and runs around the store trying to scare the other customers. After 4 complaints, Jared stops the kid, and drags him to his parents, who don't give one shit nor a giggle about what my manager has to say and wave him off. The kid bolts towards toys, and stars ripping toys down off the shelf. The floor looks like a miniature Antietam by the time he is finished. Now he has an armload of toys and decides to take them to the bathroom. Once in there, he places them on the floor, and proceeds to urinate on them. Jared walks in on him finishing up, and drags the kid back to his parents, leaving a trail of piss footprints behind him. Jared tells the parents what he did, and that they have to clean up the mess. This switches the parents into rage mode. They just cannot BELIEVE that their kid would do this! And he will be punished severely when they get home. Jared tells them calmly ""I am punishing you, not your child. You guys made no effort to control him, and even brushed me off after the first incident. You guys will clean up every mess he has made, and then you can leave. You are no longer welcomed here."" They start yelling profanities at him and their kid, saying how this is ridiculous and they shouldn't have to put up with this. 

After they cleaned up, they left empty handed. Jared received many compliments on how he handled the situation. It is the second worst customers I have ever had, even if I didn't directly deal with them. The worst, by far, has to be a couple out of towners. That is for another day though.

racheecakes,8,,49,1rhjav,,205,"This sub is usually full of complaints and although I have quite a few I have a short, nice story to tell. I work in the dining room at one of the lovely bakery/cafe chains in America. We are very lax on people lingering in our cafe, especially the homeless. We allow them to stay in our building in the single comfortable chairs for as long as they want as long as they're not pestering our customers. (It's not like we're hobo central, there are only two or three regulars). Usually our lunch rushes are filled with self centered people or angry people who just spent a dick load of money on presents for people they really didn't want to spend money on (we're located in a mall parking lot). In the midst of the chaos, bread bowls, and dirty tables I notice a customer approaching an obvious homeless man. This catches my eye so I go over and start cleaning a nearby table and eavesdrop. The customer hands the homeless man a gift card to our cafe for fifty dollars. He told him to stay full during this holiday season, to have a good one, and clenched his shoulder in a very comforting, almost fatherly like way. He walked away and back to his table before the homeless man got to say a word. The look on the homeless man's face was something worth remembering. It was nice to see someone think of someone they did not even know.

aturquoiseseashell,12,,22,1rg9do,,130,"End of shift at a famous, upscale department store, and I am already clocked out, with my purse on. I'm talking to my coworkers before I leave because I'm waiting on a ride home. I work in the lingerie department, which is near one of the 2nd story entrance doors to the store. 

A flustered woman comes up with three bags, one from Kate Spade, one from Michael Kors, and one from Tory Burch. She says she found the bags in the vestibule of the entrance to the store.
We thank her for her honesty and promise to call Loss Prevention to come and take the bags. She becomes agitated.

""Well I'm going to wait here and see that you do it,"" she snaps. She's suddenly riled up.

We're a bit taken aback, but continue to be polite to her and my coworker calls LP.

While my coworker waits on the phone to be connected to the security desk, I guess we kind of exchanged looks. (She was very antsy, and was holding onto the bags for dear life). The woman exclaims in outrage, ""Don't you all roll your eyes at me!"" 

""Ma'am,"" says my co-worker, ""No one is rolling their eyes. We're waiting for security to pick up the phone. They will make sure the bags are returned to the customer. Thank you very much for bringing them to our attention, we will see to it that they are returned to the customer."" 

The woman becomes more agitated and irritated. Finally, security picks up and my coworker says, ""A customer found some bags; one's from MK, one is from Tory Burch…""
The woman snaps, before my coworker is quite finished, ""And one from Kate Spade!!"" as though we purposely left that one out so we could steal it or something. 

""And one from Kate Spade,"" my co-worker adds. We're all getting kind of insulted by this woman's attitude. She seems convinced we're plotting to steal the bags, despite the fact that they remain in plain sight of the security camera. We're all well-dressed, well-spoken girls in our early twenties, and we are acting calm and polite. No apparent cause for suspicion.

Security says they can't help and to turn the bags into customer service, who coworker speaks to.
""Ma'am, please give me the bags. Customer service is coming to pick them up,"" my coworker says. We really want her to leave at this point. She's staring at us through narrowed eyes and she's breathing heavily.

""No!"" the woman shrieks, and clutches them to her chest. She tears frantically at one of them and finds a receipt. She begins dialing the number of Kate Spade. We're stunned.
""Please, ma'am…"" the coworker begins, but the woman literally shushes her and begins frantically reading the details of the receipt to the cashier at Kate Spade who is on the other end of the phone. 

She convinces an employee at Kate Spade to come to the dept. store to identify the bags.
Meanwhile, she announces that she will take the bags to customer service herself, in a very angry tone. ""You all are acting VERY suspicious!"" she declares, still clutching the bags to her breast almost maniacally. 

At this point, we're pretty alarmed by her behavior and beginning to wonder if she plans to steal the bags herself after seeing the prices on the receipt. My coworker calls the store manager, and we inform the customer that we would prefer that she remain in lingerie with the bags and wait for the manager. She loudly refuses to stay put. My coworker follows her to customer service.

From all the way in our department on the other end of the floor, we can hear the woman yelling. She had a quavery voice and a really strong British accent. 
Apparently, she got to customer service, and the couple who had left the bags was there. The woman refused to give them the bags without proof of their identity!! Finally the Kate Spade employee arrived and confirmed that yes, the bags belonged to the couple. 

I guess the woman was trying to do the right thing, but she insulted my coworkers and me and frightened various customers in the process. I still don't get why she became so suspicious or why she didn't just bring the bags to customer service in the first place. Of course, since we were lowly retail workers we must have been plotting to steal the lost merchandise. Definitely one of my more memorable encounters.",You all are acting VERY suspicious!,152,talesFromRetail
KroipyBill,11,,42,1rhynu,,122,"After [writing about our cheering seasonal workers from Black Friday yesterday,](http://redd.it/1rf92j) it reminded me of this other story involving my goofy manager. 

When I first started working for this place, I came in clean shaven, and patchy hair. I was in denial that mother nature was closing my hair follicles for business, and it wasn't until after my engagement photos I decided to make a change. I shaved my head and have kept it that way ever since. I then grew a goatee to compensate for my loss. Honestly I looked much sharper than having the grassy field of hair you can see the horizon through. It was a relief to embrace it, and feel like I looked decent again. There was one manager who enjoyed messing with me however. In fact in my previous stories, I've quoted him several times in our conversations, since he was my favorite manager to talk to, and the biggest goof ball there. He vowed he would draw on my head when I wasn't ready for it. 

**Me:** Dude I'm taller than you. So unless you parachute from the rafters onto my cranium with your sharpie, you will not succeed. 

**Manager:** We'll see...we'll...see...

At that moment I wondered if he really was contemplating that attack strategy. At least he left it at just contemplating. 

One day, we were pretty busy. It was pre-holiday, post-black Friday days. I'm sure you all know the type. Everybody is getting geared up for Christmas. I found my way over to the computer department helping a customer decide what Mac they wanted. I was describing the hardware specs, how it works with their Apple products etc. During this I felt I was going to make a decent sale. However I made a massive mistake...

*I sat down.* 

Yes I slipped up big time. My manager saw this opportunity from what it seemed immediately. He walked over and distracted me by having another employee ask me a question. 

**Employee:** Hey KroipyBill you know where I can find [some bullcrap item that he knew the answer to.]

**Me:** Yeah sure. Remember they're eh...ahh...AHH!!!

Right then, my manager walks up to me with his pen, and I felt the coldness of the ballpoint touch my head, while it was dragged across my chrome dome. My entire body froze as if somebody stiffed my spine. I made a weird breathing noise, like I was experiencing sharp pains when it was just mainly a very tiny cold piece of metal on my head. Kind of like EAHH!! EAHH!! EAHH!!! (That's the best I can do textually.) They were quiet, sharp noises.

He walked off, cackling like the joker. I looked at my customer with this super surprised look on my face. He lost his crap, and just laughed. Because of this I sold him more attachments, but that's beside the point. 

Over the radio:

**Me:** The person who drew on my head. You know who you are. Thanks for helping my sale out by doodling with a ballpoint pen on my cranium. 

I looked around the store and saw those with a radio express such confusion. I'm a pretty tall dude, so for those who were in eye sight, I bent my head down so they could see the graffiti my manager brought forth upon my person. Much laughter followed, including my manager.

**Manager:** You said I would never get you. 

**Me:** Well bucket head, you're lucky I was sitting so your midget self could strike me. 

**Manager:** My strike is now complete. 

**Me:** It's a good thing I don't just go over there and rub my greasy head all over your face. I'm glad you feel all militaristic about your approach. 

**Manager:** Oh...this would be a much more fun Call of Duty game if this were part of the game play. 

I never got him back. And he has since left the store after I left. Despite us still being good friends, he's still a bucket head.

It was a beautiful sunny day, which is not common in these parts from oh...October to May.    
    
A very proper looking lady walks up and asks for a salesmen that is off.  Lets call her Uber bitch (UB).  
    
Me, ""He's off today, is there something I can help you with?"" 
       
UB, ""I'm not sure your capable, 'L' was very knowledgeable.""  
       
Her tone was very matter of fact and frankly bitchy.     
     
Me, ""Lets do it this way, I'll help you to the best of my ability and if you're not satisfied you can come back and see 'L' when he gets back.""

Me, ""Advanced how?""     
   
UB, ""Technologically.""

UB, ""That's a start show me the way.""      
    
At this point I realized that I'm dealing with some sort of royalty by the way she's talking to me and looking at me like I was clearly beneath her.    
    
We walked out side and toward the Avalon's and as we rounded the corner I was blinded by the light of 1 sun (that mutha fucker is bright when we only see it a few times a year) so I do what I thought was natural, I put on my sun glasses. You'd think I killed her 2nd born spawn.    
        
UB stopped in her tracks and said, ""Excuse me, how long have you been in sales.""     
    
Me, ""About 15 years now, why do you ask?""    
    
UB, ""How dare you put your sunglasses on in front of a customer. You should know better.""    
    
At this point I'm done with her attitude. She can; buy a car, sell a car, die in fire for all that I'm concerned.    
    
Me, ""While were walking into the direct sunlight I'm keeping them on, once we get into a car I'll make sure to take them off so you can see my pretty greens again.""     
     
The look and sound of disgust from her should of withered some near by plants.     
    
UB, "" I don't want to look at the Avalon unless it has what I want on it.""      
        
I acted all surprised and said, ""Ahhh in that case thus far all you've told me is that you want technology on it. Every car on my lot has technology, how about you fill in the blanks for me and I'll get you what you need.""   I finished that last part with a touch of sarcasm.
    
UB, "" You don't have to take that tone with me.""     
    
I just started at her until she finally answered my question.    
   
UB, ""I want....""  Imagine everything every car in every scfi movie has done (some highlights: Voice activated everything, self driving, self maintaining, color changing, all electric or non-gas, The list goes on)

UB, "" You never tell a customer you can't get something for them it's improper sales.""    
    
Me, ""What's your thoughts on a Prius that parks for you, stops for you in emergencies and has rain sensing wipers?""    
    
UB let here vileness spew out of her and she said, ""That's all been out for years I don't want dated technology.""

Maloth_Warblade,6,,19,1rhx0y,,93,"Black Friday, 2011. Big, blue, zombie-filled box store. I was a photo tech.

It's been almost 2 years now, as I no longer work for retail. I did my 5 years with it and I'm done.

I'm glad I'm out, too. I don't hate people, I just learned that I hate being treated like less than crap, filth, and told I'm worthless on a daily basis. But this one was so irritating I spoke up.

I worked 2 stores on Black Friday in 2011, both the BBS and the famous game store. I was basically at work from Noon-8 on Thanksgiving at the BBS, missing all family gatherings, by the way, and then 11:30pm-7am at the games store (I was the only cashier by the way, in the most populated area of the county/city), and then 12-8 again on Black Friday at the BBS. 

I was tired, beyond tired, essentially 20hrs of work, on my feet with no breaks for food or bathroom due to chaos. The BBS frequently refused to give me my lunches until I was mandatorily locked out, and even then they simply made me work anyway (even got reported for going over 8 hrs without a break, wasn't given a choice).

 Needless to say, by the time 5pm rolled around, and not having eaten but a pop tart in 24hrs, I was having a sugar crash. These make you lightheaded, these make it hard to think and respond quickly. I was working my ass off to get greeting cards printed, packaged, priced and all the while walking everyone through how to use our touch-screen computers and simple tasks. 

One customer didn't like that I wasn't answering fast enough. Of course she didn't, it's Black Friday, and that I was being far too rude for her. She told me she didn't like how tired I was, that I shouldn't work at all if I was so tired. How worthless I was to be there, on the busiest day of the year, if I couldn't be bothered to be awake. 

At this point I interrupted her. I told her ""Lady, listen. I don't need this from you, not today. Not the day people die from customers entitlement. No. I've been working since pretty much Noon yesterday. I had to miss my family's Thanksgiving, again, and not only that, I couldn't even EAT any food yet. There's no time. I'm beyond having a sugar crash, I'm hungry, and beyond normal tired. If you're going to sit there and belittle me over this, you can just get out of my face and leave this place"" (or something VERY close to this, been a few years).

Of course I got loud to say this, and everyone looked at her. Associates, customers, even her husband. She tried apologizing, I kept interrupting her asking what else she needed, and she kept trying to change subjects..I wouldn't let her. She was the last straw I needed that day, and I wasn't having it.

Good news though, wasn't reported, wasn't written up. Had a very nice and thoughtful customer buy me a bag of chips and a soda after seeing me be berated by not only her but other customers. Made it home and promptly slept for 15 hours.

adelajoy,15,,16,1rg29x,,71,"I spent two years working at a big warehouse-style grocery store. I worked mostly as a cashier, but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a week.

Most of the crappy moments have all blurred together, but there are a few particular moments that stick out.

This grocery store is the only one in the area that doesn't bag your groceries for you. Each till has two long conveyor belts to hold your groceries while you bag them (Both the customer and the cashier have buttons to move the groceries down, away from the till). This speeds orders up, requires less staff, saves money and drops prices. People occasionally complain about it, but if they want to pay more for their groceries and have someone else bag them, they're welcome to. ... The store isn't exactly famous for customer service, but I think the prices make up for this.

I was one of the fastest cashiers on staff at the time. This meant that my belts would often get full. I had ways to deal with this. I knew how fast people packed, I knew how soon a belt would clear. I was really good at my job. One day, the lines were insanely long, I was working really fast, everyone was buying a lot. I got to a point that there were groceries on both of my belts, so I squeezed the smaller order down a little, watched for a moment, and knew that he would be down before the next order crowded him. I started scanning the next order, and smiled at the customers - a man and his very pregnant wife.

The wife snapped at me, ""Can you just wait!""

""Excuse me?""

""Can you wait? I don't want you to crowd out that other guy!""

I looked, and he was literally loading his last bag with groceries. I stopped scanning anyways, and maybe glared at the lady. I don't really like it when other people tell me how to do my job.

Eventually he was packed and gone, so I started scanning again. While I had been waiting, I had lined all of their canned goods up. I can scan cans super fast if they're all really close. I started scanning the canned goods, grabbing a can, tossing it to my other hand, and setting it on the other belt. Except that this woman had walked around (The belt she got was behind me) and was standing behind me, trying to bag the cans as I scanned them. I'm sorry, but I'm not actually looking where the cans go. I know the space, and I need to watch the computer screen, not my hands. Well, she kept trying to grab the one I'd just set down, which meant that I kept hitting her hand with the next can. I wasn't by any means throwing the cans, but I was moving quickly and she was in my space, so she was getting hit. I didn't actually realize that I was hitting her until she complained to her husband. So I slowed down, apologized, and moved on to her other groceries.

She then had a bag of apples. She had grabbed one of our bags and put three different apples in it, and tied it shut. I have to weigh each type of fruit separately, so I opened the bag, weighed the first apple, set it aside. I noticed her husband grabbed the apple right away. I weighed the second apple, and set it aside. He grabbed that one too. When I weighed the third, my plan had been to put all three back in the bag and tie it shut, but the other two apples were gone. I tied the bag around the last one and set it on the belt. If the husband wanted to pack the apples separately, he was welcome to.

The couple also bought about half a dozen little bags of frozen perogies. One of the bags had been ripped all the open, right down the middle, and frozen perogies were laying all over the belt. I considered not telling them, because I was mad, but I took a deep breath, rounded up all of the stray perogies, put them in a plastic bag, and informed the lady. I asked her if she would like me to send for a new bag. She snippily replied ""Yes"" as if I should have just known. Some people don't bother to get a new bag because it can hold up the line, so I always ask. Our runner quickly returned with an identical bag and I kept going.

When I finally finished (They bought *a lot* of stuff), the husband paid, while the wife stormed over to customer service. I watched as she talked to my supervisor, and eventually a store manager. I was getting pretty nervous. Oh, also I should mention this woman was rude and snapped every time I asked her a question. I was pretty angry by the time they left.

After they were completely done, my supervisor closed my till and asked to speak to me at customer service.

She said the lady had filed a formal complaint against me. Apparently the conversation went something like this:

**Pregnant Lady**: ""I want to complain about the cashier on till 9!""

**Nice Supervisor**: ""Till 9? Do you mean till 8?"" (I was on 9 - one of my quick-to-anger coworkers was on 8)

**PL**: ""No, I mean 9!""

**NS**: ""Like the girl with brown hair, *not* the blonde?""

**PL**: (getting frustrated) ""Yes!""

**NS**: ""So what did adelajoy do?""

**PL**: ""She was rude and short with me!""

**NS**: ""Adelajoy? Are you sure?""

**PL**: ""Yes! She also threw canned goods at me, *ripped* open a bag of perogies, scattered them *everywhere* and scattered all of my apples too! She also bruised all of my fruit because she was throwing them around!""

A store manager was brought down to take a formal complaint, which means it probably went in my employee file. The lady was calmed down and left, and that was the end of it. Typically, the store managers will meet with you to discuss complaints, and make sure they won't happen again. The fact that I didn't means either the manager simply didn't believe the woman, or wasn't concerned because it was my first (and only). The supervisor who helped her said she closed my till because I looked upset and she thought I needed a break. The only reason she told me was to find out what really happened. I told her my side, and she just laughed it off. I admitted to being short and snippy, but the rest was just ludicrous. I still cannot beleive she blamed me for the bag of perogies being ripped open, considering I told her about them, got a new bag, and spent a minute or two picking up all of the perogies. Also, why would I take the time to do that, when I was clearly rushed with everything else?

I get that pregnant women have a lot of hormones, and tend to be angry, short-tempered, whatnot, but I think there's a line. Also, the fact that her husband didn't stop her, stand up for me, or admit to grabbing all the apples kind of pissed me off.

Tl;dr: Crazy-hormones pregnant lady complained about me, but the supervisor didn't believe her.","In my spare time, I like to rip open your groceries and scatter them",87,talesFromRetail
unidentifiableblarg,12,,10,1rhfwt,,64,"**Back story:** I worked in a small convenience store in a town on the outskirts of a city. A lot of the customer's are regulars and have been coming here for years, decades even.

About 6 years ago the place changed hands, names and management too. Still provided the same sort of stuff though, so the locals kept calling it by it's old name. 

This is relevant, I swear.



**The story:** I'm serving on the registers at the front of the store, just doin ma biz, when a flustered woman comes up to the counter demanding my attention. I tell her I'll be with her as soon as I finish processing my currant customer.

This somehow seemed to offended her, so I was already off to a bad start. But I get to her and try to smooth things over with my best customer service voice (you know the one).

After a bit of just listening to her complaining and bitching in general she finally gets to the point.

""I bought this product here earlier and you (not me) charged me the wrong price! It's on special, why is it wrong blah blah blah""

The outrage was dripping off her.

Now, normally I'd be prepared to fix this, sometimes we just straight up get it wrong and stuff isn't the right price.

*But*, while she's ranting she's waving around a catalogue, that contains the magical special that we failed to give her.

Eventually she shoves it in my face to accent a point, and shows me what it should have been.

The catalogue wasn't for our store, we don't even sell the brand (ice cream, I think it was) that she seemed to have thought she purchased.

I politely explain that we're not an [old store] any more and that was why she didn't get the discount. But I'd be happy t...

Her: What?! I've lived her FOR YEARS and it's always been [old store]. You've got to be kidding me.

I point out the signs (they're everywhere) and shirts of the employees and explain that we've been [new store] for quite a while.

She persists though, demanding to get her discount because it's ""always been that way and why should I get screwed for what you did..."" just generally giving me a hard time; that kind of bullshit.

The managers will usually give the discount to them anyway, just to keep them happy, but I was sick of getting abused by people who apparently can't read and wasn't about to let this one fly. Pety, I know.

Eventually I get to the point where I'm just repeating myself and she's adamantly refusing to be 'robbed' of forty cents. So I call my manager to come up.

By this stage I'm sick of her shit and just want her to leave, customers are waiting to be served and I'm meant to be serving. Small store, small number of staff.

Finally my duty manager meanders up and he immediately grovels at her feet, begging her forgiveness and taking her to a spare register to sort out her problem. 


I'm not bitter (lies), but the smug grin she threw me on her way out made me really wish that our management stood up for us, at least sometimes.

And that I had a crowbar handy.

CommandoDerp,9,,20,1rhsfa,,59,"First off, I would like to say that I had two days off before this incident so I was unaware of any changes at work.

So I was at work after two days off when I was serving an elderly man, who was a regular, cigarettes. He asked for a particular brand in a carton of twin packs. I tell him unfortunately that the twin packs are classified as cartons themselves, and you cannot purchase a carton of a carton. He rolled his eyes and asked for 4 individual twin packs.

I immediately check the cupboard nearby of said twin packs of cigarettes that he wanted and I inform him that we are all sold out. This is the conversation that follows:

Him: ""Are you serious?""
Me: ""Yes, sorry. We are unfortunately all sold out until we get some more.""
Him: ""This is pathetic!""
Me: ""Would you like another flavor?""
He mumbles something to me which I repeat my previous question.
Me: ""Would you like another flavor?""
Him: ""No. This unacceptable. You are refusing sale""
Me: ""Is there anything else I can help you with as we don't seem to have what you are after?""
Him: ""I would like to speak to your manager.""
Me: ""Actually there might be some here""

I had a thought and I turned around and checked the display rack to see if there are any more in the display. To which I found 4 individual twin packs sitting there, I felt like an idiot not checking there first.

Me: ""I didn't realize that there was any in the display, I...""
Him: ""Your very lucky""
Me: ""I'm very sorry I did not check there first. I recently had two days off and I wasn't informed that what you were after was in the display. I'm sorry for any unconvinced""

He just sighs loudly and rolls his eyes and tells me one last thing while paying for his cigarettes.

Him: ""Your very lucky you found them or otherwise you would have lost hundreds and hundreds of dollars in sales and quite a few hundred customers because of your poor service.""

Payment is finished and I tell him I'm sorry again and to enjoy his night. He storms back into the store and complains to another staff member who was not in charge for the night.

The man left and the employee approached me asking what happened. I told them and they said not to worry, they knew it wasn't on purpose. The actual supervisor for the night approached me and asked what happened, they knew it wasn't intentional so they didn't seem too phased by it; even though I was the back up person in charge that night.","I don't know how to feel after my ""complaint""?",79,talesFromRetail
Drunken_Black_Belt,7,,11,1rhw8z,,56,"I'm back bitches!  About 2 months ago, I got a second job working part time at a men's Big &amp;Tall store.  The hours are easy, commision is alright, and to be honest, the customers are generally friendly and awesome.  It helps that a lot of them don't have anywhere else to shop. Unfortunantly the store isn't as eventul as my past retail jobs.  Its just selling clothes and shoes.  But I've gotten a few funny stories that I'll share over time here. And with the holiday's coming up, i'm sure I'll have plenty more.  

Welll, for your pleasure (hopefully), I present **Boy, Are My Feet Sore!**

**WARNING: GROSS!**

So recently I began working in a men's store for Big &amp; Tall sizes.  I knew of it because I buy my shoes there.  Only store that carries a size 15/16.  I am too small for the clothes, despite being 6'4 and slightly overweight.  And if I'm being honest,  seeing some of the people who come in makes me more motivated to keep losing weight (50 lbs this year alone).  

Now, don't get me wrong, SOME of the people have legitimate health concerns.  One gentleman was born with his left foot backwards.  During his childhood they would constantly have to break his foot, set it slightly closer to the proper position, let it heal, and repeat. But it never set 100% correct, keeping him from being able to run or exercise, or even stand for long periods of time.  It's guys like him I feel for.  Given a shitty deal in life and just having to suffer for it. 

Most customers, however, are just plain old fat guys.  I don't want to sound mean, or ""fat shame"".  But it's just poor lifestyle choices and such.  I was there.  I was 5lbs shy of 300 last new years.  And it was just being lazy and making bad choices.  I don't have as much sympathy for these guys.  And that brings us to our story today.

It's a sunny fall day.  It's midweek, and pretty dead.  I'm in my suit, fixing clothes, putzing around, pretty much just pretending to work.  I hear the door chime, and in walks an older couple.  Probably late 60's, very early 70's.  The lady was using a walker to move around, and the gentleman was resting his weight on a cane as he slowly moved with her.  They seemed like a nice enough couple, but as you know, those are the ones who always turn into assholes.

I introduced myself, asked how I could help them that day.  The man gruffly replied ""shoes"".  I brought them to the shoe department.  Now my store is small, and there is only one small bench to sit on, and it's in the shoe department.  Naturally, this oaf takes the seat, leaving his frail wife to stand.  I could tell she was having difficulty, being particularly petire and frail, so I went in the back and got her a folding chair to sit in next to her husband.  She thanked me, because manners.  The man, charming fellow that he was, just said ""can you get me some shoes now?"".  

It was about this time that I realized this was going to go south faster than a my ex g/f in a dick sucking contest.

I offered several suggestions, as the gentleman didn't seem to know what kind of shoes he wanted.  The man complained that most of our shoes don't even fit him. I expressed sympathy, as I have large feet and can only fit into the largest size available in store.  The man looked me up and down and sneered ""Well, you just have big feet. I have a health condition that causes this, so consider yourself lucky"".  

Eventually we found a pair he liked and thought may just fit his feet.  And that's when the real horror of this story starts.  The man then proceeds to roll up his sweatpants.  He was wearing ankle socks and sandals.  His feet are hugely swollen, and covered in open sores.  This guy has diabetes, and it's eating away at his foot.  Sadly it's fairly common where I work.  What came next, however, is not.

I hand him the shoes, and take a step back, giving him some space to put the shoes on, look at them in the mirror, see how they feel, etc.  

NOPE!  

He looks at me like an idiot and says ""Well I can't put them on myself.  I can't bend that far.  Put them on for me"".   

Now I am no fan of feet, even on a good day.  Sure if I'm dating someone, and they want a footrub, and their feet are clean, then i'll oblige.  But other than that, I just want nothing to do with that area of the body.  Add to the fact that we are talking about a stranger whose foot is literally covered in open, oozing sores.  

DBB: Sir I just can't do that, I'm sorry.

Man:  You need to help me.  I'm a customer and I need service.

DBB: There is no way I am doing that sir.  I am sorry but you have open sores on your foot and leg. It's unsanitary for both me and YOU, to have me do that.

Man: Oh just wash your hands after it'll be fine.

How this man survived 70 or so years with logic like that, will forever amaze me.  

DBB: Absolutely not.  

Man: I want the manger!  I'll have your ass for discrimination and harrassment

DBB:  I am the manager.  If you want the store manager call back tomorrow.  If you want corporate's phone number I'll give it with my name gladly.  


The man continued to yell and scream about receiving the shoes at a discount and having me fired.  Typical stuff for anyone who works in retail really.  I essentially told him that I wasn't going to touch his feet, and if he didn't like the service he could leave. Wife is trying to keep the peace.  It's not very effective.  Husband used Rage!  It's inneffective against DBB!  Besides my DEF is to high.  

Anyways, i wish there was some more to this.  Eventually he stormed out as dramatically as one can when you can barely walk under your own weight, and your wife is frail and moves about as fast a christian school girl with a chastity belt.  I did hear from corporate the next day though.  Naturally some of the details were changed when he called in, but once I explained about the sores, I receieve a ""Yea that happens all the time. Don't worry about it"".  

Sorry if it's not very exciting.  I'm sure I'll have some good ones coming up.  Hope you all are surviving the holidays!

Turns out, the woman was making a sizeable purchase and couldn't supply an adequate form of ID. I explained to her that we simply couldn't process her credit card without proper identification. She dug through her purse and tossed a bottle of birth control pills on the counter and was like ""Will this bottle work?

She then threw a world class tantrum using colorful language that would even make a seasoned sailor blush.

I was working in the jewelry department of a department/grocery store at the time. I'd been in that same department for 2 years by the time this incident took place. It was very early on a Saturday, before the rush, and a lady comes up to my counter to do a return. No problemo, I thought.

Me: I can do that return for you. Can I see your receipt ma'am?

Customer: I don't have it anymore. 

Me: I'll only be able to refund it to a gift card then, is that ok?

Customer: yeah, that's fine. 

One hurdle jumped. She hands me the item and I notice that it is in a package I have never seen before. I know my department like the back of my hand cause I'm the one that checks in -all- of the merchandise. Every item that has gone into the department in the last two years had to pass by me first. 

Me: ma'am are you sure you bought this here? I don't recognize this package. 

Customer, suddenly angry: of course I bought it here. (Spoiler, this a lie)

Me: ok, let me see if the system recognizes it. 

I scan the item at the register and I get an error. I look at the barcode and it's half as long as it needs to be (6 characters instead of 12, which is the store norm). 

Me: ma'am my register does not recognize this item. 

Customer: I bought it here!

Me, getting cranky at this point: are you -sure-? I've been in the department for two years and I've never seen this package before. Are you certain you didn't buy this at [dept store x] or [dept store y]?

Customer: I'm certain. I'm returning this for a friend and she bought it here! (Told ya)

Me: I'm sorry but I can't take an Item that doesn't even come up in the system. Especially if you don't have a receipt. 

Customer snatches the item from me and pulls her cell phone out: I am going to call her (the friend) and prove to you that it was bought here!! (She's nearly screaming at this point)

The customer walks away and makes her call. I watch her patiently from the counter and wait for her to return. She finally gets her friend on the line but is far enough away that I can't hear her.

ScaldingSoup,5,,6,1rha57,,26,"So several  years ago I worked for a very popular lingerie store.  This store didn't pay commission, but would give us more or less hours per week based on sales performance.  My sales performance was VERY good.  I got more hours a week than most people.  

During the holiday season, we had a lot of seasonal employees, as any big retail store normally does.  One of the workers hired seasonally was this lady who was a lot older than the rest of us.  This was not the problem.  Her hair was bleached blonde, and growing out (showing obvious roots), and styled in a ""feathered"" fashion.  She did not know how to wear make-up and what she wore did not flatter her.  In this store our dress code was all black.   She wore skirts with no stockings, but with slouch socks and yeah, that was a hot mess.  

People began to call her the ""missing link"", as in to the 1980s because of the hair and her wearing slouch socks that were probably black in the 1980s but grey now.  Reading this, you may think that I judged her based on this, or have some animosity for people older than me.  I do not, but this just sort of describes what she looked like because it is important.  Black Friday rolls around, and she wears her normal dress of skirt, slouch socks and what-not.  Surrounding her socks are these bells that jingle..  

She begins waving panties in the air, helicopter style, like a stripper, chanting what the sale is as customers are passing by.  One of our gay male managers passes me by and mutters so only I can hear it ""I want her out"".  I was dying trying not to laugh at the situation, and meanwhile feeling very embarrassed for her.  Everywhere she walked, she jingled.

Some time during her short career with the lingerie store, she found my phone number on the schedule.  I guess they weren't giving her enough hours, because she had the nerve to leave me a message asking me for some of mine.

**Story (er, stories)**: 

1) I walk by the front door. Man approached with wife, stopped and said Excuse Me? Fine. I go over, and he started counting out a huge wad of cash. He counts $100 in small bills out, gives it to me, then says, ""Now, I want a propane tank, honey..."" 

He got the manager who resembles an NFL player instead. (Yes, I gave him the money back.)

2) Two young guys came through the checkout line with four carts of Head &amp; Shoulders, Dove bars, and some razors, I forgot the brand. This is ***-mart, it's cheap, and that's what matters. Three products. They racked up $1800 in this stuff. The one guy then pulled out of his pocket a pile of coupons that was quite literally a foot high. Mind already blown, I said half-jokingly, ""Those aren't all for me, are they?""

Yes. Yes they were. $1500 in coupons, $3 at a time. Do the math. And you couldn't do coupon repeats. Due to the volume, the *CSM thing came up halfway through, and I said ""Oh, the supervisor's going to have to turn the key..."" and they were all ""Ok, cool.""

So they hand over the remaining $300 cash (and people pay 500-600 all the time-that was normal) and the supervisor sees the key message on the palm pilot. I had every CSM (three on duty), the front end supervisor, two assistant managers, and every loss prevention person in the building (three-two associates &amp; the manager) at the register in what seemed like two seconds. 

The guy who'd had the coupons recognized the front end supervisor. He (coupon guy) went off and started going into it with the supervisor. The friend stands there numb, all the managers start talking at me, a CSM sticks the key in to abort this transaction, and I'm standing here holding $300 cash and a hell's lot of coupons. 

Then:
The customer let out a primal yell, the supervisor took the coupons from me, stuck them in the guy's hand, and wished him a good day-anywhere else. 

Turns out they were known scammers. The coupons would scan, but we can't get money back for them. I knew something was up, but I didn't know the back story. I just was asking myself over and over after this: If it had all gone through, and they'd walked out with $1800 of soap and shampoo, what the hell were they going to do with it all? Sell it at less than cost? Fill a swimming pool? Get ridiculously clean?

While Cee and his dad are looking at the toys, a woman with two children comes into the aisle they are in.

Me: Do you have the canceled check?

Customer: No, I threw it in your trash.

Me, cringing: How about a receipt?

Customer: In the gar-bage. What don’t you understand?

Me:  I think I need to transfer you to the Customer Service Desk. Let me just find the number…

Customer: NO, you will NOT! I need the movie about…(another two, three minutes)…now!

Customer: Getting my movie!

Me: I can’t give you a physical object through the phone. Why don’t you come in and see Customer Service?  They should be able to help you.

Customer: …I’ll be there in fifteen minutes. Let me get the kids.

copisreallybad,4,,6,1rhulb,,21,"a few days ago, i get called down to the returns desk from the paint desk. the return policy for the chain i work at is very lenient, but we aren't supposed to take mixed paint back, so already walking down there i had a bad feeling that i would have to get a manager involved (and we all know how incompetent they can be)

so i get there, and to my surprise it's just a regular can of unmixed, white, exterior paint, which *is* returnable without manager involvement. i ask the guy what's wrong with the paint and he says that it's frozen and we need to fix it or give him another can.

i bring the can to the paint desk and open it up. now, imagine what half frozen, hardened paint looks like. that's what this paint looked like, and the following conversation sort of went like this.

me: ""this paint is frozen, did you leave it in the garage or something?""

customer (now visibly irate): ""ABSOLUTELY NOT I BOUGHT IT AND I JUST OPENED IT THIS MORNING AND TO MY SURPRISE IT LOOKS LIKE THIS""

me: ""I'm sorry but we really aren't supposed to take paint like this back, it's useless to us returned""

customer (literally about to pop a blood vessel in his brain at this point): ""WELL MAYBE IF YOU GUYS HAD FUCKING SOLD ME A GOOD CAN OF PAINT IT WOULDNT BE FUCKING FROZEN. I WANT A MANAGER, NOW""

great, this guy knows how to get what he wants. i call a manager and explain the situation to him. the manager, being a typical manager, offers him a plethora of free things, including brushes and a brand new can of paint. the customer walks away with his free things (that i have to get for him) with the smuggiest ass look on his face.

story over, right? nope. i bring the can of paint to receiving, ZMA and hazmat it (since we can't sell it, it's fucking frozen and you can't paint with it). done deal im thinking, right?

not even close, bby. picture a hambeast of a woman. ok, maybe not that big, but she had a hard time fitting inside the reach truck sometimes. she is the department head of receiving. basically she sits in receiving on her computer waiting for trucks to arrive. 

now picture her carrying the frozen can of paint to the desk, except i actually had to see it happen. 

okay, okay, what the fuck is going on, im thinking. maybe i didnt mark it down correctly or something, maybe she'll show me how to hazmat it, i have no idea. im also in the middle of explaining to an older woman the different paint finishes we sell. 

nope, she has the nerve to tell me to just ""stick it in the paint shaker for a minute or two and see if we can try and sell it as OOPS paint."" at this point im all whatthefuck.jpeg, the paint is fucking frozen and shaking it won't help. i try to explain this to her but she would have none of it and walks away, and me, being the lowly, minimum wage paint associate that i am, do as she says. i stick it on the OOPS rack and continue my day.

the story ends when the department head of paint sees it on the OOPS rack, laughs, and takes it to receiving himself to hazmat it.

tl;dr - guy returns 3 year old can of frozen paint, manager gives him free shit, hambeast from receiving thinks that we can still sell it, paint department head saves the day.  ",i work at a home improvement store that sells paint (among other things),27,talesFromRetail

I worked in a a supermarket produce department for about 13 months.  But there was a guy who came in he'd wear a suit and gel his hair to make himself look important, but the only time id see him in my department was sampling my food or outright shoplifting. 
One of the things he'd do would come up to me and say something along the lines of
""Hey Champ, can you cut me a piece of this ""insert fruit here"" , ive heard this batch is extra juicy"" and then once hed taste it hed spit it out and say 
""Yuck thats disgusting, im glad i wasnt going to buy it"" and just storm off. He did this to me quite a few times and hed throw the skin or peel of it onto my displays and I was quite pissed off with all of it. 

He came in and and I recognised him. And the convorsation went as follows. 

Him: Hey Champ, do you mind if I try one of these Mandarins, they seem mighty delicious. 

Me: No you cant

Him: Why the hell not?

Me: Because its shoplifting, you have no intention of buying it, youve done this before you ask if you can try some and say its disgusting then walk off and all youre going to do is peel it, take one bite leave the the rest of the fruit and peel on my display and im not paid to clean up after you and its not a buffet either, what youre doing is taking stuff you havnt paid for, so its actually theft. So no you cant!

He stood there for about 6 seconds trying to think of something to say and all he could muster up was yelling:
Hey I use to work in a fruit store aswell, I know what its like, so deal with it!

And he just walked off, I kept an eye on him too, he didnt buy anything but just walked out the front of the store (giving me an evil eye) and then out the door to the carpark.

He did come back into the store a few days later, but I didnt see him in the produce department again while i was there ( I only did 3pm until Midnight, but he might have come in between 7am and 3pm or while someone else was on) but when I saw him ordering things from the deli hed give me a bitter stare but that was it.

One day, I have a guy come in with a bunch of stuff and some rain cheques. I take them from him and noticed that they're all photocopied. I look at them and notice they have a different store number on them. So, since I can't blatantly say ""I think you faked these"", I made up some policy on the spot. I told him that we couldn't take another stores rain cheques, how we had to have the matching piece of the rain cheque, and that our stores order inventory specifically to cover rain cheques.

A little back story. I actually PAY customers for metal. We are private and can choose what prices we pay for what material etc. We do not have any pricing criteria. The only thing we have to deal with really is the law which is one of the more annoying things. People who steal metal makes it tough for the honest guys who recycle.

I get several customers who come in every day or several times a week (we're open 6 days a week, 9 to 5). 80% of these customers are never ready. We require valid ID for every transaction and though I remember a good amount of people's names, some I don't. Those that know I ask for ID every time never had it ready. While they're standing in line why wouldn't they pull it out of their wallets instead of when they are at the front of the line? Or sign the receipt which is also required by law. I have to ask them EVERY SINGLE TIME. It's very frustrating. I go through the same thing every day and they never learn. I also get several customers who don't even speak English which is also frustrating. How can I ask you for things that are required by law when you don't speak my language?

Anyway, this next story was also from Barschmucks. If I didn't mention before, this was a franchise location inside of a large supermarket. We were technically employees of the supermarket even though we were real certified baristas. But this meant that many of our coworkers were cashiers and stock guys. One of the stock guys was Otis. He was a huuuuuge black dude who didn't converse much when he came by for his free cup of ice water but seemed like a pretty good guy.

I wasn't working when this happened, but my AST (Evan) told me about it. It's dead and he's just cleaning up waiting for the last few stragglers to wander in when Otis cruises up to the counter. Evan asks him what he'd like but Otis doesn't say anything and just stares at the menu. Evan goes back to cleaning while Otis contemplates the meaning of life. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Otis opening up the tea rack and fumbling for a tea bag (already this is a no-no, not only are we the only ones supposed to touch that tea, but we have to use tongs because it goes right in a customer's drink.) 

Evan doesn't have time to say anything before Otis lifts a bag to his nose and takes a deep whiff. 

He goes: ""What is this? Vanilla Rooibos? (He pronounced it ""roo-bis""; it's actually ""roy-bohs"".) Mmmmmmm. If a girl smell like dis, I'd lick her all *up* and down.""

Then, as quickly as he came, he put the tea back back, and left without saying a word. 

Evan dumped out all the Vanilla Rooibos and replaced it (not a big deal, nobody gets it anyway.)

**TL;DR:** Large man sexually assaults a tea bag in the middle of our store and left my coworker to clean up the mess.

j-sap,3,,4,1rigon,,18,"Some back story: I work the front desk at a gym a couple of days a week after class. We specialize in helping people with injuries and have a very specialized staff, program, and equipment. We are attached to an apartment complex that is spread out over a couple of buildings. The laundry for the complex is in the building adjacent to us. Now to use the laundry machines you are required to use a proprietary card that has to be purchased from a machine. I don't know what someone was smoking one day but instead of putting the machine that dispenses and allows people to add money to there card next to the laundry machines (even though there is plenty of room), someone decided to put the machine in the lobby of the gym. 

Where I work I have a very large window that overlooks the parking lot and see everyone who comes and goes and where people park. I had someone park or fly in the handicap spot (we'll call him Scumbag Steve or SS to keep things simple). SS jumps out of the car and runs full sprint into the lobby to add money onto his laundry card. After a minute or so I hear a knock on the window and we a quick interaction that goes like this:

SS: ""Hey yo man you got change for a $20?""

Now I absolutely do have the change for this guy in my drawer but if I used it then I would not have any for transaction at my desk.

Me: ""Sorry.""

SS: ""Yo man what about in your wallet, I know you can personally make me change?""

Now I am taken aback a little from this second question and am smart enough to never take out personal items around customers or even let them know where personal things are. I take a couple of seconds to think about everything and then respond.

Me: ""No I don't, but we have a great physical therapy program if you are interested.""

SS: ""Man why would I be interested in physical therapy, I am as fit as a horse?""

Me: ""Because you parked in a handicap spot and those spots are almost always full of clients.""

SS just sort of gave me a defeated look and slinked out the door and back to his car. He was back 20-30 minutes later and was good enough to not park in the handicap spot, instead he pulled up to the curb and made people walk around his vehicle.

adelajoy,0,,1,1ri8kg,,22,"I spent two years working at a big warehouse-style grocery store. I worked mostly as a cashier, but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a week.

Most of the crappy moments have all blurred together, but there are a few particular moments that stick out.

I realize this isn't the craziest story on here, but I will probably never forget this lady. 

Backstory: Our store had a policy that if an item scanned differently than the price tag, the customer would get it for free, up to $10. The mistake happened because the price tag didn't get changed, or was misplaced. If they spotted a problem, we would go look. If we found a tag in front of their item with the same code and a different price, we gave it to them and changed the tag. If the tag was for a different item, they didn't get anything. 

I was working the customer service desk, and a lady stormed up. I had several customers on the go at the moment, but it was pretty clear she *needed* help right away. As soon as I could, I asked what I could help her with. She was holding a bottle of toilet cleaner, her receipt and a price tag. Let's call her Crazy Customer, CC for short.

**CC**: ""I bought this bottle of toilet cleaner, but it was the wrong price! You guys are trying to charge me too much!""

**Me**: ""Okay, can I see your receipt?""

**CC**: *Hands me the receipt.* ""I tried to tell the cashier, but she didn't believe me!""

**Me**: *I checked who her cashier was, and it was one of our long-time girls. She knew the policy. There was no way she ""didn't believe"" the customer.* ""Okay, so the price came up $3.99, I'll just send a price-checker out to see what the tag said.""

**CC**: ""Oh, I grabbed the price tag already."" *She hands me the price tag. This lady is pretty worked up,  I'm not sure if she just wants to get out of the store, or if she's trying to pull one on me.*

A policy was that the tag had to be on the shelf. If a customer brings it to you, who's to say they didn't take it off the shelf last week and save it? They also could have found it in the wrong place, somewhere that the stock employees wouldn't have checked to fix the tag. As with most stores I've been to, store policy is to inform the customer about the relative store policies, and then see if you can help them anyways. No matter the problem.

It study the tag, and inform her of the policy, that the tag would have to be on the shelf. I start to let her know I can contact a manager, but she snatches the tag back and interrupts me.

**CC**: ""Well if that's your policy, I'll just put it back on the shelf! I was trying to save you some goddamn work, but I guess if you guys want to work extra, I'll just go put it back!""

She took off before I could say anything. I was just standing at the desk, aghast. I didn't even know what to say. 

The supervisor that was on shift was the scary kind. You know, the kind that isn't afraid to yell a little, handles the worst customers, and isn't phased when people call her names. Let's call her Jane. When the woman was gone, I grabbed Jane and told her the whole story. She said, ""Okay. When she comes back, let me know who she is. I'll handle her.""

As soon as I saw the customer coming back, I hissed, ""Jane! Jane! Jane! White hat! That's her."" I then ducked behind the display at customer service, and quite actually hid back there until the customer was gone. I could hear her yelling at Jane. I don't know what the verdict was. Any other manager, and the customer would have gotten the item for free, but it's hard to say with Jane.

I remember one of my coworkers came around the display and exclaimed my name. I hushed them, and told them I was hiding. I was so afraid the woman would see me and do one of those, ""Her! That's the one I was talking to! She told me this!"" And drag me back into it.

I've never hid from a customer before or since. Oh! Fun fact: The price tag she was holding said $3.29, a $0.70 difference from what she paid, and the tag was dated for the week before, which means it wasn't the current price. Not to say it wasn't still on the shelf, but there is a chance she did save it and bring it back in, especially with how worked up she was.

Dannythegirl,5,,5,1rh77t,,8,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this but I needed to share. Long time lurker of this subreddit. On my phone, sorry for wall. 
I am a customer in this story, but former multi-year service/retail employee.
Today, I was grocery shopping with my two very little children. Not a huge chain store, but prominent in my state for supporting local foods. Many locations. 
I got in line to check out after an eventful and frustrating trip around the store with the kids. There was an elderly man checking out ahead of me. He was friendly and talkative to my kids and was asking me about my tattoos while we were waiting. The cashier was probably 55, spacey, but very sweet woman. When it was old guys turn to check out, I overheard their conversation at the register, and it was obvious they were both long time veterans to the store. 
The man had some trouble checking out. He rang his credit card through the machine multiple times while chatting with the cashier and he seemed confused. Eventually, she explained that he didn't have to keep swiping his card, and that his transaction was complete. In the mean time, she was scanning my items. 
The cashier chatted up a storm with me too. Asking about my kids while I was trying to wrangle them. I was getting a little impatient at this point because my 1 and 3 year old were ready to get the hell out of there, but I listened to her stories with patience. She was kind too.
When she finished scanning my food I pulled my card out to run through the machine, but it was asking for a signature, when I hadn't scanned my card yet. 
Me: ""there must be a mistake, I haven't slid my card through but it's already asking for a signature""
Cashier: ""no, you did, you must have forgot"" -looks at screen- ""you swiped your America express""
Me: ""No, I don't have an Amex, see?.. Oh no did the man in front of me swipe his card while you were ringing me up?""
Cashier: ""uh oh, that must have been what happened""
She looked panicked, but printed the receipt and said ""I'll just do this"" AND SIGNED THE RECEIPT
Cashier: ""He'll be okay, he can be so spacey. Don't even worry about it""
She at first folded up the receipt like she was going to trash it but I asked her if that was really ok, and that I could wait for a manger. She unfolded the receipt and told me not to worry. There was a long line behind me and frankly I was ready to get the fuck out of there with my crazy kids. I asked her ""are you sure? I feel uncomfortable"" 
She told me not to worry, and to go ahead and leave. And I did. 
I think her career might have ended today.
TLDR; Elderly man in line ahead of me accidentally paid for my groceries, cashier eventually realized but didn't give a fuck to fix it. I got free groceries :/

EDIT/UPDATE: I can see how it looks like I was unsympathetic in my post. I was in fact, horrified. I know the groceries weren't free, I just did not pay for them. In my car, I wrote down the time, my total $78.43 and what I thought the mans total was before me $43, and the name of the cashier. I should have stuck around and put my foot down but I was flustered and unsure how to proceed.  I was planning on calling when I got home, and totally forgot about the whole thing until I was in bed redditing from my phone late at night.
This morning I called and spoke with a manager, giving him all of my information. I told him I would happily come back and pay for the groceries and to please make sure the man did not actually get charged (hoping the cashier took the issue to the manager after I left). He said he will look into the receipts from last night and give me a call back. I will update again when I hear from him.

On to the story:

One of my favorite cashier's (seriously, she's so sweet and helpful. I always drop what I'm doing to answer her questions because she's one of the three that I trust) calls me over for a price check on a set of plates. Customer says they were $29.99, but when I go check they're $49.99. She says that's fine and she pays for them. Done and over, right?

Wrong.

About ten minutes later she comes over to my podium. I already know she's getting coal from me in her stockings (merry Christmas bitch).

Her- ""I was just over there looking at the plates again. They were there just in the wrong spot.""

Me- ""I'm sorry ma'am, I'll let an associate know so he can fix it. I'm a little busy to get to it."" Which I was, I was getting five different change orders ready.

Her- ""Isn't it your job to fix it?""

Me- ""actually no it's not. I'm the front end manager. There are two managers who work in that area, it's actually their job technically. If I would've seen the plates,I would've put them in the right spot.""

Her- ""So you're just a lazy asshole.""

Ok, I'm done. I talk to everyone in a civil manner, but when they take that tone with me, I'm done.

Me- ""yep""

Her- ""You're not going to fix it?""

Me- ""Nope, too lazy right now.""

This was followed by more angry questions and statements until I walked away to deliver my change orders. She tracked an assistant manager down and let him have it about my attitude. He's a pretty cool guy, came up to me later, asked what the deal was and just laughed when I told him. Now he always asks if I'm lazy today when he sees me.

I think I just stood there looking at him for a moment. He had an Italian accent so I was thinking I may have misheard him, and asked for his order again. He held his hand out and insisted to see mine.

Now, this guy didn't look creepy or scary or anything. If so I would have just bolted. But I was 17 and put on the spot so I gave him my hand.

It was a pretty good job, and I got to have as much free soda as I wanted, since I was in the concessions booth. I had to set out prizes, read tickets to see how many points a kid had, tell them how much each prize was (They could mix and match), then calculate how many points they had left as they chose. They'd choose their prizes, I'd hand it to them, and they'd leave. 

I had a friend of mine with me for the first hour, and we split the customers when it got busy. (Around 5 people at the same time.) At one point I spilled my soda, and she handled the crowd as I cleaned up the mess.

Then she left. Oh god.

I was left to set out prizes for display, serve customers, and translate kid-speak by myself. At some points I was so swamped with customers that I could barely figure out the total points for each kid as they got prizes.

Another girl came it at low tide, but left before it got busy again. (Around twenty minutes.) I wasn't allowed to leave my station to try and find her, so I had to deal with all the customers alone. (She wasn't actually allowed to leave either, but she gave zero fucks. Bitch.)

Scott5114,0,,3,1riony,,13,"I've met a lot of strange customers in my time at the casino. This guy takes the cake as the most fucked-up, unpleasant guy that's ever darkened our doorstep. We'll call him Dick because he is one.

To begin with, Dick is in the casino for a fucked-up reason. He's dying of cancer, or some other terminal disease. He spends his last days in our casino trying to win an inheritance for his children. Of course, mathematics says it's not going to happen, so he's squandering what money he does have and the remainder of his life sitting in a smoky room with no natural light playing $25 per spin on a slot machine. 

I wouldn't judge him so harshly for that if he wasn't a colossal asshole. Pretty much everyone who has had to pay a jackpot for him has some sort of unpleasant experience to share. Mine was when I was processing a jackpot for him and I go to clear the jackpot message from the screen. See, if you win, say, $1500, and you had $80 in credit when you hit it, when the attendant clears the jackpot your $80 will still be left on the machine. People sometimes forget or don't know this, and will leave the money on the machine and walk away, so after clearing it most of us will say ""You still have $80 left on the machine."" Of course, when I mention this to Dick, he flies into a rage, screaming ""I CAN SEE THAT! GOD!"" I started dodging his jackpots when I knew where he was playing after that—I don't put up with that sort of BS—though I still had to pay him out a couple of times after that because I didn't realize who it was. 

And Dick did hit a lot of jackpots. He would usually destroy the copy of the W2-G tax forms we would give him, I guess thinking since he's dying he won't need to worry about paying taxes, though you would think he would realize his kids would be on the hook for all of it. He also had the tendency to swear ambiguously so you never really knew whether he was calling the machine or you a piece of shit. Management had talked to him a couple of times about treating the attendants better. He did tip the bare minimum to not be considered an ass in that department, at least.

All of that is backstory to properly put in context what happened this week. At this point, Dick's managed to piss off enough attendants that most of the shift is dodging his calls, so it takes him probably twice as long to get someone over there than it would anyone else. This, coupled with the fact that he's losing heavily, pisses him off. 

Management gets called over to a machine in my section. I'm generally pretty curious about these things, so I head over there. The machine's touchscreen (retail price quoted to me by a tech as $700 or so) is totally shattered. The machine still has $20 on it—with an inoperable touchscreen, there's no way to cash that out on this machine. There's a patron further down the bank who saw the whole thing. Said the guy was losing, got pissed, punched the screen, threw a piece of paper down, and stormed off. One of the managers that showed up picks up the paper.

It's a torn-up W2-G with Dick's name, address, and social security number on it. A little bit of searching in the computers turns up copies of his driver license and the hotel room he is in. And of course the whole incident is caught on tape.

We don't know what happened to Dick after that. Apparently it became the responsibility of the casino's assistant general manager, and she isn't talking. We're all watching the usual locations for ban notices to go up, though.",The worst casino patron in the world,16,talesFromRetail
GlowingBall,2,,3,1rioer,,15,"These are my Tales of Retail Loss Prevention....

Part Three – Citizen Snips (Aka - The Pants Aquatic)



As a recap for those of you who have never read one of my stories before – I am a male in the midwest who is on the wrong side of his twenties and works retail loss prevention for a major retailer (one of the 'Big 5').  I am underpaid for what I do but enjoy my job none the less.  A majority of my time is spent wandering the floor or watching middle aged moms shop for clothing far too skimpy on them via CCTV (closed circuit television or 'security cameras').  Every once in awhile I get a case that is just so mind blowingly 'WTF' that I have to share.  

This story opens up with me doing just as I said above – watching people on CCTV.  It is a blisteringly cold afternoon so the customers, far more content to stay in their warm homes and snuggled beneath their blankets, are few and far between.  I, as the ever watchful hawk of justice that I am, was busy playing a Marvel version of Candy Crush Saga.  My job provides me the liberty of slacking off a good amount and my boss is rather lenient as long as I continue to bring in a good amount of stops per month.  I am sitting there diligently trying to match up small colored tiles with one another when I am startled by a sudden ring – the phone is going off!  

Now the phone going off is common place.  We get tons of calls a day ranging from the frozen dairy department calling to tell us a temperature alarm is going off (we know...it goes off for us as well) to people asking us to deactivate a door alarm (we also know...we see you standing at the door).  This happened to be a call from one of the few places that doesn't call us often – the meat department.  The guy on the other end, a tall black man with more muscle than he knows what to do with, calls to tell us that there is a guy standing in front of the freshly butchered meat.  The guy has refused any help the meat employee has offered and continues to say he is 'just browsing' for over ten minutes.  This strikes me as rather odd.  Who just hangs out around the meat department?  I quickly devise a plan for the situation.  I tell the employee to walk into the back so I could see just what the person was going to do.  

The employee hangs up and walks over to the man to let him know he is going to be into the back and to ring the bell if he needs anything.  No sooner than when he had walked into the back but the man glanced around and then walked behind the counter.  My adrenaline already began to rush as my suspicions came to fruition – he was going to steal!  “Oh shit here we go, ” I declared, only to watch in confusion and frustration as he walked right past all the glass displays full of meat and right over to the lobster tank.  Now if you aren't familiar with these tanks they are exactly just what the name implies – a water filled tank full of live lobsters we sell by the pound.  Their claws are bound and they just kind of hang out crawling all over one another.  Kids love to sit there and watch them.

“No way...is he really going to...” I whispered as I watched on in awe.  Sure enough he reached right into the live lobster display tank we have.  After a moment of 'fishing around' he plucked the lobster he wanted from the tank and pulled it out of the water.  Before I could even make heads or tails of the situation he glanced around once more and shoved the lobster right down the front of his pants.  The guy, whom shall be hence forth called Lobster Johnson, then proceeded to shuffle run his way out of the meat department and through the grocery department towards the front of the store.  The only way I can really describe how he ran was a forward version of Zoidberg's shuffle.  All he was missing was yelping out “Woop woop woop woop!” loudly as he went.  

Needless to say he wasn't too hard to stop.  I may not be in the best shape of my life but I can still move quicker than a guy with a large lobster squirming around in his pants.  He didn't fight me at the door or even try to argue what he was doing.  After all, it is kind of hard to argue that you aren't stealing when you have a large, lobster shaped bulge in your pants.

Bonus icing on top of the cake: I usually ask the person why they are stealing.  It usually won't change anything but it fulfills my curiosity and keeps them talking which usually calms them down a bit.  This guy tried to say that he was stealing the lobster for his kids...

His kids have some expensive tastes.",Loss Prevention Tales Pt 3. - Citizen Snips,18,talesFromRetail
tankenka,5,,8,1rgfao,,0,"I work for a phallic retailer with lots of balls. (hehehe)

I decided to go get some water during my shift the other day so I headed towards our water fountain, which happens to be down a narrow hallway and is between the bathrooms and is opposite the hallway from our offices/breakroom area.  As I come around a corner in said hallway I almost bump into our Store Manager (SM from here on out) who is in the middle of cleaning the bathrooms.  SM and I start chatting and from the men's room I hear some loud noises.

""What the hell was that?"" I ask

""Damn kids screwing around."" SM replies as he sets down the bag of trash he had been holding and walks over to the men's room.

Now, SM isn't a particularly tall guy, but he lifts weights quite a bit and could very well be described as being jacked.  Somehow, from time to time, people think it is a good idea to fight him, so I stuck around in case he needed backup.

SM opens the men's room door hard, slamming it into the wall and bellows, ""What the HELL are you doing in my bathroom?""

--inaudible reply--

""Yeah, well it is a pretty sad day when I have to kick someone out of the bathroom, now get the hell out."" SM says at a slightly reduced volume.

""B..But my stomach hurts."" says a meek voice from inside the bathroom.

Then at a normal volume, but with a tone of voice that sounded like SM had ice in his veins he replies, ""Carry it somewhere else.""  Then he stared into the bathroom in a manner that was somewhat intense.

With that the teens walked out of the store with their heads hung in shame.

Princess_Honey_Bunny,114,,162,1rg853,,569,"BACKGROUND: I work at a mattress store. Selling(whatelse) mattresses. The law in North Carolina says that we cannot sell used mattresses. We follow this law strictly. To avoid angry customers being stuck with something they dont like, we offer a 'comfort guarantee' where you have 90days to decide you dont like it and come exchange it for something else. This comes with a fee of $200 as we have to throw the like new mattress out.  

STORY: In comes a guy. Hes visibly upset, all I can think is [""here we go""](http://i.imgur.com/8MmamRX.gif) lets call him Angry Asshat(AA)

AA: I hate my mattress! 

ME: Im so sorry to hear that sir woul-

(he cut me off)

AA: I want my money refunded immediately, and I want you to come get that shit off my property **Today**

ME: Im very sorry but we cant refund your money. 

AA: [WHAT?! WHAT DO YOU MEAN](http://i.imgur.com/HouBhTG.gif)

ME: Well sir its illegal in the state of North Carolina to take used mattresses and we cant take it back. 

AA: WELL I WANT IT THE FUCK BACK NOW I DONT RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE([he was just yelling nonsense at me about how this is whats wrong with the world and its all the dirty liberals fault](http://i.imgur.com/OudLd7s.gif))

ME: Sir, I cannot break the law for you. Not only is it the store policy its **the law**

Now hes raging, but Im trying to salvage the situation

ME: What we can do for you though is our 90 day comfort guarantee swap out. Can I have your name Ill look your ticket up and well see what we can do. 

He seems to calm down a little bit and he takes a seat across from my desk and he gives me hi name. I look up his name and pull up his ticket as Im explaining the comfort guarantee I look at his ticket. And then at the date he bought it(ya know to make sure its at least close to 90 days) I was willing to be flexible to make this guy happy when I notice he bought this mattress 9months ago!! Im flexible but not *that* flexible

ME: Uhh Sir, Im sorry to say this but you bought this mattress 9months ago, that 6months over the 90days. Theres nothing we can do for you. 

That when he became absolutely IRATE with me. Screaming something about how this is bad business practice, he deserves to get a refund, we owe it to him. Blah blah blah. [Im done this this shit](http://i.imgur.com/InDPcFn.gif)

ME: SIR. There is nothing we can do, the comfort exchange policy was explained to you when you bought it, if you didnt like the mattress you should have come back 6months ago, now Im going to have to ask you to leave the store. 

Well he didnt like that very much. He was becoming increasingly angry and hostile. Hes leaning over my desk pointing his finger right in my face([Which I hate](http://i.imgur.com/u77ThfE.gif)) but I keep my cool, and as sternly as I can say

ME: Sir if you dont leave immediately I will be forced to call the police and have you removed from my store. 

He paused for a moment with sheer rage in his eyes. Then he SLAPS!(yes slaps) the coffee on my desk across the 5mattresses that are close to my desk, gives me the finger and walkes out! I was in shock I composed myself quickly, called the police, and then my boss and explained everything that happened. 

I guess that asshat forgot that he gave us his address to deliver the mattress to, he ruined about 5beds which he was made to pay sticker price for on all of them(sticker price is close to $300 more than what we normally sell for) 


Although I was scared I made a great commission on all the beds he had to replace. There was justice that day and it was great.

jessajuhanabi,30,,94,1rhnqp,,397,"As of last Thursday, I am the head manager of a retail outlet and cafe, answering only to my boss, since the only girl above me quit. All people that walk in, call or email come through me. My boss is normally around but he works on coffee machines most days. 

As backgound for this story: His brother is a c*nt. I live in Australia, so that term seriously fits him. He owes a bunch of people money, is generally an asshole, and my boss is very sad his brother has changed so much. It stresses my boss out as their finances are tied due to a trust. 

Today, a lady walks in around 11:30, and walks up to the front desk. Politely, she asks me, ""Is (boss) in?""

In my mind, she was another person that he knew since he's been running this business for 20+ years, or a rep from some company that I didn't care about. He turned around to look at her, and I pointed in his direction. 

She immediately starts spouting about how boss's brother, we'll call him AH for asshole, owed her money. This is not a surprise to boss. He knows her. He's heard from her over email before. In which he told her he has no access to the trust and he's also fighting AH for money. 

This does not please the lady, henceforth known as douchecanoe. DC repeats over and over, despite pleas from my boss to chase down AH, ""I'm not leaving without my money. Get it for me.""

Now, DC wants a hefty sum. A couple thousand dollars. My boss offers her a coffee while he tries to reach AH. A water. A chair. Nothing. She stands in front of our stock and repeats herself over and over. ""Give me my money. Give me my money. I don't care its not my problem. YOU pay me.""

Why is she going after my boss? Because she's gone through the courts, they told AH to pay, and he still hasn't. Her response? Come into my store and stand there all day every day until HIS BROTHER, pays her. 

Now, my boss tries and tries to get her to understand he has no access to the money. No go. So instead she stands in our store, silent, for 4 fucking hours. Four. DC stands there so long my boss gets fed up and stressed, and leaves. 

The difference is, he's a peace keeper. I was itching for him to leave. I was just going to have the cops come eject her. I was EXCITED. 

Unfortunately she realized rather quickly I was not the ""nice cop"" type so she stood out the front, called in a few friends and intermittently yelled ""YOU KNOW THIS IS SO SILLY I JUST WANT MY MONEY FROM THE (BUSINESS)"" and ""I KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE IN XXXX SUBURB I COULD RUIN A BUSINESS IF I WANTED TO."" through the window at me. 

Oh god. You scare me so much. I might pee my pants. 

Anyway she eventually gave up and left without coming back inside, probably since I was watching her and smiling, willing her to come inside so I could call the cops. 

Oh well, another day I suppose! Maybe she'll be back tomorrow...

DolfyuttSrednaz,58,,48,1rh8hc,,200,"I have got to say, after working 4 years in retail, parents should be responsible for their children's actions. I have seen so many kids acting like demons that have just spawned from a dimension full of pointy sticks being shoved up their asses, but I never blame the kids. I usually don't even blame the parents, because kids are kids, but when customers blatantly let their kids run around like Sonic on meth, I blame the parents. that is why we have an announcement that plays every few minutes, reminding customers to keep their little shits in line. So when a customer like the one I had comes in, I usually inform my manager (who will be called Jared) of the situation and he watches the kid from a distance. 

A middle-aged couple stumbles into the store with their 7 year old son. They head off to furniture, but their son makes a bee-line to toys. I immediately call Jared, and let him know that this little tornado is heading to toys and he should try to contain the damage as much as possible. Before the kid makes it to toys, he stops over in the Halloween section and starts putting on masks and runs around the store trying to scare the other customers. After 4 complaints, Jared stops the kid, and drags him to his parents, who don't give one shit nor a giggle about what my manager has to say and wave him off. The kid bolts towards toys, and stars ripping toys down off the shelf. The floor looks like a miniature Antietam by the time he is finished. Now he has an armload of toys and decides to take them to the bathroom. Once in there, he places them on the floor, and proceeds to urinate on them. Jared walks in on him finishing up, and drags the kid back to his parents, leaving a trail of piss footprints behind him. Jared tells the parents what he did, and that they have to clean up the mess. This switches the parents into rage mode. They just cannot BELIEVE that their kid would do this! And he will be punished severely when they get home. Jared tells them calmly ""I am punishing you, not your child. You guys made no effort to control him, and even brushed me off after the first incident. You guys will clean up every mess he has made, and then you can leave. You are no longer welcomed here."" They start yelling profanities at him and their kid, saying how this is ridiculous and they shouldn't have to put up with this. 

After they cleaned up, they left empty handed. Jared received many compliments on how he handled the situation. It is the second worst customers I have ever had, even if I didn't directly deal with them. The worst, by far, has to be a couple out of towners. That is for another day though.

aturquoiseseashell,12,,25,1rg9do,,127,"End of shift at a famous, upscale department store, and I am already clocked out, with my purse on. I'm talking to my coworkers before I leave because I'm waiting on a ride home. I work in the lingerie department, which is near one of the 2nd story entrance doors to the store. 

A flustered woman comes up with three bags, one from Kate Spade, one from Michael Kors, and one from Tory Burch. She says she found the bags in the vestibule of the entrance to the store.
We thank her for her honesty and promise to call Loss Prevention to come and take the bags. She becomes agitated.

""Well I'm going to wait here and see that you do it,"" she snaps. She's suddenly riled up.

We're a bit taken aback, but continue to be polite to her and my coworker calls LP.

While my coworker waits on the phone to be connected to the security desk, I guess we kind of exchanged looks. (She was very antsy, and was holding onto the bags for dear life). The woman exclaims in outrage, ""Don't you all roll your eyes at me!"" 

""Ma'am,"" says my co-worker, ""No one is rolling their eyes. We're waiting for security to pick up the phone. They will make sure the bags are returned to the customer. Thank you very much for bringing them to our attention, we will see to it that they are returned to the customer."" 

The woman becomes more agitated and irritated. Finally, security picks up and my coworker says, ""A customer found some bags; one's from MK, one is from Tory Burch…""
The woman snaps, before my coworker is quite finished, ""And one from Kate Spade!!"" as though we purposely left that one out so we could steal it or something. 

""And one from Kate Spade,"" my co-worker adds. We're all getting kind of insulted by this woman's attitude. She seems convinced we're plotting to steal the bags, despite the fact that they remain in plain sight of the security camera. We're all well-dressed, well-spoken girls in our early twenties, and we are acting calm and polite. No apparent cause for suspicion.

Security says they can't help and to turn the bags into customer service, who coworker speaks to.
""Ma'am, please give me the bags. Customer service is coming to pick them up,"" my coworker says. We really want her to leave at this point. She's staring at us through narrowed eyes and she's breathing heavily.

""No!"" the woman shrieks, and clutches them to her chest. She tears frantically at one of them and finds a receipt. She begins dialing the number of Kate Spade. We're stunned.
""Please, ma'am…"" the coworker begins, but the woman literally shushes her and begins frantically reading the details of the receipt to the cashier at Kate Spade who is on the other end of the phone. 

She convinces an employee at Kate Spade to come to the dept. store to identify the bags.
Meanwhile, she announces that she will take the bags to customer service herself, in a very angry tone. ""You all are acting VERY suspicious!"" she declares, still clutching the bags to her breast almost maniacally. 

At this point, we're pretty alarmed by her behavior and beginning to wonder if she plans to steal the bags herself after seeing the prices on the receipt. My coworker calls the store manager, and we inform the customer that we would prefer that she remain in lingerie with the bags and wait for the manager. She loudly refuses to stay put. My coworker follows her to customer service.

From all the way in our department on the other end of the floor, we can hear the woman yelling. She had a quavery voice and a really strong British accent. 
Apparently, she got to customer service, and the couple who had left the bags was there. The woman refused to give them the bags without proof of their identity!! Finally the Kate Spade employee arrived and confirmed that yes, the bags belonged to the couple. 

I guess the woman was trying to do the right thing, but she insulted my coworkers and me and frightened various customers in the process. I still don't get why she became so suspicious or why she didn't just bring the bags to customer service in the first place.

KroipyBill,11,,40,1rhynu,,123,"After [writing about our cheering seasonal workers from Black Friday yesterday,](http://redd.it/1rf92j) it reminded me of this other story involving my goofy manager. 

When I first started working for this place, I came in clean shaven, and patchy hair. I was in denial that mother nature was closing my hair follicles for business, and it wasn't until after my engagement photos I decided to make a change. I shaved my head and have kept it that way ever since. I then grew a goatee to compensate for my loss. Honestly I looked much sharper than having the grassy field of hair you can see the horizon through. It was a relief to embrace it, and feel like I looked decent again. There was one manager who enjoyed messing with me however. In fact in my previous stories, I've quoted him several times in our conversations, since he was my favorite manager to talk to, and the biggest goof ball there. He vowed he would draw on my head when I wasn't ready for it. 

**Me:** Dude I'm taller than you. So unless you parachute from the rafters onto my cranium with your sharpie, you will not succeed. 

**Manager:** We'll see...we'll...see...

At that moment I wondered if he really was contemplating that attack strategy. At least he left it at just contemplating. 

One day, we were pretty busy. It was pre-holiday, post-black Friday days. I'm sure you all know the type. Everybody is getting geared up for Christmas. I found my way over to the computer department helping a customer decide what Mac they wanted. I was describing the hardware specs, how it works with their Apple products etc. During this I felt I was going to make a decent sale. However I made a massive mistake...

*I sat down.* 

Yes I slipped up big time. My manager saw this opportunity from what it seemed immediately. He walked over and distracted me by having another employee ask me a question. 

**Employee:** Hey KroipyBill you know where I can find [some bullcrap item that he knew the answer to.]

**Me:** Yeah sure. Remember they're eh...ahh...AHH!!!

Right then, my manager walks up to me with his pen, and I felt the coldness of the ballpoint touch my head, while it was dragged across my chrome dome. My entire body froze as if somebody stiffed my spine. I made a weird breathing noise, like I was experiencing sharp pains when it was just mainly a very tiny cold piece of metal on my head. Kind of like EAHH!! EAHH!! EAHH!!! (That's the best I can do textually.) They were quiet, sharp noises.

He walked off, cackling like the joker. I looked at my customer with this super surprised look on my face. He lost his crap, and just laughed. Because of this I sold him more attachments, but that's beside the point. 

Over the radio:

**Me:** The person who drew on my head. You know who you are. Thanks for helping my sale out by doodling with a ballpoint pen on my cranium. 

I looked around the store and saw those with a radio express such confusion. I'm a pretty tall dude, so for those who were in eye sight, I bent my head down so they could see the graffiti my manager brought forth upon my person. Much laughter followed, including my manager.

**Manager:** You said I would never get you. 

**Me:** Well bucket head, you're lucky I was sitting so your midget self could strike me. 

**Manager:** My strike is now complete. 

**Me:** It's a good thing I don't just go over there and rub my greasy head all over your face. I'm glad you feel all militaristic about your approach. 

**Manager:** Oh...this would be a much more fun Call of Duty game if this were part of the game play. 

I never got him back. And he has since left the store after I left. Despite us still being good friends, he's still a bucket head.

Minja78,35,,16,1rgqvv,,81,"Preface, I sell cars in the Pacific Northwest.  This story occurred back in October.   
    
It was a beautiful sunny day, which is not common in these parts from oh...October to May.    
    
A very proper looking lady walks up and asks for a salesmen that is off.  Lets call her Uber bitch (UB).  
    
Me, ""He's off today, is there something I can help you with?"" 
       
UB, ""I'm not sure your capable, 'L' was very knowledgeable.""  
       
Her tone was very matter of fact and frankly bitchy.     
     
Me, ""Lets do it this way, I'll help you to the best of my ability and if you're not satisfied you can come back and see 'L' when he gets back.""     
    
UB sighed and said, ""I suppose that will do. Tell me about your most advanced car.""     
    
Me, ""Advanced how?""     
   
UB, ""Technologically.""    
    
Me, ""That's a pretty broad spectrum, lets start with what kind of car do you want?  Like an SUV or Sedan.""      
       
UB, ""I don't see why this matters.""     
    
Me, ""I'm just trying to help you to the best of my ability.""    
    
UB, ""Well that clearly lacking.""      
    
Me, ""Apparently. I have an idea though lets go look at the new Avalon, they just had a fresh rebuild this year so I would say the have the most gadgets and cool technology in them.""     
    
UB, ""That's a start show me the way.""      
    
At this point I realized that I'm dealing with some sort of royalty by the way she's talking to me and looking at me like I was clearly beneath her.    
    
We walked out side and toward the Avalon's and as we rounded the corner I was blinded by the light of 1 sun (that mutha fucker is bright when we only see it a few times a year) so I do what I thought was natural, I put on my sun glasses. You'd think I killed her 2nd born spawn.    
        
UB stopped in her tracks and said, ""Excuse me, how long have you been in sales.""     
    
Me, ""About 15 years now, why do you ask?""    
    
UB, ""How dare you put your sunglasses on in front of a customer. You should know better.""    
    
At this point I'm done with her attitude. She can; buy a car, sell a car, die in fire for all that I'm concerned.    
    
Me, ""While were walking into the direct sunlight I'm keeping them on, once we get into a car I'll make sure to take them off so you can see my pretty greens again.""     
     
The look and sound of disgust from her should of withered some near by plants.     
    
UB, "" I don't want to look at the Avalon unless it has what I want on it.""      
        
I acted all surprised and said, ""Ahhh in that case thus far all you've told me is that you want technology on it. Every car on my lot has technology, how about you fill in the blanks for me and I'll get you what you need.""   I finished that last part with a touch of sarcasm.
    
UB, "" You don't have to take that tone with me.""     
    
I just started at her until she finally answered my question.    
   
UB, ""I want....""  Imagine everything every car in every scfi movie has done (some highlights: Voice activated everything, self driving, self maintaining, color changing, all electric or non-gas, The list goes on)     

Me, ""Mam for me to get you even a small percentage of these option I would need a time machine, what you asking for simply does not exist.""     
    
UB, "" You never tell a customer you can't get something for them it's improper sales.""    
    
Me, ""What's your thoughts on a Prius that parks for you, stops for you in emergencies and has rain sensing wipers?""    
    
UB let here vileness spew out of her and she said, ""That's all been out for years I don't want dated technology.""    
   
Me, ""What your asking for doesn't exist, I think the closest you'll come is the new Tesla but I can't think of anything in the mainstream car world that's even close to half of your list.""     
   
UB, ""You are an awful salesman then.""

Maloth_Warblade,6,,17,1rhx0y,,94,"Black Friday, 2011. Big, blue, zombie-filled box store. I was a photo tech.

It's been almost 2 years now, as I no longer work for retail. I did my 5 years with it and I'm done.

I'm glad I'm out, too. I don't hate people, I just learned that I hate being treated like less than crap, filth, and told I'm worthless on a daily basis. But this one was so irritating I spoke up.

I worked 2 stores on Black Friday in 2011, both the BBS and the famous game store. I was basically at work from Noon-8 on Thanksgiving at the BBS, missing all family gatherings, by the way, and then 11:30pm-7am at the games store (I was the only cashier by the way, in the most populated area of the county/city), and then 12-8 again on Black Friday at the BBS. 

I was tired, beyond tired, essentially 20hrs of work, on my feet with no breaks for food or bathroom due to chaos. The BBS frequently refused to give me my lunches until I was mandatorily locked out, and even then they simply made me work anyway (even got reported for going over 8 hrs without a break, wasn't given a choice).

 Needless to say, by the time 5pm rolled around, and not having eaten but a pop tart in 24hrs, I was having a sugar crash. These make you lightheaded, these make it hard to think and respond quickly. I was working my ass off to get greeting cards printed, packaged, priced and all the while walking everyone through how to use our touch-screen computers and simple tasks. 

One customer didn't like that I wasn't answering fast enough. Of course she didn't, it's Black Friday, and that I was being far too rude for her. She told me she didn't like how tired I was, that I shouldn't work at all if I was so tired. How worthless I was to be there, on the busiest day of the year, if I couldn't be bothered to be awake. 

At this point I interrupted her. I told her ""Lady, listen. I don't need this from you, not today. Not the day people die from customers entitlement. No. I've been working since pretty much Noon yesterday. I had to miss my family's Thanksgiving, again, and not only that, I couldn't even EAT any food yet. There's no time. I'm beyond having a sugar crash, I'm hungry, and beyond normal tired. If you're going to sit there and belittle me over this, you can just get out of my face and leave this place"" (or something VERY close to this, been a few years).

Of course I got loud to say this, and everyone looked at her. Associates, customers, even her husband. She tried apologizing, I kept interrupting her asking what else she needed, and she kept trying to change subjects..I wouldn't let her. She was the last straw I needed that day, and I wasn't having it.

Good news though, wasn't reported, wasn't written up. Had a very nice and thoughtful customer buy me a bag of chips and a soda after seeing me be berated by not only her but other customers. Made it home and promptly slept for 15 hours.

adelajoy,15,,15,1rg29x,,73,"I spent two years working at a big warehouse-style grocery store. I worked mostly as a cashier, but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a week.

Most of the crappy moments have all blurred together, but there are a few particular moments that stick out.

This grocery store is the only one in the area that doesn't bag your groceries for you. Each till has two long conveyor belts to hold your groceries while you bag them (Both the customer and the cashier have buttons to move the groceries down, away from the till). This speeds orders up, requires less staff, saves money and drops prices. People occasionally complain about it, but if they want to pay more for their groceries and have someone else bag them, they're welcome to. ... The store isn't exactly famous for customer service, but I think the prices make up for this.

I was one of the fastest cashiers on staff at the time. This meant that my belts would often get full. I had ways to deal with this. I knew how fast people packed, I knew how soon a belt would clear. I was really good at my job. One day, the lines were insanely long, I was working really fast, everyone was buying a lot. I got to a point that there were groceries on both of my belts, so I squeezed the smaller order down a little, watched for a moment, and knew that he would be down before the next order crowded him. I started scanning the next order, and smiled at the customers - a man and his very pregnant wife.

The wife snapped at me, ""Can you just wait!""

""Excuse me?""

""Can you wait? I don't want you to crowd out that other guy!""

I looked, and he was literally loading his last bag with groceries. I stopped scanning anyways, and maybe glared at the lady. I don't really like it when other people tell me how to do my job.

Eventually he was packed and gone, so I started scanning again. While I had been waiting, I had lined all of their canned goods up. I can scan cans super fast if they're all really close. I started scanning the canned goods, grabbing a can, tossing it to my other hand, and setting it on the other belt. Except that this woman had walked around (The belt she got was behind me) and was standing behind me, trying to bag the cans as I scanned them. I'm sorry, but I'm not actually looking where the cans go. I know the space, and I need to watch the computer screen, not my hands. Well, she kept trying to grab the one I'd just set down, which meant that I kept hitting her hand with the next can. I wasn't by any means throwing the cans, but I was moving quickly and she was in my space, so she was getting hit. I didn't actually realize that I was hitting her until she complained to her husband. So I slowed down, apologized, and moved on to her other groceries.

She then had a bag of apples. She had grabbed one of our bags and put three different apples in it, and tied it shut. I have to weigh each type of fruit separately, so I opened the bag, weighed the first apple, set it aside. I noticed her husband grabbed the apple right away. I weighed the second apple, and set it aside. He grabbed that one too. When I weighed the third, my plan had been to put all three back in the bag and tie it shut, but the other two apples were gone. I tied the bag around the last one and set it on the belt. If the husband wanted to pack the apples separately, he was welcome to.

The couple also bought about half a dozen little bags of frozen perogies. One of the bags had been ripped all the open, right down the middle, and frozen perogies were laying all over the belt. I considered not telling them, because I was mad, but I took a deep breath, rounded up all of the stray perogies, put them in a plastic bag, and informed the lady. I asked her if she would like me to send for a new bag. She snippily replied ""Yes"" as if I should have just known. Some people don't bother to get a new bag because it can hold up the line, so I always ask. Our runner quickly returned with an identical bag and I kept going.

When I finally finished (They bought *a lot* of stuff), the husband paid, while the wife stormed over to customer service. I watched as she talked to my supervisor, and eventually a store manager. I was getting pretty nervous. Oh, also I should mention this woman was rude and snapped every time I asked her a question. I was pretty angry by the time they left.

After they were completely done, my supervisor closed my till and asked to speak to me at customer service.

She said the lady had filed a formal complaint against me. Apparently the conversation went something like this:

**Pregnant Lady**: ""I want to complain about the cashier on till 9!""

**Nice Supervisor**: ""Till 9? Do you mean till 8?"" (I was on 9 - one of my quick-to-anger coworkers was on 8)

**PL**: ""No, I mean 9!""

**NS**: ""Like the girl with brown hair, *not* the blonde?""

**PL**: (getting frustrated) ""Yes!""

**NS**: ""So what did adelajoy do?""

**PL**: ""She was rude and short with me!""

**NS**: ""Adelajoy? Are you sure?""

**PL**: ""Yes! She also threw canned goods at me, *ripped* open a bag of perogies, scattered them *everywhere* and scattered all of my apples too! She also bruised all of my fruit because she was throwing them around!""

A store manager was brought down to take a formal complaint, which means it probably went in my employee file. The lady was calmed down and left, and that was the end of it. Typically, the store managers will meet with you to discuss complaints, and make sure they won't happen again. The fact that I didn't means either the manager simply didn't believe the woman, or wasn't concerned because it was my first (and only). The supervisor who helped her said she closed my till because I looked upset and she thought I needed a break. The only reason she told me was to find out what really happened. I told her my side, and she just laughed it off. I admitted to being short and snippy, but the rest was just ludicrous. I still cannot beleive she blamed me for the bag of perogies being ripped open, considering I told her about them, got a new bag, and spent a minute or two picking up all of the perogies. Also, why would I take the time to do that, when I was clearly rushed with everything else?

I get that pregnant women have a lot of hormones, and tend to be angry, short-tempered, whatnot, but I think there's a line. Also, the fact that her husband didn't stop her, stand up for me, or admit to grabbing all the apples kind of pissed me off.

Tl;dr: Crazy-hormones pregnant lady complained about me, but the supervisor didn't believe her.","In my spare time, I like to rip open your groceries and scatter them",88,talesFromRetail
unidentifiableblarg,12,,9,1rhfwt,,65,"**Back story:** I worked in a small convenience store in a town on the outskirts of a city. A lot of the customer's are regulars and have been coming here for years, decades even.

About 6 years ago the place changed hands, names and management too. Still provided the same sort of stuff though, so the locals kept calling it by it's old name. 

This is relevant, I swear.



**The story:** I'm serving on the registers at the front of the store, just doin ma biz, when a flustered woman comes up to the counter demanding my attention. I tell her I'll be with her as soon as I finish processing my currant customer.

This somehow seemed to offended her, so I was already off to a bad start. But I get to her and try to smooth things over with my best customer service voice (you know the one).

After a bit of just listening to her complaining and bitching in general she finally gets to the point.

""I bought this product here earlier and you (not me) charged me the wrong price! It's on special, why is it wrong blah blah blah""

The outrage was dripping off her.

Now, normally I'd be prepared to fix this, sometimes we just straight up get it wrong and stuff isn't the right price.

*But*, while she's ranting she's waving around a catalogue, that contains the magical special that we failed to give her.

Eventually she shoves it in my face to accent a point, and shows me what it should have been.

The catalogue wasn't for our store, we don't even sell the brand (ice cream, I think it was) that she seemed to have thought she purchased.

I politely explain that we're not an [old store] any more and that was why she didn't get the discount. But I'd be happy t...

Her: What?! I've lived her FOR YEARS and it's always been [old store]. You've got to be kidding me.

I point out the signs (they're everywhere) and shirts of the employees and explain that we've been [new store] for quite a while.

She persists though, demanding to get her discount because it's ""always been that way and why should I get screwed for what you did..."" just generally giving me a hard time; that kind of bullshit.

The managers will usually give the discount to them anyway, just to keep them happy, but I was sick of getting abused by people who apparently can't read and wasn't about to let this one fly. Pety, I know.

Eventually I get to the point where I'm just repeating myself and she's adamantly refusing to be 'robbed' of forty cents. So I call my manager to come up.

By this stage I'm sick of her shit and just want her to leave, customers are waiting to be served and I'm meant to be serving. Small store, small number of staff.

Finally my duty manager meanders up and he immediately grovels at her feet, begging her forgiveness and taking her to a spare register to sort out her problem. 


I'm not bitter (lies), but the smug grin she threw me on her way out made me really wish that our management stood up for us, at least sometimes.

And that I had a crowbar handy.

CommandoDerp,9,,17,1rhsfa,,62,"First off, I would like to say that I had two days off before this incident so I was unaware of any changes at work.

So I was at work after two days off when I was serving an elderly man, who was a regular, cigarettes. He asked for a particular brand in a carton of twin packs. I tell him unfortunately that the twin packs are classified as cartons themselves, and you cannot purchase a carton of a carton. He rolled his eyes and asked for 4 individual twin packs.

I immediately check the cupboard nearby of said twin packs of cigarettes that he wanted and I inform him that we are all sold out. This is the conversation that follows:

Him: ""Are you serious?""
Me: ""Yes, sorry. We are unfortunately all sold out until we get some more.""
Him: ""This is pathetic!""
Me: ""Would you like another flavor?""
He mumbles something to me which I repeat my previous question.
Me: ""Would you like another flavor?""
Him: ""No. This unacceptable. You are refusing sale""
Me: ""Is there anything else I can help you with as we don't seem to have what you are after?""
Him: ""I would like to speak to your manager.""
Me: ""Actually there might be some here""

I had a thought and I turned around and checked the display rack to see if there are any more in the display. To which I found 4 individual twin packs sitting there, I felt like an idiot not checking there first.

Me: ""I didn't realize that there was any in the display, I...""
Him: ""Your very lucky""
Me: ""I'm very sorry I did not check there first. I recently had two days off and I wasn't informed that what you were after was in the display. I'm sorry for any unconvinced""

He just sighs loudly and rolls his eyes and tells me one last thing while paying for his cigarettes.

Him: ""Your very lucky you found them or otherwise you would have lost hundreds and hundreds of dollars in sales and quite a few hundred customers because of your poor service.""

Payment is finished and I tell him I'm sorry again and to enjoy his night. He storms back into the store and complains to another staff member who was not in charge for the night.

The man left and the employee approached me asking what happened. I told them and they said not to worry, they knew it wasn't on purpose. The actual supervisor for the night approached me and asked what happened, they knew it wasn't intentional so they didn't seem too phased by it; even though I was the back up person in charge that night.","I don't know how to feel after my ""complaint""?",79,talesFromRetail
Drunken_Black_Belt,7,,8,1rhw8z,,59,"I'm back bitches!  About 2 months ago, I got a second job working part time at a men's Big &amp;Tall store.  The hours are easy, commision is alright, and to be honest, the customers are generally friendly and awesome.  It helps that a lot of them don't have anywhere else to shop. Unfortunantly the store isn't as eventul as my past retail jobs.  Its just selling clothes and shoes.  But I've gotten a few funny stories that I'll share over time here. And with the holiday's coming up, i'm sure I'll have plenty more.  

Welll, for your pleasure (hopefully), I present **Boy, Are My Feet Sore!**

**WARNING: GROSS!**

So recently I began working in a men's store for Big &amp; Tall sizes.  I knew of it because I buy my shoes there.  Only store that carries a size 15/16.  I am too small for the clothes, despite being 6'4 and slightly overweight.  And if I'm being honest,  seeing some of the people who come in makes me more motivated to keep losing weight (50 lbs this year alone).  

Now, don't get me wrong, SOME of the people have legitimate health concerns.  One gentleman was born with his left foot backwards.  During his childhood they would constantly have to break his foot, set it slightly closer to the proper position, let it heal, and repeat. But it never set 100% correct, keeping him from being able to run or exercise, or even stand for long periods of time.  It's guys like him I feel for.  Given a shitty deal in life and just having to suffer for it. 

Most customers, however, are just plain old fat guys.  I don't want to sound mean, or ""fat shame"".  But it's just poor lifestyle choices and such.  I was there.  I was 5lbs shy of 300 last new years.  And it was just being lazy and making bad choices.  I don't have as much sympathy for these guys.  And that brings us to our story today.

It's a sunny fall day.  It's midweek, and pretty dead.  I'm in my suit, fixing clothes, putzing around, pretty much just pretending to work.  I hear the door chime, and in walks an older couple.  Probably late 60's, very early 70's.  The lady was using a walker to move around, and the gentleman was resting his weight on a cane as he slowly moved with her.  They seemed like a nice enough couple, but as you know, those are the ones who always turn into assholes.

I introduced myself, asked how I could help them that day.  The man gruffly replied ""shoes"".  I brought them to the shoe department.  Now my store is small, and there is only one small bench to sit on, and it's in the shoe department.  Naturally, this oaf takes the seat, leaving his frail wife to stand.  I could tell she was having difficulty, being particularly petire and frail, so I went in the back and got her a folding chair to sit in next to her husband.  She thanked me, because manners.  The man, charming fellow that he was, just said ""can you get me some shoes now?"".  

It was about this time that I realized this was going to go south faster than a my ex g/f in a dick sucking contest.

I offered several suggestions, as the gentleman didn't seem to know what kind of shoes he wanted.  The man complained that most of our shoes don't even fit him. I expressed sympathy, as I have large feet and can only fit into the largest size available in store.  The man looked me up and down and sneered ""Well, you just have big feet. I have a health condition that causes this, so consider yourself lucky"".  

Eventually we found a pair he liked and thought may just fit his feet.  And that's when the real horror of this story starts.  The man then proceeds to roll up his sweatpants.  He was wearing ankle socks and sandals.  His feet are hugely swollen, and covered in open sores.  This guy has diabetes, and it's eating away at his foot.  Sadly it's fairly common where I work.  What came next, however, is not.

I hand him the shoes, and take a step back, giving him some space to put the shoes on, look at them in the mirror, see how they feel, etc.  

NOPE!  

He looks at me like an idiot and says ""Well I can't put them on myself.  I can't bend that far.  Put them on for me"".   

Now I am no fan of feet, even on a good day.  Sure if I'm dating someone, and they want a footrub, and their feet are clean, then i'll oblige.  But other than that, I just want nothing to do with that area of the body.  Add to the fact that we are talking about a stranger whose foot is literally covered in open, oozing sores.  

DBB: Sir I just can't do that, I'm sorry.

Man:  You need to help me.  I'm a customer and I need service.

DBB: There is no way I am doing that sir.  I am sorry but you have open sores on your foot and leg. It's unsanitary for both me and YOU, to have me do that.

Man: Oh just wash your hands after it'll be fine.

How this man survived 70 or so years with logic like that, will forever amaze me.  

DBB: Absolutely not.  

Man: I want the manger!  I'll have your ass for discrimination and harrassment

DBB:  I am the manager.  If you want the store manager call back tomorrow.  If you want corporate's phone number I'll give it with my name gladly.  


The man continued to yell and scream about receiving the shoes at a discount and having me fired.  Typical stuff for anyone who works in retail really.  I essentially told him that I wasn't going to touch his feet, and if he didn't like the service he could leave. Wife is trying to keep the peace.  It's not very effective.  Husband used Rage!  It's inneffective against DBB!  Besides my DEF is to high.  

Anyways, i wish there was some more to this.  Eventually he stormed out as dramatically as one can when you can barely walk under your own weight, and your wife is frail and moves about as fast a christian school girl with a chastity belt.  I did hear from corporate the next day though.  Naturally some of the details were changed when he called in, but once I explained about the sores, I receieve a ""Yea that happens all the time. Don't worry about it"".  

Sorry if it's not very exciting.  I'm sure I'll have some good ones coming up.  Hope you all are surviving the holidays!

Turns out, the woman was making a sizeable purchase and couldn't supply an adequate form of ID. I explained to her that we simply couldn't process her credit card without proper identification. She dug through her purse and tossed a bottle of birth control pills on the counter and was like ""Will this bottle work? No one can have these pills but me"" No ma'am ... birth control pills are not a form of identification. She then threw a world class tantrum using colorful language that would even make a seasoned sailor blush.

At that point, I let her know she was no longer welcomed at any of the locations in our state. She wanted my DM's info and I was like you're looking at her but if you'd like to talk to my Regional, I'll dial the number for you. She left at that point.

I was working in the jewelry department of a department/grocery store at the time. I'd been in that same department for 2 years by the time this incident took place. It was very early on a Saturday, before the rush, and a lady comes up to my counter to do a return. No problemo, I thought.

Me: I can do that return for you. Can I see your receipt ma'am?

Customer: I don't have it anymore. 

Me: I'll only be able to refund it to a gift card then, is that ok?

Customer: yeah, that's fine. 

One hurdle jumped. She hands me the item and I notice that it is in a package I have never seen before. I know my department like the back of my hand cause I'm the one that checks in -all- of the merchandise. Every item that has gone into the department in the last two years had to pass by me first. 

Me: ma'am are you sure you bought this here? I don't recognize this package. 

Customer, suddenly angry: of course I bought it here. (Spoiler, this a lie)

Me: ok, let me see if the system recognizes it. 

I scan the item at the register and I get an error. I look at the barcode and it's half as long as it needs to be (6 characters instead of 12, which is the store norm). 

Me: ma'am my register does not recognize this item. 

Customer: I bought it here!

Me, getting cranky at this point: are you -sure-? I've been in the department for two years and I've never seen this package before. Are you certain you didn't buy this at [dept store x] or [dept store y]?

Customer: I'm certain. I'm returning this for a friend and she bought it here! (Told ya)

Me: I'm sorry but I can't take an Item that doesn't even come up in the system. Especially if you don't have a receipt. 

Customer snatches the item from me and pulls her cell phone out: I am going to call her (the friend) and prove to you that it was bought here!! (She's nearly screaming at this point)

The customer walks away and makes her call. I watch her patiently from the counter and wait for her to return. She finally gets her friend on the line but is far enough away that I can't hear her. She's visibly pissed off and ranting to her friend. There's a short pause as she listens to her friend. Her demeanor changes completely. She looks at me once, turns, and walks out the door, presumably to return the item at the place it was bought from. ",Just discovered this sub today.

ScaldingSoup,5,,6,1rha57,,26,"So several  years ago I worked for a very popular lingerie store.  This store didn't pay commission, but would give us more or less hours per week based on sales performance.  My sales performance was VERY good.  I got more hours a week than most people.  

During the holiday season, we had a lot of seasonal employees, as any big retail store normally does.  One of the workers hired seasonally was this lady who was a lot older than the rest of us.  This was not the problem.  Her hair was bleached blonde, and growing out (showing obvious roots), and styled in a ""feathered"" fashion.  She did not know how to wear make-up and what she wore did not flatter her.  In this store our dress code was all black.   She wore skirts with no stockings, but with slouch socks and yeah, that was a hot mess.  

People began to call her the ""missing link"", as in to the 1980s because of the hair and her wearing slouch socks that were probably black in the 1980s but grey now.  Reading this, you may think that I judged her based on this, or have some animosity for people older than me.  I do not, but this just sort of describes what she looked like because it is important.  Black Friday rolls around, and she wears her normal dress of skirt, slouch socks and what-not.  Surrounding her socks are these bells that jingle..  

She begins waving panties in the air, helicopter style, like a stripper, chanting what the sale is as customers are passing by.  One of our gay male managers passes me by and mutters so only I can hear it ""I want her out"".  I was dying trying not to laugh at the situation, and meanwhile feeling very embarrassed for her.  Everywhere she walked, she jingled.

Some time during her short career with the lingerie store, she found my phone number on the schedule.  I guess they weren't giving her enough hours, because she had the nerve to leave me a message asking me for some of mine.

BlankName55,14,,6,1rgvl7,,23,"**Background**: I work for the spark store at a mega sized location. It's a regular location with a grocery store on one side and a nursery, essentially, on the other. I work in the party/craft/office section, although I've done everything and anything, from service desk to the truck to the phones (no, I believe you want the health clinic down the street, ma'am).

**Story (er, stories)**: 

1) I walk by the front door. Man approached with wife, stopped and said Excuse Me? Fine. I go over, and he started counting out a huge wad of cash. He counts $100 in small bills out, gives it to me, then says, ""Now, I want a propane tank, honey..."" 

He got the manager who resembles an NFL player instead. (Yes, I gave him the money back.)

2) Two young guys came through the checkout line with four carts of Head &amp; Shoulders, Dove bars, and some razors, I forgot the brand. This is ***-mart, it's cheap, and that's what matters. Three products. They racked up $1800 in this stuff. The one guy then pulled out of his pocket a pile of coupons that was quite literally a foot high. Mind already blown, I said half-jokingly, ""Those aren't all for me, are they?""

Yes. Yes they were. $1500 in coupons, $3 at a time. Do the math. And you couldn't do coupon repeats. Due to the volume, the *CSM thing came up halfway through, and I said ""Oh, the supervisor's going to have to turn the key..."" and they were all ""Ok, cool.""

So they hand over the remaining $300 cash (and people pay 500-600 all the time-that was normal) and the supervisor sees the key message on the palm pilot. I had every CSM (three on duty), the front end supervisor, two assistant managers, and every loss prevention person in the building (three-two associates &amp; the manager) at the register in what seemed like two seconds. 

The guy who'd had the coupons recognized the front end supervisor. He (coupon guy) went off and started going into it with the supervisor. The friend stands there numb, all the managers start talking at me, a CSM sticks the key in to abort this transaction, and I'm standing here holding $300 cash and a hell's lot of coupons. 

Then:
The customer let out a primal yell, the supervisor took the coupons from me, stuck them in the guy's hand, and wished him a good day-anywhere else. 

Turns out they were known scammers. The coupons would scan, but we can't get money back for them. I knew something was up, but I didn't know the back story. I just was asking myself over and over after this: If it had all gone through, and they'd walked out with $1800 of soap and shampoo, what the hell were they going to do with it all? Sell it at less than cost? Fill a swimming pool? Get ridiculously clean?

Well, because the star of this story is my son but, after reading all the posts about awful parents/kids, I wanted to share a funny story about a good kid and parents who are trying their best.

This story happened when my son was 4.  It takes place in the store where I work.  I wasn't there at the time.  My son, I'll call him Cee, was browsing the toy department with his dad while they were waiting for me to finish my shift.  

While Cee and his dad are looking at the toys, a woman with two children comes into the aisle they are in.  The older of the two, who is about the same age as Cee, sees something she wants and asks her mom for it.  Mom says no.  The little girl begs and pleads but mom holds firm and keeps telling her no.  Then the girl pulls out all the stops and throws herself on the floor, kicking and screaming, in a full blown tantrum.

Cee watches for a few seconds and then walks over to the girl.  He kneels in front of her and says:  ""Well, if you act like that, you really won't get anything.""  And then he walked back to his dad.  

Cee's dad was trying hard not to laugh but the woman didn't find it so funny.  She looked embarrassed and angry.  She grabbed her kids and stormed off.

copisreallybad,4,,6,1rhulb,,22,"a few days ago, i get called down to the returns desk from the paint desk. the return policy for the chain i work at is very lenient, but we aren't supposed to take mixed paint back, so already walking down there i had a bad feeling that i would have to get a manager involved (and we all know how incompetent they can be)

so i get there, and to my surprise it's just a regular can of unmixed, white, exterior paint, which *is* returnable without manager involvement. i ask the guy what's wrong with the paint and he says that it's frozen and we need to fix it or give him another can.

i bring the can to the paint desk and open it up. now, imagine what half frozen, hardened paint looks like. that's what this paint looked like, and the following conversation sort of went like this.

me: ""this paint is frozen, did you leave it in the garage or something?""

customer (now visibly irate): ""ABSOLUTELY NOT I BOUGHT IT AND I JUST OPENED IT THIS MORNING AND TO MY SURPRISE IT LOOKS LIKE THIS""

me: ""I'm sorry but we really aren't supposed to take paint like this back, it's useless to us returned""

customer (literally about to pop a blood vessel in his brain at this point): ""WELL MAYBE IF YOU GUYS HAD FUCKING SOLD ME A GOOD CAN OF PAINT IT WOULDNT BE FUCKING FROZEN. I WANT A MANAGER, NOW""

great, this guy knows how to get what he wants. i call a manager and explain the situation to him. the manager, being a typical manager, offers him a plethora of free things, including brushes and a brand new can of paint. the customer walks away with his free things (that i have to get for him) with the smuggiest ass look on his face.

story over, right? nope. i bring the can of paint to receiving, ZMA and hazmat it (since we can't sell it, it's fucking frozen and you can't paint with it). done deal im thinking, right?

not even close, bby. picture a hambeast of a woman. ok, maybe not that big, but she had a hard time fitting inside the reach truck sometimes. she is the department head of receiving. basically she sits in receiving on her computer waiting for trucks to arrive. 

now picture her carrying the frozen can of paint to the desk, except i actually had to see it happen. 

okay, okay, what the fuck is going on, im thinking. maybe i didnt mark it down correctly or something, maybe she'll show me how to hazmat it, i have no idea. im also in the middle of explaining to an older woman the different paint finishes we sell. 

nope, she has the nerve to tell me to just ""stick it in the paint shaker for a minute or two and see if we can try and sell it as OOPS paint."" at this point im all whatthefuck.jpeg, the paint is fucking frozen and shaking it won't help. i try to explain this to her but she would have none of it and walks away, and me, being the lowly, minimum wage paint associate that i am, do as she says. i stick it on the OOPS rack and continue my day.

the story ends when the department head of paint sees it on the OOPS rack, laughs, and takes it to receiving himself to hazmat it.

I worked in a a supermarket produce department for about 13 months.  But there was a guy who came in he'd wear a suit and gel his hair to make himself look important, but the only time id see him in my department was sampling my food or outright shoplifting. 
One of the things he'd do would come up to me and say something along the lines of
""Hey Champ, can you cut me a piece of this ""insert fruit here"" , ive heard this batch is extra juicy"" and then once hed taste it hed spit it out and say 
""Yuck thats disgusting, im glad i wasnt going to buy it"" and just storm off. He did this to me quite a few times and hed throw the skin or peel of it onto my displays and I was quite pissed off with all of it. 

He came in and and I recognised him. And the convorsation went as follows. 

Him: Hey Champ, do you mind if I try one of these Mandarins, they seem mighty delicious. 

Me: No you cant

Him: Why the hell not?

Me: Because its shoplifting, you have no intention of buying it, youve done this before you ask if you can try some and say its disgusting then walk off and all youre going to do is peel it, take one bite leave the the rest of the fruit and peel on my display and im not paid to clean up after you and its not a buffet either, what youre doing is taking stuff you havnt paid for, so its actually theft. So no you cant!

He stood there for about 6 seconds trying to think of something to say and all he could muster up was yelling:
Hey I use to work in a fruit store aswell, I know what its like, so deal with it!

And he just walked off, I kept an eye on him too, he didnt buy anything but just walked out the front of the store (giving me an evil eye) and then out the door to the carpark.

He did come back into the store a few days later, but I didnt see him in the produce department again while i was there ( I only did 3pm until Midnight, but he might have come in between 7am and 3pm or while someone else was on) but when I saw him ordering things from the deli hed give me a bitter stare but that was it.

While they're standing in line why wouldn't they pull it out of their wallets instead of when they are at the front of the line? Or sign the receipt which is also required by law. I have to ask them EVERY SINGLE TIME. It's very frustrating. I go through the same thing every day and they never learn. I also get several customers who don't even speak English which is also frustrating. How can I ask you for things that are required by law when you don't speak my language?

Anyway, this next story was also from Barschmucks. If I didn't mention before, this was a franchise location inside of a large supermarket. We were technically employees of the supermarket even though we were real certified baristas. But this meant that many of our coworkers were cashiers and stock guys. One of the stock guys was Otis. He was a huuuuuge black dude who didn't converse much when he came by for his free cup of ice water but seemed like a pretty good guy.

I wasn't working when this happened, but my AST (Evan) told me about it. It's dead and he's just cleaning up waiting for the last few stragglers to wander in when Otis cruises up to the counter. Evan asks him what he'd like but Otis doesn't say anything and just stares at the menu. Evan goes back to cleaning while Otis contemplates the meaning of life. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Otis opening up the tea rack and fumbling for a tea bag (already this is a no-no, not only are we the only ones supposed to touch that tea, but we have to use tongs because it goes right in a customer's drink.) 

Evan doesn't have time to say anything before Otis lifts a bag to his nose and takes a deep whiff. 

He goes: ""What is this? Vanilla Rooibos? (He pronounced it ""roo-bis""; it's actually ""roy-bohs"".) Mmmmmmm. If a girl smell like dis, I'd lick her all *up* and down.""

Then, as quickly as he came, he put the tea back back, and left without saying a word.

We specialize in helping people with injuries and have a very specialized staff, program, and equipment. We are attached to an apartment complex that is spread out over a couple of buildings. The laundry for the complex is in the building adjacent to us. Now to use the laundry machines you are required to use a proprietary card that has to be purchased from a machine. I don't know what someone was smoking one day but instead of putting the machine that dispenses and allows people to add money to there card next to the laundry machines (even though there is plenty of room), someone decided to put the machine in the lobby of the gym. 

Where I work I have a very large window that overlooks the parking lot and see everyone who comes and goes and where people park. I had someone park or fly in the handicap spot (we'll call him Scumbag Steve or SS to keep things simple). SS jumps out of the car and runs full sprint into the lobby to add money onto his laundry card. After a minute or so I hear a knock on the window and we a quick interaction that goes like this:

Me: ""Sorry.""

SS: ""Yo man what about in your wallet, I know you can personally make me change?""

adelajoy,0,,1,1ri8kg,,22,"I spent two years working at a big warehouse-style grocery store. I worked mostly as a cashier, but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a week.

Most of the crappy moments have all blurred together, but there are a few particular moments that stick out.

I realize this isn't the craziest story on here, but I will probably never forget this lady. 

Backstory: Our store had a policy that if an item scanned differently than the price tag, the customer would get it for free, up to $10. The mistake happened because the price tag didn't get changed, or was misplaced. If they spotted a problem, we would go look. If we found a tag in front of their item with the same code and a different price, we gave it to them and changed the tag. If the tag was for a different item, they didn't get anything. 

I was working the customer service desk, and a lady stormed up. I had several customers on the go at the moment, but it was pretty clear she *needed* help right away. As soon as I could, I asked what I could help her with. She was holding a bottle of toilet cleaner, her receipt and a price tag. Let's call her Crazy Customer, CC for short.

**CC**: ""I bought this bottle of toilet cleaner, but it was the wrong price! You guys are trying to charge me too much!""

**Me**: ""Okay, can I see your receipt?""

**CC**: *Hands me the receipt.* ""I tried to tell the cashier, but she didn't believe me!""

**Me**: *I checked who her cashier was, and it was one of our long-time girls. She knew the policy. There was no way she ""didn't believe"" the customer.* ""Okay, so the price came up $3.99, I'll just send a price-checker out to see what the tag said.""

**CC**: ""Oh, I grabbed the price tag already."" *She hands me the price tag. This lady is pretty worked up,  I'm not sure if she just wants to get out of the store, or if she's trying to pull one on me.*

A policy was that the tag had to be on the shelf. If a customer brings it to you, who's to say they didn't take it off the shelf last week and save it? They also could have found it in the wrong place, somewhere that the stock employees wouldn't have checked to fix the tag. As with most stores I've been to, store policy is to inform the customer about the relative store policies, and then see if you can help them anyways. No matter the problem.

It study the tag, and inform her of the policy, that the tag would have to be on the shelf. I start to let her know I can contact a manager, but she snatches the tag back and interrupts me.

**CC**: ""Well if that's your policy, I'll just put it back on the shelf! I was trying to save you some goddamn work, but I guess if you guys want to work extra, I'll just go put it back!""

She took off before I could say anything. I was just standing at the desk, aghast. I didn't even know what to say. 

The supervisor that was on shift was the scary kind. You know, the kind that isn't afraid to yell a little, handles the worst customers, and isn't phased when people call her names. Let's call her Jane. When the woman was gone, I grabbed Jane and told her the whole story. She said, ""Okay. When she comes back, let me know who she is. I'll handle her.""

As soon as I saw the customer coming back, I hissed, ""Jane! Jane! Jane! White hat! That's her."" I then ducked behind the display at customer service, and quite actually hid back there until the customer was gone. I could hear her yelling at Jane. I don't know what the verdict was. Any other manager, and the customer would have gotten the item for free, but it's hard to say with Jane.

I remember one of my coworkers came around the display and exclaimed my name. I hushed them, and told them I was hiding. I was so afraid the woman would see me and do one of those, ""Her! That's the one I was talking to! She told me this!"" And drag me back into it.

I've never hid from a customer before or since. Oh! Fun fact: The price tag she was holding said $3.29, a $0.70 difference from what she paid, and the tag was dated for the week before, which means it wasn't the current price. Not to say it wasn't still on the shelf, but there is a chance she did save it and bring it back in, especially with how worked up she was.

He was friendly and talkative to my kids and was asking me about my tattoos while we were waiting. The cashier was probably 55, spacey, but very sweet woman. When it was old guys turn to check out, I overheard their conversation at the register, and it was obvious they were both long time veterans to the store. 
The man had some trouble checking out. He rang his credit card through the machine multiple times while chatting with the cashier and he seemed confused. Eventually, she explained that he didn't have to keep swiping his card, and that his transaction was complete. In the mean time, she was scanning my items. 
The cashier chatted up a storm with me too. Asking about my kids while I was trying to wrangle them. I was getting a little impatient at this point because my 1 and 3 year old were ready to get the hell out of there, but I listened to her stories with patience. She was kind too.
When she finished scanning my food I pulled my card out to run through the machine, but it was asking for a signature, when I hadn't scanned my card yet. 
Me: ""there must be a mistake, I haven't slid my card through but it's already asking for a signature""
Cashier: ""no, you did, you must have forgot"" -looks at screen- ""you swiped your America express""
Me: ""No, I don't have an Amex, see?.. Oh no did the man in front of me swipe his card while you were ringing me up?""
Cashier: ""uh oh, that must have been what happened""
She looked panicked, but printed the receipt and said ""I'll just do this"" AND SIGNED THE RECEIPT
Cashier: ""He'll be okay, he can be so spacey. Don't even worry about it""
She at first folded up the receipt like she was going to trash it but I asked her if that was really ok, and that I could wait for a manger. She unfolded the receipt and told me not to worry. There was a long line behind me and frankly I was ready to get the fuck out of there with my crazy kids. I asked her ""are you sure? I feel uncomfortable"" 
She told me not to worry, and to go ahead and leave. And I did. 
I think her career might have ended today.
TLDR; Elderly man in line ahead of me accidentally paid for my groceries, cashier eventually realized but didn't give a fuck to fix it. I got free groceries :/

EDIT/UPDATE: I can see how it looks like I was unsympathetic in my post. I was in fact, horrified. I know the groceries weren't free, I just did not pay for them. In my car, I wrote down the time, my total $78.43 and what I thought the mans total was before me $43, and the name of the cashier. I should have stuck around and put my foot down but I was flustered and unsure how to proceed.  I was planning on calling when I got home, and totally forgot about the whole thing until I was in bed redditing from my phone late at night.
This morning I called and spoke with a manager, giving him all of my information. I told him I would happily come back and pay for the groceries and to please make sure the man did not actually get charged (hoping the cashier took the issue to the manager after I left). He said he will look into the receipts from last night and give me a call back. I will update again when I hear from him.

I was behind the register filling out the daily statistics and my manager was folding some clothes. The mall was about to close and we were all just finishing up, trying to go home. 

So, this kid walks in dressed as Gumby and we all laughed/joked around with him for a minute. Then, I was pretty sure I saw him walk out of the store since the mall was closing. 

10 minutes later I was ringing the last customer out and thought I saw my boss out of the corner of my eye so I turned around to talk to her. Turns out it wasn't my boss. Gumby had somehow snuck back in and thought it would be funny to come behind the register and stand over my shoulder and scream ""Boo!"" in my face as soon as I turned around.

insecure_shit_knob,3,,2,1rie8h,,21,"Short and sweet one today. For new readers of my stories (welcome back to the other three), I'm a front end manager at a giant retail chain. Dealing with customers and cashiers is my job, and I only have the job because I'd rather work than be bored. I have enough money to not work, so I am not scared of losing my job.


On to the story:

One of my favorite cashier's (seriously, she's so sweet and helpful. I always drop what I'm doing to answer her questions because she's one of the three that I trust) calls me over for a price check on a set of plates. Customer says they were $29.99, but when I go check they're $49.99. She says that's fine and she pays for them. Done and over, right?

Wrong.

About ten minutes later she comes over to my podium. I already know she's getting coal from me in her stockings (merry Christmas bitch).

Her- ""I was just over there looking at the plates again. They were there just in the wrong spot.""

Me- ""I'm sorry ma'am, I'll let an associate know so he can fix it. I'm a little busy to get to it."" Which I was, I was getting five different change orders ready.

Her- ""Isn't it your job to fix it?""

Me- ""actually no it's not. I'm the front end manager. There are two managers who work in that area, it's actually their job technically. If I would've seen the plates,I would've put them in the right spot.""

Her- ""So you're just a lazy asshole.""

Ok, I'm done. I talk to everyone in a civil manner, but when they take that tone with me, I'm done.

Me- ""yep""

Her- ""You're not going to fix it?""

Me- ""Nope, too lazy right now.""

This was followed by more angry questions and statements until I walked away to deliver my change orders. She tracked an assistant manager down and let him have it about my attitude. He's a pretty cool guy, came up to me later, asked what the deal was and just laughed when I told him. Now he always asks if I'm lazy today when he sees me.

I don't remember much from it except for this story. Working storefront; typical day, typical customers. This older, possibly Italian gentleman came up and I asked to take his order.

Man: May I see your hand?

I think I just stood there looking at him for a moment. He had an Italian accent so I was thinking I may have misheard him, and asked for his order again. He held his hand out and insisted to see mine.

Now, this guy didn't look creepy or scary or anything. If so I would have just bolted. But I was 17 and put on the spot so I gave him my hand.

Man: What is your name?

At the time I still had my ""Trainee"" name tag so it wasn't on there. I don't know why I gave him my name. I didn't really know what else to do.

He then proceeded to serenade me in front of the entire store. Granted, there were only about 10 people around. He held my hand with enough force that I could not easily pull it away and I stood there flushed red while the rest of the staff laughed at me. Apparently it's happened before.

He sang in deep Italian (and I heard my name thrown in there) for a good two minutes before he let me go. I had to stand there awkwardly while begging with my eyes to be saved by my coworkers, but they certainly weren't going to put an end to their amusement any earlier than necessary. I don't even remember if he ordered anything.

IIWinterbreezeII,2,,3,1rhy5m,,2,"I'm not a retailer, but this story's close enough, so screw it.

I was volunteering at a local zoo for a special Halloween event for about 3 - 4 hours. It was the last night of the event, and I was in charge of handing out prizes for games. It was a pretty good job, and I got to have as much free soda as I wanted, since I was in the concessions booth. I had to set out prizes, read tickets to see how many points a kid had, tell them how much each prize was (They could mix and match), then calculate how many points they had left as they chose. They'd choose their prizes, I'd hand it to them, and they'd leave. 

I had a friend of mine with me for the first hour, and we split the customers when it got busy. (Around 5 people at the same time.) At one point I spilled my soda, and she handled the crowd as I cleaned up the mess.

Then she left. Oh god.

I was left to set out prizes for display, serve customers, and translate kid-speak by myself. At some points I was so swamped with customers that I could barely figure out the total points for each kid as they got prizes.

Another girl came it at low tide, but left before it got busy again. (Around twenty minutes.) I wasn't allowed to leave my station to try and find her, so I had to deal with all the customers alone. (She wasn't actually allowed to leave either, but she gave zero fucks. Bitch.)

Scott5114,0,,3,1riony,,13,"I've met a lot of strange customers in my time at the casino. This guy takes the cake as the most fucked-up, unpleasant guy that's ever darkened our doorstep. We'll call him Dick because he is one.

To begin with, Dick is in the casino for a fucked-up reason. He's dying of cancer, or some other terminal disease. He spends his last days in our casino trying to win an inheritance for his children. Of course, mathematics says it's not going to happen, so he's squandering what money he does have and the remainder of his life sitting in a smoky room with no natural light playing $25 per spin on a slot machine. 

I wouldn't judge him so harshly for that if he wasn't a colossal asshole. Pretty much everyone who has had to pay a jackpot for him has some sort of unpleasant experience to share. Mine was when I was processing a jackpot for him and I go to clear the jackpot message from the screen. See, if you win, say, $1500, and you had $80 in credit when you hit it, when the attendant clears the jackpot your $80 will still be left on the machine. People sometimes forget or don't know this, and will leave the money on the machine and walk away, so after clearing it most of us will say ""You still have $80 left on the machine."" Of course, when I mention this to Dick, he flies into a rage, screaming ""I CAN SEE THAT! GOD!"" I started dodging his jackpots when I knew where he was playing after that—I don't put up with that sort of BS—though I still had to pay him out a couple of times after that because I didn't realize who it was. 

And Dick did hit a lot of jackpots. He would usually destroy the copy of the W2-G tax forms we would give him, I guess thinking since he's dying he won't need to worry about paying taxes, though you would think he would realize his kids would be on the hook for all of it. He also had the tendency to swear ambiguously so you never really knew whether he was calling the machine or you a piece of shit. Management had talked to him a couple of times about treating the attendants better. He did tip the bare minimum to not be considered an ass in that department, at least.

All of that is backstory to properly put in context what happened this week. At this point, Dick's managed to piss off enough attendants that most of the shift is dodging his calls, so it takes him probably twice as long to get someone over there than it would anyone else. This, coupled with the fact that he's losing heavily, pisses him off. 

Management gets called over to a machine in my section. I'm generally pretty curious about these things, so I head over there. The machine's touchscreen (retail price quoted to me by a tech as $700 or so) is totally shattered. The machine still has $20 on it—with an inoperable touchscreen, there's no way to cash that out on this machine. There's a patron further down the bank who saw the whole thing. Said the guy was losing, got pissed, punched the screen, threw a piece of paper down, and stormed off. One of the managers that showed up picks up the paper.

It's a torn-up W2-G with Dick's name, address, and social security number on it. A little bit of searching in the computers turns up copies of his driver license and the hotel room he is in. And of course the whole incident is caught on tape.

We don't know what happened to Dick after that. Apparently it became the responsibility of the casino's assistant general manager, and she isn't talking. We're all watching the usual locations for ban notices to go up, though.",The worst casino patron in the world,16,talesFromRetail
GlowingBall,2,,2,1rioer,,16,"These are my Tales of Retail Loss Prevention....

Part Three – Citizen Snips (Aka - The Pants Aquatic)



As a recap for those of you who have never read one of my stories before – I am a male in the midwest who is on the wrong side of his twenties and works retail loss prevention for a major retailer (one of the 'Big 5').  I am underpaid for what I do but enjoy my job none the less.  A majority of my time is spent wandering the floor or watching middle aged moms shop for clothing far too skimpy on them via CCTV (closed circuit television or 'security cameras').  Every once in awhile I get a case that is just so mind blowingly 'WTF' that I have to share.  

This story opens up with me doing just as I said above – watching people on CCTV.  It is a blisteringly cold afternoon so the customers, far more content to stay in their warm homes and snuggled beneath their blankets, are few and far between.  I, as the ever watchful hawk of justice that I am, was busy playing a Marvel version of Candy Crush Saga.  My job provides me the liberty of slacking off a good amount and my boss is rather lenient as long as I continue to bring in a good amount of stops per month.  I am sitting there diligently trying to match up small colored tiles with one another when I am startled by a sudden ring – the phone is going off!  

Now the phone going off is common place.  We get tons of calls a day ranging from the frozen dairy department calling to tell us a temperature alarm is going off (we know...it goes off for us as well) to people asking us to deactivate a door alarm (we also know...we see you standing at the door).  This happened to be a call from one of the few places that doesn't call us often – the meat department.  The guy on the other end, a tall black man with more muscle than he knows what to do with, calls to tell us that there is a guy standing in front of the freshly butchered meat.  The guy has refused any help the meat employee has offered and continues to say he is 'just browsing' for over ten minutes.  This strikes me as rather odd.  Who just hangs out around the meat department?  I quickly devise a plan for the situation.  I tell the employee to walk into the back so I could see just what the person was going to do.  

The employee hangs up and walks over to the man to let him know he is going to be into the back and to ring the bell if he needs anything.  No sooner than when he had walked into the back but the man glanced around and then walked behind the counter.  My adrenaline already began to rush as my suspicions came to fruition – he was going to steal!  “Oh shit here we go, ” I declared, only to watch in confusion and frustration as he walked right past all the glass displays full of meat and right over to the lobster tank.  Now if you aren't familiar with these tanks they are exactly just what the name implies – a water filled tank full of live lobsters we sell by the pound.  Their claws are bound and they just kind of hang out crawling all over one another.  Kids love to sit there and watch them.

“No way...is he really going to...” I whispered as I watched on in awe.  Sure enough he reached right into the live lobster display tank we have.  After a moment of 'fishing around' he plucked the lobster he wanted from the tank and pulled it out of the water.  Before I could even make heads or tails of the situation he glanced around once more and shoved the lobster right down the front of his pants.  The guy, whom shall be hence forth called Lobster Johnson, then proceeded to shuffle run his way out of the meat department and through the grocery department towards the front of the store.  The only way I can really describe how he ran was a forward version of Zoidberg's shuffle.  All he was missing was yelping out “Woop woop woop woop!” loudly as he went.  

Needless to say he wasn't too hard to stop.  I may not be in the best shape of my life but I can still move quicker than a guy with a large lobster squirming around in his pants.  He didn't fight me at the door or even try to argue what he was doing.  After all, it is kind of hard to argue that you aren't stealing when you have a large, lobster shaped bulge in your pants.

Bonus icing on top of the cake: I usually ask the person why they are stealing.  It usually won't change anything but it fulfills my curiosity and keeps them talking which usually calms them down a bit.  This guy tried to say that he was stealing the lobster for his kids...

I decided to go get some water during my shift the other day so I headed towards our water fountain, which happens to be down a narrow hallway and is between the bathrooms and is opposite the hallway from our offices/breakroom area.  As I come around a corner in said hallway I almost bump into our Store Manager (SM from here on out) who is in the middle of cleaning the bathrooms.  SM and I start chatting and from the men's room I hear some loud noises.

""What the hell was that?"" I ask

""Damn kids screwing around."" SM replies as he sets down the bag of trash he had been holding and walks over to the men's room.

Now, SM isn't a particularly tall guy, but he lifts weights quite a bit and could very well be described as being jacked.  Somehow, from time to time, people think it is a good idea to fight him, so I stuck around in case he needed backup.

SM opens the men's room door hard, slamming it into the wall and bellows, ""What the HELL are you doing in my bathroom?""

--inaudible reply--

""Yeah, well it is a pretty sad day when I have to kick someone out of the bathroom, now get the hell out."" SM says at a slightly reduced volume.

""B..But my stomach hurts."" says a meek voice from inside the bathroom.

Then at a normal volume, but with a tone of voice that sounded like SM had ice in his veins he replies, ""Carry it somewhere else.""  Then he stared into the bathroom in a manner that was somewhat intense.

With that the teens walked out of the store with their heads hung in shame.

ME: What we can do for you though is our 90 day comfort guarantee swap out. Can I have your name Ill look your ticket up and well see what we can do. 

He seems to calm down a little bit and he takes a seat across from my desk and he gives me hi name. I look up his name and pull up his ticket as Im explaining the comfort guarantee I look at his ticket. And then at the date he bought it(ya know to make sure its at least close to 90 days) I was willing to be flexible to make this guy happy when I notice he bought this mattress 9months ago!! Im flexible but not *that* flexible

ME: Uhh Sir, Im sorry to say this but you bought this mattress 9months ago, that 6months over the 90days. Theres nothing we can do for you. 

That when he became absolutely IRATE with me. Screaming something about how this is bad business practice, he deserves to get a refund, we owe it to him. Blah blah blah. [Im done this this shit](http://i.imgur.com/InDPcFn.gif)

ME: SIR. There is nothing we can do, the comfort exchange policy was explained to you when you bought it, if you didnt like the mattress you should have come back 6months ago, now Im going to have to ask you to leave the store. 

Well he didnt like that very much. He was becoming increasingly angry and hostile. Hes leaning over my desk pointing his finger right in my face([Which I hate](http://i.imgur.com/u77ThfE.gif)) but I keep my cool, and as sternly as I can say

ME: Sir if you dont leave immediately I will be forced to call the police and have you removed from my store.

I was in shock I composed myself quickly, called the police, and then my boss and explained everything that happened. 

I guess that asshat forgot that he gave us his address to deliver the mattress to, he ruined about 5beds which he was made to pay sticker price for on all of them(sticker price is close to $300 more than what we normally sell for)

jessajuhanabi,30,,94,1rhnqp,,397,"As of last Thursday, I am the head manager of a retail outlet and cafe, answering only to my boss, since the only girl above me quit. All people that walk in, call or email come through me. My boss is normally around but he works on coffee machines most days. 

As backgound for this story: His brother is a c*nt. I live in Australia, so that term seriously fits him. He owes a bunch of people money, is generally an asshole, and my boss is very sad his brother has changed so much. It stresses my boss out as their finances are tied due to a trust. 

Today, a lady walks in around 11:30, and walks up to the front desk. Politely, she asks me, ""Is (boss) in?""

In my mind, she was another person that he knew since he's been running this business for 20+ years, or a rep from some company that I didn't care about. He turned around to look at her, and I pointed in his direction. 

She immediately starts spouting about how boss's brother, we'll call him AH for asshole, owed her money. This is not a surprise to boss. He knows her. He's heard from her over email before. In which he told her he has no access to the trust and he's also fighting AH for money. 

This does not please the lady, henceforth known as douchecanoe. DC repeats over and over, despite pleas from my boss to chase down AH, ""I'm not leaving without my money. Get it for me.""

Now, DC wants a hefty sum. A couple thousand dollars. My boss offers her a coffee while he tries to reach AH. A water. A chair. Nothing. She stands in front of our stock and repeats herself over and over. ""Give me my money. Give me my money. I don't care its not my problem. YOU pay me.""

Why is she going after my boss? Because she's gone through the courts, they told AH to pay, and he still hasn't. Her response? Come into my store and stand there all day every day until HIS BROTHER, pays her. 

Now, my boss tries and tries to get her to understand he has no access to the money. No go. So instead she stands in our store, silent, for 4 fucking hours. Four. DC stands there so long my boss gets fed up and stressed, and leaves. 

The difference is, he's a peace keeper. I was itching for him to leave. I was just going to have the cops come eject her. I was EXCITED. 

Unfortunately she realized rather quickly I was not the ""nice cop"" type so she stood out the front, called in a few friends and intermittently yelled ""YOU KNOW THIS IS SO SILLY I JUST WANT MY MONEY FROM THE (BUSINESS)"" and ""I KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE IN XXXX SUBURB I COULD RUIN A BUSINESS IF I WANTED TO."" through the window at me. 

Oh god. You scare me so much. I might pee my pants. 

Anyway she eventually gave up and left without coming back inside, probably since I was watching her and smiling, willing her to come inside so I could call the cops. 

Oh well, another day I suppose! Maybe she'll be back tomorrow...

DolfyuttSrednaz,58,,48,1rh8hc,,200,"I have got to say, after working 4 years in retail, parents should be responsible for their children's actions. I have seen so many kids acting like demons that have just spawned from a dimension full of pointy sticks being shoved up their asses, but I never blame the kids. I usually don't even blame the parents, because kids are kids, but when customers blatantly let their kids run around like Sonic on meth, I blame the parents. that is why we have an announcement that plays every few minutes, reminding customers to keep their little shits in line. So when a customer like the one I had comes in, I usually inform my manager (who will be called Jared) of the situation and he watches the kid from a distance. 

A middle-aged couple stumbles into the store with their 7 year old son. They head off to furniture, but their son makes a bee-line to toys. I immediately call Jared, and let him know that this little tornado is heading to toys and he should try to contain the damage as much as possible. Before the kid makes it to toys, he stops over in the Halloween section and starts putting on masks and runs around the store trying to scare the other customers. After 4 complaints, Jared stops the kid, and drags him to his parents, who don't give one shit nor a giggle about what my manager has to say and wave him off. The kid bolts towards toys, and stars ripping toys down off the shelf. The floor looks like a miniature Antietam by the time he is finished. Now he has an armload of toys and decides to take them to the bathroom. Once in there, he places them on the floor, and proceeds to urinate on them. Jared walks in on him finishing up, and drags the kid back to his parents, leaving a trail of piss footprints behind him. Jared tells the parents what he did, and that they have to clean up the mess. This switches the parents into rage mode. They just cannot BELIEVE that their kid would do this! And he will be punished severely when they get home. Jared tells them calmly ""I am punishing you, not your child. You guys made no effort to control him, and even brushed me off after the first incident. You guys will clean up every mess he has made, and then you can leave. You are no longer welcomed here."" They start yelling profanities at him and their kid, saying how this is ridiculous and they shouldn't have to put up with this. 

After they cleaned up, they left empty handed. Jared received many compliments on how he handled the situation.

racheecakes,8,,48,1rhjav,,206,"This sub is usually full of complaints and although I have quite a few I have a short, nice story to tell. I work in the dining room at one of the lovely bakery/cafe chains in America. We are very lax on people lingering in our cafe, especially the homeless. We allow them to stay in our building in the single comfortable chairs for as long as they want as long as they're not pestering our customers. (It's not like we're hobo central, there are only two or three regulars). Usually our lunch rushes are filled with self centered people or angry people who just spent a dick load of money on presents for people they really didn't want to spend money on (we're located in a mall parking lot). In the midst of the chaos, bread bowls, and dirty tables I notice a customer approaching an obvious homeless man. This catches my eye so I go over and start cleaning a nearby table and eavesdrop. The customer hands the homeless man a gift card to our cafe for fifty dollars. He told him to stay full during this holiday season, to have a good one, and clenched his shoulder in a very comforting, almost fatherly like way. He walked away and back to his table before the homeless man got to say a word. The look on the homeless man's face was something worth remembering. It was nice to see someone think of someone they did not even know. Although it didn't happen to me, I witnessed it happen, and it's something I will be passing forward.",A little holiday cheer early this year.,254,talesFromRetail

aturquoiseseashell,12,,25,1rg9do,,127,"End of shift at a famous, upscale department store, and I am already clocked out, with my purse on. I'm talking to my coworkers before I leave because I'm waiting on a ride home. I work in the lingerie department, which is near one of the 2nd story entrance doors to the store. 

A flustered woman comes up with three bags, one from Kate Spade, one from Michael Kors, and one from Tory Burch. She says she found the bags in the vestibule of the entrance to the store.
We thank her for her honesty and promise to call Loss Prevention to come and take the bags. She becomes agitated.

""Well I'm going to wait here and see that you do it,"" she snaps. She's suddenly riled up.

We're a bit taken aback, but continue to be polite to her and my coworker calls LP.

While my coworker waits on the phone to be connected to the security desk, I guess we kind of exchanged looks. (She was very antsy, and was holding onto the bags for dear life). The woman exclaims in outrage, ""Don't you all roll your eyes at me!"" 

""Ma'am,"" says my co-worker, ""No one is rolling their eyes. We're waiting for security to pick up the phone. They will make sure the bags are returned to the customer. Thank you very much for bringing them to our attention, we will see to it that they are returned to the customer."" 

The woman becomes more agitated and irritated. Finally, security picks up and my coworker says, ""A customer found some bags; one's from MK, one is from Tory Burch…""
The woman snaps, before my coworker is quite finished, ""And one from Kate Spade!!"" as though we purposely left that one out so we could steal it or something. 

""And one from Kate Spade,"" my co-worker adds. We're all getting kind of insulted by this woman's attitude. She seems convinced we're plotting to steal the bags, despite the fact that they remain in plain sight of the security camera. We're all well-dressed, well-spoken girls in our early twenties, and we are acting calm and polite. No apparent cause for suspicion.

Security says they can't help and to turn the bags into customer service, who coworker speaks to.
""Ma'am, please give me the bags. Customer service is coming to pick them up,"" my coworker says. We really want her to leave at this point. She's staring at us through narrowed eyes and she's breathing heavily.

""No!"" the woman shrieks, and clutches them to her chest. She tears frantically at one of them and finds a receipt. She begins dialing the number of Kate Spade. We're stunned.
""Please, ma'am…"" the coworker begins, but the woman literally shushes her and begins frantically reading the details of the receipt to the cashier at Kate Spade who is on the other end of the phone. 

She convinces an employee at Kate Spade to come to the dept. store to identify the bags.
Meanwhile, she announces that she will take the bags to customer service herself, in a very angry tone. ""You all are acting VERY suspicious!"" she declares, still clutching the bags to her breast almost maniacally. 

At this point, we're pretty alarmed by her behavior and beginning to wonder if she plans to steal the bags herself after seeing the prices on the receipt. My coworker calls the store manager, and we inform the customer that we would prefer that she remain in lingerie with the bags and wait for the manager. She loudly refuses to stay put. My coworker follows her to customer service.

From all the way in our department on the other end of the floor, we can hear the woman yelling. She had a quavery voice and a really strong British accent. 
Apparently, she got to customer service, and the couple who had left the bags was there. The woman refused to give them the bags without proof of their identity!! Finally the Kate Spade employee arrived and confirmed that yes, the bags belonged to the couple. 

I guess the woman was trying to do the right thing, but she insulted my coworkers and me and frightened various customers in the process. I still don't get why she became so suspicious or why she didn't just bring the bags to customer service in the first place. Of course, since we were lowly retail workers we must have been plotting to steal the lost merchandise.

KroipyBill,11,,40,1rhynu,,123,"After [writing about our cheering seasonal workers from Black Friday yesterday,](http://redd.it/1rf92j) it reminded me of this other story involving my goofy manager. 

When I first started working for this place, I came in clean shaven, and patchy hair. I was in denial that mother nature was closing my hair follicles for business, and it wasn't until after my engagement photos I decided to make a change. I shaved my head and have kept it that way ever since. I then grew a goatee to compensate for my loss. Honestly I looked much sharper than having the grassy field of hair you can see the horizon through. It was a relief to embrace it, and feel like I looked decent again. There was one manager who enjoyed messing with me however. In fact in my previous stories, I've quoted him several times in our conversations, since he was my favorite manager to talk to, and the biggest goof ball there. He vowed he would draw on my head when I wasn't ready for it. 

**Me:** Dude I'm taller than you. So unless you parachute from the rafters onto my cranium with your sharpie, you will not succeed. 

**Manager:** We'll see...we'll...see...

At that moment I wondered if he really was contemplating that attack strategy. At least he left it at just contemplating. 

One day, we were pretty busy. It was pre-holiday, post-black Friday days. I'm sure you all know the type. Everybody is getting geared up for Christmas. I found my way over to the computer department helping a customer decide what Mac they wanted. I was describing the hardware specs, how it works with their Apple products etc. During this I felt I was going to make a decent sale. However I made a massive mistake...

*I sat down.* 

Yes I slipped up big time. My manager saw this opportunity from what it seemed immediately. He walked over and distracted me by having another employee ask me a question. 

**Employee:** Hey KroipyBill you know where I can find [some bullcrap item that he knew the answer to.]

**Me:** Yeah sure. Remember they're eh...ahh...AHH!!!

Right then, my manager walks up to me with his pen, and I felt the coldness of the ballpoint touch my head, while it was dragged across my chrome dome. My entire body froze as if somebody stiffed my spine. I made a weird breathing noise, like I was experiencing sharp pains when it was just mainly a very tiny cold piece of metal on my head. Kind of like EAHH!! EAHH!! EAHH!!! (That's the best I can do textually.) They were quiet, sharp noises.

He walked off, cackling like the joker. I looked at my customer with this super surprised look on my face. He lost his crap, and just laughed. Because of this I sold him more attachments, but that's beside the point. 

Over the radio:

**Me:** The person who drew on my head. You know who you are. Thanks for helping my sale out by doodling with a ballpoint pen on my cranium. 

I looked around the store and saw those with a radio express such confusion. I'm a pretty tall dude, so for those who were in eye sight, I bent my head down so they could see the graffiti my manager brought forth upon my person. Much laughter followed, including my manager.

**Manager:** You said I would never get you. 

**Me:** Well bucket head, you're lucky I was sitting so your midget self could strike me. 

**Manager:** My strike is now complete. 

**Me:** It's a good thing I don't just go over there and rub my greasy head all over your face. I'm glad you feel all militaristic about your approach. 

**Manager:** Oh...this would be a much more fun Call of Duty game if this were part of the game play. 

I never got him back. And he has since left the store after I left. Despite us still being good friends, he's still a bucket head.

It was a beautiful sunny day, which is not common in these parts from oh...October to May.    
    
A very proper looking lady walks up and asks for a salesmen that is off.  Lets call her Uber bitch (UB).  
    
Me, ""He's off today, is there something I can help you with?"" 
       
UB, ""I'm not sure your capable, 'L' was very knowledgeable.""  
       
Her tone was very matter of fact and frankly bitchy.     
     
Me, ""Lets do it this way, I'll help you to the best of my ability and if you're not satisfied you can come back and see 'L' when he gets back.""     
    
UB sighed and said, ""I suppose that will do. Tell me about your most advanced car.""     
    
Me, ""Advanced how?""     
   
UB, ""Technologically.""    
    
Me, ""That's a pretty broad spectrum, lets start with what kind of car do you want?  Like an SUV or Sedan.""      
       
UB, ""I don't see why this matters.""     
    
Me, ""I'm just trying to help you to the best of my ability.""    
    
UB, ""Well that clearly lacking.""      
    
Me, ""Apparently. I have an idea though lets go look at the new Avalon, they just had a fresh rebuild this year so I would say the have the most gadgets and cool technology in them.""     
    
UB, ""That's a start show me the way.""      
    
At this point I realized that I'm dealing with some sort of royalty by the way she's talking to me and looking at me like I was clearly beneath her.    
    
We walked out side and toward the Avalon's and as we rounded the corner I was blinded by the light of 1 sun (that mutha fucker is bright when we only see it a few times a year) so I do what I thought was natural, I put on my sun glasses. You'd think I killed her 2nd born spawn.    
        
UB stopped in her tracks and said, ""Excuse me, how long have you been in sales.""     
    
Me, ""About 15 years now, why do you ask?""    
    
UB, ""How dare you put your sunglasses on in front of a customer. You should know better.""    
    
At this point I'm done with her attitude. She can; buy a car, sell a car, die in fire for all that I'm concerned.    
    
Me, ""While were walking into the direct sunlight I'm keeping them on, once we get into a car I'll make sure to take them off so you can see my pretty greens again.""     
     
The look and sound of disgust from her should of withered some near by plants.     
    
UB, "" I don't want to look at the Avalon unless it has what I want on it.""      
        
I acted all surprised and said, ""Ahhh in that case thus far all you've told me is that you want technology on it. Every car on my lot has technology, how about you fill in the blanks for me and I'll get you what you need.""   I finished that last part with a touch of sarcasm.
    
UB, "" You don't have to take that tone with me.""     
    
I just started at her until she finally answered my question.    
   
UB, ""I want....""  Imagine everything every car in every scfi movie has done (some highlights: Voice activated everything, self driving, self maintaining, color changing, all electric or non-gas, The list goes on)

Me, ""What's your thoughts on a Prius that parks for you, stops for you in emergencies and has rain sensing wipers?""    
    
UB let here vileness spew out of her and she said, ""That's all been out for years I don't want dated technology.""

Maloth_Warblade,6,,17,1rhx0y,,94,"Black Friday, 2011. Big, blue, zombie-filled box store. I was a photo tech.

It's been almost 2 years now, as I no longer work for retail. I did my 5 years with it and I'm done.

I'm glad I'm out, too. I don't hate people, I just learned that I hate being treated like less than crap, filth, and told I'm worthless on a daily basis. But this one was so irritating I spoke up.

I worked 2 stores on Black Friday in 2011, both the BBS and the famous game store. I was basically at work from Noon-8 on Thanksgiving at the BBS, missing all family gatherings, by the way, and then 11:30pm-7am at the games store (I was the only cashier by the way, in the most populated area of the county/city), and then 12-8 again on Black Friday at the BBS. 

I was tired, beyond tired, essentially 20hrs of work, on my feet with no breaks for food or bathroom due to chaos. The BBS frequently refused to give me my lunches until I was mandatorily locked out, and even then they simply made me work anyway (even got reported for going over 8 hrs without a break, wasn't given a choice).

 Needless to say, by the time 5pm rolled around, and not having eaten but a pop tart in 24hrs, I was having a sugar crash. These make you lightheaded, these make it hard to think and respond quickly. I was working my ass off to get greeting cards printed, packaged, priced and all the while walking everyone through how to use our touch-screen computers and simple tasks. 

One customer didn't like that I wasn't answering fast enough. Of course she didn't, it's Black Friday, and that I was being far too rude for her. She told me she didn't like how tired I was, that I shouldn't work at all if I was so tired. How worthless I was to be there, on the busiest day of the year, if I couldn't be bothered to be awake. 

At this point I interrupted her. I told her ""Lady, listen. I don't need this from you, not today. Not the day people die from customers entitlement. No. I've been working since pretty much Noon yesterday. I had to miss my family's Thanksgiving, again, and not only that, I couldn't even EAT any food yet. There's no time. I'm beyond having a sugar crash, I'm hungry, and beyond normal tired. If you're going to sit there and belittle me over this, you can just get out of my face and leave this place"" (or something VERY close to this, been a few years).

Of course I got loud to say this, and everyone looked at her. Associates, customers, even her husband. She tried apologizing, I kept interrupting her asking what else she needed, and she kept trying to change subjects..I wouldn't let her. She was the last straw I needed that day, and I wasn't having it.

Good news though, wasn't reported, wasn't written up. Had a very nice and thoughtful customer buy me a bag of chips and a soda after seeing me be berated by not only her but other customers. Made it home and promptly slept for 15 hours.

adelajoy,15,,15,1rg29x,,73,"I spent two years working at a big warehouse-style grocery store. I worked mostly as a cashier, but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a week.

Most of the crappy moments have all blurred together, but there are a few particular moments that stick out.

This grocery store is the only one in the area that doesn't bag your groceries for you. Each till has two long conveyor belts to hold your groceries while you bag them (Both the customer and the cashier have buttons to move the groceries down, away from the till). This speeds orders up, requires less staff, saves money and drops prices. People occasionally complain about it, but if they want to pay more for their groceries and have someone else bag them, they're welcome to. ... The store isn't exactly famous for customer service, but I think the prices make up for this.

I was one of the fastest cashiers on staff at the time. This meant that my belts would often get full. I had ways to deal with this. I knew how fast people packed, I knew how soon a belt would clear. I was really good at my job. One day, the lines were insanely long, I was working really fast, everyone was buying a lot. I got to a point that there were groceries on both of my belts, so I squeezed the smaller order down a little, watched for a moment, and knew that he would be down before the next order crowded him. I started scanning the next order, and smiled at the customers - a man and his very pregnant wife.

The wife snapped at me, ""Can you just wait!""

""Excuse me?""

""Can you wait? I don't want you to crowd out that other guy!""

I looked, and he was literally loading his last bag with groceries. I stopped scanning anyways, and maybe glared at the lady. I don't really like it when other people tell me how to do my job.

Eventually he was packed and gone, so I started scanning again. While I had been waiting, I had lined all of their canned goods up. I can scan cans super fast if they're all really close. I started scanning the canned goods, grabbing a can, tossing it to my other hand, and setting it on the other belt. Except that this woman had walked around (The belt she got was behind me) and was standing behind me, trying to bag the cans as I scanned them. I'm sorry, but I'm not actually looking where the cans go. I know the space, and I need to watch the computer screen, not my hands. Well, she kept trying to grab the one I'd just set down, which meant that I kept hitting her hand with the next can. I wasn't by any means throwing the cans, but I was moving quickly and she was in my space, so she was getting hit. I didn't actually realize that I was hitting her until she complained to her husband. So I slowed down, apologized, and moved on to her other groceries.

She then had a bag of apples. She had grabbed one of our bags and put three different apples in it, and tied it shut. I have to weigh each type of fruit separately, so I opened the bag, weighed the first apple, set it aside. I noticed her husband grabbed the apple right away. I weighed the second apple, and set it aside. He grabbed that one too. When I weighed the third, my plan had been to put all three back in the bag and tie it shut, but the other two apples were gone. I tied the bag around the last one and set it on the belt. If the husband wanted to pack the apples separately, he was welcome to.

The couple also bought about half a dozen little bags of frozen perogies. One of the bags had been ripped all the open, right down the middle, and frozen perogies were laying all over the belt. I considered not telling them, because I was mad, but I took a deep breath, rounded up all of the stray perogies, put them in a plastic bag, and informed the lady. I asked her if she would like me to send for a new bag. She snippily replied ""Yes"" as if I should have just known. Some people don't bother to get a new bag because it can hold up the line, so I always ask. Our runner quickly returned with an identical bag and I kept going.

When I finally finished (They bought *a lot* of stuff), the husband paid, while the wife stormed over to customer service. I watched as she talked to my supervisor, and eventually a store manager. I was getting pretty nervous. Oh, also I should mention this woman was rude and snapped every time I asked her a question. I was pretty angry by the time they left.

After they were completely done, my supervisor closed my till and asked to speak to me at customer service.

She said the lady had filed a formal complaint against me. Apparently the conversation went something like this:

**Pregnant Lady**: ""I want to complain about the cashier on till 9!""

**Nice Supervisor**: ""Till 9? Do you mean till 8?"" (I was on 9 - one of my quick-to-anger coworkers was on 8)

**PL**: ""No, I mean 9!""

**NS**: ""Like the girl with brown hair, *not* the blonde?""

**PL**: (getting frustrated) ""Yes!""

**NS**: ""So what did adelajoy do?""

**PL**: ""She was rude and short with me!""

**NS**: ""Adelajoy? Are you sure?""

**PL**: ""Yes! She also threw canned goods at me, *ripped* open a bag of perogies, scattered them *everywhere* and scattered all of my apples too! She also bruised all of my fruit because she was throwing them around!""

A store manager was brought down to take a formal complaint, which means it probably went in my employee file. The lady was calmed down and left, and that was the end of it. Typically, the store managers will meet with you to discuss complaints, and make sure they won't happen again. The fact that I didn't means either the manager simply didn't believe the woman, or wasn't concerned because it was my first (and only). The supervisor who helped her said she closed my till because I looked upset and she thought I needed a break. The only reason she told me was to find out what really happened. I told her my side, and she just laughed it off. I admitted to being short and snippy, but the rest was just ludicrous. I still cannot beleive she blamed me for the bag of perogies being ripped open, considering I told her about them, got a new bag, and spent a minute or two picking up all of the perogies. Also, why would I take the time to do that, when I was clearly rushed with everything else?

I get that pregnant women have a lot of hormones, and tend to be angry, short-tempered, whatnot, but I think there's a line. Also, the fact that her husband didn't stop her, stand up for me, or admit to grabbing all the apples kind of pissed me off.

unidentifiableblarg,12,,9,1rhfwt,,65,"**Back story:** I worked in a small convenience store in a town on the outskirts of a city. A lot of the customer's are regulars and have been coming here for years, decades even.

About 6 years ago the place changed hands, names and management too. Still provided the same sort of stuff though, so the locals kept calling it by it's old name. 

This is relevant, I swear.



**The story:** I'm serving on the registers at the front of the store, just doin ma biz, when a flustered woman comes up to the counter demanding my attention. I tell her I'll be with her as soon as I finish processing my currant customer.

This somehow seemed to offended her, so I was already off to a bad start. But I get to her and try to smooth things over with my best customer service voice (you know the one).

After a bit of just listening to her complaining and bitching in general she finally gets to the point.

""I bought this product here earlier and you (not me) charged me the wrong price! It's on special, why is it wrong blah blah blah""

The outrage was dripping off her.

Now, normally I'd be prepared to fix this, sometimes we just straight up get it wrong and stuff isn't the right price.

*But*, while she's ranting she's waving around a catalogue, that contains the magical special that we failed to give her.

Eventually she shoves it in my face to accent a point, and shows me what it should have been.

The catalogue wasn't for our store, we don't even sell the brand (ice cream, I think it was) that she seemed to have thought she purchased.

I politely explain that we're not an [old store] any more and that was why she didn't get the discount. But I'd be happy t...

Her: What?! I've lived her FOR YEARS and it's always been [old store]. You've got to be kidding me.

I point out the signs (they're everywhere) and shirts of the employees and explain that we've been [new store] for quite a while.

She persists though, demanding to get her discount because it's ""always been that way and why should I get screwed for what you did..."" just generally giving me a hard time; that kind of bullshit.

The managers will usually give the discount to them anyway, just to keep them happy, but I was sick of getting abused by people who apparently can't read and wasn't about to let this one fly. Pety, I know.

Eventually I get to the point where I'm just repeating myself and she's adamantly refusing to be 'robbed' of forty cents. So I call my manager to come up.

By this stage I'm sick of her shit and just want her to leave, customers are waiting to be served and I'm meant to be serving. Small store, small number of staff.

Finally my duty manager meanders up and he immediately grovels at her feet, begging her forgiveness and taking her to a spare register to sort out her problem. 


I'm not bitter (lies), but the smug grin she threw me on her way out made me really wish that our management stood up for us, at least sometimes.

And that I had a crowbar handy.

CommandoDerp,9,,17,1rhsfa,,62,"First off, I would like to say that I had two days off before this incident so I was unaware of any changes at work.

So I was at work after two days off when I was serving an elderly man, who was a regular, cigarettes. He asked for a particular brand in a carton of twin packs. I tell him unfortunately that the twin packs are classified as cartons themselves, and you cannot purchase a carton of a carton. He rolled his eyes and asked for 4 individual twin packs.

I immediately check the cupboard nearby of said twin packs of cigarettes that he wanted and I inform him that we are all sold out. This is the conversation that follows:

Him: ""Are you serious?""
Me: ""Yes, sorry. We are unfortunately all sold out until we get some more.""
Him: ""This is pathetic!""
Me: ""Would you like another flavor?""
He mumbles something to me which I repeat my previous question.
Me: ""Would you like another flavor?""
Him: ""No. This unacceptable. You are refusing sale""
Me: ""Is there anything else I can help you with as we don't seem to have what you are after?""
Him: ""I would like to speak to your manager.""
Me: ""Actually there might be some here""

I had a thought and I turned around and checked the display rack to see if there are any more in the display. To which I found 4 individual twin packs sitting there, I felt like an idiot not checking there first.

Me: ""I didn't realize that there was any in the display, I...""
Him: ""Your very lucky""

Him: ""Your very lucky you found them or otherwise you would have lost hundreds and hundreds of dollars in sales and quite a few hundred customers because of your poor service.""

Drunken_Black_Belt,7,,8,1rhw8z,,59,"I'm back bitches!  About 2 months ago, I got a second job working part time at a men's Big &amp;Tall store.  The hours are easy, commision is alright, and to be honest, the customers are generally friendly and awesome.  It helps that a lot of them don't have anywhere else to shop. Unfortunantly the store isn't as eventul as my past retail jobs.  Its just selling clothes and shoes.  But I've gotten a few funny stories that I'll share over time here. And with the holiday's coming up, i'm sure I'll have plenty more.  

Welll, for your pleasure (hopefully), I present **Boy, Are My Feet Sore!**

**WARNING: GROSS!**

So recently I began working in a men's store for Big &amp; Tall sizes.  I knew of it because I buy my shoes there.  Only store that carries a size 15/16.  I am too small for the clothes, despite being 6'4 and slightly overweight.  And if I'm being honest,  seeing some of the people who come in makes me more motivated to keep losing weight (50 lbs this year alone).  

Now, don't get me wrong, SOME of the people have legitimate health concerns.  One gentleman was born with his left foot backwards.  During his childhood they would constantly have to break his foot, set it slightly closer to the proper position, let it heal, and repeat. But it never set 100% correct, keeping him from being able to run or exercise, or even stand for long periods of time.  It's guys like him I feel for.  Given a shitty deal in life and just having to suffer for it. 

Most customers, however, are just plain old fat guys.  I don't want to sound mean, or ""fat shame"".  But it's just poor lifestyle choices and such.  I was there.  I was 5lbs shy of 300 last new years.  And it was just being lazy and making bad choices.  I don't have as much sympathy for these guys.  And that brings us to our story today.

It's a sunny fall day.  It's midweek, and pretty dead.  I'm in my suit, fixing clothes, putzing around, pretty much just pretending to work.  I hear the door chime, and in walks an older couple.  Probably late 60's, very early 70's.  The lady was using a walker to move around, and the gentleman was resting his weight on a cane as he slowly moved with her.  They seemed like a nice enough couple, but as you know, those are the ones who always turn into assholes.

I introduced myself, asked how I could help them that day.  The man gruffly replied ""shoes"".  I brought them to the shoe department.  Now my store is small, and there is only one small bench to sit on, and it's in the shoe department.  Naturally, this oaf takes the seat, leaving his frail wife to stand.  I could tell she was having difficulty, being particularly petire and frail, so I went in the back and got her a folding chair to sit in next to her husband.  She thanked me, because manners.  The man, charming fellow that he was, just said ""can you get me some shoes now?"".  

It was about this time that I realized this was going to go south faster than a my ex g/f in a dick sucking contest.

I offered several suggestions, as the gentleman didn't seem to know what kind of shoes he wanted.  The man complained that most of our shoes don't even fit him. I expressed sympathy, as I have large feet and can only fit into the largest size available in store.  The man looked me up and down and sneered ""Well, you just have big feet. I have a health condition that causes this, so consider yourself lucky"".  

Eventually we found a pair he liked and thought may just fit his feet.  And that's when the real horror of this story starts.  The man then proceeds to roll up his sweatpants.  He was wearing ankle socks and sandals.  His feet are hugely swollen, and covered in open sores.  This guy has diabetes, and it's eating away at his foot.  Sadly it's fairly common where I work.  What came next, however, is not.

I hand him the shoes, and take a step back, giving him some space to put the shoes on, look at them in the mirror, see how they feel, etc.  

NOPE!  

He looks at me like an idiot and says ""Well I can't put them on myself.  I can't bend that far.  Put them on for me"".   

Now I am no fan of feet, even on a good day.  Sure if I'm dating someone, and they want a footrub, and their feet are clean, then i'll oblige.  But other than that, I just want nothing to do with that area of the body.  Add to the fact that we are talking about a stranger whose foot is literally covered in open, oozing sores.  

DBB: Sir I just can't do that, I'm sorry.

Man:  You need to help me.  I'm a customer and I need service.

DBB: There is no way I am doing that sir.  I am sorry but you have open sores on your foot and leg. It's unsanitary for both me and YOU, to have me do that.

Man: Oh just wash your hands after it'll be fine.

How this man survived 70 or so years with logic like that, will forever amaze me.  

DBB: Absolutely not.  

Man: I want the manger!  I'll have your ass for discrimination and harrassment

DBB:  I am the manager.  If you want the store manager call back tomorrow.  If you want corporate's phone number I'll give it with my name gladly.  


The man continued to yell and scream about receiving the shoes at a discount and having me fired.  Typical stuff for anyone who works in retail really.  I essentially told him that I wasn't going to touch his feet, and if he didn't like the service he could leave. Wife is trying to keep the peace.  It's not very effective.  Husband used Rage!  It's inneffective against DBB!  Besides my DEF is to high.  

Anyways, i wish there was some more to this.  Eventually he stormed out as dramatically as one can when you can barely walk under your own weight, and your wife is frail and moves about as fast a christian school girl with a chastity belt.  I did hear from corporate the next day though.  Naturally some of the details were changed when he called in, but once I explained about the sores, I receieve a ""Yea that happens all the time. Don't worry about it"".  

Sorry if it's not very exciting.  I'm sure I'll have some good ones coming up.  Hope you all are surviving the holidays!

Turns out, the woman was making a sizeable purchase and couldn't supply an adequate form of ID. I explained to her that we simply couldn't process her credit card without proper identification. She dug through her purse and tossed a bottle of birth control pills on the counter and was like ""Will this bottle work?

She then threw a world class tantrum using colorful language that would even make a seasoned sailor blush.

kyatel,6,,8,1riaxl,,46,"*sorry for any typos or errors. Typing this on my phone on lunch break*

I was working in the jewelry department of a department/grocery store at the time. I'd been in that same department for 2 years by the time this incident took place. It was very early on a Saturday, before the rush, and a lady comes up to my counter to do a return. No problemo, I thought.

Me: I can do that return for you. Can I see your receipt ma'am?

Customer: I don't have it anymore. 

Me: I'll only be able to refund it to a gift card then, is that ok?

Customer: yeah, that's fine. 

One hurdle jumped. She hands me the item and I notice that it is in a package I have never seen before. I know my department like the back of my hand cause I'm the one that checks in -all- of the merchandise. Every item that has gone into the department in the last two years had to pass by me first. 

Me: ma'am are you sure you bought this here? I don't recognize this package. 

Customer, suddenly angry: of course I bought it here. (Spoiler, this a lie)

Me: ok, let me see if the system recognizes it. 

I scan the item at the register and I get an error. I look at the barcode and it's half as long as it needs to be (6 characters instead of 12, which is the store norm). 

Me: ma'am my register does not recognize this item. 

Customer: I bought it here!

Me, getting cranky at this point: are you -sure-? I've been in the department for two years and I've never seen this package before. Are you certain you didn't buy this at [dept store x] or [dept store y]?

Customer: I'm certain. I'm returning this for a friend and she bought it here! (Told ya)

Me: I'm sorry but I can't take an Item that doesn't even come up in the system. Especially if you don't have a receipt. 

Customer snatches the item from me and pulls her cell phone out: I am going to call her (the friend) and prove to you that it was bought here!! (She's nearly screaming at this point)

The customer walks away and makes her call. I watch her patiently from the counter and wait for her to return. She finally gets her friend on the line but is far enough away that I can't hear her. She's visibly pissed off and ranting to her friend. There's a short pause as she listens to her friend. Her demeanor changes completely. She looks at me once, turns, and walks out the door, presumably to return the item at the place it was bought from. ",Just discovered this sub today.

ScaldingSoup,5,,6,1rha57,,26,"So several  years ago I worked for a very popular lingerie store.  This store didn't pay commission, but would give us more or less hours per week based on sales performance.  My sales performance was VERY good.  I got more hours a week than most people.  

During the holiday season, we had a lot of seasonal employees, as any big retail store normally does.  One of the workers hired seasonally was this lady who was a lot older than the rest of us.  This was not the problem.  Her hair was bleached blonde, and growing out (showing obvious roots), and styled in a ""feathered"" fashion.  She did not know how to wear make-up and what she wore did not flatter her.  In this store our dress code was all black.   She wore skirts with no stockings, but with slouch socks and yeah, that was a hot mess.  

People began to call her the ""missing link"", as in to the 1980s because of the hair and her wearing slouch socks that were probably black in the 1980s but grey now.  Reading this, you may think that I judged her based on this, or have some animosity for people older than me.  I do not, but this just sort of describes what she looked like because it is important.  Black Friday rolls around, and she wears her normal dress of skirt, slouch socks and what-not.  Surrounding her socks are these bells that jingle..  

She begins waving panties in the air, helicopter style, like a stripper, chanting what the sale is as customers are passing by.  One of our gay male managers passes me by and mutters so only I can hear it ""I want her out"".  I was dying trying not to laugh at the situation, and meanwhile feeling very embarrassed for her.  Everywhere she walked, she jingled.

Some time during her short career with the lingerie store, she found my phone number on the schedule.  I guess they weren't giving her enough hours, because she had the nerve to leave me a message asking me for some of mine.

BlankName55,14,,6,1rgvl7,,23,"**Background**: I work for the spark store at a mega sized location. It's a regular location with a grocery store on one side and a nursery, essentially, on the other. I work in the party/craft/office section, although I've done everything and anything, from service desk to the truck to the phones (no, I believe you want the health clinic down the street, ma'am).

**Story (er, stories)**: 

1) I walk by the front door. Man approached with wife, stopped and said Excuse Me? Fine. I go over, and he started counting out a huge wad of cash. He counts $100 in small bills out, gives it to me, then says, ""Now, I want a propane tank, honey..."" 

He got the manager who resembles an NFL player instead. (Yes, I gave him the money back.)

2) Two young guys came through the checkout line with four carts of Head &amp; Shoulders, Dove bars, and some razors, I forgot the brand. This is ***-mart, it's cheap, and that's what matters. Three products. They racked up $1800 in this stuff. The one guy then pulled out of his pocket a pile of coupons that was quite literally a foot high. Mind already blown, I said half-jokingly, ""Those aren't all for me, are they?""

Yes. Yes they were. $1500 in coupons, $3 at a time. Do the math. And you couldn't do coupon repeats. Due to the volume, the *CSM thing came up halfway through, and I said ""Oh, the supervisor's going to have to turn the key..."" and they were all ""Ok, cool.""

So they hand over the remaining $300 cash (and people pay 500-600 all the time-that was normal) and the supervisor sees the key message on the palm pilot. I had every CSM (three on duty), the front end supervisor, two assistant managers, and every loss prevention person in the building (three-two associates &amp; the manager) at the register in what seemed like two seconds. 

The guy who'd had the coupons recognized the front end supervisor. He (coupon guy) went off and started going into it with the supervisor. The friend stands there numb, all the managers start talking at me, a CSM sticks the key in to abort this transaction, and I'm standing here holding $300 cash and a hell's lot of coupons. 

Then:
The customer let out a primal yell, the supervisor took the coupons from me, stuck them in the guy's hand, and wished him a good day-anywhere else. 

Turns out they were known scammers. The coupons would scan, but we can't get money back for them. I knew something was up, but I didn't know the back story. I just was asking myself over and over after this: If it had all gone through, and they'd walked out with $1800 of soap and shampoo, what the hell were they going to do with it all? Sell it at less than cost? Fill a swimming pool? Get ridiculously clean?

Well, because the star of this story is my son but, after reading all the posts about awful parents/kids, I wanted to share a funny story about a good kid and parents who are trying their best.

This story happened when my son was 4.  It takes place in the store where I work.  I wasn't there at the time.  My son, I'll call him Cee, was browsing the toy department with his dad while they were waiting for me to finish my shift.  

While Cee and his dad are looking at the toys, a woman with two children comes into the aisle they are in.  The older of the two, who is about the same age as Cee, sees something she wants and asks her mom for it.  Mom says no.  The little girl begs and pleads but mom holds firm and keeps telling her no.  Then the girl pulls out all the stops and throws herself on the floor, kicking and screaming, in a full blown tantrum.

Cee watches for a few seconds and then walks over to the girl.  He kneels in front of her and says:  ""Well, if you act like that, you really won't get anything.""  And then he walked back to his dad.  

Cee's dad was trying hard not to laugh but the woman didn't find it so funny.  She looked embarrassed and angry.  She grabbed her kids and stormed off.

copisreallybad,4,,6,1rhulb,,22,"a few days ago, i get called down to the returns desk from the paint desk. the return policy for the chain i work at is very lenient, but we aren't supposed to take mixed paint back, so already walking down there i had a bad feeling that i would have to get a manager involved (and we all know how incompetent they can be)

so i get there, and to my surprise it's just a regular can of unmixed, white, exterior paint, which *is* returnable without manager involvement. i ask the guy what's wrong with the paint and he says that it's frozen and we need to fix it or give him another can.

i bring the can to the paint desk and open it up. now, imagine what half frozen, hardened paint looks like. that's what this paint looked like, and the following conversation sort of went like this.

me: ""this paint is frozen, did you leave it in the garage or something?""

customer (now visibly irate): ""ABSOLUTELY NOT I BOUGHT IT AND I JUST OPENED IT THIS MORNING AND TO MY SURPRISE IT LOOKS LIKE THIS""

me: ""I'm sorry but we really aren't supposed to take paint like this back, it's useless to us returned""

customer (literally about to pop a blood vessel in his brain at this point): ""WELL MAYBE IF YOU GUYS HAD FUCKING SOLD ME A GOOD CAN OF PAINT IT WOULDNT BE FUCKING FROZEN. I WANT A MANAGER, NOW""

great, this guy knows how to get what he wants. i call a manager and explain the situation to him. the manager, being a typical manager, offers him a plethora of free things, including brushes and a brand new can of paint. the customer walks away with his free things (that i have to get for him) with the smuggiest ass look on his face.

story over, right? nope. i bring the can of paint to receiving, ZMA and hazmat it (since we can't sell it, it's fucking frozen and you can't paint with it). done deal im thinking, right?

not even close, bby. picture a hambeast of a woman. ok, maybe not that big, but she had a hard time fitting inside the reach truck sometimes. she is the department head of receiving. basically she sits in receiving on her computer waiting for trucks to arrive. 

now picture her carrying the frozen can of paint to the desk, except i actually had to see it happen. 

okay, okay, what the fuck is going on, im thinking. maybe i didnt mark it down correctly or something, maybe she'll show me how to hazmat it, i have no idea. im also in the middle of explaining to an older woman the different paint finishes we sell. 

nope, she has the nerve to tell me to just ""stick it in the paint shaker for a minute or two and see if we can try and sell it as OOPS paint."" at this point im all whatthefuck.jpeg, the paint is fucking frozen and shaking it won't help. i try to explain this to her but she would have none of it and walks away, and me, being the lowly, minimum wage paint associate that i am, do as she says. i stick it on the OOPS rack and continue my day.

the story ends when the department head of paint sees it on the OOPS rack, laughs, and takes it to receiving himself to hazmat it.

One of the things he'd do would come up to me and say something along the lines of
""Hey Champ, can you cut me a piece of this ""insert fruit here"" , ive heard this batch is extra juicy"" and then once hed taste it hed spit it out and say 
""Yuck thats disgusting, im glad i wasnt going to buy it"" and just storm off. He did this to me quite a few times and hed throw the skin or peel of it onto my displays and I was quite pissed off with all of it. 

He came in and and I recognised him. And the convorsation went as follows. 

Him: Hey Champ, do you mind if I try one of these Mandarins, they seem mighty delicious. 

Me: No you cant

Him: Why the hell not?

Me: Because its shoplifting, you have no intention of buying it, youve done this before you ask if you can try some and say its disgusting then walk off and all youre going to do is peel it, take one bite leave the the rest of the fruit and peel on my display and im not paid to clean up after you and its not a buffet either, what youre doing is taking stuff you havnt paid for, so its actually theft. So no you cant!

He stood there for about 6 seconds trying to think of something to say and all he could muster up was yelling:

The only thing we have to deal with really is the law which is one of the more annoying things. People who steal metal makes it tough for the honest guys who recycle.

I get several customers who come in every day or several times a week (we're open 6 days a week, 9 to 5). 80% of these customers are never ready. We require valid ID for every transaction and though I remember a good amount of people's names, some I don't. Those that know I ask for ID every time never had it ready. While they're standing in line why wouldn't they pull it out of their wallets instead of when they are at the front of the line? Or sign the receipt which is also required by law. I have to ask them EVERY SINGLE TIME. It's very frustrating. I go through the same thing every day and they never learn. I also get several customers who don't even speak English which is also frustrating. How can I ask you for things that are required by law when you don't speak my language? Most of them when I ask for ID just nod their heads. What are you nodding too? I asked for something, I didn't ask you to agree with me...

BefuddledBison,2,,3,1ric04,,24,"Howdy TFR. Turns out /u/BaffledBuffalo is taken on Gmail and Xbox Live so I changed my username to match my other accounts. At least my one post with it was sort of a one-hit wonder. 

Anyway, this next story was also from Barschmucks. If I didn't mention before, this was a franchise location inside of a large supermarket. We were technically employees of the supermarket even though we were real certified baristas. But this meant that many of our coworkers were cashiers and stock guys. One of the stock guys was Otis. He was a huuuuuge black dude who didn't converse much when he came by for his free cup of ice water but seemed like a pretty good guy.

I wasn't working when this happened, but my AST (Evan) told me about it. It's dead and he's just cleaning up waiting for the last few stragglers to wander in when Otis cruises up to the counter. Evan asks him what he'd like but Otis doesn't say anything and just stares at the menu. Evan goes back to cleaning while Otis contemplates the meaning of life. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Otis opening up the tea rack and fumbling for a tea bag (already this is a no-no, not only are we the only ones supposed to touch that tea, but we have to use tongs because it goes right in a customer's drink.) 

Evan doesn't have time to say anything before Otis lifts a bag to his nose and takes a deep whiff. 

He goes: ""What is this? Vanilla Rooibos? (He pronounced it ""roo-bis""; it's actually ""roy-bohs"".) Mmmmmmm. If a girl smell like dis, I'd lick her all *up* and down.""

Then, as quickly as he came, he put the tea back back, and left without saying a word. 

Evan dumped out all the Vanilla Rooibos and replaced it (not a big deal, nobody gets it anyway.)

**TL;DR:** Large man sexually assaults a tea bag in the middle of our store and left my coworker to clean up the mess.

Also, for anyone wondering why we keep the tea where the customers can reach it, it's because apparently people need to be able to see the bags before they can pick a drink for some reason.

j-sap,3,,5,1rigon,,17,"Some back story: I work the front desk at a gym a couple of days a week after class. We specialize in helping people with injuries and have a very specialized staff, program, and equipment. We are attached to an apartment complex that is spread out over a couple of buildings. The laundry for the complex is in the building adjacent to us. Now to use the laundry machines you are required to use a proprietary card that has to be purchased from a machine. I don't know what someone was smoking one day but instead of putting the machine that dispenses and allows people to add money to there card next to the laundry machines (even though there is plenty of room), someone decided to put the machine in the lobby of the gym. 

Where I work I have a very large window that overlooks the parking lot and see everyone who comes and goes and where people park. I had someone park or fly in the handicap spot (we'll call him Scumbag Steve or SS to keep things simple). SS jumps out of the car and runs full sprint into the lobby to add money onto his laundry card. After a minute or so I hear a knock on the window and we a quick interaction that goes like this:

SS: ""Hey yo man you got change for a $20?""

Now I absolutely do have the change for this guy in my drawer but if I used it then I would not have any for transaction at my desk.

Me: ""Sorry.""

SS: ""Yo man what about in your wallet, I know you can personally make me change?""

Now I am taken aback a little from this second question and am smart enough to never take out personal items around customers or even let them know where personal things are. I take a couple of seconds to think about everything and then respond.

Me: ""No I don't, but we have a great physical therapy program if you are interested.""

SS: ""Man why would I be interested in physical therapy, I am as fit as a horse?""

Me: ""Because you parked in a handicap spot and those spots are almost always full of clients.""

SS just sort of gave me a defeated look and slinked out the door and back to his car. He was back 20-30 minutes later and was good enough to not park in the handicap spot, instead he pulled up to the curb and made people walk around his vehicle.

adelajoy,0,,1,1ri8kg,,22,"I spent two years working at a big warehouse-style grocery store. I worked mostly as a cashier, but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a week.

Most of the crappy moments have all blurred together, but there are a few particular moments that stick out.

I realize this isn't the craziest story on here, but I will probably never forget this lady. 

Backstory: Our store had a policy that if an item scanned differently than the price tag, the customer would get it for free, up to $10. The mistake happened because the price tag didn't get changed, or was misplaced. If they spotted a problem, we would go look. If we found a tag in front of their item with the same code and a different price, we gave it to them and changed the tag. If the tag was for a different item, they didn't get anything. 

I was working the customer service desk, and a lady stormed up. I had several customers on the go at the moment, but it was pretty clear she *needed* help right away. As soon as I could, I asked what I could help her with. She was holding a bottle of toilet cleaner, her receipt and a price tag. Let's call her Crazy Customer, CC for short.

**CC**: ""I bought this bottle of toilet cleaner, but it was the wrong price! You guys are trying to charge me too much!""

**Me**: ""Okay, can I see your receipt?""

**CC**: *Hands me the receipt.* ""I tried to tell the cashier, but she didn't believe me!""

**Me**: *I checked who her cashier was, and it was one of our long-time girls. She knew the policy. There was no way she ""didn't believe"" the customer.* ""Okay, so the price came up $3.99, I'll just send a price-checker out to see what the tag said.""

**CC**: ""Oh, I grabbed the price tag already."" *She hands me the price tag. This lady is pretty worked up,  I'm not sure if she just wants to get out of the store, or if she's trying to pull one on me.*

A policy was that the tag had to be on the shelf. If a customer brings it to you, who's to say they didn't take it off the shelf last week and save it? They also could have found it in the wrong place, somewhere that the stock employees wouldn't have checked to fix the tag. As with most stores I've been to, store policy is to inform the customer about the relative store policies, and then see if you can help them anyways. No matter the problem.

It study the tag, and inform her of the policy, that the tag would have to be on the shelf. I start to let her know I can contact a manager, but she snatches the tag back and interrupts me.

**CC**: ""Well if that's your policy, I'll just put it back on the shelf! I was trying to save you some goddamn work, but I guess if you guys want to work extra, I'll just go put it back!""

She took off before I could say anything. I was just standing at the desk, aghast. I didn't even know what to say. 

The supervisor that was on shift was the scary kind. You know, the kind that isn't afraid to yell a little, handles the worst customers, and isn't phased when people call her names. Let's call her Jane. When the woman was gone, I grabbed Jane and told her the whole story. She said, ""Okay. When she comes back, let me know who she is. I'll handle her.""

As soon as I saw the customer coming back, I hissed, ""Jane! Jane! Jane! White hat! That's her."" I then ducked behind the display at customer service, and quite actually hid back there until the customer was gone. I could hear her yelling at Jane. I don't know what the verdict was. Any other manager, and the customer would have gotten the item for free, but it's hard to say with Jane.

I remember one of my coworkers came around the display and exclaimed my name. I hushed them, and told them I was hiding. I was so afraid the woman would see me and do one of those, ""Her! That's the one I was talking to! She told me this!"" And drag me back into it.

I've never hid from a customer before or since. Oh! Fun fact: The price tag she was holding said $3.29, a $0.70 difference from what she paid, and the tag was dated for the week before, which means it wasn't the current price. Not to say it wasn't still on the shelf, but there is a chance she did save it and bring it back in, especially with how worked up she was.

Thank goodness for thick-skinned supervisors who can handle being yelled at.","""I guess if you guys want to work extra, I'll just go put it back!""",23,talesFromRetail
Dannythegirl,5,,6,1rh77t,,7,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this but I needed to share. Long time lurker of this subreddit. On my phone, sorry for wall. 
I am a customer in this story, but former multi-year service/retail employee.
Today, I was grocery shopping with my two very little children. Not a huge chain store, but prominent in my state for supporting local foods. Many locations. 
I got in line to check out after an eventful and frustrating trip around the store with the kids. There was an elderly man checking out ahead of me. He was friendly and talkative to my kids and was asking me about my tattoos while we were waiting. The cashier was probably 55, spacey, but very sweet woman. When it was old guys turn to check out, I overheard their conversation at the register, and it was obvious they were both long time veterans to the store. 
The man had some trouble checking out. He rang his credit card through the machine multiple times while chatting with the cashier and he seemed confused. Eventually, she explained that he didn't have to keep swiping his card, and that his transaction was complete. In the mean time, she was scanning my items. 
The cashier chatted up a storm with me too. Asking about my kids while I was trying to wrangle them. I was getting a little impatient at this point because my 1 and 3 year old were ready to get the hell out of there, but I listened to her stories with patience. She was kind too.
When she finished scanning my food I pulled my card out to run through the machine, but it was asking for a signature, when I hadn't scanned my card yet. 
Me: ""there must be a mistake, I haven't slid my card through but it's already asking for a signature""
Cashier: ""no, you did, you must have forgot"" -looks at screen- ""you swiped your America express""
Me: ""No, I don't have an Amex, see?.. Oh no did the man in front of me swipe his card while you were ringing me up?""
Cashier: ""uh oh, that must have been what happened""
She looked panicked, but printed the receipt and said ""I'll just do this"" AND SIGNED THE RECEIPT
Cashier: ""He'll be okay, he can be so spacey. Don't even worry about it""
She at first folded up the receipt like she was going to trash it but I asked her if that was really ok, and that I could wait for a manger. She unfolded the receipt and told me not to worry. There was a long line behind me and frankly I was ready to get the fuck out of there with my crazy kids. I asked her ""are you sure? I feel uncomfortable"" 
She told me not to worry, and to go ahead and leave. And I did. 
I think her career might have ended today.
TLDR; Elderly man in line ahead of me accidentally paid for my groceries, cashier eventually realized but didn't give a fuck to fix it. I got free groceries :/

EDIT/UPDATE: I can see how it looks like I was unsympathetic in my post. I was in fact, horrified. I know the groceries weren't free, I just did not pay for them. In my car, I wrote down the time, my total $78.43 and what I thought the mans total was before me $43, and the name of the cashier. I should have stuck around and put my foot down but I was flustered and unsure how to proceed.  I was planning on calling when I got home, and totally forgot about the whole thing until I was in bed redditing from my phone late at night.
This morning I called and spoke with a manager, giving him all of my information. I told him I would happily come back and pay for the groceries and to please make sure the man did not actually get charged (hoping the cashier took the issue to the manager after I left). He said he will look into the receipts from last night and give me a call back. I will update again when I hear from him.

insecure_shit_knob,3,,2,1rie8h,,21,"Short and sweet one today. For new readers of my stories (welcome back to the other three), I'm a front end manager at a giant retail chain. Dealing with customers and cashiers is my job, and I only have the job because I'd rather work than be bored. I have enough money to not work, so I am not scared of losing my job.


On to the story:

One of my favorite cashier's (seriously, she's so sweet and helpful. I always drop what I'm doing to answer her questions because she's one of the three that I trust) calls me over for a price check on a set of plates. Customer says they were $29.99, but when I go check they're $49.99. She says that's fine and she pays for them. Done and over, right?

Wrong.

About ten minutes later she comes over to my podium. I already know she's getting coal from me in her stockings (merry Christmas bitch).

Her- ""I was just over there looking at the plates again. They were there just in the wrong spot.""

Me- ""I'm sorry ma'am, I'll let an associate know so he can fix it. I'm a little busy to get to it."" Which I was, I was getting five different change orders ready.

Her- ""Isn't it your job to fix it?""

Me- ""actually no it's not. I'm the front end manager. There are two managers who work in that area, it's actually their job technically. If I would've seen the plates,I would've put them in the right spot.""

Her- ""So you're just a lazy asshole.""

Ok, I'm done. I talk to everyone in a civil manner, but when they take that tone with me, I'm done.

Me- ""yep""

Her- ""You're not going to fix it?""

Me- ""Nope, too lazy right now.""

This was followed by more angry questions and statements until I walked away to deliver my change orders. She tracked an assistant manager down and let him have it about my attitude. He's a pretty cool guy, came up to me later, asked what the deal was and just laughed when I told him. Now he always asks if I'm lazy today when he sees me.

I don't remember much from it except for this story. Working storefront; typical day, typical customers. This older, possibly Italian gentleman came up and I asked to take his order.

Man: May I see your hand?

I think I just stood there looking at him for a moment. He had an Italian accent so I was thinking I may have misheard him, and asked for his order again. He held his hand out and insisted to see mine.

Now, this guy didn't look creepy or scary or anything. If so I would have just bolted. But I was 17 and put on the spot so I gave him my hand.

Man: What is your name?

At the time I still had my ""Trainee"" name tag so it wasn't on there. I don't know why I gave him my name. I didn't really know what else to do.

He then proceeded to serenade me in front of the entire store. Granted, there were only about 10 people around. He held my hand with enough force that I could not easily pull it away and I stood there flushed red while the rest of the staff laughed at me. Apparently it's happened before.

He sang in deep Italian (and I heard my name thrown in there) for a good two minutes before he let me go.

I was volunteering at a local zoo for a special Halloween event for about 3 - 4 hours. It was the last night of the event, and I was in charge of handing out prizes for games. It was a pretty good job, and I got to have as much free soda as I wanted, since I was in the concessions booth. I had to set out prizes, read tickets to see how many points a kid had, tell them how much each prize was (They could mix and match), then calculate how many points they had left as they chose. They'd choose their prizes, I'd hand it to them, and they'd leave. 

I had a friend of mine with me for the first hour, and we split the customers when it got busy. (Around 5 people at the same time.) At one point I spilled my soda, and she handled the crowd as I cleaned up the mess.

Then she left. Oh god.

I was left to set out prizes for display, serve customers, and translate kid-speak by myself. At some points I was so swamped with customers that I could barely figure out the total points for each kid as they got prizes.

Another girl came it at low tide, but left before it got busy again. (Around twenty minutes.) I wasn't allowed to leave my station to try and find her, so I had to deal with all the customers alone. (She wasn't actually allowed to leave either, but she gave zero fucks. Bitch.)

Scott5114,0,,3,1riony,,13,"I've met a lot of strange customers in my time at the casino. This guy takes the cake as the most fucked-up, unpleasant guy that's ever darkened our doorstep. We'll call him Dick because he is one.

To begin with, Dick is in the casino for a fucked-up reason. He's dying of cancer, or some other terminal disease. He spends his last days in our casino trying to win an inheritance for his children. Of course, mathematics says it's not going to happen, so he's squandering what money he does have and the remainder of his life sitting in a smoky room with no natural light playing $25 per spin on a slot machine. 

I wouldn't judge him so harshly for that if he wasn't a colossal asshole. Pretty much everyone who has had to pay a jackpot for him has some sort of unpleasant experience to share. Mine was when I was processing a jackpot for him and I go to clear the jackpot message from the screen. See, if you win, say, $1500, and you had $80 in credit when you hit it, when the attendant clears the jackpot your $80 will still be left on the machine. People sometimes forget or don't know this, and will leave the money on the machine and walk away, so after clearing it most of us will say ""You still have $80 left on the machine."" Of course, when I mention this to Dick, he flies into a rage, screaming ""I CAN SEE THAT! GOD!"" I started dodging his jackpots when I knew where he was playing after that—I don't put up with that sort of BS—though I still had to pay him out a couple of times after that because I didn't realize who it was. 

And Dick did hit a lot of jackpots. He would usually destroy the copy of the W2-G tax forms we would give him, I guess thinking since he's dying he won't need to worry about paying taxes, though you would think he would realize his kids would be on the hook for all of it. He also had the tendency to swear ambiguously so you never really knew whether he was calling the machine or you a piece of shit. Management had talked to him a couple of times about treating the attendants better. He did tip the bare minimum to not be considered an ass in that department, at least.

All of that is backstory to properly put in context what happened this week. At this point, Dick's managed to piss off enough attendants that most of the shift is dodging his calls, so it takes him probably twice as long to get someone over there than it would anyone else. This, coupled with the fact that he's losing heavily, pisses him off. 

Management gets called over to a machine in my section. I'm generally pretty curious about these things, so I head over there. The machine's touchscreen (retail price quoted to me by a tech as $700 or so) is totally shattered. The machine still has $20 on it—with an inoperable touchscreen, there's no way to cash that out on this machine. There's a patron further down the bank who saw the whole thing. Said the guy was losing, got pissed, punched the screen, threw a piece of paper down, and stormed off. One of the managers that showed up picks up the paper.

It's a torn-up W2-G with Dick's name, address, and social security number on it. A little bit of searching in the computers turns up copies of his driver license and the hotel room he is in. And of course the whole incident is caught on tape.

We don't know what happened to Dick after that. Apparently it became the responsibility of the casino's assistant general manager, and she isn't talking. We're all watching the usual locations for ban notices to go up, though.",The worst casino patron in the world,16,talesFromRetail
GlowingBall,2,,2,1rioer,,16,"These are my Tales of Retail Loss Prevention....

Part Three – Citizen Snips (Aka - The Pants Aquatic)



As a recap for those of you who have never read one of my stories before – I am a male in the midwest who is on the wrong side of his twenties and works retail loss prevention for a major retailer (one of the 'Big 5').  I am underpaid for what I do but enjoy my job none the less.  A majority of my time is spent wandering the floor or watching middle aged moms shop for clothing far too skimpy on them via CCTV (closed circuit television or 'security cameras').  Every once in awhile I get a case that is just so mind blowingly 'WTF' that I have to share.  

This story opens up with me doing just as I said above – watching people on CCTV.  It is a blisteringly cold afternoon so the customers, far more content to stay in their warm homes and snuggled beneath their blankets, are few and far between.  I, as the ever watchful hawk of justice that I am, was busy playing a Marvel version of Candy Crush Saga.  My job provides me the liberty of slacking off a good amount and my boss is rather lenient as long as I continue to bring in a good amount of stops per month.  I am sitting there diligently trying to match up small colored tiles with one another when I am startled by a sudden ring – the phone is going off!  

Now the phone going off is common place.  We get tons of calls a day ranging from the frozen dairy department calling to tell us a temperature alarm is going off (we know...it goes off for us as well) to people asking us to deactivate a door alarm (we also know...we see you standing at the door).  This happened to be a call from one of the few places that doesn't call us often – the meat department.  The guy on the other end, a tall black man with more muscle than he knows what to do with, calls to tell us that there is a guy standing in front of the freshly butchered meat.  The guy has refused any help the meat employee has offered and continues to say he is 'just browsing' for over ten minutes.  This strikes me as rather odd.  Who just hangs out around the meat department?  I quickly devise a plan for the situation.  I tell the employee to walk into the back so I could see just what the person was going to do.  

The employee hangs up and walks over to the man to let him know he is going to be into the back and to ring the bell if he needs anything.  No sooner than when he had walked into the back but the man glanced around and then walked behind the counter.  My adrenaline already began to rush as my suspicions came to fruition – he was going to steal!  “Oh shit here we go, ” I declared, only to watch in confusion and frustration as he walked right past all the glass displays full of meat and right over to the lobster tank.  Now if you aren't familiar with these tanks they are exactly just what the name implies – a water filled tank full of live lobsters we sell by the pound.  Their claws are bound and they just kind of hang out crawling all over one another.  Kids love to sit there and watch them.

“No way...is he really going to...” I whispered as I watched on in awe.  Sure enough he reached right into the live lobster display tank we have.  After a moment of 'fishing around' he plucked the lobster he wanted from the tank and pulled it out of the water.  Before I could even make heads or tails of the situation he glanced around once more and shoved the lobster right down the front of his pants.  The guy, whom shall be hence forth called Lobster Johnson, then proceeded to shuffle run his way out of the meat department and through the grocery department towards the front of the store.  The only way I can really describe how he ran was a forward version of Zoidberg's shuffle.  All he was missing was yelping out “Woop woop woop woop!” loudly as he went.  

Needless to say he wasn't too hard to stop.  I may not be in the best shape of my life but I can still move quicker than a guy with a large lobster squirming around in his pants.  He didn't fight me at the door or even try to argue what he was doing.  After all, it is kind of hard to argue that you aren't stealing when you have a large, lobster shaped bulge in your pants.

Bonus icing on top of the cake: I usually ask the person why they are stealing.  It usually won't change anything but it fulfills my curiosity and keeps them talking which usually calms them down a bit.  This guy tried to say that he was stealing the lobster for his kids...

As I come around a corner in said hallway I almost bump into our Store Manager (SM from here on out) who is in the middle of cleaning the bathrooms.  SM and I start chatting and from the men's room I hear some loud noises.

""Damn kids screwing around."" SM replies as he sets down the bag of trash he had been holding and walks over to the men's room.

Now, SM isn't a particularly tall guy, but he lifts weights quite a bit and could very well be described as being jacked.  Somehow, from time to time, people think it is a good idea to fight him, so I stuck around in case he needed backup.

SM opens the men's room door hard, slamming it into the wall and bellows, ""What the HELL are you doing in my bathroom?""

--inaudible reply--

""Yeah, well it is a pretty sad day when I have to kick someone out of the bathroom, now get the hell out."" SM says at a slightly reduced volume.

""B..But my stomach hurts."" says a meek voice from inside the bathroom.

Then at a normal volume, but with a tone of voice that sounded like SM had ice in his veins he replies, ""Carry it somewhere else.""  Then he stared into the bathroom in a manner that was somewhat intense.

To avoid angry customers being stuck with something they dont like, we offer a 'comfort guarantee' where you have 90days to decide you dont like it and come exchange it for something else. This comes with a fee of $200 as we have to throw the like new mattress out.  

STORY: In comes a guy. Hes visibly upset, all I can think is [""here we go""](http://i.imgur.com/8MmamRX.gif) lets call him Angry Asshat(AA)

AA: I hate my mattress! 

ME: Im so sorry to hear that sir woul-

(he cut me off)

AA: I want my money refunded immediately, and I want you to come get that shit off my property **Today**

ME: Im very sorry but we cant refund your money. 

AA: [WHAT?! WHAT DO YOU MEAN](http://i.imgur.com/HouBhTG.gif)

ME: Well sir its illegal in the state of North Carolina to take used mattresses and we cant take it back. 

AA: WELL I WANT IT THE FUCK BACK NOW I DONT RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE([he was just yelling nonsense at me about how this is whats wrong with the world and its all the dirty liberals fault](http://i.imgur.com/OudLd7s.gif))

ME: Sir, I cannot break the law for you. Not only is it the store policy its **the law**

Now hes raging, but Im trying to salvage the situation

ME: What we can do for you though is our 90 day comfort guarantee swap out. Can I have your name Ill look your ticket up and well see what we can do. 

He seems to calm down a little bit and he takes a seat across from my desk and he gives me hi name. I look up his name and pull up his ticket as Im explaining the comfort guarantee I look at his ticket. And then at the date he bought it(ya know to make sure its at least close to 90 days) I was willing to be flexible to make this guy happy when I notice he bought this mattress 9months ago!! Im flexible but not *that* flexible

ME: Uhh Sir, Im sorry to say this but you bought this mattress 9months ago, that 6months over the 90days. Theres nothing we can do for you. 

That when he became absolutely IRATE with me. Screaming something about how this is bad business practice, he deserves to get a refund, we owe it to him. Blah blah blah. [Im done this this shit](http://i.imgur.com/InDPcFn.gif)

ME: SIR. There is nothing we can do, the comfort exchange policy was explained to you when you bought it, if you didnt like the mattress you should have come back 6months ago, now Im going to have to ask you to leave the store. 

Well he didnt like that very much. He was becoming increasingly angry and hostile. Hes leaning over my desk pointing his finger right in my face([Which I hate](http://i.imgur.com/u77ThfE.gif)) but I keep my cool, and as sternly as I can say

ME: Sir if you dont leave immediately I will be forced to call the police and have you removed from my store. 

He paused for a moment with sheer rage in his eyes. Then he SLAPS!(yes slaps) the coffee on my desk across the 5mattresses that are close to my desk, gives me the finger and walkes out! I was in shock I composed myself quickly, called the police, and then my boss and explained everything that happened. 

I guess that asshat forgot that he gave us his address to deliver the mattress to, he ruined about 5beds which he was made to pay sticker price for on all of them(sticker price is close to $300 more than what we normally sell for) 


Although I was scared I made a great commission on all the beds he had to replace. There was justice that day and it was great.

jessajuhanabi,30,,94,1rhnqp,,397,"As of last Thursday, I am the head manager of a retail outlet and cafe, answering only to my boss, since the only girl above me quit. All people that walk in, call or email come through me. My boss is normally around but he works on coffee machines most days. 

As backgound for this story: His brother is a c*nt. I live in Australia, so that term seriously fits him. He owes a bunch of people money, is generally an asshole, and my boss is very sad his brother has changed so much. It stresses my boss out as their finances are tied due to a trust. 

Today, a lady walks in around 11:30, and walks up to the front desk. Politely, she asks me, ""Is (boss) in?""

In my mind, she was another person that he knew since he's been running this business for 20+ years, or a rep from some company that I didn't care about. He turned around to look at her, and I pointed in his direction. 

She immediately starts spouting about how boss's brother, we'll call him AH for asshole, owed her money. This is not a surprise to boss. He knows her. He's heard from her over email before. In which he told her he has no access to the trust and he's also fighting AH for money. 

This does not please the lady, henceforth known as douchecanoe. DC repeats over and over, despite pleas from my boss to chase down AH, ""I'm not leaving without my money. Get it for me.""

Now, DC wants a hefty sum. A couple thousand dollars. My boss offers her a coffee while he tries to reach AH. A water. A chair. Nothing. She stands in front of our stock and repeats herself over and over. ""Give me my money. Give me my money. I don't care its not my problem. YOU pay me.""

Why is she going after my boss? Because she's gone through the courts, they told AH to pay, and he still hasn't. Her response? Come into my store and stand there all day every day until HIS BROTHER, pays her. 

Now, my boss tries and tries to get her to understand he has no access to the money. No go. So instead she stands in our store, silent, for 4 fucking hours. Four. DC stands there so long my boss gets fed up and stressed, and leaves. 

The difference is, he's a peace keeper. I was itching for him to leave. I was just going to have the cops come eject her. I was EXCITED. 

Unfortunately she realized rather quickly I was not the ""nice cop"" type so she stood out the front, called in a few friends and intermittently yelled ""YOU KNOW THIS IS SO SILLY I JUST WANT MY MONEY FROM THE (BUSINESS)"" and ""I KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE IN XXXX SUBURB I COULD RUIN A BUSINESS IF I WANTED TO."" through the window at me. 

Oh god. You scare me so much. I might pee my pants. 

Anyway she eventually gave up and left without coming back inside, probably since I was watching her and smiling, willing her to come inside so I could call the cops. 

Oh well, another day I suppose! Maybe she'll be back tomorrow...

SS_material,103,,89,1rhs01,,308,"I work in a Pet store, and had a lady check out, take her stuff to her car, come back in, ask for the bathroom directions, and came back to me asking for a manager.

Now when I was calling my managers phone, I had asked her if there was a reason and she replied, ""Oh yeah, there's a reason alright.""

Hmm..okay. I told my manager and she came to the front to talk to the lady. She had stepped to the side, away from me and talked to her. Then she began to tell another customer what happened sayinf ""that's just anti christian! Can you beleieve that?""

So I think to myself, oh boy what sign pissed her off. Because we have celebrate the season everywhere. Later, I asked my manager what she had complained about and she told me that she was upset because I didn't tell her Merry Christmas.

What...it's not even Thanksgiving yet! My manager did say it's fine, and that I'm not in trouble. I don't have to tell her Merry Christmas, or Happy Holidays unless I wanted to. I started my first retail job in August of this year, so it's gonna be fun during the holidays when people get angry at me for ""offending"" them.

DolfyuttSrednaz,58,,48,1rh8hc,,200,"I have got to say, after working 4 years in retail, parents should be responsible for their children's actions. I have seen so many kids acting like demons that have just spawned from a dimension full of pointy sticks being shoved up their asses, but I never blame the kids. I usually don't even blame the parents, because kids are kids, but when customers blatantly let their kids run around like Sonic on meth, I blame the parents. that is why we have an announcement that plays every few minutes, reminding customers to keep their little shits in line. So when a customer like the one I had comes in, I usually inform my manager (who will be called Jared) of the situation and he watches the kid from a distance. 

A middle-aged couple stumbles into the store with their 7 year old son. They head off to furniture, but their son makes a bee-line to toys. I immediately call Jared, and let him know that this little tornado is heading to toys and he should try to contain the damage as much as possible. Before the kid makes it to toys, he stops over in the Halloween section and starts putting on masks and runs around the store trying to scare the other customers. After 4 complaints, Jared stops the kid, and drags him to his parents, who don't give one shit nor a giggle about what my manager has to say and wave him off. The kid bolts towards toys, and stars ripping toys down off the shelf. The floor looks like a miniature Antietam by the time he is finished. Now he has an armload of toys and decides to take them to the bathroom. Once in there, he places them on the floor, and proceeds to urinate on them. Jared walks in on him finishing up, and drags the kid back to his parents, leaving a trail of piss footprints behind him. Jared tells the parents what he did, and that they have to clean up the mess. This switches the parents into rage mode. They just cannot BELIEVE that their kid would do this! And he will be punished severely when they get home. Jared tells them calmly ""I am punishing you, not your child. You guys made no effort to control him, and even brushed me off after the first incident. You guys will clean up every mess he has made, and then you can leave. You are no longer welcomed here."" They start yelling profanities at him and their kid, saying how this is ridiculous and they shouldn't have to put up with this. 

After they cleaned up, they left empty handed. Jared received many compliments on how he handled the situation. It is the second worst customers I have ever had, even if I didn't directly deal with them. The worst, by far, has to be a couple out of towners. That is for another day though.

racheecakes,8,,48,1rhjav,,206,"This sub is usually full of complaints and although I have quite a few I have a short, nice story to tell. I work in the dining room at one of the lovely bakery/cafe chains in America. We are very lax on people lingering in our cafe, especially the homeless. We allow them to stay in our building in the single comfortable chairs for as long as they want as long as they're not pestering our customers. (It's not like we're hobo central, there are only two or three regulars). Usually our lunch rushes are filled with self centered people or angry people who just spent a dick load of money on presents for people they really didn't want to spend money on (we're located in a mall parking lot). In the midst of the chaos, bread bowls, and dirty tables I notice a customer approaching an obvious homeless man. This catches my eye so I go over and start cleaning a nearby table and eavesdrop. The customer hands the homeless man a gift card to our cafe for fifty dollars. He told him to stay full during this holiday season, to have a good one, and clenched his shoulder in a very comforting, almost fatherly like way. He walked away and back to his table before the homeless man got to say a word. The look on the homeless man's face was something worth remembering. It was nice to see someone think of someone they did not even know.

aturquoiseseashell,12,,25,1rg9do,,127,"End of shift at a famous, upscale department store, and I am already clocked out, with my purse on. I'm talking to my coworkers before I leave because I'm waiting on a ride home. I work in the lingerie department, which is near one of the 2nd story entrance doors to the store. 

A flustered woman comes up with three bags, one from Kate Spade, one from Michael Kors, and one from Tory Burch. She says she found the bags in the vestibule of the entrance to the store.
We thank her for her honesty and promise to call Loss Prevention to come and take the bags. She becomes agitated.

""Well I'm going to wait here and see that you do it,"" she snaps. She's suddenly riled up.

We're a bit taken aback, but continue to be polite to her and my coworker calls LP.

While my coworker waits on the phone to be connected to the security desk, I guess we kind of exchanged looks. (She was very antsy, and was holding onto the bags for dear life). The woman exclaims in outrage, ""Don't you all roll your eyes at me!"" 

""Ma'am,"" says my co-worker, ""No one is rolling their eyes. We're waiting for security to pick up the phone. They will make sure the bags are returned to the customer. Thank you very much for bringing them to our attention, we will see to it that they are returned to the customer."" 

The woman becomes more agitated and irritated. Finally, security picks up and my coworker says, ""A customer found some bags; one's from MK, one is from Tory Burch…""
The woman snaps, before my coworker is quite finished, ""And one from Kate Spade!!"" as though we purposely left that one out so we could steal it or something. 

""And one from Kate Spade,"" my co-worker adds. We're all getting kind of insulted by this woman's attitude. She seems convinced we're plotting to steal the bags, despite the fact that they remain in plain sight of the security camera. We're all well-dressed, well-spoken girls in our early twenties, and we are acting calm and polite. No apparent cause for suspicion.

Security says they can't help and to turn the bags into customer service, who coworker speaks to.
""Ma'am, please give me the bags. Customer service is coming to pick them up,"" my coworker says. We really want her to leave at this point. She's staring at us through narrowed eyes and she's breathing heavily.

""No!"" the woman shrieks, and clutches them to her chest. She tears frantically at one of them and finds a receipt. She begins dialing the number of Kate Spade. We're stunned.
""Please, ma'am…"" the coworker begins, but the woman literally shushes her and begins frantically reading the details of the receipt to the cashier at Kate Spade who is on the other end of the phone. 

She convinces an employee at Kate Spade to come to the dept. store to identify the bags.
Meanwhile, she announces that she will take the bags to customer service herself, in a very angry tone. ""You all are acting VERY suspicious!"" she declares, still clutching the bags to her breast almost maniacally. 

At this point, we're pretty alarmed by her behavior and beginning to wonder if she plans to steal the bags herself after seeing the prices on the receipt. My coworker calls the store manager, and we inform the customer that we would prefer that she remain in lingerie with the bags and wait for the manager. She loudly refuses to stay put. My coworker follows her to customer service.

From all the way in our department on the other end of the floor, we can hear the woman yelling. She had a quavery voice and a really strong British accent. 
Apparently, she got to customer service, and the couple who had left the bags was there. The woman refused to give them the bags without proof of their identity!! Finally the Kate Spade employee arrived and confirmed that yes, the bags belonged to the couple. 

I guess the woman was trying to do the right thing, but she insulted my coworkers and me and frightened various customers in the process. I still don't get why she became so suspicious or why she didn't just bring the bags to customer service in the first place. Of course, since we were lowly retail workers we must have been plotting to steal the lost merchandise.

KroipyBill,11,,40,1rhynu,,123,"After [writing about our cheering seasonal workers from Black Friday yesterday,](http://redd.it/1rf92j) it reminded me of this other story involving my goofy manager. 

When I first started working for this place, I came in clean shaven, and patchy hair. I was in denial that mother nature was closing my hair follicles for business, and it wasn't until after my engagement photos I decided to make a change. I shaved my head and have kept it that way ever since. I then grew a goatee to compensate for my loss. Honestly I looked much sharper than having the grassy field of hair you can see the horizon through. It was a relief to embrace it, and feel like I looked decent again. There was one manager who enjoyed messing with me however. In fact in my previous stories, I've quoted him several times in our conversations, since he was my favorite manager to talk to, and the biggest goof ball there. He vowed he would draw on my head when I wasn't ready for it. 

**Me:** Dude I'm taller than you. So unless you parachute from the rafters onto my cranium with your sharpie, you will not succeed. 

**Manager:** We'll see...we'll...see...

At that moment I wondered if he really was contemplating that attack strategy. At least he left it at just contemplating. 

One day, we were pretty busy. It was pre-holiday, post-black Friday days. I'm sure you all know the type. Everybody is getting geared up for Christmas. I found my way over to the computer department helping a customer decide what Mac they wanted. I was describing the hardware specs, how it works with their Apple products etc. During this I felt I was going to make a decent sale. However I made a massive mistake...

*I sat down.* 

Yes I slipped up big time. My manager saw this opportunity from what it seemed immediately. He walked over and distracted me by having another employee ask me a question. 

**Employee:** Hey KroipyBill you know where I can find [some bullcrap item that he knew the answer to.]

**Me:** Yeah sure. Remember they're eh...ahh...AHH!!!

Right then, my manager walks up to me with his pen, and I felt the coldness of the ballpoint touch my head, while it was dragged across my chrome dome. My entire body froze as if somebody stiffed my spine. I made a weird breathing noise, like I was experiencing sharp pains when it was just mainly a very tiny cold piece of metal on my head. Kind of like EAHH!! EAHH!! EAHH!!! (That's the best I can do textually.) They were quiet, sharp noises.

He walked off, cackling like the joker. I looked at my customer with this super surprised look on my face. He lost his crap, and just laughed. Because of this I sold him more attachments, but that's beside the point. 

Over the radio:

**Me:** The person who drew on my head. You know who you are. Thanks for helping my sale out by doodling with a ballpoint pen on my cranium. 

I looked around the store and saw those with a radio express such confusion. I'm a pretty tall dude, so for those who were in eye sight, I bent my head down so they could see the graffiti my manager brought forth upon my person. Much laughter followed, including my manager.

**Manager:** You said I would never get you. 

**Me:** Well bucket head, you're lucky I was sitting so your midget self could strike me. 

**Manager:** My strike is now complete. 

**Me:** It's a good thing I don't just go over there and rub my greasy head all over your face. I'm glad you feel all militaristic about your approach. 

**Manager:** Oh...this would be a much more fun Call of Duty game if this were part of the game play. 

I never got him back. And he has since left the store after I left. Despite us still being good friends, he's still a bucket head.

It was a beautiful sunny day, which is not common in these parts from oh...October to May.

At this point I realized that I'm dealing with some sort of royalty by the way she's talking to me and looking at me like I was clearly beneath her.    
    
We walked out side and toward the Avalon's and as we rounded the corner I was blinded by the light of 1 sun (that mutha fucker is bright when we only see it a few times a year) so I do what I thought was natural, I put on my sun glasses. You'd think I killed her 2nd born spawn.    
        
UB stopped in her tracks and said, ""Excuse me, how long have you been in sales.""     
    
Me, ""About 15 years now, why do you ask?""    
    
UB, ""How dare you put your sunglasses on in front of a customer. You should know better.""    
    
At this point I'm done with her attitude. She can; buy a car, sell a car, die in fire for all that I'm concerned.    
    
Me, ""While were walking into the direct sunlight I'm keeping them on, once we get into a car I'll make sure to take them off so you can see my pretty greens again.""     
     
The look and sound of disgust from her should of withered some near by plants.     
    
UB, "" I don't want to look at the Avalon unless it has what I want on it.""      
        
I acted all surprised and said, ""Ahhh in that case thus far all you've told me is that you want technology on it. Every car on my lot has technology, how about you fill in the blanks for me and I'll get you what you need.""   I finished that last part with a touch of sarcasm.
    
UB, "" You don't have to take that tone with me.""     
    
I just started at her until she finally answered my question.    
   
UB, ""I want....""  Imagine everything every car in every scfi movie has done (some highlights: Voice activated everything, self driving, self maintaining, color changing, all electric or non-gas, The list goes on)

Maloth_Warblade,6,,17,1rhx0y,,94,"Black Friday, 2011. Big, blue, zombie-filled box store. I was a photo tech.

It's been almost 2 years now, as I no longer work for retail. I did my 5 years with it and I'm done.

I'm glad I'm out, too. I don't hate people, I just learned that I hate being treated like less than crap, filth, and told I'm worthless on a daily basis. But this one was so irritating I spoke up.

I worked 2 stores on Black Friday in 2011, both the BBS and the famous game store. I was basically at work from Noon-8 on Thanksgiving at the BBS, missing all family gatherings, by the way, and then 11:30pm-7am at the games store (I was the only cashier by the way, in the most populated area of the county/city), and then 12-8 again on Black Friday at the BBS. 

I was tired, beyond tired, essentially 20hrs of work, on my feet with no breaks for food or bathroom due to chaos. The BBS frequently refused to give me my lunches until I was mandatorily locked out, and even then they simply made me work anyway (even got reported for going over 8 hrs without a break, wasn't given a choice).

 Needless to say, by the time 5pm rolled around, and not having eaten but a pop tart in 24hrs, I was having a sugar crash. These make you lightheaded, these make it hard to think and respond quickly. I was working my ass off to get greeting cards printed, packaged, priced and all the while walking everyone through how to use our touch-screen computers and simple tasks. 

One customer didn't like that I wasn't answering fast enough. Of course she didn't, it's Black Friday, and that I was being far too rude for her. She told me she didn't like how tired I was, that I shouldn't work at all if I was so tired. How worthless I was to be there, on the busiest day of the year, if I couldn't be bothered to be awake. 

At this point I interrupted her. I told her ""Lady, listen. I don't need this from you, not today. Not the day people die from customers entitlement. No. I've been working since pretty much Noon yesterday. I had to miss my family's Thanksgiving, again, and not only that, I couldn't even EAT any food yet. There's no time. I'm beyond having a sugar crash, I'm hungry, and beyond normal tired. If you're going to sit there and belittle me over this, you can just get out of my face and leave this place"" (or something VERY close to this, been a few years).

Of course I got loud to say this, and everyone looked at her. Associates, customers, even her husband. She tried apologizing, I kept interrupting her asking what else she needed, and she kept trying to change subjects..I wouldn't let her. She was the last straw I needed that day, and I wasn't having it.

Good news though, wasn't reported, wasn't written up. Had a very nice and thoughtful customer buy me a bag of chips and a soda after seeing me be berated by not only her but other customers. Made it home and promptly slept for 15 hours.

adelajoy,15,,15,1rg29x,,73,"I spent two years working at a big warehouse-style grocery store. I worked mostly as a cashier, but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a week.

Most of the crappy moments have all blurred together, but there are a few particular moments that stick out.

This grocery store is the only one in the area that doesn't bag your groceries for you. Each till has two long conveyor belts to hold your groceries while you bag them (Both the customer and the cashier have buttons to move the groceries down, away from the till). This speeds orders up, requires less staff, saves money and drops prices. People occasionally complain about it, but if they want to pay more for their groceries and have someone else bag them, they're welcome to. ... The store isn't exactly famous for customer service, but I think the prices make up for this.

I was one of the fastest cashiers on staff at the time. This meant that my belts would often get full. I had ways to deal with this. I knew how fast people packed, I knew how soon a belt would clear. I was really good at my job. One day, the lines were insanely long, I was working really fast, everyone was buying a lot. I got to a point that there were groceries on both of my belts, so I squeezed the smaller order down a little, watched for a moment, and knew that he would be down before the next order crowded him. I started scanning the next order, and smiled at the customers - a man and his very pregnant wife.

The wife snapped at me, ""Can you just wait!""

""Excuse me?""

""Can you wait? I don't want you to crowd out that other guy!""

I looked, and he was literally loading his last bag with groceries. I stopped scanning anyways, and maybe glared at the lady. I don't really like it when other people tell me how to do my job.

Eventually he was packed and gone, so I started scanning again. While I had been waiting, I had lined all of their canned goods up. I can scan cans super fast if they're all really close. I started scanning the canned goods, grabbing a can, tossing it to my other hand, and setting it on the other belt. Except that this woman had walked around (The belt she got was behind me) and was standing behind me, trying to bag the cans as I scanned them. I'm sorry, but I'm not actually looking where the cans go. I know the space, and I need to watch the computer screen, not my hands. Well, she kept trying to grab the one I'd just set down, which meant that I kept hitting her hand with the next can. I wasn't by any means throwing the cans, but I was moving quickly and she was in my space, so she was getting hit. I didn't actually realize that I was hitting her until she complained to her husband. So I slowed down, apologized, and moved on to her other groceries.

She then had a bag of apples. She had grabbed one of our bags and put three different apples in it, and tied it shut. I have to weigh each type of fruit separately, so I opened the bag, weighed the first apple, set it aside. I noticed her husband grabbed the apple right away. I weighed the second apple, and set it aside. He grabbed that one too. When I weighed the third, my plan had been to put all three back in the bag and tie it shut, but the other two apples were gone. I tied the bag around the last one and set it on the belt. If the husband wanted to pack the apples separately, he was welcome to.

The couple also bought about half a dozen little bags of frozen perogies. One of the bags had been ripped all the open, right down the middle, and frozen perogies were laying all over the belt. I considered not telling them, because I was mad, but I took a deep breath, rounded up all of the stray perogies, put them in a plastic bag, and informed the lady. I asked her if she would like me to send for a new bag. She snippily replied ""Yes"" as if I should have just known. Some people don't bother to get a new bag because it can hold up the line, so I always ask. Our runner quickly returned with an identical bag and I kept going.

When I finally finished (They bought *a lot* of stuff), the husband paid, while the wife stormed over to customer service. I watched as she talked to my supervisor, and eventually a store manager. I was getting pretty nervous. Oh, also I should mention this woman was rude and snapped every time I asked her a question. I was pretty angry by the time they left.

After they were completely done, my supervisor closed my till and asked to speak to me at customer service.

She said the lady had filed a formal complaint against me. Apparently the conversation went something like this:

**Pregnant Lady**: ""I want to complain about the cashier on till 9!""

**Nice Supervisor**: ""Till 9? Do you mean till 8?"" (I was on 9 - one of my quick-to-anger coworkers was on 8)

**PL**: ""No, I mean 9!""

**NS**: ""Like the girl with brown hair, *not* the blonde?""

**PL**: (getting frustrated) ""Yes!""

**NS**: ""So what did adelajoy do?""

**PL**: ""She was rude and short with me!""

**NS**: ""Adelajoy? Are you sure?""

**PL**: ""Yes! She also threw canned goods at me, *ripped* open a bag of perogies, scattered them *everywhere* and scattered all of my apples too! She also bruised all of my fruit because she was throwing them around!""

A store manager was brought down to take a formal complaint, which means it probably went in my employee file. The lady was calmed down and left, and that was the end of it. Typically, the store managers will meet with you to discuss complaints, and make sure they won't happen again. The fact that I didn't means either the manager simply didn't believe the woman, or wasn't concerned because it was my first (and only). The supervisor who helped her said she closed my till because I looked upset and she thought I needed a break. The only reason she told me was to find out what really happened. I told her my side, and she just laughed it off. I admitted to being short and snippy, but the rest was just ludicrous. I still cannot beleive she blamed me for the bag of perogies being ripped open, considering I told her about them, got a new bag, and spent a minute or two picking up all of the perogies. Also, why would I take the time to do that, when I was clearly rushed with everything else?

I get that pregnant women have a lot of hormones, and tend to be angry, short-tempered, whatnot, but I think there's a line. Also, the fact that her husband didn't stop her, stand up for me, or admit to grabbing all the apples kind of pissed me off.

Tl;dr: Crazy-hormones pregnant lady complained about me, but the supervisor didn't believe her.","In my spare time, I like to rip open your groceries and scatter them",88,talesFromRetail
unidentifiableblarg,12,,9,1rhfwt,,65,"**Back story:** I worked in a small convenience store in a town on the outskirts of a city. A lot of the customer's are regulars and have been coming here for years, decades even.

About 6 years ago the place changed hands, names and management too. Still provided the same sort of stuff though, so the locals kept calling it by it's old name. 

This is relevant, I swear.



**The story:** I'm serving on the registers at the front of the store, just doin ma biz, when a flustered woman comes up to the counter demanding my attention. I tell her I'll be with her as soon as I finish processing my currant customer.

This somehow seemed to offended her, so I was already off to a bad start. But I get to her and try to smooth things over with my best customer service voice (you know the one).

After a bit of just listening to her complaining and bitching in general she finally gets to the point.

""I bought this product here earlier and you (not me) charged me the wrong price! It's on special, why is it wrong blah blah blah""

The outrage was dripping off her.

Now, normally I'd be prepared to fix this, sometimes we just straight up get it wrong and stuff isn't the right price.

*But*, while she's ranting she's waving around a catalogue, that contains the magical special that we failed to give her.

Eventually she shoves it in my face to accent a point, and shows me what it should have been.

The catalogue wasn't for our store, we don't even sell the brand (ice cream, I think it was) that she seemed to have thought she purchased.

I politely explain that we're not an [old store] any more and that was why she didn't get the discount. But I'd be happy t...

Her: What?! I've lived her FOR YEARS and it's always been [old store]. You've got to be kidding me.

I point out the signs (they're everywhere) and shirts of the employees and explain that we've been [new store] for quite a while.

She persists though, demanding to get her discount because it's ""always been that way and why should I get screwed for what you did..."" just generally giving me a hard time; that kind of bullshit.

The managers will usually give the discount to them anyway, just to keep them happy, but I was sick of getting abused by people who apparently can't read and wasn't about to let this one fly. Pety, I know.

Eventually I get to the point where I'm just repeating myself and she's adamantly refusing to be 'robbed' of forty cents. So I call my manager to come up.

By this stage I'm sick of her shit and just want her to leave, customers are waiting to be served and I'm meant to be serving. Small store, small number of staff.

Finally my duty manager meanders up and he immediately grovels at her feet, begging her forgiveness and taking her to a spare register to sort out her problem. 


I'm not bitter (lies), but the smug grin she threw me on her way out made me really wish that our management stood up for us, at least sometimes.

And that I had a crowbar handy.

CommandoDerp,9,,17,1rhsfa,,62,"First off, I would like to say that I had two days off before this incident so I was unaware of any changes at work.

So I was at work after two days off when I was serving an elderly man, who was a regular, cigarettes. He asked for a particular brand in a carton of twin packs. I tell him unfortunately that the twin packs are classified as cartons themselves, and you cannot purchase a carton of a carton. He rolled his eyes and asked for 4 individual twin packs.

I immediately check the cupboard nearby of said twin packs of cigarettes that he wanted and I inform him that we are all sold out. This is the conversation that follows:

Him: ""Are you serious?""
Me: ""Yes, sorry. We are unfortunately all sold out until we get some more.""
Him: ""This is pathetic!""
Me: ""Would you like another flavor?""
He mumbles something to me which I repeat my previous question.
Me: ""Would you like another flavor?""
Him: ""No. This unacceptable. You are refusing sale""
Me: ""Is there anything else I can help you with as we don't seem to have what you are after?""
Him: ""I would like to speak to your manager.""
Me: ""Actually there might be some here""

I had a thought and I turned around and checked the display rack to see if there are any more in the display. To which I found 4 individual twin packs sitting there, I felt like an idiot not checking there first.

Me: ""I didn't realize that there was any in the display, I...""
Him: ""Your very lucky""
Me: ""I'm very sorry I did not check there first. I recently had two days off and I wasn't informed that what you were after was in the display. I'm sorry for any unconvinced""

He just sighs loudly and rolls his eyes and tells me one last thing while paying for his cigarettes.

Him: ""Your very lucky you found them or otherwise you would have lost hundreds and hundreds of dollars in sales and quite a few hundred customers because of your poor service.""

Payment is finished and I tell him I'm sorry again and to enjoy his night. He storms back into the store and complains to another staff member who was not in charge for the night.

The man left and the employee approached me asking what happened. I told them and they said not to worry, they knew it wasn't on purpose. The actual supervisor for the night approached me and asked what happened, they knew it wasn't intentional so they didn't seem too phased by it; even though I was the back up person in charge that night.","I don't know how to feel after my ""complaint""?",79,talesFromRetail
Drunken_Black_Belt,7,,8,1rhw8z,,59,"I'm back bitches!  About 2 months ago, I got a second job working part time at a men's Big &amp;Tall store.  The hours are easy, commision is alright, and to be honest, the customers are generally friendly and awesome.  It helps that a lot of them don't have anywhere else to shop. Unfortunantly the store isn't as eventul as my past retail jobs.  Its just selling clothes and shoes.  But I've gotten a few funny stories that I'll share over time here. And with the holiday's coming up, i'm sure I'll have plenty more.  

Welll, for your pleasure (hopefully), I present **Boy, Are My Feet Sore!**

**WARNING: GROSS!**

So recently I began working in a men's store for Big &amp; Tall sizes.  I knew of it because I buy my shoes there.  Only store that carries a size 15/16.  I am too small for the clothes, despite being 6'4 and slightly overweight.  And if I'm being honest,  seeing some of the people who come in makes me more motivated to keep losing weight (50 lbs this year alone).  

Now, don't get me wrong, SOME of the people have legitimate health concerns.  One gentleman was born with his left foot backwards.  During his childhood they would constantly have to break his foot, set it slightly closer to the proper position, let it heal, and repeat. But it never set 100% correct, keeping him from being able to run or exercise, or even stand for long periods of time.  It's guys like him I feel for.  Given a shitty deal in life and just having to suffer for it. 

Most customers, however, are just plain old fat guys.  I don't want to sound mean, or ""fat shame"".  But it's just poor lifestyle choices and such.  I was there.  I was 5lbs shy of 300 last new years.  And it was just being lazy and making bad choices.  I don't have as much sympathy for these guys.  And that brings us to our story today.

It's a sunny fall day.  It's midweek, and pretty dead.  I'm in my suit, fixing clothes, putzing around, pretty much just pretending to work.  I hear the door chime, and in walks an older couple.  Probably late 60's, very early 70's.  The lady was using a walker to move around, and the gentleman was resting his weight on a cane as he slowly moved with her.  They seemed like a nice enough couple, but as you know, those are the ones who always turn into assholes.

I introduced myself, asked how I could help them that day.  The man gruffly replied ""shoes"".  I brought them to the shoe department.  Now my store is small, and there is only one small bench to sit on, and it's in the shoe department.  Naturally, this oaf takes the seat, leaving his frail wife to stand.  I could tell she was having difficulty, being particularly petire and frail, so I went in the back and got her a folding chair to sit in next to her husband.  She thanked me, because manners.  The man, charming fellow that he was, just said ""can you get me some shoes now?"".  

It was about this time that I realized this was going to go south faster than a my ex g/f in a dick sucking contest.

I offered several suggestions, as the gentleman didn't seem to know what kind of shoes he wanted.  The man complained that most of our shoes don't even fit him. I expressed sympathy, as I have large feet and can only fit into the largest size available in store.  The man looked me up and down and sneered ""Well, you just have big feet. I have a health condition that causes this, so consider yourself lucky"".  

Eventually we found a pair he liked and thought may just fit his feet.  And that's when the real horror of this story starts.  The man then proceeds to roll up his sweatpants.  He was wearing ankle socks and sandals.  His feet are hugely swollen, and covered in open sores.  This guy has diabetes, and it's eating away at his foot.  Sadly it's fairly common where I work.  What came next, however, is not.

I hand him the shoes, and take a step back, giving him some space to put the shoes on, look at them in the mirror, see how they feel, etc.  

NOPE!  

He looks at me like an idiot and says ""Well I can't put them on myself.  I can't bend that far.  Put them on for me"".   

Now I am no fan of feet, even on a good day.  Sure if I'm dating someone, and they want a footrub, and their feet are clean, then i'll oblige.  But other than that, I just want nothing to do with that area of the body.  Add to the fact that we are talking about a stranger whose foot is literally covered in open, oozing sores.  

DBB: Sir I just can't do that, I'm sorry.

Man:  You need to help me.  I'm a customer and I need service.

DBB: There is no way I am doing that sir.  I am sorry but you have open sores on your foot and leg. It's unsanitary for both me and YOU, to have me do that.

Man: Oh just wash your hands after it'll be fine.

How this man survived 70 or so years with logic like that, will forever amaze me.  

DBB: Absolutely not.  

Man: I want the manger!  I'll have your ass for discrimination and harrassment

DBB:  I am the manager.  If you want the store manager call back tomorrow.  If you want corporate's phone number I'll give it with my name gladly.  


The man continued to yell and scream about receiving the shoes at a discount and having me fired.  Typical stuff for anyone who works in retail really.  I essentially told him that I wasn't going to touch his feet, and if he didn't like the service he could leave. Wife is trying to keep the peace.  It's not very effective.  Husband used Rage!  It's inneffective against DBB!  Besides my DEF is to high.  

Anyways, i wish there was some more to this.  Eventually he stormed out as dramatically as one can when you can barely walk under your own weight, and your wife is frail and moves about as fast a christian school girl with a chastity belt.  I did hear from corporate the next day though.  Naturally some of the details were changed when he called in, but once I explained about the sores, I receieve a ""Yea that happens all the time. Don't worry about it"".  

Sorry if it's not very exciting.  I'm sure I'll have some good ones coming up.  Hope you all are surviving the holidays!

Turns out, the woman was making a sizeable purchase and couldn't supply an adequate form of ID. I explained to her that we simply couldn't process her credit card without proper identification. She dug through her purse and tossed a bottle of birth control pills on the counter and was like ""Will this bottle work?

She then threw a world class tantrum using colorful language that would even make a seasoned sailor blush.

I was working in the jewelry department of a department/grocery store at the time. I'd been in that same department for 2 years by the time this incident took place. It was very early on a Saturday, before the rush, and a lady comes up to my counter to do a return. No problemo, I thought.

Me: I can do that return for you. Can I see your receipt ma'am?

Customer: I don't have it anymore. 

Me: I'll only be able to refund it to a gift card then, is that ok?

Customer: yeah, that's fine. 

One hurdle jumped. She hands me the item and I notice that it is in a package I have never seen before. I know my department like the back of my hand cause I'm the one that checks in -all- of the merchandise. Every item that has gone into the department in the last two years had to pass by me first. 

Me: ma'am are you sure you bought this here? I don't recognize this package. 

Customer, suddenly angry: of course I bought it here. (Spoiler, this a lie)

Me: ok, let me see if the system recognizes it. 

I scan the item at the register and I get an error. I look at the barcode and it's half as long as it needs to be (6 characters instead of 12, which is the store norm). 

Me: ma'am my register does not recognize this item. 

Customer: I bought it here!

Me, getting cranky at this point: are you -sure-? I've been in the department for two years and I've never seen this package before. Are you certain you didn't buy this at [dept store x] or [dept store y]?

Customer: I'm certain. I'm returning this for a friend and she bought it here! (Told ya)

Me: I'm sorry but I can't take an Item that doesn't even come up in the system. Especially if you don't have a receipt. 

Customer snatches the item from me and pulls her cell phone out: I am going to call her (the friend) and prove to you that it was bought here!! (She's nearly screaming at this point)

ScaldingSoup,5,,6,1rha57,,26,"So several  years ago I worked for a very popular lingerie store.  This store didn't pay commission, but would give us more or less hours per week based on sales performance.  My sales performance was VERY good.  I got more hours a week than most people.  

During the holiday season, we had a lot of seasonal employees, as any big retail store normally does.  One of the workers hired seasonally was this lady who was a lot older than the rest of us.  This was not the problem.  Her hair was bleached blonde, and growing out (showing obvious roots), and styled in a ""feathered"" fashion.  She did not know how to wear make-up and what she wore did not flatter her.  In this store our dress code was all black.   She wore skirts with no stockings, but with slouch socks and yeah, that was a hot mess.  

People began to call her the ""missing link"", as in to the 1980s because of the hair and her wearing slouch socks that were probably black in the 1980s but grey now.  Reading this, you may think that I judged her based on this, or have some animosity for people older than me.  I do not, but this just sort of describes what she looked like because it is important.  Black Friday rolls around, and she wears her normal dress of skirt, slouch socks and what-not.  Surrounding her socks are these bells that jingle..  

She begins waving panties in the air, helicopter style, like a stripper, chanting what the sale is as customers are passing by.  One of our gay male managers passes me by and mutters so only I can hear it ""I want her out"".  I was dying trying not to laugh at the situation, and meanwhile feeling very embarrassed for her.  Everywhere she walked, she jingled.

Some time during her short career with the lingerie store, she found my phone number on the schedule.  I guess they weren't giving her enough hours, because she had the nerve to leave me a message asking me for some of mine.

**Story (er, stories)**: 

1) I walk by the front door. Man approached with wife, stopped and said Excuse Me? Fine. I go over, and he started counting out a huge wad of cash. He counts $100 in small bills out, gives it to me, then says, ""Now, I want a propane tank, honey..."" 

He got the manager who resembles an NFL player instead. (Yes, I gave him the money back.)

2) Two young guys came through the checkout line with four carts of Head &amp; Shoulders, Dove bars, and some razors, I forgot the brand. This is ***-mart, it's cheap, and that's what matters. Three products. They racked up $1800 in this stuff. The one guy then pulled out of his pocket a pile of coupons that was quite literally a foot high. Mind already blown, I said half-jokingly, ""Those aren't all for me, are they?""

Yes. Yes they were. $1500 in coupons, $3 at a time. Do the math. And you couldn't do coupon repeats. Due to the volume, the *CSM thing came up halfway through, and I said ""Oh, the supervisor's going to have to turn the key..."" and they were all ""Ok, cool.""

So they hand over the remaining $300 cash (and people pay 500-600 all the time-that was normal) and the supervisor sees the key message on the palm pilot. I had every CSM (three on duty), the front end supervisor, two assistant managers, and every loss prevention person in the building (three-two associates &amp; the manager) at the register in what seemed like two seconds. 

The guy who'd had the coupons recognized the front end supervisor. He (coupon guy) went off and started going into it with the supervisor. The friend stands there numb, all the managers start talking at me, a CSM sticks the key in to abort this transaction, and I'm standing here holding $300 cash and a hell's lot of coupons. 

Then:
The customer let out a primal yell, the supervisor took the coupons from me, stuck them in the guy's hand, and wished him a good day-anywhere else. 

Turns out they were known scammers. The coupons would scan, but we can't get money back for them. I knew something was up, but I didn't know the back story. I just was asking myself over and over after this: If it had all gone through, and they'd walked out with $1800 of soap and shampoo, what the hell were they going to do with it all? Sell it at less than cost? Fill a swimming pool? Get ridiculously clean?

While Cee and his dad are looking at the toys, a woman with two children comes into the aisle they are in.  The older of the two, who is about the same age as Cee, sees something she wants and asks her mom for it.  Mom says no.  The little girl begs and pleads but mom holds firm and keeps telling her no.

Cee watches for a few seconds and then walks over to the girl.  He kneels in front of her and says:  ""Well, if you act like that, you really won't get anything.""  And then he walked back to his dad.

Me: Do you have the canceled check?

Customer: No, I threw it in your trash.

Me, cringing: How about a receipt?

Customer: In the gar-bage. What don’t you understand?

Me:  I think I need to transfer you to the Customer Service Desk. Let me just find the number…

Customer: NO, you will NOT! I need the movie about…(another two, three minutes)…now!

Customer: Getting my movie!

Me: I can’t give you a physical object through the phone. Why don’t you come in and see Customer Service?  They should be able to help you.

Customer: …I’ll be there in fifteen minutes. Let me get the kids.

copisreallybad,4,,6,1rhulb,,22,"a few days ago, i get called down to the returns desk from the paint desk. the return policy for the chain i work at is very lenient, but we aren't supposed to take mixed paint back, so already walking down there i had a bad feeling that i would have to get a manager involved (and we all know how incompetent they can be)

so i get there, and to my surprise it's just a regular can of unmixed, white, exterior paint, which *is* returnable without manager involvement. i ask the guy what's wrong with the paint and he says that it's frozen and we need to fix it or give him another can.

i bring the can to the paint desk and open it up. now, imagine what half frozen, hardened paint looks like. that's what this paint looked like, and the following conversation sort of went like this.

me: ""this paint is frozen, did you leave it in the garage or something?""

customer (now visibly irate): ""ABSOLUTELY NOT I BOUGHT IT AND I JUST OPENED IT THIS MORNING AND TO MY SURPRISE IT LOOKS LIKE THIS""

me: ""I'm sorry but we really aren't supposed to take paint like this back, it's useless to us returned""

customer (literally about to pop a blood vessel in his brain at this point): ""WELL MAYBE IF YOU GUYS HAD FUCKING SOLD ME A GOOD CAN OF PAINT IT WOULDNT BE FUCKING FROZEN. I WANT A MANAGER, NOW""

great, this guy knows how to get what he wants. i call a manager and explain the situation to him. the manager, being a typical manager, offers him a plethora of free things, including brushes and a brand new can of paint. the customer walks away with his free things (that i have to get for him) with the smuggiest ass look on his face.

story over, right? nope. i bring the can of paint to receiving, ZMA and hazmat it (since we can't sell it, it's fucking frozen and you can't paint with it). done deal im thinking, right?

not even close, bby. picture a hambeast of a woman. ok, maybe not that big, but she had a hard time fitting inside the reach truck sometimes. she is the department head of receiving. basically she sits in receiving on her computer waiting for trucks to arrive. 

now picture her carrying the frozen can of paint to the desk, except i actually had to see it happen. 

okay, okay, what the fuck is going on, im thinking. maybe i didnt mark it down correctly or something, maybe she'll show me how to hazmat it, i have no idea. im also in the middle of explaining to an older woman the different paint finishes we sell. 

nope, she has the nerve to tell me to just ""stick it in the paint shaker for a minute or two and see if we can try and sell it as OOPS paint."" at this point im all whatthefuck.jpeg, the paint is fucking frozen and shaking it won't help. i try to explain this to her but she would have none of it and walks away, and me, being the lowly, minimum wage paint associate that i am, do as she says. i stick it on the OOPS rack and continue my day.

the story ends when the department head of paint sees it on the OOPS rack, laughs, and takes it to receiving himself to hazmat it.

tl;dr - guy returns 3 year old can of frozen paint, manager gives him free shit, hambeast from receiving thinks that we can still sell it, paint department head saves the day.  ",i work at a home improvement store that sells paint (among other things),28,talesFromRetail

I worked in a a supermarket produce department for about 13 months.  But there was a guy who came in he'd wear a suit and gel his hair to make himself look important, but the only time id see him in my department was sampling my food or outright shoplifting. 
One of the things he'd do would come up to me and say something along the lines of
""Hey Champ, can you cut me a piece of this ""insert fruit here"" , ive heard this batch is extra juicy"" and then once hed taste it hed spit it out and say 
""Yuck thats disgusting, im glad i wasnt going to buy it"" and just storm off. He did this to me quite a few times and hed throw the skin or peel of it onto my displays and I was quite pissed off with all of it. 

He came in and and I recognised him. And the convorsation went as follows. 

Him: Hey Champ, do you mind if I try one of these Mandarins, they seem mighty delicious. 

Me: No you cant

Him: Why the hell not?

Me: Because its shoplifting, you have no intention of buying it, youve done this before you ask if you can try some and say its disgusting then walk off and all youre going to do is peel it, take one bite leave the the rest of the fruit and peel on my display and im not paid to clean up after you and its not a buffet either, what youre doing is taking stuff you havnt paid for, so its actually theft. So no you cant!

He stood there for about 6 seconds trying to think of something to say and all he could muster up was yelling:
Hey I use to work in a fruit store aswell, I know what its like, so deal with it!

And he just walked off, I kept an eye on him too, he didnt buy anything but just walked out the front of the store (giving me an evil eye) and then out the door to the carpark.

He did come back into the store a few days later, but I didnt see him in the produce department again while i was there ( I only did 3pm until Midnight, but he might have come in between 7am and 3pm or while someone else was on) but when I saw him ordering things from the deli hed give me a bitter stare but that was it.

One day, I have a guy come in with a bunch of stuff and some rain cheques. I take them from him and noticed that they're all photocopied. I look at them and notice they have a different store number on them. So, since I can't blatantly say ""I think you faked these"", I made up some policy on the spot. I told him that we couldn't take another stores rain cheques, how we had to have the matching piece of the rain cheque, and that our stores order inventory specifically to cover rain cheques.

A little back story. I actually PAY customers for metal. We are private and can choose what prices we pay for what material etc. We do not have any pricing criteria. The only thing we have to deal with really is the law which is one of the more annoying things. People who steal metal makes it tough for the honest guys who recycle.

I get several customers who come in every day or several times a week (we're open 6 days a week, 9 to 5). 80% of these customers are never ready. We require valid ID for every transaction and though I remember a good amount of people's names, some I don't. Those that know I ask for ID every time never had it ready. While they're standing in line why wouldn't they pull it out of their wallets instead of when they are at the front of the line? Or sign the receipt which is also required by law. I have to ask them EVERY SINGLE TIME. It's very frustrating. I go through the same thing every day and they never learn. I also get several customers who don't even speak English which is also frustrating. How can I ask you for things that are required by law when you don't speak my language?

Anyway, this next story was also from Barschmucks. If I didn't mention before, this was a franchise location inside of a large supermarket. We were technically employees of the supermarket even though we were real certified baristas. But this meant that many of our coworkers were cashiers and stock guys. One of the stock guys was Otis. He was a huuuuuge black dude who didn't converse much when he came by for his free cup of ice water but seemed like a pretty good guy.

I wasn't working when this happened, but my AST (Evan) told me about it. It's dead and he's just cleaning up waiting for the last few stragglers to wander in when Otis cruises up to the counter. Evan asks him what he'd like but Otis doesn't say anything and just stares at the menu. Evan goes back to cleaning while Otis contemplates the meaning of life. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Otis opening up the tea rack and fumbling for a tea bag (already this is a no-no, not only are we the only ones supposed to touch that tea, but we have to use tongs because it goes right in a customer's drink.) 

Evan doesn't have time to say anything before Otis lifts a bag to his nose and takes a deep whiff. 

He goes: ""What is this? Vanilla Rooibos? (He pronounced it ""roo-bis""; it's actually ""roy-bohs"".) Mmmmmmm. If a girl smell like dis, I'd lick her all *up* and down.""

Then, as quickly as he came, he put the tea back back, and left without saying a word. 

Evan dumped out all the Vanilla Rooibos and replaced it (not a big deal, nobody gets it anyway.)

**TL;DR:** Large man sexually assaults a tea bag in the middle of our store and left my coworker to clean up the mess.

j-sap,3,,5,1rigon,,17,"Some back story: I work the front desk at a gym a couple of days a week after class. We specialize in helping people with injuries and have a very specialized staff, program, and equipment. We are attached to an apartment complex that is spread out over a couple of buildings. The laundry for the complex is in the building adjacent to us. Now to use the laundry machines you are required to use a proprietary card that has to be purchased from a machine. I don't know what someone was smoking one day but instead of putting the machine that dispenses and allows people to add money to there card next to the laundry machines (even though there is plenty of room), someone decided to put the machine in the lobby of the gym. 

Where I work I have a very large window that overlooks the parking lot and see everyone who comes and goes and where people park. I had someone park or fly in the handicap spot (we'll call him Scumbag Steve or SS to keep things simple). SS jumps out of the car and runs full sprint into the lobby to add money onto his laundry card. After a minute or so I hear a knock on the window and we a quick interaction that goes like this:

SS: ""Hey yo man you got change for a $20?""

Now I absolutely do have the change for this guy in my drawer but if I used it then I would not have any for transaction at my desk.

Me: ""Sorry.""

SS: ""Yo man what about in your wallet, I know you can personally make me change?""

Now I am taken aback a little from this second question and am smart enough to never take out personal items around customers or even let them know where personal things are. I take a couple of seconds to think about everything and then respond.

Me: ""No I don't, but we have a great physical therapy program if you are interested.""

SS: ""Man why would I be interested in physical therapy, I am as fit as a horse?""

Me: ""Because you parked in a handicap spot and those spots are almost always full of clients.""

SS just sort of gave me a defeated look and slinked out the door and back to his car. He was back 20-30 minutes later and was good enough to not park in the handicap spot, instead he pulled up to the curb and made people walk around his vehicle.

adelajoy,0,,1,1ri8kg,,22,"I spent two years working at a big warehouse-style grocery store. I worked mostly as a cashier, but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a week.

Most of the crappy moments have all blurred together, but there are a few particular moments that stick out.

I realize this isn't the craziest story on here, but I will probably never forget this lady. 

Backstory: Our store had a policy that if an item scanned differently than the price tag, the customer would get it for free, up to $10. The mistake happened because the price tag didn't get changed, or was misplaced. If they spotted a problem, we would go look. If we found a tag in front of their item with the same code and a different price, we gave it to them and changed the tag. If the tag was for a different item, they didn't get anything. 

I was working the customer service desk, and a lady stormed up. I had several customers on the go at the moment, but it was pretty clear she *needed* help right away. As soon as I could, I asked what I could help her with. She was holding a bottle of toilet cleaner, her receipt and a price tag. Let's call her Crazy Customer, CC for short.

**CC**: ""I bought this bottle of toilet cleaner, but it was the wrong price! You guys are trying to charge me too much!""

**Me**: ""Okay, can I see your receipt?""

**CC**: *Hands me the receipt.* ""I tried to tell the cashier, but she didn't believe me!""

**Me**: *I checked who her cashier was, and it was one of our long-time girls. She knew the policy. There was no way she ""didn't believe"" the customer.* ""Okay, so the price came up $3.99, I'll just send a price-checker out to see what the tag said.""

**CC**: ""Oh, I grabbed the price tag already."" *She hands me the price tag. This lady is pretty worked up,  I'm not sure if she just wants to get out of the store, or if she's trying to pull one on me.*

A policy was that the tag had to be on the shelf. If a customer brings it to you, who's to say they didn't take it off the shelf last week and save it? They also could have found it in the wrong place, somewhere that the stock employees wouldn't have checked to fix the tag. As with most stores I've been to, store policy is to inform the customer about the relative store policies, and then see if you can help them anyways. No matter the problem.

It study the tag, and inform her of the policy, that the tag would have to be on the shelf. I start to let her know I can contact a manager, but she snatches the tag back and interrupts me.

**CC**: ""Well if that's your policy, I'll just put it back on the shelf! I was trying to save you some goddamn work, but I guess if you guys want to work extra, I'll just go put it back!""

She took off before I could say anything. I was just standing at the desk, aghast. I didn't even know what to say. 

The supervisor that was on shift was the scary kind. You know, the kind that isn't afraid to yell a little, handles the worst customers, and isn't phased when people call her names. Let's call her Jane. When the woman was gone, I grabbed Jane and told her the whole story. She said, ""Okay. When she comes back, let me know who she is. I'll handle her.""

As soon as I saw the customer coming back, I hissed, ""Jane! Jane! Jane! White hat! That's her."" I then ducked behind the display at customer service, and quite actually hid back there until the customer was gone. I could hear her yelling at Jane. I don't know what the verdict was. Any other manager, and the customer would have gotten the item for free, but it's hard to say with Jane.

I remember one of my coworkers came around the display and exclaimed my name. I hushed them, and told them I was hiding. I was so afraid the woman would see me and do one of those, ""Her! That's the one I was talking to! She told me this!"" And drag me back into it.

I've never hid from a customer before or since. Oh! Fun fact: The price tag she was holding said $3.29, a $0.70 difference from what she paid, and the tag was dated for the week before, which means it wasn't the current price. Not to say it wasn't still on the shelf, but there is a chance she did save it and bring it back in, especially with how worked up she was.

Dannythegirl,5,,6,1rh77t,,7,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this but I needed to share. Long time lurker of this subreddit. On my phone, sorry for wall. 
I am a customer in this story, but former multi-year service/retail employee.
Today, I was grocery shopping with my two very little children. Not a huge chain store, but prominent in my state for supporting local foods. Many locations. 
I got in line to check out after an eventful and frustrating trip around the store with the kids. There was an elderly man checking out ahead of me. He was friendly and talkative to my kids and was asking me about my tattoos while we were waiting. The cashier was probably 55, spacey, but very sweet woman. When it was old guys turn to check out, I overheard their conversation at the register, and it was obvious they were both long time veterans to the store. 
The man had some trouble checking out. He rang his credit card through the machine multiple times while chatting with the cashier and he seemed confused. Eventually, she explained that he didn't have to keep swiping his card, and that his transaction was complete. In the mean time, she was scanning my items. 
The cashier chatted up a storm with me too. Asking about my kids while I was trying to wrangle them. I was getting a little impatient at this point because my 1 and 3 year old were ready to get the hell out of there, but I listened to her stories with patience. She was kind too.
When she finished scanning my food I pulled my card out to run through the machine, but it was asking for a signature, when I hadn't scanned my card yet. 
Me: ""there must be a mistake, I haven't slid my card through but it's already asking for a signature""
Cashier: ""no, you did, you must have forgot"" -looks at screen- ""you swiped your America express""
Me: ""No, I don't have an Amex, see?.. Oh no did the man in front of me swipe his card while you were ringing me up?""
Cashier: ""uh oh, that must have been what happened""
She looked panicked, but printed the receipt and said ""I'll just do this"" AND SIGNED THE RECEIPT
Cashier: ""He'll be okay, he can be so spacey. Don't even worry about it""
She at first folded up the receipt like she was going to trash it but I asked her if that was really ok, and that I could wait for a manger. She unfolded the receipt and told me not to worry. There was a long line behind me and frankly I was ready to get the fuck out of there with my crazy kids. I asked her ""are you sure? I feel uncomfortable"" 
She told me not to worry, and to go ahead and leave. And I did. 
I think her career might have ended today.
TLDR; Elderly man in line ahead of me accidentally paid for my groceries, cashier eventually realized but didn't give a fuck to fix it. I got free groceries :/

EDIT/UPDATE: I can see how it looks like I was unsympathetic in my post. I was in fact, horrified. I know the groceries weren't free, I just did not pay for them. In my car, I wrote down the time, my total $78.43 and what I thought the mans total was before me $43, and the name of the cashier. I should have stuck around and put my foot down but I was flustered and unsure how to proceed.  I was planning on calling when I got home, and totally forgot about the whole thing until I was in bed redditing from my phone late at night.
This morning I called and spoke with a manager, giving him all of my information. I told him I would happily come back and pay for the groceries and to please make sure the man did not actually get charged (hoping the cashier took the issue to the manager after I left). He said he will look into the receipts from last night and give me a call back. I will update again when I hear from him.

On to the story:

One of my favorite cashier's (seriously, she's so sweet and helpful. I always drop what I'm doing to answer her questions because she's one of the three that I trust) calls me over for a price check on a set of plates. Customer says they were $29.99, but when I go check they're $49.99. She says that's fine and she pays for them. Done and over, right?

Wrong.

About ten minutes later she comes over to my podium. I already know she's getting coal from me in her stockings (merry Christmas bitch).

Her- ""I was just over there looking at the plates again. They were there just in the wrong spot.""

Me- ""I'm sorry ma'am, I'll let an associate know so he can fix it. I'm a little busy to get to it."" Which I was, I was getting five different change orders ready.

Her- ""Isn't it your job to fix it?""

Me- ""actually no it's not. I'm the front end manager. There are two managers who work in that area, it's actually their job technically. If I would've seen the plates,I would've put them in the right spot.""

Her- ""So you're just a lazy asshole.""

Ok, I'm done. I talk to everyone in a civil manner, but when they take that tone with me, I'm done.

Me- ""yep""

Her- ""You're not going to fix it?""

Me- ""Nope, too lazy right now.""

This was followed by more angry questions and statements until I walked away to deliver my change orders. She tracked an assistant manager down and let him have it about my attitude. He's a pretty cool guy, came up to me later, asked what the deal was and just laughed when I told him. Now he always asks if I'm lazy today when he sees me.

I think I just stood there looking at him for a moment. He had an Italian accent so I was thinking I may have misheard him, and asked for his order again. He held his hand out and insisted to see mine.

Now, this guy didn't look creepy or scary or anything. If so I would have just bolted. But I was 17 and put on the spot so I gave him my hand.

It was a pretty good job, and I got to have as much free soda as I wanted, since I was in the concessions booth. I had to set out prizes, read tickets to see how many points a kid had, tell them how much each prize was (They could mix and match), then calculate how many points they had left as they chose. They'd choose their prizes, I'd hand it to them, and they'd leave. 

I had a friend of mine with me for the first hour, and we split the customers when it got busy. (Around 5 people at the same time.) At one point I spilled my soda, and she handled the crowd as I cleaned up the mess.

Then she left. Oh god.

I was left to set out prizes for display, serve customers, and translate kid-speak by myself. At some points I was so swamped with customers that I could barely figure out the total points for each kid as they got prizes.

Another girl came it at low tide, but left before it got busy again. (Around twenty minutes.) I wasn't allowed to leave my station to try and find her, so I had to deal with all the customers alone. (She wasn't actually allowed to leave either, but she gave zero fucks. Bitch.)

Scott5114,0,,3,1riony,,13,"I've met a lot of strange customers in my time at the casino. This guy takes the cake as the most fucked-up, unpleasant guy that's ever darkened our doorstep. We'll call him Dick because he is one.

To begin with, Dick is in the casino for a fucked-up reason. He's dying of cancer, or some other terminal disease. He spends his last days in our casino trying to win an inheritance for his children. Of course, mathematics says it's not going to happen, so he's squandering what money he does have and the remainder of his life sitting in a smoky room with no natural light playing $25 per spin on a slot machine. 

I wouldn't judge him so harshly for that if he wasn't a colossal asshole. Pretty much everyone who has had to pay a jackpot for him has some sort of unpleasant experience to share. Mine was when I was processing a jackpot for him and I go to clear the jackpot message from the screen. See, if you win, say, $1500, and you had $80 in credit when you hit it, when the attendant clears the jackpot your $80 will still be left on the machine. People sometimes forget or don't know this, and will leave the money on the machine and walk away, so after clearing it most of us will say ""You still have $80 left on the machine."" Of course, when I mention this to Dick, he flies into a rage, screaming ""I CAN SEE THAT! GOD!"" I started dodging his jackpots when I knew where he was playing after that—I don't put up with that sort of BS—though I still had to pay him out a couple of times after that because I didn't realize who it was. 

And Dick did hit a lot of jackpots. He would usually destroy the copy of the W2-G tax forms we would give him, I guess thinking since he's dying he won't need to worry about paying taxes, though you would think he would realize his kids would be on the hook for all of it. He also had the tendency to swear ambiguously so you never really knew whether he was calling the machine or you a piece of shit. Management had talked to him a couple of times about treating the attendants better. He did tip the bare minimum to not be considered an ass in that department, at least.

All of that is backstory to properly put in context what happened this week. At this point, Dick's managed to piss off enough attendants that most of the shift is dodging his calls, so it takes him probably twice as long to get someone over there than it would anyone else. This, coupled with the fact that he's losing heavily, pisses him off. 

Management gets called over to a machine in my section. I'm generally pretty curious about these things, so I head over there. The machine's touchscreen (retail price quoted to me by a tech as $700 or so) is totally shattered. The machine still has $20 on it—with an inoperable touchscreen, there's no way to cash that out on this machine. There's a patron further down the bank who saw the whole thing. Said the guy was losing, got pissed, punched the screen, threw a piece of paper down, and stormed off. One of the managers that showed up picks up the paper.

It's a torn-up W2-G with Dick's name, address, and social security number on it. A little bit of searching in the computers turns up copies of his driver license and the hotel room he is in. And of course the whole incident is caught on tape.

We don't know what happened to Dick after that. Apparently it became the responsibility of the casino's assistant general manager, and she isn't talking. We're all watching the usual locations for ban notices to go up, though.",The worst casino patron in the world,16,talesFromRetail
GlowingBall,2,,2,1rioer,,16,"These are my Tales of Retail Loss Prevention....

Part Three – Citizen Snips (Aka - The Pants Aquatic)



As a recap for those of you who have never read one of my stories before – I am a male in the midwest who is on the wrong side of his twenties and works retail loss prevention for a major retailer (one of the 'Big 5').  I am underpaid for what I do but enjoy my job none the less.  A majority of my time is spent wandering the floor or watching middle aged moms shop for clothing far too skimpy on them via CCTV (closed circuit television or 'security cameras').  Every once in awhile I get a case that is just so mind blowingly 'WTF' that I have to share.  

This story opens up with me doing just as I said above – watching people on CCTV.  It is a blisteringly cold afternoon so the customers, far more content to stay in their warm homes and snuggled beneath their blankets, are few and far between.  I, as the ever watchful hawk of justice that I am, was busy playing a Marvel version of Candy Crush Saga.  My job provides me the liberty of slacking off a good amount and my boss is rather lenient as long as I continue to bring in a good amount of stops per month.  I am sitting there diligently trying to match up small colored tiles with one another when I am startled by a sudden ring – the phone is going off!  

Now the phone going off is common place.  We get tons of calls a day ranging from the frozen dairy department calling to tell us a temperature alarm is going off (we know...it goes off for us as well) to people asking us to deactivate a door alarm (we also know...we see you standing at the door).  This happened to be a call from one of the few places that doesn't call us often – the meat department.  The guy on the other end, a tall black man with more muscle than he knows what to do with, calls to tell us that there is a guy standing in front of the freshly butchered meat.  The guy has refused any help the meat employee has offered and continues to say he is 'just browsing' for over ten minutes.  This strikes me as rather odd.  Who just hangs out around the meat department?  I quickly devise a plan for the situation.  I tell the employee to walk into the back so I could see just what the person was going to do.  

The employee hangs up and walks over to the man to let him know he is going to be into the back and to ring the bell if he needs anything.  No sooner than when he had walked into the back but the man glanced around and then walked behind the counter.  My adrenaline already began to rush as my suspicions came to fruition – he was going to steal!  “Oh shit here we go, ” I declared, only to watch in confusion and frustration as he walked right past all the glass displays full of meat and right over to the lobster tank.  Now if you aren't familiar with these tanks they are exactly just what the name implies – a water filled tank full of live lobsters we sell by the pound.  Their claws are bound and they just kind of hang out crawling all over one another.  Kids love to sit there and watch them.

“No way...is he really going to...” I whispered as I watched on in awe.  Sure enough he reached right into the live lobster display tank we have.  After a moment of 'fishing around' he plucked the lobster he wanted from the tank and pulled it out of the water.  Before I could even make heads or tails of the situation he glanced around once more and shoved the lobster right down the front of his pants.  The guy, whom shall be hence forth called Lobster Johnson, then proceeded to shuffle run his way out of the meat department and through the grocery department towards the front of the store.  The only way I can really describe how he ran was a forward version of Zoidberg's shuffle.  All he was missing was yelping out “Woop woop woop woop!” loudly as he went.  

Needless to say he wasn't too hard to stop.  I may not be in the best shape of my life but I can still move quicker than a guy with a large lobster squirming around in his pants.  He didn't fight me at the door or even try to argue what he was doing.  After all, it is kind of hard to argue that you aren't stealing when you have a large, lobster shaped bulge in your pants.

Bonus icing on top of the cake: I usually ask the person why they are stealing.  It usually won't change anything but it fulfills my curiosity and keeps them talking which usually calms them down a bit.  This guy tried to say that he was stealing the lobster for his kids...

His kids have some expensive tastes.",Loss Prevention Tales Pt 3. - Citizen Snips,18,talesFromRetail
tankenka,5,,9,1rgfao,,0,"I work for a phallic retailer with lots of balls. (hehehe)

I decided to go get some water during my shift the other day so I headed towards our water fountain, which happens to be down a narrow hallway and is between the bathrooms and is opposite the hallway from our offices/breakroom area.  As I come around a corner in said hallway I almost bump into our Store Manager (SM from here on out) who is in the middle of cleaning the bathrooms.  SM and I start chatting and from the men's room I hear some loud noises.

""What the hell was that?"" I ask

""Damn kids screwing around."" SM replies as he sets down the bag of trash he had been holding and walks over to the men's room.

Now, SM isn't a particularly tall guy, but he lifts weights quite a bit and could very well be described as being jacked.  Somehow, from time to time, people think it is a good idea to fight him, so I stuck around in case he needed backup.

SM opens the men's room door hard, slamming it into the wall and bellows, ""What the HELL are you doing in my bathroom?""

--inaudible reply--

""Yeah, well it is a pretty sad day when I have to kick someone out of the bathroom, now get the hell out."" SM says at a slightly reduced volume.

""B..But my stomach hurts."" says a meek voice from inside the bathroom.

Then at a normal volume, but with a tone of voice that sounded like SM had ice in his veins he replies, ""Carry it somewhere else.""  Then he stared into the bathroom in a manner that was somewhat intense.

With that the teens walked out of the store with their heads hung in shame.

Princess_Honey_Bunny,114,,162,1rg853,,569,"BACKGROUND: I work at a mattress store. Selling(whatelse) mattresses. The law in North Carolina says that we cannot sell used mattresses. We follow this law strictly. To avoid angry customers being stuck with something they dont like, we offer a 'comfort guarantee' where you have 90days to decide you dont like it and come exchange it for something else. This comes with a fee of $200 as we have to throw the like new mattress out.  

STORY: In comes a guy. Hes visibly upset, all I can think is [""here we go""](http://i.imgur.com/8MmamRX.gif) lets call him Angry Asshat(AA)

AA: I hate my mattress! 

ME: Im so sorry to hear that sir woul-

(he cut me off)

AA: I want my money refunded immediately, and I want you to come get that shit off my property **Today**

ME: Im very sorry but we cant refund your money. 

AA: [WHAT?! WHAT DO YOU MEAN](http://i.imgur.com/HouBhTG.gif)

ME: Well sir its illegal in the state of North Carolina to take used mattresses and we cant take it back. 

AA: WELL I WANT IT THE FUCK BACK NOW I DONT RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE([he was just yelling nonsense at me about how this is whats wrong with the world and its all the dirty liberals fault](http://i.imgur.com/OudLd7s.gif))

ME: Sir, I cannot break the law for you. Not only is it the store policy its **the law**

Now hes raging, but Im trying to salvage the situation

ME: What we can do for you though is our 90 day comfort guarantee swap out. Can I have your name Ill look your ticket up and well see what we can do. 

He seems to calm down a little bit and he takes a seat across from my desk and he gives me hi name. I look up his name and pull up his ticket as Im explaining the comfort guarantee I look at his ticket. And then at the date he bought it(ya know to make sure its at least close to 90 days) I was willing to be flexible to make this guy happy when I notice he bought this mattress 9months ago!! Im flexible but not *that* flexible

ME: Uhh Sir, Im sorry to say this but you bought this mattress 9months ago, that 6months over the 90days. Theres nothing we can do for you. 

That when he became absolutely IRATE with me. Screaming something about how this is bad business practice, he deserves to get a refund, we owe it to him. Blah blah blah. [Im done this this shit](http://i.imgur.com/InDPcFn.gif)

ME: SIR. There is nothing we can do, the comfort exchange policy was explained to you when you bought it, if you didnt like the mattress you should have come back 6months ago, now Im going to have to ask you to leave the store. 

Well he didnt like that very much. He was becoming increasingly angry and hostile. Hes leaning over my desk pointing his finger right in my face([Which I hate](http://i.imgur.com/u77ThfE.gif)) but I keep my cool, and as sternly as I can say

ME: Sir if you dont leave immediately I will be forced to call the police and have you removed from my store. 

He paused for a moment with sheer rage in his eyes. Then he SLAPS!(yes slaps) the coffee on my desk across the 5mattresses that are close to my desk, gives me the finger and walkes out! I was in shock I composed myself quickly, called the police, and then my boss and explained everything that happened. 

I guess that asshat forgot that he gave us his address to deliver the mattress to, he ruined about 5beds which he was made to pay sticker price for on all of them(sticker price is close to $300 more than what we normally sell for) 


Although I was scared I made a great commission on all the beds he had to replace. There was justice that day and it was great.

jessajuhanabi,30,,94,1rhnqp,,397,"As of last Thursday, I am the head manager of a retail outlet and cafe, answering only to my boss, since the only girl above me quit. All people that walk in, call or email come through me. My boss is normally around but he works on coffee machines most days. 

As backgound for this story: His brother is a c*nt. I live in Australia, so that term seriously fits him. He owes a bunch of people money, is generally an asshole, and my boss is very sad his brother has changed so much. It stresses my boss out as their finances are tied due to a trust. 

Today, a lady walks in around 11:30, and walks up to the front desk. Politely, she asks me, ""Is (boss) in?""

In my mind, she was another person that he knew since he's been running this business for 20+ years, or a rep from some company that I didn't care about. He turned around to look at her, and I pointed in his direction. 

She immediately starts spouting about how boss's brother, we'll call him AH for asshole, owed her money. This is not a surprise to boss. He knows her. He's heard from her over email before. In which he told her he has no access to the trust and he's also fighting AH for money. 

This does not please the lady, henceforth known as douchecanoe. DC repeats over and over, despite pleas from my boss to chase down AH, ""I'm not leaving without my money. Get it for me.""

Now, DC wants a hefty sum. A couple thousand dollars. My boss offers her a coffee while he tries to reach AH. A water. A chair. Nothing. She stands in front of our stock and repeats herself over and over. ""Give me my money. Give me my money. I don't care its not my problem. YOU pay me.""

Why is she going after my boss? Because she's gone through the courts, they told AH to pay, and he still hasn't. Her response? Come into my store and stand there all day every day until HIS BROTHER, pays her. 

Now, my boss tries and tries to get her to understand he has no access to the money. No go. So instead she stands in our store, silent, for 4 fucking hours. Four. DC stands there so long my boss gets fed up and stressed, and leaves. 

The difference is, he's a peace keeper. I was itching for him to leave. I was just going to have the cops come eject her. I was EXCITED. 

Unfortunately she realized rather quickly I was not the ""nice cop"" type so she stood out the front, called in a few friends and intermittently yelled ""YOU KNOW THIS IS SO SILLY I JUST WANT MY MONEY FROM THE (BUSINESS)"" and ""I KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE IN XXXX SUBURB I COULD RUIN A BUSINESS IF I WANTED TO."" through the window at me. 

Oh god. You scare me so much. I might pee my pants. 

Anyway she eventually gave up and left without coming back inside, probably since I was watching her and smiling, willing her to come inside so I could call the cops. 

Oh well, another day I suppose! Maybe she'll be back tomorrow...

DolfyuttSrednaz,58,,48,1rh8hc,,200,"I have got to say, after working 4 years in retail, parents should be responsible for their children's actions. I have seen so many kids acting like demons that have just spawned from a dimension full of pointy sticks being shoved up their asses, but I never blame the kids. I usually don't even blame the parents, because kids are kids, but when customers blatantly let their kids run around like Sonic on meth, I blame the parents. that is why we have an announcement that plays every few minutes, reminding customers to keep their little shits in line. So when a customer like the one I had comes in, I usually inform my manager (who will be called Jared) of the situation and he watches the kid from a distance. 

A middle-aged couple stumbles into the store with their 7 year old son. They head off to furniture, but their son makes a bee-line to toys. I immediately call Jared, and let him know that this little tornado is heading to toys and he should try to contain the damage as much as possible. Before the kid makes it to toys, he stops over in the Halloween section and starts putting on masks and runs around the store trying to scare the other customers. After 4 complaints, Jared stops the kid, and drags him to his parents, who don't give one shit nor a giggle about what my manager has to say and wave him off. The kid bolts towards toys, and stars ripping toys down off the shelf. The floor looks like a miniature Antietam by the time he is finished. Now he has an armload of toys and decides to take them to the bathroom. Once in there, he places them on the floor, and proceeds to urinate on them. Jared walks in on him finishing up, and drags the kid back to his parents, leaving a trail of piss footprints behind him. Jared tells the parents what he did, and that they have to clean up the mess. This switches the parents into rage mode. They just cannot BELIEVE that their kid would do this! And he will be punished severely when they get home. Jared tells them calmly ""I am punishing you, not your child. You guys made no effort to control him, and even brushed me off after the first incident. You guys will clean up every mess he has made, and then you can leave. You are no longer welcomed here."" They start yelling profanities at him and their kid, saying how this is ridiculous and they shouldn't have to put up with this. 

After they cleaned up, they left empty handed. Jared received many compliments on how he handled the situation. It is the second worst customers I have ever had, even if I didn't directly deal with them. The worst, by far, has to be a couple out of towners. That is for another day though.

aturquoiseseashell,12,,25,1rg9do,,127,"End of shift at a famous, upscale department store, and I am already clocked out, with my purse on. I'm talking to my coworkers before I leave because I'm waiting on a ride home. I work in the lingerie department, which is near one of the 2nd story entrance doors to the store. 

A flustered woman comes up with three bags, one from Kate Spade, one from Michael Kors, and one from Tory Burch. She says she found the bags in the vestibule of the entrance to the store.
We thank her for her honesty and promise to call Loss Prevention to come and take the bags. She becomes agitated.

""Well I'm going to wait here and see that you do it,"" she snaps. She's suddenly riled up.

We're a bit taken aback, but continue to be polite to her and my coworker calls LP.

While my coworker waits on the phone to be connected to the security desk, I guess we kind of exchanged looks. (She was very antsy, and was holding onto the bags for dear life). The woman exclaims in outrage, ""Don't you all roll your eyes at me!"" 

""Ma'am,"" says my co-worker, ""No one is rolling their eyes. We're waiting for security to pick up the phone. They will make sure the bags are returned to the customer. Thank you very much for bringing them to our attention, we will see to it that they are returned to the customer."" 

The woman becomes more agitated and irritated. Finally, security picks up and my coworker says, ""A customer found some bags; one's from MK, one is from Tory Burch…""
The woman snaps, before my coworker is quite finished, ""And one from Kate Spade!!"" as though we purposely left that one out so we could steal it or something. 

""And one from Kate Spade,"" my co-worker adds. We're all getting kind of insulted by this woman's attitude. She seems convinced we're plotting to steal the bags, despite the fact that they remain in plain sight of the security camera. We're all well-dressed, well-spoken girls in our early twenties, and we are acting calm and polite. No apparent cause for suspicion.

Security says they can't help and to turn the bags into customer service, who coworker speaks to.
""Ma'am, please give me the bags. Customer service is coming to pick them up,"" my coworker says. We really want her to leave at this point. She's staring at us through narrowed eyes and she's breathing heavily.

""No!"" the woman shrieks, and clutches them to her chest. She tears frantically at one of them and finds a receipt. She begins dialing the number of Kate Spade. We're stunned.
""Please, ma'am…"" the coworker begins, but the woman literally shushes her and begins frantically reading the details of the receipt to the cashier at Kate Spade who is on the other end of the phone. 

She convinces an employee at Kate Spade to come to the dept. store to identify the bags.
Meanwhile, she announces that she will take the bags to customer service herself, in a very angry tone. ""You all are acting VERY suspicious!"" she declares, still clutching the bags to her breast almost maniacally. 

At this point, we're pretty alarmed by her behavior and beginning to wonder if she plans to steal the bags herself after seeing the prices on the receipt. My coworker calls the store manager, and we inform the customer that we would prefer that she remain in lingerie with the bags and wait for the manager. She loudly refuses to stay put. My coworker follows her to customer service.

From all the way in our department on the other end of the floor, we can hear the woman yelling. She had a quavery voice and a really strong British accent. 
Apparently, she got to customer service, and the couple who had left the bags was there. The woman refused to give them the bags without proof of their identity!! Finally the Kate Spade employee arrived and confirmed that yes, the bags belonged to the couple. 

I guess the woman was trying to do the right thing, but she insulted my coworkers and me and frightened various customers in the process. I still don't get why she became so suspicious or why she didn't just bring the bags to customer service in the first place.

KroipyBill,11,,40,1rhynu,,123,"After [writing about our cheering seasonal workers from Black Friday yesterday,](http://redd.it/1rf92j) it reminded me of this other story involving my goofy manager. 

When I first started working for this place, I came in clean shaven, and patchy hair. I was in denial that mother nature was closing my hair follicles for business, and it wasn't until after my engagement photos I decided to make a change. I shaved my head and have kept it that way ever since. I then grew a goatee to compensate for my loss. Honestly I looked much sharper than having the grassy field of hair you can see the horizon through. It was a relief to embrace it, and feel like I looked decent again. There was one manager who enjoyed messing with me however. In fact in my previous stories, I've quoted him several times in our conversations, since he was my favorite manager to talk to, and the biggest goof ball there. He vowed he would draw on my head when I wasn't ready for it. 

**Me:** Dude I'm taller than you. So unless you parachute from the rafters onto my cranium with your sharpie, you will not succeed. 

**Manager:** We'll see...we'll...see...

At that moment I wondered if he really was contemplating that attack strategy. At least he left it at just contemplating. 

One day, we were pretty busy. It was pre-holiday, post-black Friday days. I'm sure you all know the type. Everybody is getting geared up for Christmas. I found my way over to the computer department helping a customer decide what Mac they wanted. I was describing the hardware specs, how it works with their Apple products etc. During this I felt I was going to make a decent sale. However I made a massive mistake...

*I sat down.* 

Yes I slipped up big time. My manager saw this opportunity from what it seemed immediately. He walked over and distracted me by having another employee ask me a question. 

**Employee:** Hey KroipyBill you know where I can find [some bullcrap item that he knew the answer to.]

**Me:** Yeah sure. Remember they're eh...ahh...AHH!!!

Right then, my manager walks up to me with his pen, and I felt the coldness of the ballpoint touch my head, while it was dragged across my chrome dome. My entire body froze as if somebody stiffed my spine. I made a weird breathing noise, like I was experiencing sharp pains when it was just mainly a very tiny cold piece of metal on my head. Kind of like EAHH!! EAHH!! EAHH!!! (That's the best I can do textually.) They were quiet, sharp noises.

He walked off, cackling like the joker. I looked at my customer with this super surprised look on my face. He lost his crap, and just laughed. Because of this I sold him more attachments, but that's beside the point. 

Over the radio:

**Me:** The person who drew on my head. You know who you are. Thanks for helping my sale out by doodling with a ballpoint pen on my cranium. 

I looked around the store and saw those with a radio express such confusion. I'm a pretty tall dude, so for those who were in eye sight, I bent my head down so they could see the graffiti my manager brought forth upon my person. Much laughter followed, including my manager.

**Manager:** You said I would never get you. 

**Me:** Well bucket head, you're lucky I was sitting so your midget self could strike me. 

**Manager:** My strike is now complete. 

**Me:** It's a good thing I don't just go over there and rub my greasy head all over your face. I'm glad you feel all militaristic about your approach. 

**Manager:** Oh...this would be a much more fun Call of Duty game if this were part of the game play. 

I never got him back. And he has since left the store after I left. Despite us still being good friends, he's still a bucket head.

Minja78,35,,16,1rgqvv,,81,"Preface, I sell cars in the Pacific Northwest.  This story occurred back in October.   
    
It was a beautiful sunny day, which is not common in these parts from oh...October to May.    
    
A very proper looking lady walks up and asks for a salesmen that is off.  Lets call her Uber bitch (UB).  
    
Me, ""He's off today, is there something I can help you with?"" 
       
UB, ""I'm not sure your capable, 'L' was very knowledgeable.""  
       
Her tone was very matter of fact and frankly bitchy.     
     
Me, ""Lets do it this way, I'll help you to the best of my ability and if you're not satisfied you can come back and see 'L' when he gets back.""     
    
UB sighed and said, ""I suppose that will do. Tell me about your most advanced car.""     
    
Me, ""Advanced how?""     
   
UB, ""Technologically.""    
    
Me, ""That's a pretty broad spectrum, lets start with what kind of car do you want?  Like an SUV or Sedan.""      
       
UB, ""I don't see why this matters.""     
    
Me, ""I'm just trying to help you to the best of my ability.""    
    
UB, ""Well that clearly lacking.""      
    
Me, ""Apparently. I have an idea though lets go look at the new Avalon, they just had a fresh rebuild this year so I would say the have the most gadgets and cool technology in them.""     
    
UB, ""That's a start show me the way.""      
    
At this point I realized that I'm dealing with some sort of royalty by the way she's talking to me and looking at me like I was clearly beneath her.    
    
We walked out side and toward the Avalon's and as we rounded the corner I was blinded by the light of 1 sun (that mutha fucker is bright when we only see it a few times a year) so I do what I thought was natural, I put on my sun glasses. You'd think I killed her 2nd born spawn.    
        
UB stopped in her tracks and said, ""Excuse me, how long have you been in sales.""     
    
Me, ""About 15 years now, why do you ask?""    
    
UB, ""How dare you put your sunglasses on in front of a customer. You should know better.""    
    
At this point I'm done with her attitude. She can; buy a car, sell a car, die in fire for all that I'm concerned.    
    
Me, ""While were walking into the direct sunlight I'm keeping them on, once we get into a car I'll make sure to take them off so you can see my pretty greens again.""     
     
The look and sound of disgust from her should of withered some near by plants.     
    
UB, "" I don't want to look at the Avalon unless it has what I want on it.""      
        
I acted all surprised and said, ""Ahhh in that case thus far all you've told me is that you want technology on it. Every car on my lot has technology, how about you fill in the blanks for me and I'll get you what you need.""   I finished that last part with a touch of sarcasm.
    
UB, "" You don't have to take that tone with me.""     
    
I just started at her until she finally answered my question.    
   
UB, ""I want....""  Imagine everything every car in every scfi movie has done (some highlights: Voice activated everything, self driving, self maintaining, color changing, all electric or non-gas, The list goes on)     

Me, ""Mam for me to get you even a small percentage of these option I would need a time machine, what you asking for simply does not exist.""     
    
UB, "" You never tell a customer you can't get something for them it's improper sales.""    
    
Me, ""What's your thoughts on a Prius that parks for you, stops for you in emergencies and has rain sensing wipers?""    
    
UB let here vileness spew out of her and she said, ""That's all been out for years I don't want dated technology.""    
   
Me, ""What your asking for doesn't exist, I think the closest you'll come is the new Tesla but I can't think of anything in the mainstream car world that's even close to half of your list.""     
   
UB, ""You are an awful salesman then.""

Maloth_Warblade,6,,17,1rhx0y,,94,"Black Friday, 2011. Big, blue, zombie-filled box store. I was a photo tech.

It's been almost 2 years now, as I no longer work for retail. I did my 5 years with it and I'm done.

I'm glad I'm out, too. I don't hate people, I just learned that I hate being treated like less than crap, filth, and told I'm worthless on a daily basis. But this one was so irritating I spoke up.

I worked 2 stores on Black Friday in 2011, both the BBS and the famous game store. I was basically at work from Noon-8 on Thanksgiving at the BBS, missing all family gatherings, by the way, and then 11:30pm-7am at the games store (I was the only cashier by the way, in the most populated area of the county/city), and then 12-8 again on Black Friday at the BBS. 

I was tired, beyond tired, essentially 20hrs of work, on my feet with no breaks for food or bathroom due to chaos. The BBS frequently refused to give me my lunches until I was mandatorily locked out, and even then they simply made me work anyway (even got reported for going over 8 hrs without a break, wasn't given a choice).

 Needless to say, by the time 5pm rolled around, and not having eaten but a pop tart in 24hrs, I was having a sugar crash. These make you lightheaded, these make it hard to think and respond quickly. I was working my ass off to get greeting cards printed, packaged, priced and all the while walking everyone through how to use our touch-screen computers and simple tasks. 

One customer didn't like that I wasn't answering fast enough. Of course she didn't, it's Black Friday, and that I was being far too rude for her. She told me she didn't like how tired I was, that I shouldn't work at all if I was so tired. How worthless I was to be there, on the busiest day of the year, if I couldn't be bothered to be awake. 

At this point I interrupted her. I told her ""Lady, listen. I don't need this from you, not today. Not the day people die from customers entitlement. No. I've been working since pretty much Noon yesterday. I had to miss my family's Thanksgiving, again, and not only that, I couldn't even EAT any food yet. There's no time. I'm beyond having a sugar crash, I'm hungry, and beyond normal tired. If you're going to sit there and belittle me over this, you can just get out of my face and leave this place"" (or something VERY close to this, been a few years).

Of course I got loud to say this, and everyone looked at her. Associates, customers, even her husband. She tried apologizing, I kept interrupting her asking what else she needed, and she kept trying to change subjects..I wouldn't let her. She was the last straw I needed that day, and I wasn't having it.

Good news though, wasn't reported, wasn't written up. Had a very nice and thoughtful customer buy me a bag of chips and a soda after seeing me be berated by not only her but other customers. Made it home and promptly slept for 15 hours.

adelajoy,15,,15,1rg29x,,73,"I spent two years working at a big warehouse-style grocery store. I worked mostly as a cashier, but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a week.

Most of the crappy moments have all blurred together, but there are a few particular moments that stick out.

This grocery store is the only one in the area that doesn't bag your groceries for you. Each till has two long conveyor belts to hold your groceries while you bag them (Both the customer and the cashier have buttons to move the groceries down, away from the till). This speeds orders up, requires less staff, saves money and drops prices. People occasionally complain about it, but if they want to pay more for their groceries and have someone else bag them, they're welcome to. ... The store isn't exactly famous for customer service, but I think the prices make up for this.

I was one of the fastest cashiers on staff at the time. This meant that my belts would often get full. I had ways to deal with this. I knew how fast people packed, I knew how soon a belt would clear. I was really good at my job. One day, the lines were insanely long, I was working really fast, everyone was buying a lot. I got to a point that there were groceries on both of my belts, so I squeezed the smaller order down a little, watched for a moment, and knew that he would be down before the next order crowded him. I started scanning the next order, and smiled at the customers - a man and his very pregnant wife.

The wife snapped at me, ""Can you just wait!""

""Excuse me?""

""Can you wait? I don't want you to crowd out that other guy!""

I looked, and he was literally loading his last bag with groceries. I stopped scanning anyways, and maybe glared at the lady. I don't really like it when other people tell me how to do my job.

Eventually he was packed and gone, so I started scanning again. While I had been waiting, I had lined all of their canned goods up. I can scan cans super fast if they're all really close. I started scanning the canned goods, grabbing a can, tossing it to my other hand, and setting it on the other belt. Except that this woman had walked around (The belt she got was behind me) and was standing behind me, trying to bag the cans as I scanned them. I'm sorry, but I'm not actually looking where the cans go. I know the space, and I need to watch the computer screen, not my hands. Well, she kept trying to grab the one I'd just set down, which meant that I kept hitting her hand with the next can. I wasn't by any means throwing the cans, but I was moving quickly and she was in my space, so she was getting hit. I didn't actually realize that I was hitting her until she complained to her husband. So I slowed down, apologized, and moved on to her other groceries.

She then had a bag of apples. She had grabbed one of our bags and put three different apples in it, and tied it shut. I have to weigh each type of fruit separately, so I opened the bag, weighed the first apple, set it aside. I noticed her husband grabbed the apple right away. I weighed the second apple, and set it aside. He grabbed that one too. When I weighed the third, my plan had been to put all three back in the bag and tie it shut, but the other two apples were gone. I tied the bag around the last one and set it on the belt. If the husband wanted to pack the apples separately, he was welcome to.

The couple also bought about half a dozen little bags of frozen perogies. One of the bags had been ripped all the open, right down the middle, and frozen perogies were laying all over the belt. I considered not telling them, because I was mad, but I took a deep breath, rounded up all of the stray perogies, put them in a plastic bag, and informed the lady. I asked her if she would like me to send for a new bag. She snippily replied ""Yes"" as if I should have just known. Some people don't bother to get a new bag because it can hold up the line, so I always ask. Our runner quickly returned with an identical bag and I kept going.

When I finally finished (They bought *a lot* of stuff), the husband paid, while the wife stormed over to customer service. I watched as she talked to my supervisor, and eventually a store manager. I was getting pretty nervous. Oh, also I should mention this woman was rude and snapped every time I asked her a question. I was pretty angry by the time they left.

After they were completely done, my supervisor closed my till and asked to speak to me at customer service.

She said the lady had filed a formal complaint against me. Apparently the conversation went something like this:

**Pregnant Lady**: ""I want to complain about the cashier on till 9!""

**Nice Supervisor**: ""Till 9? Do you mean till 8?"" (I was on 9 - one of my quick-to-anger coworkers was on 8)

**PL**: ""No, I mean 9!""

**NS**: ""Like the girl with brown hair, *not* the blonde?""

**PL**: (getting frustrated) ""Yes!""

**NS**: ""So what did adelajoy do?""

**PL**: ""She was rude and short with me!""

**NS**: ""Adelajoy? Are you sure?""

**PL**: ""Yes! She also threw canned goods at me, *ripped* open a bag of perogies, scattered them *everywhere* and scattered all of my apples too! She also bruised all of my fruit because she was throwing them around!""

A store manager was brought down to take a formal complaint, which means it probably went in my employee file. The lady was calmed down and left, and that was the end of it. Typically, the store managers will meet with you to discuss complaints, and make sure they won't happen again. The fact that I didn't means either the manager simply didn't believe the woman, or wasn't concerned because it was my first (and only). The supervisor who helped her said she closed my till because I looked upset and she thought I needed a break. The only reason she told me was to find out what really happened. I told her my side, and she just laughed it off. I admitted to being short and snippy, but the rest was just ludicrous. I still cannot beleive she blamed me for the bag of perogies being ripped open, considering I told her about them, got a new bag, and spent a minute or two picking up all of the perogies. Also, why would I take the time to do that, when I was clearly rushed with everything else?

I get that pregnant women have a lot of hormones, and tend to be angry, short-tempered, whatnot, but I think there's a line. Also, the fact that her husband didn't stop her, stand up for me, or admit to grabbing all the apples kind of pissed me off.

Tl;dr: Crazy-hormones pregnant lady complained about me, but the supervisor didn't believe her.","In my spare time, I like to rip open your groceries and scatter them",88,talesFromRetail
unidentifiableblarg,12,,9,1rhfwt,,65,"**Back story:** I worked in a small convenience store in a town on the outskirts of a city. A lot of the customer's are regulars and have been coming here for years, decades even.

About 6 years ago the place changed hands, names and management too. Still provided the same sort of stuff though, so the locals kept calling it by it's old name. 

This is relevant, I swear.



**The story:** I'm serving on the registers at the front of the store, just doin ma biz, when a flustered woman comes up to the counter demanding my attention. I tell her I'll be with her as soon as I finish processing my currant customer.

This somehow seemed to offended her, so I was already off to a bad start. But I get to her and try to smooth things over with my best customer service voice (you know the one).

After a bit of just listening to her complaining and bitching in general she finally gets to the point.

""I bought this product here earlier and you (not me) charged me the wrong price! It's on special, why is it wrong blah blah blah""

The outrage was dripping off her.

Now, normally I'd be prepared to fix this, sometimes we just straight up get it wrong and stuff isn't the right price.

*But*, while she's ranting she's waving around a catalogue, that contains the magical special that we failed to give her.

Eventually she shoves it in my face to accent a point, and shows me what it should have been.

The catalogue wasn't for our store, we don't even sell the brand (ice cream, I think it was) that she seemed to have thought she purchased.

I politely explain that we're not an [old store] any more and that was why she didn't get the discount. But I'd be happy t...

Her: What?! I've lived her FOR YEARS and it's always been [old store]. You've got to be kidding me.

I point out the signs (they're everywhere) and shirts of the employees and explain that we've been [new store] for quite a while.

She persists though, demanding to get her discount because it's ""always been that way and why should I get screwed for what you did..."" just generally giving me a hard time; that kind of bullshit.

The managers will usually give the discount to them anyway, just to keep them happy, but I was sick of getting abused by people who apparently can't read and wasn't about to let this one fly. Pety, I know.

Eventually I get to the point where I'm just repeating myself and she's adamantly refusing to be 'robbed' of forty cents. So I call my manager to come up.

By this stage I'm sick of her shit and just want her to leave, customers are waiting to be served and I'm meant to be serving. Small store, small number of staff.

Finally my duty manager meanders up and he immediately grovels at her feet, begging her forgiveness and taking her to a spare register to sort out her problem. 


I'm not bitter (lies), but the smug grin she threw me on her way out made me really wish that our management stood up for us, at least sometimes.

And that I had a crowbar handy.

CommandoDerp,9,,17,1rhsfa,,62,"First off, I would like to say that I had two days off before this incident so I was unaware of any changes at work.

So I was at work after two days off when I was serving an elderly man, who was a regular, cigarettes. He asked for a particular brand in a carton of twin packs. I tell him unfortunately that the twin packs are classified as cartons themselves, and you cannot purchase a carton of a carton. He rolled his eyes and asked for 4 individual twin packs.

I immediately check the cupboard nearby of said twin packs of cigarettes that he wanted and I inform him that we are all sold out. This is the conversation that follows:

Him: ""Are you serious?""
Me: ""Yes, sorry. We are unfortunately all sold out until we get some more.""
Him: ""This is pathetic!""
Me: ""Would you like another flavor?""
He mumbles something to me which I repeat my previous question.
Me: ""Would you like another flavor?""
Him: ""No. This unacceptable. You are refusing sale""
Me: ""Is there anything else I can help you with as we don't seem to have what you are after?""
Him: ""I would like to speak to your manager.""
Me: ""Actually there might be some here""

I had a thought and I turned around and checked the display rack to see if there are any more in the display. To which I found 4 individual twin packs sitting there, I felt like an idiot not checking there first.

Me: ""I didn't realize that there was any in the display, I...""
Him: ""Your very lucky""
Me: ""I'm very sorry I did not check there first. I recently had two days off and I wasn't informed that what you were after was in the display. I'm sorry for any unconvinced""

He just sighs loudly and rolls his eyes and tells me one last thing while paying for his cigarettes.

Him: ""Your very lucky you found them or otherwise you would have lost hundreds and hundreds of dollars in sales and quite a few hundred customers because of your poor service.""

Payment is finished and I tell him I'm sorry again and to enjoy his night. He storms back into the store and complains to another staff member who was not in charge for the night.

The man left and the employee approached me asking what happened. I told them and they said not to worry, they knew it wasn't on purpose. The actual supervisor for the night approached me and asked what happened, they knew it wasn't intentional so they didn't seem too phased by it; even though I was the back up person in charge that night.","I don't know how to feel after my ""complaint""?",79,talesFromRetail
Drunken_Black_Belt,7,,8,1rhw8z,,59,"I'm back bitches!  About 2 months ago, I got a second job working part time at a men's Big &amp;Tall store.  The hours are easy, commision is alright, and to be honest, the customers are generally friendly and awesome.  It helps that a lot of them don't have anywhere else to shop. Unfortunantly the store isn't as eventul as my past retail jobs.  Its just selling clothes and shoes.  But I've gotten a few funny stories that I'll share over time here. And with the holiday's coming up, i'm sure I'll have plenty more.  

Welll, for your pleasure (hopefully), I present **Boy, Are My Feet Sore!**

**WARNING: GROSS!**

So recently I began working in a men's store for Big &amp; Tall sizes.  I knew of it because I buy my shoes there.  Only store that carries a size 15/16.  I am too small for the clothes, despite being 6'4 and slightly overweight.  And if I'm being honest,  seeing some of the people who come in makes me more motivated to keep losing weight (50 lbs this year alone).  

Now, don't get me wrong, SOME of the people have legitimate health concerns.  One gentleman was born with his left foot backwards.  During his childhood they would constantly have to break his foot, set it slightly closer to the proper position, let it heal, and repeat. But it never set 100% correct, keeping him from being able to run or exercise, or even stand for long periods of time.  It's guys like him I feel for.  Given a shitty deal in life and just having to suffer for it. 

Most customers, however, are just plain old fat guys.  I don't want to sound mean, or ""fat shame"".  But it's just poor lifestyle choices and such.  I was there.  I was 5lbs shy of 300 last new years.  And it was just being lazy and making bad choices.  I don't have as much sympathy for these guys.  And that brings us to our story today.

It's a sunny fall day.  It's midweek, and pretty dead.  I'm in my suit, fixing clothes, putzing around, pretty much just pretending to work.  I hear the door chime, and in walks an older couple.  Probably late 60's, very early 70's.  The lady was using a walker to move around, and the gentleman was resting his weight on a cane as he slowly moved with her.  They seemed like a nice enough couple, but as you know, those are the ones who always turn into assholes.

I introduced myself, asked how I could help them that day.  The man gruffly replied ""shoes"".  I brought them to the shoe department.  Now my store is small, and there is only one small bench to sit on, and it's in the shoe department.  Naturally, this oaf takes the seat, leaving his frail wife to stand.  I could tell she was having difficulty, being particularly petire and frail, so I went in the back and got her a folding chair to sit in next to her husband.  She thanked me, because manners.  The man, charming fellow that he was, just said ""can you get me some shoes now?"".  

It was about this time that I realized this was going to go south faster than a my ex g/f in a dick sucking contest.

I offered several suggestions, as the gentleman didn't seem to know what kind of shoes he wanted.  The man complained that most of our shoes don't even fit him. I expressed sympathy, as I have large feet and can only fit into the largest size available in store.  The man looked me up and down and sneered ""Well, you just have big feet. I have a health condition that causes this, so consider yourself lucky"".  

Eventually we found a pair he liked and thought may just fit his feet.  And that's when the real horror of this story starts.  The man then proceeds to roll up his sweatpants.  He was wearing ankle socks and sandals.  His feet are hugely swollen, and covered in open sores.  This guy has diabetes, and it's eating away at his foot.  Sadly it's fairly common where I work.  What came next, however, is not.

I hand him the shoes, and take a step back, giving him some space to put the shoes on, look at them in the mirror, see how they feel, etc.  

NOPE!  

He looks at me like an idiot and says ""Well I can't put them on myself.  I can't bend that far.  Put them on for me"".   

Now I am no fan of feet, even on a good day.  Sure if I'm dating someone, and they want a footrub, and their feet are clean, then i'll oblige.  But other than that, I just want nothing to do with that area of the body.  Add to the fact that we are talking about a stranger whose foot is literally covered in open, oozing sores.  

DBB: Sir I just can't do that, I'm sorry.

Man:  You need to help me.  I'm a customer and I need service.

DBB: There is no way I am doing that sir.  I am sorry but you have open sores on your foot and leg. It's unsanitary for both me and YOU, to have me do that.

Man: Oh just wash your hands after it'll be fine.

How this man survived 70 or so years with logic like that, will forever amaze me.  

DBB: Absolutely not.  

Man: I want the manger!  I'll have your ass for discrimination and harrassment

DBB:  I am the manager.  If you want the store manager call back tomorrow.  If you want corporate's phone number I'll give it with my name gladly.  


The man continued to yell and scream about receiving the shoes at a discount and having me fired.  Typical stuff for anyone who works in retail really.  I essentially told him that I wasn't going to touch his feet, and if he didn't like the service he could leave. Wife is trying to keep the peace.  It's not very effective.  Husband used Rage!  It's inneffective against DBB!  Besides my DEF is to high.  

Anyways, i wish there was some more to this.  Eventually he stormed out as dramatically as one can when you can barely walk under your own weight, and your wife is frail and moves about as fast a christian school girl with a chastity belt.  I did hear from corporate the next day though.  Naturally some of the details were changed when he called in, but once I explained about the sores, I receieve a ""Yea that happens all the time. Don't worry about it"".  

Sorry if it's not very exciting.  I'm sure I'll have some good ones coming up.  Hope you all are surviving the holidays!

Turns out, the woman was making a sizeable purchase and couldn't supply an adequate form of ID. I explained to her that we simply couldn't process her credit card without proper identification. She dug through her purse and tossed a bottle of birth control pills on the counter and was like ""Will this bottle work? No one can have these pills but me"" No ma'am ... birth control pills are not a form of identification. She then threw a world class tantrum using colorful language that would even make a seasoned sailor blush.

At that point, I let her know she was no longer welcomed at any of the locations in our state. She wanted my DM's info and I was like you're looking at her but if you'd like to talk to my Regional, I'll dial the number for you. She left at that point.

I was working in the jewelry department of a department/grocery store at the time. I'd been in that same department for 2 years by the time this incident took place. It was very early on a Saturday, before the rush, and a lady comes up to my counter to do a return. No problemo, I thought.

Me: I can do that return for you. Can I see your receipt ma'am?

Customer: I don't have it anymore. 

Me: I'll only be able to refund it to a gift card then, is that ok?

Customer: yeah, that's fine. 

One hurdle jumped. She hands me the item and I notice that it is in a package I have never seen before. I know my department like the back of my hand cause I'm the one that checks in -all- of the merchandise. Every item that has gone into the department in the last two years had to pass by me first. 

Me: ma'am are you sure you bought this here? I don't recognize this package. 

Customer, suddenly angry: of course I bought it here. (Spoiler, this a lie)

Me: ok, let me see if the system recognizes it. 

I scan the item at the register and I get an error. I look at the barcode and it's half as long as it needs to be (6 characters instead of 12, which is the store norm). 

Me: ma'am my register does not recognize this item. 

Customer: I bought it here!

Me, getting cranky at this point: are you -sure-? I've been in the department for two years and I've never seen this package before. Are you certain you didn't buy this at [dept store x] or [dept store y]?

Customer: I'm certain. I'm returning this for a friend and she bought it here! (Told ya)

Me: I'm sorry but I can't take an Item that doesn't even come up in the system. Especially if you don't have a receipt. 

Customer snatches the item from me and pulls her cell phone out: I am going to call her (the friend) and prove to you that it was bought here!! (She's nearly screaming at this point)

The customer walks away and makes her call. I watch her patiently from the counter and wait for her to return. She finally gets her friend on the line but is far enough away that I can't hear her. She's visibly pissed off and ranting to her friend. There's a short pause as she listens to her friend. Her demeanor changes completely. She looks at me once, turns, and walks out the door, presumably to return the item at the place it was bought from. ",Just discovered this sub today.

ScaldingSoup,5,,6,1rha57,,26,"So several  years ago I worked for a very popular lingerie store.  This store didn't pay commission, but would give us more or less hours per week based on sales performance.  My sales performance was VERY good.  I got more hours a week than most people.  

During the holiday season, we had a lot of seasonal employees, as any big retail store normally does.  One of the workers hired seasonally was this lady who was a lot older than the rest of us.  This was not the problem.  Her hair was bleached blonde, and growing out (showing obvious roots), and styled in a ""feathered"" fashion.  She did not know how to wear make-up and what she wore did not flatter her.  In this store our dress code was all black.   She wore skirts with no stockings, but with slouch socks and yeah, that was a hot mess.  

People began to call her the ""missing link"", as in to the 1980s because of the hair and her wearing slouch socks that were probably black in the 1980s but grey now.  Reading this, you may think that I judged her based on this, or have some animosity for people older than me.  I do not, but this just sort of describes what she looked like because it is important.  Black Friday rolls around, and she wears her normal dress of skirt, slouch socks and what-not.  Surrounding her socks are these bells that jingle..  

She begins waving panties in the air, helicopter style, like a stripper, chanting what the sale is as customers are passing by.  One of our gay male managers passes me by and mutters so only I can hear it ""I want her out"".  I was dying trying not to laugh at the situation, and meanwhile feeling very embarrassed for her.  Everywhere she walked, she jingled.

Some time during her short career with the lingerie store, she found my phone number on the schedule.  I guess they weren't giving her enough hours, because she had the nerve to leave me a message asking me for some of mine.

BlankName55,14,,6,1rgvl7,,23,"**Background**: I work for the spark store at a mega sized location. It's a regular location with a grocery store on one side and a nursery, essentially, on the other. I work in the party/craft/office section, although I've done everything and anything, from service desk to the truck to the phones (no, I believe you want the health clinic down the street, ma'am).

**Story (er, stories)**: 

1) I walk by the front door. Man approached with wife, stopped and said Excuse Me? Fine. I go over, and he started counting out a huge wad of cash. He counts $100 in small bills out, gives it to me, then says, ""Now, I want a propane tank, honey..."" 

He got the manager who resembles an NFL player instead. (Yes, I gave him the money back.)

2) Two young guys came through the checkout line with four carts of Head &amp; Shoulders, Dove bars, and some razors, I forgot the brand. This is ***-mart, it's cheap, and that's what matters. Three products. They racked up $1800 in this stuff. The one guy then pulled out of his pocket a pile of coupons that was quite literally a foot high. Mind already blown, I said half-jokingly, ""Those aren't all for me, are they?""

Yes. Yes they were. $1500 in coupons, $3 at a time. Do the math. And you couldn't do coupon repeats. Due to the volume, the *CSM thing came up halfway through, and I said ""Oh, the supervisor's going to have to turn the key..."" and they were all ""Ok, cool.""

So they hand over the remaining $300 cash (and people pay 500-600 all the time-that was normal) and the supervisor sees the key message on the palm pilot. I had every CSM (three on duty), the front end supervisor, two assistant managers, and every loss prevention person in the building (three-two associates &amp; the manager) at the register in what seemed like two seconds. 

The guy who'd had the coupons recognized the front end supervisor. He (coupon guy) went off and started going into it with the supervisor. The friend stands there numb, all the managers start talking at me, a CSM sticks the key in to abort this transaction, and I'm standing here holding $300 cash and a hell's lot of coupons. 

Then:
The customer let out a primal yell, the supervisor took the coupons from me, stuck them in the guy's hand, and wished him a good day-anywhere else. 

Turns out they were known scammers. The coupons would scan, but we can't get money back for them. I knew something was up, but I didn't know the back story. I just was asking myself over and over after this: If it had all gone through, and they'd walked out with $1800 of soap and shampoo, what the hell were they going to do with it all? Sell it at less than cost? Fill a swimming pool? Get ridiculously clean?

Well, because the star of this story is my son but, after reading all the posts about awful parents/kids, I wanted to share a funny story about a good kid and parents who are trying their best.

This story happened when my son was 4.  It takes place in the store where I work.  I wasn't there at the time.  My son, I'll call him Cee, was browsing the toy department with his dad while they were waiting for me to finish my shift.  

While Cee and his dad are looking at the toys, a woman with two children comes into the aisle they are in.  The older of the two, who is about the same age as Cee, sees something she wants and asks her mom for it.  Mom says no.  The little girl begs and pleads but mom holds firm and keeps telling her no.  Then the girl pulls out all the stops and throws herself on the floor, kicking and screaming, in a full blown tantrum.

Cee watches for a few seconds and then walks over to the girl.  He kneels in front of her and says:  ""Well, if you act like that, you really won't get anything.""  And then he walked back to his dad.  

Cee's dad was trying hard not to laugh but the woman didn't find it so funny.  She looked embarrassed and angry.  She grabbed her kids and stormed off.

copisreallybad,4,,6,1rhulb,,22,"a few days ago, i get called down to the returns desk from the paint desk. the return policy for the chain i work at is very lenient, but we aren't supposed to take mixed paint back, so already walking down there i had a bad feeling that i would have to get a manager involved (and we all know how incompetent they can be)

so i get there, and to my surprise it's just a regular can of unmixed, white, exterior paint, which *is* returnable without manager involvement. i ask the guy what's wrong with the paint and he says that it's frozen and we need to fix it or give him another can.

i bring the can to the paint desk and open it up. now, imagine what half frozen, hardened paint looks like. that's what this paint looked like, and the following conversation sort of went like this.

me: ""this paint is frozen, did you leave it in the garage or something?""

customer (now visibly irate): ""ABSOLUTELY NOT I BOUGHT IT AND I JUST OPENED IT THIS MORNING AND TO MY SURPRISE IT LOOKS LIKE THIS""

me: ""I'm sorry but we really aren't supposed to take paint like this back, it's useless to us returned""

customer (literally about to pop a blood vessel in his brain at this point): ""WELL MAYBE IF YOU GUYS HAD FUCKING SOLD ME A GOOD CAN OF PAINT IT WOULDNT BE FUCKING FROZEN. I WANT A MANAGER, NOW""

great, this guy knows how to get what he wants. i call a manager and explain the situation to him. the manager, being a typical manager, offers him a plethora of free things, including brushes and a brand new can of paint. the customer walks away with his free things (that i have to get for him) with the smuggiest ass look on his face.

story over, right? nope. i bring the can of paint to receiving, ZMA and hazmat it (since we can't sell it, it's fucking frozen and you can't paint with it). done deal im thinking, right?

not even close, bby. picture a hambeast of a woman. ok, maybe not that big, but she had a hard time fitting inside the reach truck sometimes. she is the department head of receiving. basically she sits in receiving on her computer waiting for trucks to arrive. 

now picture her carrying the frozen can of paint to the desk, except i actually had to see it happen. 

okay, okay, what the fuck is going on, im thinking. maybe i didnt mark it down correctly or something, maybe she'll show me how to hazmat it, i have no idea. im also in the middle of explaining to an older woman the different paint finishes we sell. 

nope, she has the nerve to tell me to just ""stick it in the paint shaker for a minute or two and see if we can try and sell it as OOPS paint."" at this point im all whatthefuck.jpeg, the paint is fucking frozen and shaking it won't help. i try to explain this to her but she would have none of it and walks away, and me, being the lowly, minimum wage paint associate that i am, do as she says. i stick it on the OOPS rack and continue my day.

the story ends when the department head of paint sees it on the OOPS rack, laughs, and takes it to receiving himself to hazmat it.

I worked in a a supermarket produce department for about 13 months.  But there was a guy who came in he'd wear a suit and gel his hair to make himself look important, but the only time id see him in my department was sampling my food or outright shoplifting. 
One of the things he'd do would come up to me and say something along the lines of
""Hey Champ, can you cut me a piece of this ""insert fruit here"" , ive heard this batch is extra juicy"" and then once hed taste it hed spit it out and say 
""Yuck thats disgusting, im glad i wasnt going to buy it"" and just storm off. He did this to me quite a few times and hed throw the skin or peel of it onto my displays and I was quite pissed off with all of it. 

He came in and and I recognised him. And the convorsation went as follows. 

Him: Hey Champ, do you mind if I try one of these Mandarins, they seem mighty delicious. 

Me: No you cant

Him: Why the hell not?

Me: Because its shoplifting, you have no intention of buying it, youve done this before you ask if you can try some and say its disgusting then walk off and all youre going to do is peel it, take one bite leave the the rest of the fruit and peel on my display and im not paid to clean up after you and its not a buffet either, what youre doing is taking stuff you havnt paid for, so its actually theft. So no you cant!

He stood there for about 6 seconds trying to think of something to say and all he could muster up was yelling:
Hey I use to work in a fruit store aswell, I know what its like, so deal with it!

And he just walked off, I kept an eye on him too, he didnt buy anything but just walked out the front of the store (giving me an evil eye) and then out the door to the carpark.

He did come back into the store a few days later, but I didnt see him in the produce department again while i was there ( I only did 3pm until Midnight, but he might have come in between 7am and 3pm or while someone else was on) but when I saw him ordering things from the deli hed give me a bitter stare but that was it.

While they're standing in line why wouldn't they pull it out of their wallets instead of when they are at the front of the line? Or sign the receipt which is also required by law. I have to ask them EVERY SINGLE TIME. It's very frustrating. I go through the same thing every day and they never learn. I also get several customers who don't even speak English which is also frustrating. How can I ask you for things that are required by law when you don't speak my language?

Anyway, this next story was also from Barschmucks. If I didn't mention before, this was a franchise location inside of a large supermarket. We were technically employees of the supermarket even though we were real certified baristas. But this meant that many of our coworkers were cashiers and stock guys. One of the stock guys was Otis. He was a huuuuuge black dude who didn't converse much when he came by for his free cup of ice water but seemed like a pretty good guy.

I wasn't working when this happened, but my AST (Evan) told me about it. It's dead and he's just cleaning up waiting for the last few stragglers to wander in when Otis cruises up to the counter. Evan asks him what he'd like but Otis doesn't say anything and just stares at the menu. Evan goes back to cleaning while Otis contemplates the meaning of life. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Otis opening up the tea rack and fumbling for a tea bag (already this is a no-no, not only are we the only ones supposed to touch that tea, but we have to use tongs because it goes right in a customer's drink.) 

Evan doesn't have time to say anything before Otis lifts a bag to his nose and takes a deep whiff. 

He goes: ""What is this? Vanilla Rooibos? (He pronounced it ""roo-bis""; it's actually ""roy-bohs"".) Mmmmmmm. If a girl smell like dis, I'd lick her all *up* and down.""

Then, as quickly as he came, he put the tea back back, and left without saying a word.

We specialize in helping people with injuries and have a very specialized staff, program, and equipment. We are attached to an apartment complex that is spread out over a couple of buildings. The laundry for the complex is in the building adjacent to us. Now to use the laundry machines you are required to use a proprietary card that has to be purchased from a machine. I don't know what someone was smoking one day but instead of putting the machine that dispenses and allows people to add money to there card next to the laundry machines (even though there is plenty of room), someone decided to put the machine in the lobby of the gym. 

Where I work I have a very large window that overlooks the parking lot and see everyone who comes and goes and where people park. I had someone park or fly in the handicap spot (we'll call him Scumbag Steve or SS to keep things simple). SS jumps out of the car and runs full sprint into the lobby to add money onto his laundry card. After a minute or so I hear a knock on the window and we a quick interaction that goes like this:

Me: ""Sorry.""

SS: ""Yo man what about in your wallet, I know you can personally make me change?""

adelajoy,0,,1,1ri8kg,,22,"I spent two years working at a big warehouse-style grocery store. I worked mostly as a cashier, but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a week.

Most of the crappy moments have all blurred together, but there are a few particular moments that stick out.

I realize this isn't the craziest story on here, but I will probably never forget this lady. 

Backstory: Our store had a policy that if an item scanned differently than the price tag, the customer would get it for free, up to $10. The mistake happened because the price tag didn't get changed, or was misplaced. If they spotted a problem, we would go look. If we found a tag in front of their item with the same code and a different price, we gave it to them and changed the tag. If the tag was for a different item, they didn't get anything. 

I was working the customer service desk, and a lady stormed up. I had several customers on the go at the moment, but it was pretty clear she *needed* help right away. As soon as I could, I asked what I could help her with. She was holding a bottle of toilet cleaner, her receipt and a price tag. Let's call her Crazy Customer, CC for short.

**CC**: ""I bought this bottle of toilet cleaner, but it was the wrong price! You guys are trying to charge me too much!""

**Me**: ""Okay, can I see your receipt?""

**CC**: *Hands me the receipt.* ""I tried to tell the cashier, but she didn't believe me!""

**Me**: *I checked who her cashier was, and it was one of our long-time girls. She knew the policy. There was no way she ""didn't believe"" the customer.* ""Okay, so the price came up $3.99, I'll just send a price-checker out to see what the tag said.""

**CC**: ""Oh, I grabbed the price tag already."" *She hands me the price tag. This lady is pretty worked up,  I'm not sure if she just wants to get out of the store, or if she's trying to pull one on me.*

A policy was that the tag had to be on the shelf. If a customer brings it to you, who's to say they didn't take it off the shelf last week and save it? They also could have found it in the wrong place, somewhere that the stock employees wouldn't have checked to fix the tag. As with most stores I've been to, store policy is to inform the customer about the relative store policies, and then see if you can help them anyways. No matter the problem.

It study the tag, and inform her of the policy, that the tag would have to be on the shelf. I start to let her know I can contact a manager, but she snatches the tag back and interrupts me.

**CC**: ""Well if that's your policy, I'll just put it back on the shelf! I was trying to save you some goddamn work, but I guess if you guys want to work extra, I'll just go put it back!""

She took off before I could say anything. I was just standing at the desk, aghast. I didn't even know what to say. 

The supervisor that was on shift was the scary kind. You know, the kind that isn't afraid to yell a little, handles the worst customers, and isn't phased when people call her names. Let's call her Jane. When the woman was gone, I grabbed Jane and told her the whole story. She said, ""Okay. When she comes back, let me know who she is. I'll handle her.""

As soon as I saw the customer coming back, I hissed, ""Jane! Jane! Jane! White hat! That's her."" I then ducked behind the display at customer service, and quite actually hid back there until the customer was gone. I could hear her yelling at Jane. I don't know what the verdict was. Any other manager, and the customer would have gotten the item for free, but it's hard to say with Jane.

I remember one of my coworkers came around the display and exclaimed my name. I hushed them, and told them I was hiding. I was so afraid the woman would see me and do one of those, ""Her! That's the one I was talking to! She told me this!"" And drag me back into it.

I've never hid from a customer before or since. Oh! Fun fact: The price tag she was holding said $3.29, a $0.70 difference from what she paid, and the tag was dated for the week before, which means it wasn't the current price. Not to say it wasn't still on the shelf, but there is a chance she did save it and bring it back in, especially with how worked up she was.

He was friendly and talkative to my kids and was asking me about my tattoos while we were waiting. The cashier was probably 55, spacey, but very sweet woman. When it was old guys turn to check out, I overheard their conversation at the register, and it was obvious they were both long time veterans to the store. 
The man had some trouble checking out. He rang his credit card through the machine multiple times while chatting with the cashier and he seemed confused. Eventually, she explained that he didn't have to keep swiping his card, and that his transaction was complete. In the mean time, she was scanning my items. 
The cashier chatted up a storm with me too. Asking about my kids while I was trying to wrangle them. I was getting a little impatient at this point because my 1 and 3 year old were ready to get the hell out of there, but I listened to her stories with patience. She was kind too.
When she finished scanning my food I pulled my card out to run through the machine, but it was asking for a signature, when I hadn't scanned my card yet. 
Me: ""there must be a mistake, I haven't slid my card through but it's already asking for a signature""
Cashier: ""no, you did, you must have forgot"" -looks at screen- ""you swiped your America express""
Me: ""No, I don't have an Amex, see?.. Oh no did the man in front of me swipe his card while you were ringing me up?""
Cashier: ""uh oh, that must have been what happened""
She looked panicked, but printed the receipt and said ""I'll just do this"" AND SIGNED THE RECEIPT
Cashier: ""He'll be okay, he can be so spacey. Don't even worry about it""
She at first folded up the receipt like she was going to trash it but I asked her if that was really ok, and that I could wait for a manger. She unfolded the receipt and told me not to worry. There was a long line behind me and frankly I was ready to get the fuck out of there with my crazy kids. I asked her ""are you sure? I feel uncomfortable"" 
She told me not to worry, and to go ahead and leave. And I did. 
I think her career might have ended today.
TLDR; Elderly man in line ahead of me accidentally paid for my groceries, cashier eventually realized but didn't give a fuck to fix it. I got free groceries :/

EDIT/UPDATE: I can see how it looks like I was unsympathetic in my post. I was in fact, horrified. I know the groceries weren't free, I just did not pay for them. In my car, I wrote down the time, my total $78.43 and what I thought the mans total was before me $43, and the name of the cashier. I should have stuck around and put my foot down but I was flustered and unsure how to proceed.  I was planning on calling when I got home, and totally forgot about the whole thing until I was in bed redditing from my phone late at night.
This morning I called and spoke with a manager, giving him all of my information. I told him I would happily come back and pay for the groceries and to please make sure the man did not actually get charged (hoping the cashier took the issue to the manager after I left). He said he will look into the receipts from last night and give me a call back. I will update again when I hear from him.

I was behind the register filling out the daily statistics and my manager was folding some clothes. The mall was about to close and we were all just finishing up, trying to go home. 

So, this kid walks in dressed as Gumby and we all laughed/joked around with him for a minute. Then, I was pretty sure I saw him walk out of the store since the mall was closing. 

10 minutes later I was ringing the last customer out and thought I saw my boss out of the corner of my eye so I turned around to talk to her. Turns out it wasn't my boss. Gumby had somehow snuck back in and thought it would be funny to come behind the register and stand over my shoulder and scream ""Boo!"" in my face as soon as I turned around.

insecure_shit_knob,3,,2,1rie8h,,21,"Short and sweet one today. For new readers of my stories (welcome back to the other three), I'm a front end manager at a giant retail chain. Dealing with customers and cashiers is my job, and I only have the job because I'd rather work than be bored. I have enough money to not work, so I am not scared of losing my job.


On to the story:

One of my favorite cashier's (seriously, she's so sweet and helpful. I always drop what I'm doing to answer her questions because she's one of the three that I trust) calls me over for a price check on a set of plates. Customer says they were $29.99, but when I go check they're $49.99. She says that's fine and she pays for them. Done and over, right?

Wrong.

About ten minutes later she comes over to my podium. I already know she's getting coal from me in her stockings (merry Christmas bitch).

Her- ""I was just over there looking at the plates again. They were there just in the wrong spot.""

Me- ""I'm sorry ma'am, I'll let an associate know so he can fix it. I'm a little busy to get to it."" Which I was, I was getting five different change orders ready.

Her- ""Isn't it your job to fix it?""

Me- ""actually no it's not. I'm the front end manager. There are two managers who work in that area, it's actually their job technically. If I would've seen the plates,I would've put them in the right spot.""

Her- ""So you're just a lazy asshole.""

Ok, I'm done. I talk to everyone in a civil manner, but when they take that tone with me, I'm done.

Me- ""yep""

Her- ""You're not going to fix it?""

Me- ""Nope, too lazy right now.""

This was followed by more angry questions and statements until I walked away to deliver my change orders. She tracked an assistant manager down and let him have it about my attitude. He's a pretty cool guy, came up to me later, asked what the deal was and just laughed when I told him. Now he always asks if I'm lazy today when he sees me.

I don't remember much from it except for this story. Working storefront; typical day, typical customers. This older, possibly Italian gentleman came up and I asked to take his order.

Man: May I see your hand?

I think I just stood there looking at him for a moment. He had an Italian accent so I was thinking I may have misheard him, and asked for his order again. He held his hand out and insisted to see mine.

Now, this guy didn't look creepy or scary or anything. If so I would have just bolted. But I was 17 and put on the spot so I gave him my hand.

Man: What is your name?

At the time I still had my ""Trainee"" name tag so it wasn't on there. I don't know why I gave him my name. I didn't really know what else to do.

He then proceeded to serenade me in front of the entire store. Granted, there were only about 10 people around. He held my hand with enough force that I could not easily pull it away and I stood there flushed red while the rest of the staff laughed at me. Apparently it's happened before.

He sang in deep Italian (and I heard my name thrown in there) for a good two minutes before he let me go. I had to stand there awkwardly while begging with my eyes to be saved by my coworkers, but they certainly weren't going to put an end to their amusement any earlier than necessary. I don't even remember if he ordered anything.

IIWinterbreezeII,2,,3,1rhy5m,,2,"I'm not a retailer, but this story's close enough, so screw it.

I was volunteering at a local zoo for a special Halloween event for about 3 - 4 hours. It was the last night of the event, and I was in charge of handing out prizes for games. It was a pretty good job, and I got to have as much free soda as I wanted, since I was in the concessions booth. I had to set out prizes, read tickets to see how many points a kid had, tell them how much each prize was (They could mix and match), then calculate how many points they had left as they chose. They'd choose their prizes, I'd hand it to them, and they'd leave. 

I had a friend of mine with me for the first hour, and we split the customers when it got busy. (Around 5 people at the same time.) At one point I spilled my soda, and she handled the crowd as I cleaned up the mess.

Then she left. Oh god.

I was left to set out prizes for display, serve customers, and translate kid-speak by myself. At some points I was so swamped with customers that I could barely figure out the total points for each kid as they got prizes.

Another girl came it at low tide, but left before it got busy again. (Around twenty minutes.) I wasn't allowed to leave my station to try and find her, so I had to deal with all the customers alone. (She wasn't actually allowed to leave either, but she gave zero fucks. Bitch.)

Scott5114,0,,3,1riony,,13,"I've met a lot of strange customers in my time at the casino. This guy takes the cake as the most fucked-up, unpleasant guy that's ever darkened our doorstep. We'll call him Dick because he is one.

To begin with, Dick is in the casino for a fucked-up reason. He's dying of cancer, or some other terminal disease. He spends his last days in our casino trying to win an inheritance for his children. Of course, mathematics says it's not going to happen, so he's squandering what money he does have and the remainder of his life sitting in a smoky room with no natural light playing $25 per spin on a slot machine. 

I wouldn't judge him so harshly for that if he wasn't a colossal asshole. Pretty much everyone who has had to pay a jackpot for him has some sort of unpleasant experience to share. Mine was when I was processing a jackpot for him and I go to clear the jackpot message from the screen. See, if you win, say, $1500, and you had $80 in credit when you hit it, when the attendant clears the jackpot your $80 will still be left on the machine. People sometimes forget or don't know this, and will leave the money on the machine and walk away, so after clearing it most of us will say ""You still have $80 left on the machine."" Of course, when I mention this to Dick, he flies into a rage, screaming ""I CAN SEE THAT! GOD!"" I started dodging his jackpots when I knew where he was playing after that—I don't put up with that sort of BS—though I still had to pay him out a couple of times after that because I didn't realize who it was. 

And Dick did hit a lot of jackpots. He would usually destroy the copy of the W2-G tax forms we would give him, I guess thinking since he's dying he won't need to worry about paying taxes, though you would think he would realize his kids would be on the hook for all of it. He also had the tendency to swear ambiguously so you never really knew whether he was calling the machine or you a piece of shit. Management had talked to him a couple of times about treating the attendants better. He did tip the bare minimum to not be considered an ass in that department, at least.

All of that is backstory to properly put in context what happened this week. At this point, Dick's managed to piss off enough attendants that most of the shift is dodging his calls, so it takes him probably twice as long to get someone over there than it would anyone else. This, coupled with the fact that he's losing heavily, pisses him off. 

Management gets called over to a machine in my section. I'm generally pretty curious about these things, so I head over there. The machine's touchscreen (retail price quoted to me by a tech as $700 or so) is totally shattered. The machine still has $20 on it—with an inoperable touchscreen, there's no way to cash that out on this machine. There's a patron further down the bank who saw the whole thing. Said the guy was losing, got pissed, punched the screen, threw a piece of paper down, and stormed off. One of the managers that showed up picks up the paper.

It's a torn-up W2-G with Dick's name, address, and social security number on it. A little bit of searching in the computers turns up copies of his driver license and the hotel room he is in. And of course the whole incident is caught on tape.

We don't know what happened to Dick after that. Apparently it became the responsibility of the casino's assistant general manager, and she isn't talking. We're all watching the usual locations for ban notices to go up, though.",The worst casino patron in the world,16,talesFromRetail
GlowingBall,2,,2,1rioer,,16,"These are my Tales of Retail Loss Prevention....

Part Three – Citizen Snips (Aka - The Pants Aquatic)



As a recap for those of you who have never read one of my stories before – I am a male in the midwest who is on the wrong side of his twenties and works retail loss prevention for a major retailer (one of the 'Big 5').  I am underpaid for what I do but enjoy my job none the less.  A majority of my time is spent wandering the floor or watching middle aged moms shop for clothing far too skimpy on them via CCTV (closed circuit television or 'security cameras').  Every once in awhile I get a case that is just so mind blowingly 'WTF' that I have to share.  

This story opens up with me doing just as I said above – watching people on CCTV.  It is a blisteringly cold afternoon so the customers, far more content to stay in their warm homes and snuggled beneath their blankets, are few and far between.  I, as the ever watchful hawk of justice that I am, was busy playing a Marvel version of Candy Crush Saga.  My job provides me the liberty of slacking off a good amount and my boss is rather lenient as long as I continue to bring in a good amount of stops per month.  I am sitting there diligently trying to match up small colored tiles with one another when I am startled by a sudden ring – the phone is going off!  

Now the phone going off is common place.  We get tons of calls a day ranging from the frozen dairy department calling to tell us a temperature alarm is going off (we know...it goes off for us as well) to people asking us to deactivate a door alarm (we also know...we see you standing at the door).  This happened to be a call from one of the few places that doesn't call us often – the meat department.  The guy on the other end, a tall black man with more muscle than he knows what to do with, calls to tell us that there is a guy standing in front of the freshly butchered meat.  The guy has refused any help the meat employee has offered and continues to say he is 'just browsing' for over ten minutes.  This strikes me as rather odd.  Who just hangs out around the meat department?  I quickly devise a plan for the situation.  I tell the employee to walk into the back so I could see just what the person was going to do.  

The employee hangs up and walks over to the man to let him know he is going to be into the back and to ring the bell if he needs anything.  No sooner than when he had walked into the back but the man glanced around and then walked behind the counter.  My adrenaline already began to rush as my suspicions came to fruition – he was going to steal!  “Oh shit here we go, ” I declared, only to watch in confusion and frustration as he walked right past all the glass displays full of meat and right over to the lobster tank.  Now if you aren't familiar with these tanks they are exactly just what the name implies – a water filled tank full of live lobsters we sell by the pound.  Their claws are bound and they just kind of hang out crawling all over one another.  Kids love to sit there and watch them.

“No way...is he really going to...” I whispered as I watched on in awe.  Sure enough he reached right into the live lobster display tank we have.  After a moment of 'fishing around' he plucked the lobster he wanted from the tank and pulled it out of the water.  Before I could even make heads or tails of the situation he glanced around once more and shoved the lobster right down the front of his pants.  The guy, whom shall be hence forth called Lobster Johnson, then proceeded to shuffle run his way out of the meat department and through the grocery department towards the front of the store.  The only way I can really describe how he ran was a forward version of Zoidberg's shuffle.  All he was missing was yelping out “Woop woop woop woop!” loudly as he went.  

Needless to say he wasn't too hard to stop.  I may not be in the best shape of my life but I can still move quicker than a guy with a large lobster squirming around in his pants.  He didn't fight me at the door or even try to argue what he was doing.  After all, it is kind of hard to argue that you aren't stealing when you have a large, lobster shaped bulge in your pants.

Bonus icing on top of the cake: I usually ask the person why they are stealing.  It usually won't change anything but it fulfills my curiosity and keeps them talking which usually calms them down a bit.  This guy tried to say that he was stealing the lobster for his kids...

I decided to go get some water during my shift the other day so I headed towards our water fountain, which happens to be down a narrow hallway and is between the bathrooms and is opposite the hallway from our offices/breakroom area.  As I come around a corner in said hallway I almost bump into our Store Manager (SM from here on out) who is in the middle of cleaning the bathrooms.  SM and I start chatting and from the men's room I hear some loud noises.

""What the hell was that?"" I ask

""Damn kids screwing around."" SM replies as he sets down the bag of trash he had been holding and walks over to the men's room.

Now, SM isn't a particularly tall guy, but he lifts weights quite a bit and could very well be described as being jacked.  Somehow, from time to time, people think it is a good idea to fight him, so I stuck around in case he needed backup.

SM opens the men's room door hard, slamming it into the wall and bellows, ""What the HELL are you doing in my bathroom?""

--inaudible reply--

""Yeah, well it is a pretty sad day when I have to kick someone out of the bathroom, now get the hell out."" SM says at a slightly reduced volume.

""B..But my stomach hurts."" says a meek voice from inside the bathroom.

Then at a normal volume, but with a tone of voice that sounded like SM had ice in his veins he replies, ""Carry it somewhere else.""  Then he stared into the bathroom in a manner that was somewhat intense.

With that the teens walked out of the store with their heads hung in shame.

ME: What we can do for you though is our 90 day comfort guarantee swap out. Can I have your name Ill look your ticket up and well see what we can do. 

He seems to calm down a little bit and he takes a seat across from my desk and he gives me hi name. I look up his name and pull up his ticket as Im explaining the comfort guarantee I look at his ticket. And then at the date he bought it(ya know to make sure its at least close to 90 days) I was willing to be flexible to make this guy happy when I notice he bought this mattress 9months ago!! Im flexible but not *that* flexible

ME: Uhh Sir, Im sorry to say this but you bought this mattress 9months ago, that 6months over the 90days. Theres nothing we can do for you. 

That when he became absolutely IRATE with me. Screaming something about how this is bad business practice, he deserves to get a refund, we owe it to him. Blah blah blah. [Im done this this shit](http://i.imgur.com/InDPcFn.gif)

ME: SIR. There is nothing we can do, the comfort exchange policy was explained to you when you bought it, if you didnt like the mattress you should have come back 6months ago, now Im going to have to ask you to leave the store. 

Well he didnt like that very much. He was becoming increasingly angry and hostile. Hes leaning over my desk pointing his finger right in my face([Which I hate](http://i.imgur.com/u77ThfE.gif)) but I keep my cool, and as sternly as I can say

ME: Sir if you dont leave immediately I will be forced to call the police and have you removed from my store.

I was in shock I composed myself quickly, called the police, and then my boss and explained everything that happened. 

I guess that asshat forgot that he gave us his address to deliver the mattress to, he ruined about 5beds which he was made to pay sticker price for on all of them(sticker price is close to $300 more than what we normally sell for)

jessajuhanabi,30,,94,1rhnqp,,397,"As of last Thursday, I am the head manager of a retail outlet and cafe, answering only to my boss, since the only girl above me quit. All people that walk in, call or email come through me. My boss is normally around but he works on coffee machines most days. 

As backgound for this story: His brother is a c*nt. I live in Australia, so that term seriously fits him. He owes a bunch of people money, is generally an asshole, and my boss is very sad his brother has changed so much. It stresses my boss out as their finances are tied due to a trust. 

Today, a lady walks in around 11:30, and walks up to the front desk. Politely, she asks me, ""Is (boss) in?""

In my mind, she was another person that he knew since he's been running this business for 20+ years, or a rep from some company that I didn't care about. He turned around to look at her, and I pointed in his direction. 

She immediately starts spouting about how boss's brother, we'll call him AH for asshole, owed her money. This is not a surprise to boss. He knows her. He's heard from her over email before. In which he told her he has no access to the trust and he's also fighting AH for money. 

This does not please the lady, henceforth known as douchecanoe. DC repeats over and over, despite pleas from my boss to chase down AH, ""I'm not leaving without my money. Get it for me.""

Now, DC wants a hefty sum. A couple thousand dollars. My boss offers her a coffee while he tries to reach AH. A water. A chair. Nothing. She stands in front of our stock and repeats herself over and over. ""Give me my money. Give me my money. I don't care its not my problem. YOU pay me.""

Why is she going after my boss? Because she's gone through the courts, they told AH to pay, and he still hasn't. Her response? Come into my store and stand there all day every day until HIS BROTHER, pays her. 

Now, my boss tries and tries to get her to understand he has no access to the money. No go. So instead she stands in our store, silent, for 4 fucking hours. Four. DC stands there so long my boss gets fed up and stressed, and leaves. 

The difference is, he's a peace keeper. I was itching for him to leave. I was just going to have the cops come eject her. I was EXCITED. 

Unfortunately she realized rather quickly I was not the ""nice cop"" type so she stood out the front, called in a few friends and intermittently yelled ""YOU KNOW THIS IS SO SILLY I JUST WANT MY MONEY FROM THE (BUSINESS)"" and ""I KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE IN XXXX SUBURB I COULD RUIN A BUSINESS IF I WANTED TO."" through the window at me. 

Oh god. You scare me so much. I might pee my pants. 

Anyway she eventually gave up and left without coming back inside, probably since I was watching her and smiling, willing her to come inside so I could call the cops. 

Oh well, another day I suppose! Maybe she'll be back tomorrow...

DolfyuttSrednaz,58,,48,1rh8hc,,200,"I have got to say, after working 4 years in retail, parents should be responsible for their children's actions. I have seen so many kids acting like demons that have just spawned from a dimension full of pointy sticks being shoved up their asses, but I never blame the kids. I usually don't even blame the parents, because kids are kids, but when customers blatantly let their kids run around like Sonic on meth, I blame the parents. that is why we have an announcement that plays every few minutes, reminding customers to keep their little shits in line. So when a customer like the one I had comes in, I usually inform my manager (who will be called Jared) of the situation and he watches the kid from a distance. 

A middle-aged couple stumbles into the store with their 7 year old son. They head off to furniture, but their son makes a bee-line to toys. I immediately call Jared, and let him know that this little tornado is heading to toys and he should try to contain the damage as much as possible. Before the kid makes it to toys, he stops over in the Halloween section and starts putting on masks and runs around the store trying to scare the other customers. After 4 complaints, Jared stops the kid, and drags him to his parents, who don't give one shit nor a giggle about what my manager has to say and wave him off. The kid bolts towards toys, and stars ripping toys down off the shelf. The floor looks like a miniature Antietam by the time he is finished. Now he has an armload of toys and decides to take them to the bathroom. Once in there, he places them on the floor, and proceeds to urinate on them. Jared walks in on him finishing up, and drags the kid back to his parents, leaving a trail of piss footprints behind him. Jared tells the parents what he did, and that they have to clean up the mess. This switches the parents into rage mode. They just cannot BELIEVE that their kid would do this! And he will be punished severely when they get home. Jared tells them calmly ""I am punishing you, not your child. You guys made no effort to control him, and even brushed me off after the first incident. You guys will clean up every mess he has made, and then you can leave. You are no longer welcomed here."" They start yelling profanities at him and their kid, saying how this is ridiculous and they shouldn't have to put up with this. 

After they cleaned up, they left empty handed. Jared received many compliments on how he handled the situation.

racheecakes,8,,48,1rhjav,,206,"This sub is usually full of complaints and although I have quite a few I have a short, nice story to tell. I work in the dining room at one of the lovely bakery/cafe chains in America. We are very lax on people lingering in our cafe, especially the homeless. We allow them to stay in our building in the single comfortable chairs for as long as they want as long as they're not pestering our customers. (It's not like we're hobo central, there are only two or three regulars). Usually our lunch rushes are filled with self centered people or angry people who just spent a dick load of money on presents for people they really didn't want to spend money on (we're located in a mall parking lot). In the midst of the chaos, bread bowls, and dirty tables I notice a customer approaching an obvious homeless man. This catches my eye so I go over and start cleaning a nearby table and eavesdrop. The customer hands the homeless man a gift card to our cafe for fifty dollars. He told him to stay full during this holiday season, to have a good one, and clenched his shoulder in a very comforting, almost fatherly like way. He walked away and back to his table before the homeless man got to say a word. The look on the homeless man's face was something worth remembering. It was nice to see someone think of someone they did not even know. Although it didn't happen to me, I witnessed it happen, and it's something I will be passing forward.",A little holiday cheer early this year.,254,talesFromRetail

aturquoiseseashell,12,,25,1rg9do,,127,"End of shift at a famous, upscale department store, and I am already clocked out, with my purse on. I'm talking to my coworkers before I leave because I'm waiting on a ride home. I work in the lingerie department, which is near one of the 2nd story entrance doors to the store. 

A flustered woman comes up with three bags, one from Kate Spade, one from Michael Kors, and one from Tory Burch. She says she found the bags in the vestibule of the entrance to the store.
We thank her for her honesty and promise to call Loss Prevention to come and take the bags. She becomes agitated.

""Well I'm going to wait here and see that you do it,"" she snaps. She's suddenly riled up.

We're a bit taken aback, but continue to be polite to her and my coworker calls LP.

While my coworker waits on the phone to be connected to the security desk, I guess we kind of exchanged looks. (She was very antsy, and was holding onto the bags for dear life). The woman exclaims in outrage, ""Don't you all roll your eyes at me!"" 

""Ma'am,"" says my co-worker, ""No one is rolling their eyes. We're waiting for security to pick up the phone. They will make sure the bags are returned to the customer. Thank you very much for bringing them to our attention, we will see to it that they are returned to the customer."" 

The woman becomes more agitated and irritated. Finally, security picks up and my coworker says, ""A customer found some bags; one's from MK, one is from Tory Burch…""
The woman snaps, before my coworker is quite finished, ""And one from Kate Spade!!"" as though we purposely left that one out so we could steal it or something. 

""And one from Kate Spade,"" my co-worker adds. We're all getting kind of insulted by this woman's attitude. She seems convinced we're plotting to steal the bags, despite the fact that they remain in plain sight of the security camera. We're all well-dressed, well-spoken girls in our early twenties, and we are acting calm and polite. No apparent cause for suspicion.

Security says they can't help and to turn the bags into customer service, who coworker speaks to.
""Ma'am, please give me the bags. Customer service is coming to pick them up,"" my coworker says. We really want her to leave at this point. She's staring at us through narrowed eyes and she's breathing heavily.

""No!"" the woman shrieks, and clutches them to her chest. She tears frantically at one of them and finds a receipt. She begins dialing the number of Kate Spade. We're stunned.
""Please, ma'am…"" the coworker begins, but the woman literally shushes her and begins frantically reading the details of the receipt to the cashier at Kate Spade who is on the other end of the phone. 

She convinces an employee at Kate Spade to come to the dept. store to identify the bags.
Meanwhile, she announces that she will take the bags to customer service herself, in a very angry tone. ""You all are acting VERY suspicious!"" she declares, still clutching the bags to her breast almost maniacally. 

At this point, we're pretty alarmed by her behavior and beginning to wonder if she plans to steal the bags herself after seeing the prices on the receipt. My coworker calls the store manager, and we inform the customer that we would prefer that she remain in lingerie with the bags and wait for the manager. She loudly refuses to stay put. My coworker follows her to customer service.

From all the way in our department on the other end of the floor, we can hear the woman yelling. She had a quavery voice and a really strong British accent. 
Apparently, she got to customer service, and the couple who had left the bags was there. The woman refused to give them the bags without proof of their identity!! Finally the Kate Spade employee arrived and confirmed that yes, the bags belonged to the couple. 

I guess the woman was trying to do the right thing, but she insulted my coworkers and me and frightened various customers in the process. I still don't get why she became so suspicious or why she didn't just bring the bags to customer service in the first place. Of course, since we were lowly retail workers we must have been plotting to steal the lost merchandise.

KroipyBill,11,,40,1rhynu,,123,"After [writing about our cheering seasonal workers from Black Friday yesterday,](http://redd.it/1rf92j) it reminded me of this other story involving my goofy manager. 

When I first started working for this place, I came in clean shaven, and patchy hair. I was in denial that mother nature was closing my hair follicles for business, and it wasn't until after my engagement photos I decided to make a change. I shaved my head and have kept it that way ever since. I then grew a goatee to compensate for my loss. Honestly I looked much sharper than having the grassy field of hair you can see the horizon through. It was a relief to embrace it, and feel like I looked decent again. There was one manager who enjoyed messing with me however. In fact in my previous stories, I've quoted him several times in our conversations, since he was my favorite manager to talk to, and the biggest goof ball there. He vowed he would draw on my head when I wasn't ready for it. 

**Me:** Dude I'm taller than you. So unless you parachute from the rafters onto my cranium with your sharpie, you will not succeed. 

**Manager:** We'll see...we'll...see...

At that moment I wondered if he really was contemplating that attack strategy. At least he left it at just contemplating. 

One day, we were pretty busy. It was pre-holiday, post-black Friday days. I'm sure you all know the type. Everybody is getting geared up for Christmas. I found my way over to the computer department helping a customer decide what Mac they wanted. I was describing the hardware specs, how it works with their Apple products etc. During this I felt I was going to make a decent sale. However I made a massive mistake...

*I sat down.* 

Yes I slipped up big time. My manager saw this opportunity from what it seemed immediately. He walked over and distracted me by having another employee ask me a question. 

**Employee:** Hey KroipyBill you know where I can find [some bullcrap item that he knew the answer to.]

**Me:** Yeah sure. Remember they're eh...ahh...AHH!!!

Right then, my manager walks up to me with his pen, and I felt the coldness of the ballpoint touch my head, while it was dragged across my chrome dome. My entire body froze as if somebody stiffed my spine. I made a weird breathing noise, like I was experiencing sharp pains when it was just mainly a very tiny cold piece of metal on my head. Kind of like EAHH!! EAHH!! EAHH!!! (That's the best I can do textually.) They were quiet, sharp noises.

He walked off, cackling like the joker. I looked at my customer with this super surprised look on my face. He lost his crap, and just laughed. Because of this I sold him more attachments, but that's beside the point. 

Over the radio:

**Me:** The person who drew on my head. You know who you are. Thanks for helping my sale out by doodling with a ballpoint pen on my cranium. 

I looked around the store and saw those with a radio express such confusion. I'm a pretty tall dude, so for those who were in eye sight, I bent my head down so they could see the graffiti my manager brought forth upon my person. Much laughter followed, including my manager.

**Manager:** You said I would never get you. 

**Me:** Well bucket head, you're lucky I was sitting so your midget self could strike me. 

**Manager:** My strike is now complete. 

**Me:** It's a good thing I don't just go over there and rub my greasy head all over your face. I'm glad you feel all militaristic about your approach. 

**Manager:** Oh...this would be a much more fun Call of Duty game if this were part of the game play. 

I never got him back. And he has since left the store after I left. Despite us still being good friends, he's still a bucket head.

It was a beautiful sunny day, which is not common in these parts from oh...October to May.    
    
A very proper looking lady walks up and asks for a salesmen that is off.  Lets call her Uber bitch (UB).  
    
Me, ""He's off today, is there something I can help you with?"" 
       
UB, ""I'm not sure your capable, 'L' was very knowledgeable.""  
       
Her tone was very matter of fact and frankly bitchy.     
     
Me, ""Lets do it this way, I'll help you to the best of my ability and if you're not satisfied you can come back and see 'L' when he gets back.""     
    
UB sighed and said, ""I suppose that will do. Tell me about your most advanced car.""     
    
Me, ""Advanced how?""     
   
UB, ""Technologically.""    
    
Me, ""That's a pretty broad spectrum, lets start with what kind of car do you want?  Like an SUV or Sedan.""      
       
UB, ""I don't see why this matters.""     
    
Me, ""I'm just trying to help you to the best of my ability.""    
    
UB, ""Well that clearly lacking.""      
    
Me, ""Apparently. I have an idea though lets go look at the new Avalon, they just had a fresh rebuild this year so I would say the have the most gadgets and cool technology in them.""     
    
UB, ""That's a start show me the way.""      
    
At this point I realized that I'm dealing with some sort of royalty by the way she's talking to me and looking at me like I was clearly beneath her.    
    
We walked out side and toward the Avalon's and as we rounded the corner I was blinded by the light of 1 sun (that mutha fucker is bright when we only see it a few times a year) so I do what I thought was natural, I put on my sun glasses. You'd think I killed her 2nd born spawn.    
        
UB stopped in her tracks and said, ""Excuse me, how long have you been in sales.""     
    
Me, ""About 15 years now, why do you ask?""    
    
UB, ""How dare you put your sunglasses on in front of a customer. You should know better.""    
    
At this point I'm done with her attitude. She can; buy a car, sell a car, die in fire for all that I'm concerned.    
    
Me, ""While were walking into the direct sunlight I'm keeping them on, once we get into a car I'll make sure to take them off so you can see my pretty greens again.""     
     
The look and sound of disgust from her should of withered some near by plants.     
    
UB, "" I don't want to look at the Avalon unless it has what I want on it.""      
        
I acted all surprised and said, ""Ahhh in that case thus far all you've told me is that you want technology on it. Every car on my lot has technology, how about you fill in the blanks for me and I'll get you what you need.""   I finished that last part with a touch of sarcasm.
    
UB, "" You don't have to take that tone with me.""     
    
I just started at her until she finally answered my question.    
   
UB, ""I want....""  Imagine everything every car in every scfi movie has done (some highlights: Voice activated everything, self driving, self maintaining, color changing, all electric or non-gas, The list goes on)

Me, ""What's your thoughts on a Prius that parks for you, stops for you in emergencies and has rain sensing wipers?""    
    
UB let here vileness spew out of her and she said, ""That's all been out for years I don't want dated technology.""

Maloth_Warblade,6,,17,1rhx0y,,94,"Black Friday, 2011. Big, blue, zombie-filled box store. I was a photo tech.

It's been almost 2 years now, as I no longer work for retail. I did my 5 years with it and I'm done.

I'm glad I'm out, too. I don't hate people, I just learned that I hate being treated like less than crap, filth, and told I'm worthless on a daily basis. But this one was so irritating I spoke up.

I worked 2 stores on Black Friday in 2011, both the BBS and the famous game store. I was basically at work from Noon-8 on Thanksgiving at the BBS, missing all family gatherings, by the way, and then 11:30pm-7am at the games store (I was the only cashier by the way, in the most populated area of the county/city), and then 12-8 again on Black Friday at the BBS. 

I was tired, beyond tired, essentially 20hrs of work, on my feet with no breaks for food or bathroom due to chaos. The BBS frequently refused to give me my lunches until I was mandatorily locked out, and even then they simply made me work anyway (even got reported for going over 8 hrs without a break, wasn't given a choice).

 Needless to say, by the time 5pm rolled around, and not having eaten but a pop tart in 24hrs, I was having a sugar crash. These make you lightheaded, these make it hard to think and respond quickly. I was working my ass off to get greeting cards printed, packaged, priced and all the while walking everyone through how to use our touch-screen computers and simple tasks. 

One customer didn't like that I wasn't answering fast enough. Of course she didn't, it's Black Friday, and that I was being far too rude for her. She told me she didn't like how tired I was, that I shouldn't work at all if I was so tired. How worthless I was to be there, on the busiest day of the year, if I couldn't be bothered to be awake. 

At this point I interrupted her. I told her ""Lady, listen. I don't need this from you, not today. Not the day people die from customers entitlement. No. I've been working since pretty much Noon yesterday. I had to miss my family's Thanksgiving, again, and not only that, I couldn't even EAT any food yet. There's no time. I'm beyond having a sugar crash, I'm hungry, and beyond normal tired. If you're going to sit there and belittle me over this, you can just get out of my face and leave this place"" (or something VERY close to this, been a few years).

Of course I got loud to say this, and everyone looked at her. Associates, customers, even her husband. She tried apologizing, I kept interrupting her asking what else she needed, and she kept trying to change subjects..I wouldn't let her. She was the last straw I needed that day, and I wasn't having it.

Good news though, wasn't reported, wasn't written up. Had a very nice and thoughtful customer buy me a bag of chips and a soda after seeing me be berated by not only her but other customers. Made it home and promptly slept for 15 hours.

adelajoy,15,,15,1rg29x,,73,"I spent two years working at a big warehouse-style grocery store. I worked mostly as a cashier, but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a week.

Most of the crappy moments have all blurred together, but there are a few particular moments that stick out.

This grocery store is the only one in the area that doesn't bag your groceries for you. Each till has two long conveyor belts to hold your groceries while you bag them (Both the customer and the cashier have buttons to move the groceries down, away from the till). This speeds orders up, requires less staff, saves money and drops prices. People occasionally complain about it, but if they want to pay more for their groceries and have someone else bag them, they're welcome to. ... The store isn't exactly famous for customer service, but I think the prices make up for this.

I was one of the fastest cashiers on staff at the time. This meant that my belts would often get full. I had ways to deal with this. I knew how fast people packed, I knew how soon a belt would clear. I was really good at my job. One day, the lines were insanely long, I was working really fast, everyone was buying a lot. I got to a point that there were groceries on both of my belts, so I squeezed the smaller order down a little, watched for a moment, and knew that he would be down before the next order crowded him. I started scanning the next order, and smiled at the customers - a man and his very pregnant wife.

The wife snapped at me, ""Can you just wait!""

""Excuse me?""

""Can you wait? I don't want you to crowd out that other guy!""

I looked, and he was literally loading his last bag with groceries. I stopped scanning anyways, and maybe glared at the lady. I don't really like it when other people tell me how to do my job.

Eventually he was packed and gone, so I started scanning again. While I had been waiting, I had lined all of their canned goods up. I can scan cans super fast if they're all really close. I started scanning the canned goods, grabbing a can, tossing it to my other hand, and setting it on the other belt. Except that this woman had walked around (The belt she got was behind me) and was standing behind me, trying to bag the cans as I scanned them. I'm sorry, but I'm not actually looking where the cans go. I know the space, and I need to watch the computer screen, not my hands. Well, she kept trying to grab the one I'd just set down, which meant that I kept hitting her hand with the next can. I wasn't by any means throwing the cans, but I was moving quickly and she was in my space, so she was getting hit. I didn't actually realize that I was hitting her until she complained to her husband. So I slowed down, apologized, and moved on to her other groceries.

She then had a bag of apples. She had grabbed one of our bags and put three different apples in it, and tied it shut. I have to weigh each type of fruit separately, so I opened the bag, weighed the first apple, set it aside. I noticed her husband grabbed the apple right away. I weighed the second apple, and set it aside. He grabbed that one too. When I weighed the third, my plan had been to put all three back in the bag and tie it shut, but the other two apples were gone. I tied the bag around the last one and set it on the belt. If the husband wanted to pack the apples separately, he was welcome to.

The couple also bought about half a dozen little bags of frozen perogies. One of the bags had been ripped all the open, right down the middle, and frozen perogies were laying all over the belt. I considered not telling them, because I was mad, but I took a deep breath, rounded up all of the stray perogies, put them in a plastic bag, and informed the lady. I asked her if she would like me to send for a new bag. She snippily replied ""Yes"" as if I should have just known. Some people don't bother to get a new bag because it can hold up the line, so I always ask. Our runner quickly returned with an identical bag and I kept going.

When I finally finished (They bought *a lot* of stuff), the husband paid, while the wife stormed over to customer service. I watched as she talked to my supervisor, and eventually a store manager. I was getting pretty nervous. Oh, also I should mention this woman was rude and snapped every time I asked her a question. I was pretty angry by the time they left.

After they were completely done, my supervisor closed my till and asked to speak to me at customer service.

She said the lady had filed a formal complaint against me. Apparently the conversation went something like this:

**Pregnant Lady**: ""I want to complain about the cashier on till 9!""

**Nice Supervisor**: ""Till 9? Do you mean till 8?"" (I was on 9 - one of my quick-to-anger coworkers was on 8)

**PL**: ""No, I mean 9!""

**NS**: ""Like the girl with brown hair, *not* the blonde?""

**PL**: (getting frustrated) ""Yes!""

**NS**: ""So what did adelajoy do?""

**PL**: ""She was rude and short with me!""

**NS**: ""Adelajoy? Are you sure?""

**PL**: ""Yes! She also threw canned goods at me, *ripped* open a bag of perogies, scattered them *everywhere* and scattered all of my apples too! She also bruised all of my fruit because she was throwing them around!""

A store manager was brought down to take a formal complaint, which means it probably went in my employee file. The lady was calmed down and left, and that was the end of it. Typically, the store managers will meet with you to discuss complaints, and make sure they won't happen again. The fact that I didn't means either the manager simply didn't believe the woman, or wasn't concerned because it was my first (and only). The supervisor who helped her said she closed my till because I looked upset and she thought I needed a break. The only reason she told me was to find out what really happened. I told her my side, and she just laughed it off. I admitted to being short and snippy, but the rest was just ludicrous. I still cannot beleive she blamed me for the bag of perogies being ripped open, considering I told her about them, got a new bag, and spent a minute or two picking up all of the perogies. Also, why would I take the time to do that, when I was clearly rushed with everything else?

I get that pregnant women have a lot of hormones, and tend to be angry, short-tempered, whatnot, but I think there's a line. Also, the fact that her husband didn't stop her, stand up for me, or admit to grabbing all the apples kind of pissed me off.

unidentifiableblarg,12,,9,1rhfwt,,65,"**Back story:** I worked in a small convenience store in a town on the outskirts of a city. A lot of the customer's are regulars and have been coming here for years, decades even.

About 6 years ago the place changed hands, names and management too. Still provided the same sort of stuff though, so the locals kept calling it by it's old name. 

This is relevant, I swear.



**The story:** I'm serving on the registers at the front of the store, just doin ma biz, when a flustered woman comes up to the counter demanding my attention. I tell her I'll be with her as soon as I finish processing my currant customer.

This somehow seemed to offended her, so I was already off to a bad start. But I get to her and try to smooth things over with my best customer service voice (you know the one).

After a bit of just listening to her complaining and bitching in general she finally gets to the point.

""I bought this product here earlier and you (not me) charged me the wrong price! It's on special, why is it wrong blah blah blah""

The outrage was dripping off her.

Now, normally I'd be prepared to fix this, sometimes we just straight up get it wrong and stuff isn't the right price.

*But*, while she's ranting she's waving around a catalogue, that contains the magical special that we failed to give her.

Eventually she shoves it in my face to accent a point, and shows me what it should have been.

The catalogue wasn't for our store, we don't even sell the brand (ice cream, I think it was) that she seemed to have thought she purchased.

I politely explain that we're not an [old store] any more and that was why she didn't get the discount. But I'd be happy t...

Her: What?! I've lived her FOR YEARS and it's always been [old store]. You've got to be kidding me.

I point out the signs (they're everywhere) and shirts of the employees and explain that we've been [new store] for quite a while.

She persists though, demanding to get her discount because it's ""always been that way and why should I get screwed for what you did..."" just generally giving me a hard time; that kind of bullshit.

The managers will usually give the discount to them anyway, just to keep them happy, but I was sick of getting abused by people who apparently can't read and wasn't about to let this one fly. Pety, I know.

Eventually I get to the point where I'm just repeating myself and she's adamantly refusing to be 'robbed' of forty cents. So I call my manager to come up.

By this stage I'm sick of her shit and just want her to leave, customers are waiting to be served and I'm meant to be serving. Small store, small number of staff.

Finally my duty manager meanders up and he immediately grovels at her feet, begging her forgiveness and taking her to a spare register to sort out her problem. 


I'm not bitter (lies), but the smug grin she threw me on her way out made me really wish that our management stood up for us, at least sometimes.

And that I had a crowbar handy.

CommandoDerp,9,,17,1rhsfa,,62,"First off, I would like to say that I had two days off before this incident so I was unaware of any changes at work.

So I was at work after two days off when I was serving an elderly man, who was a regular, cigarettes. He asked for a particular brand in a carton of twin packs. I tell him unfortunately that the twin packs are classified as cartons themselves, and you cannot purchase a carton of a carton. He rolled his eyes and asked for 4 individual twin packs.

I immediately check the cupboard nearby of said twin packs of cigarettes that he wanted and I inform him that we are all sold out. This is the conversation that follows:

Him: ""Are you serious?""
Me: ""Yes, sorry. We are unfortunately all sold out until we get some more.""
Him: ""This is pathetic!""
Me: ""Would you like another flavor?""
He mumbles something to me which I repeat my previous question.
Me: ""Would you like another flavor?""
Him: ""No. This unacceptable. You are refusing sale""
Me: ""Is there anything else I can help you with as we don't seem to have what you are after?""
Him: ""I would like to speak to your manager.""
Me: ""Actually there might be some here""

I had a thought and I turned around and checked the display rack to see if there are any more in the display. To which I found 4 individual twin packs sitting there, I felt like an idiot not checking there first.

Me: ""I didn't realize that there was any in the display, I...""
Him: ""Your very lucky""

Him: ""Your very lucky you found them or otherwise you would have lost hundreds and hundreds of dollars in sales and quite a few hundred customers because of your poor service.""

Drunken_Black_Belt,7,,8,1rhw8z,,59,"I'm back bitches!  About 2 months ago, I got a second job working part time at a men's Big &amp;Tall store.  The hours are easy, commision is alright, and to be honest, the customers are generally friendly and awesome.  It helps that a lot of them don't have anywhere else to shop. Unfortunantly the store isn't as eventul as my past retail jobs.  Its just selling clothes and shoes.  But I've gotten a few funny stories that I'll share over time here. And with the holiday's coming up, i'm sure I'll have plenty more.  

Welll, for your pleasure (hopefully), I present **Boy, Are My Feet Sore!**

**WARNING: GROSS!**

So recently I began working in a men's store for Big &amp; Tall sizes.  I knew of it because I buy my shoes there.  Only store that carries a size 15/16.  I am too small for the clothes, despite being 6'4 and slightly overweight.  And if I'm being honest,  seeing some of the people who come in makes me more motivated to keep losing weight (50 lbs this year alone).  

Now, don't get me wrong, SOME of the people have legitimate health concerns.  One gentleman was born with his left foot backwards.  During his childhood they would constantly have to break his foot, set it slightly closer to the proper position, let it heal, and repeat. But it never set 100% correct, keeping him from being able to run or exercise, or even stand for long periods of time.  It's guys like him I feel for.  Given a shitty deal in life and just having to suffer for it. 

Most customers, however, are just plain old fat guys.  I don't want to sound mean, or ""fat shame"".  But it's just poor lifestyle choices and such.  I was there.  I was 5lbs shy of 300 last new years.  And it was just being lazy and making bad choices.  I don't have as much sympathy for these guys.  And that brings us to our story today.

It's a sunny fall day.  It's midweek, and pretty dead.  I'm in my suit, fixing clothes, putzing around, pretty much just pretending to work.  I hear the door chime, and in walks an older couple.  Probably late 60's, very early 70's.  The lady was using a walker to move around, and the gentleman was resting his weight on a cane as he slowly moved with her.  They seemed like a nice enough couple, but as you know, those are the ones who always turn into assholes.

I introduced myself, asked how I could help them that day.  The man gruffly replied ""shoes"".  I brought them to the shoe department.  Now my store is small, and there is only one small bench to sit on, and it's in the shoe department.  Naturally, this oaf takes the seat, leaving his frail wife to stand.  I could tell she was having difficulty, being particularly petire and frail, so I went in the back and got her a folding chair to sit in next to her husband.  She thanked me, because manners.  The man, charming fellow that he was, just said ""can you get me some shoes now?"".  

It was about this time that I realized this was going to go south faster than a my ex g/f in a dick sucking contest.

I offered several suggestions, as the gentleman didn't seem to know what kind of shoes he wanted.  The man complained that most of our shoes don't even fit him. I expressed sympathy, as I have large feet and can only fit into the largest size available in store.  The man looked me up and down and sneered ""Well, you just have big feet. I have a health condition that causes this, so consider yourself lucky"".  

Eventually we found a pair he liked and thought may just fit his feet.  And that's when the real horror of this story starts.  The man then proceeds to roll up his sweatpants.  He was wearing ankle socks and sandals.  His feet are hugely swollen, and covered in open sores.  This guy has diabetes, and it's eating away at his foot.  Sadly it's fairly common where I work.  What came next, however, is not.

I hand him the shoes, and take a step back, giving him some space to put the shoes on, look at them in the mirror, see how they feel, etc.  

NOPE!  

He looks at me like an idiot and says ""Well I can't put them on myself.  I can't bend that far.  Put them on for me"".   

Now I am no fan of feet, even on a good day.  Sure if I'm dating someone, and they want a footrub, and their feet are clean, then i'll oblige.  But other than that, I just want nothing to do with that area of the body.  Add to the fact that we are talking about a stranger whose foot is literally covered in open, oozing sores.  

DBB: Sir I just can't do that, I'm sorry.

Man:  You need to help me.  I'm a customer and I need service.

DBB: There is no way I am doing that sir.  I am sorry but you have open sores on your foot and leg. It's unsanitary for both me and YOU, to have me do that.

Man: Oh just wash your hands after it'll be fine.

How this man survived 70 or so years with logic like that, will forever amaze me.  

DBB: Absolutely not.  

Man: I want the manger!  I'll have your ass for discrimination and harrassment

DBB:  I am the manager.  If you want the store manager call back tomorrow.  If you want corporate's phone number I'll give it with my name gladly.  


The man continued to yell and scream about receiving the shoes at a discount and having me fired.  Typical stuff for anyone who works in retail really.  I essentially told him that I wasn't going to touch his feet, and if he didn't like the service he could leave. Wife is trying to keep the peace.  It's not very effective.  Husband used Rage!  It's inneffective against DBB!  Besides my DEF is to high.  

Anyways, i wish there was some more to this.  Eventually he stormed out as dramatically as one can when you can barely walk under your own weight, and your wife is frail and moves about as fast a christian school girl with a chastity belt.  I did hear from corporate the next day though.  Naturally some of the details were changed when he called in, but once I explained about the sores, I receieve a ""Yea that happens all the time. Don't worry about it"".  

Sorry if it's not very exciting.  I'm sure I'll have some good ones coming up.  Hope you all are surviving the holidays!

Turns out, the woman was making a sizeable purchase and couldn't supply an adequate form of ID. I explained to her that we simply couldn't process her credit card without proper identification. She dug through her purse and tossed a bottle of birth control pills on the counter and was like ""Will this bottle work?

She then threw a world class tantrum using colorful language that would even make a seasoned sailor blush.

kyatel,6,,8,1riaxl,,46,"*sorry for any typos or errors. Typing this on my phone on lunch break*

I was working in the jewelry department of a department/grocery store at the time. I'd been in that same department for 2 years by the time this incident took place. It was very early on a Saturday, before the rush, and a lady comes up to my counter to do a return. No problemo, I thought.

Me: I can do that return for you. Can I see your receipt ma'am?

Customer: I don't have it anymore. 

Me: I'll only be able to refund it to a gift card then, is that ok?

Customer: yeah, that's fine. 

One hurdle jumped. She hands me the item and I notice that it is in a package I have never seen before. I know my department like the back of my hand cause I'm the one that checks in -all- of the merchandise. Every item that has gone into the department in the last two years had to pass by me first. 

Me: ma'am are you sure you bought this here? I don't recognize this package. 

Customer, suddenly angry: of course I bought it here. (Spoiler, this a lie)

Me: ok, let me see if the system recognizes it. 

I scan the item at the register and I get an error. I look at the barcode and it's half as long as it needs to be (6 characters instead of 12, which is the store norm). 

Me: ma'am my register does not recognize this item. 

Customer: I bought it here!

Me, getting cranky at this point: are you -sure-? I've been in the department for two years and I've never seen this package before. Are you certain you didn't buy this at [dept store x] or [dept store y]?

Customer: I'm certain. I'm returning this for a friend and she bought it here! (Told ya)

Me: I'm sorry but I can't take an Item that doesn't even come up in the system. Especially if you don't have a receipt. 

Customer snatches the item from me and pulls her cell phone out: I am going to call her (the friend) and prove to you that it was bought here!! (She's nearly screaming at this point)

The customer walks away and makes her call. I watch her patiently from the counter and wait for her to return. She finally gets her friend on the line but is far enough away that I can't hear her. She's visibly pissed off and ranting to her friend. There's a short pause as she listens to her friend. Her demeanor changes completely. She looks at me once, turns, and walks out the door, presumably to return the item at the place it was bought from. ",Just discovered this sub today.

ScaldingSoup,5,,6,1rha57,,26,"So several  years ago I worked for a very popular lingerie store.  This store didn't pay commission, but would give us more or less hours per week based on sales performance.  My sales performance was VERY good.  I got more hours a week than most people.  

During the holiday season, we had a lot of seasonal employees, as any big retail store normally does.  One of the workers hired seasonally was this lady who was a lot older than the rest of us.  This was not the problem.  Her hair was bleached blonde, and growing out (showing obvious roots), and styled in a ""feathered"" fashion.  She did not know how to wear make-up and what she wore did not flatter her.  In this store our dress code was all black.   She wore skirts with no stockings, but with slouch socks and yeah, that was a hot mess.  

People began to call her the ""missing link"", as in to the 1980s because of the hair and her wearing slouch socks that were probably black in the 1980s but grey now.  Reading this, you may think that I judged her based on this, or have some animosity for people older than me.  I do not, but this just sort of describes what she looked like because it is important.  Black Friday rolls around, and she wears her normal dress of skirt, slouch socks and what-not.  Surrounding her socks are these bells that jingle..  

She begins waving panties in the air, helicopter style, like a stripper, chanting what the sale is as customers are passing by.  One of our gay male managers passes me by and mutters so only I can hear it ""I want her out"".  I was dying trying not to laugh at the situation, and meanwhile feeling very embarrassed for her.  Everywhere she walked, she jingled.

Some time during her short career with the lingerie store, she found my phone number on the schedule.  I guess they weren't giving her enough hours, because she had the nerve to leave me a message asking me for some of mine.

BlankName55,14,,6,1rgvl7,,23,"**Background**: I work for the spark store at a mega sized location. It's a regular location with a grocery store on one side and a nursery, essentially, on the other. I work in the party/craft/office section, although I've done everything and anything, from service desk to the truck to the phones (no, I believe you want the health clinic down the street, ma'am).

**Story (er, stories)**: 

1) I walk by the front door. Man approached with wife, stopped and said Excuse Me? Fine. I go over, and he started counting out a huge wad of cash. He counts $100 in small bills out, gives it to me, then says, ""Now, I want a propane tank, honey..."" 

He got the manager who resembles an NFL player instead. (Yes, I gave him the money back.)

2) Two young guys came through the checkout line with four carts of Head &amp; Shoulders, Dove bars, and some razors, I forgot the brand. This is ***-mart, it's cheap, and that's what matters. Three products. They racked up $1800 in this stuff. The one guy then pulled out of his pocket a pile of coupons that was quite literally a foot high. Mind already blown, I said half-jokingly, ""Those aren't all for me, are they?""

Yes. Yes they were. $1500 in coupons, $3 at a time. Do the math. And you couldn't do coupon repeats. Due to the volume, the *CSM thing came up halfway through, and I said ""Oh, the supervisor's going to have to turn the key..."" and they were all ""Ok, cool.""

So they hand over the remaining $300 cash (and people pay 500-600 all the time-that was normal) and the supervisor sees the key message on the palm pilot. I had every CSM (three on duty), the front end supervisor, two assistant managers, and every loss prevention person in the building (three-two associates &amp; the manager) at the register in what seemed like two seconds. 

The guy who'd had the coupons recognized the front end supervisor. He (coupon guy) went off and started going into it with the supervisor. The friend stands there numb, all the managers start talking at me, a CSM sticks the key in to abort this transaction, and I'm standing here holding $300 cash and a hell's lot of coupons. 

Then:
The customer let out a primal yell, the supervisor took the coupons from me, stuck them in the guy's hand, and wished him a good day-anywhere else. 

Turns out they were known scammers. The coupons would scan, but we can't get money back for them. I knew something was up, but I didn't know the back story. I just was asking myself over and over after this: If it had all gone through, and they'd walked out with $1800 of soap and shampoo, what the hell were they going to do with it all? Sell it at less than cost? Fill a swimming pool? Get ridiculously clean?

Well, because the star of this story is my son but, after reading all the posts about awful parents/kids, I wanted to share a funny story about a good kid and parents who are trying their best.

This story happened when my son was 4.  It takes place in the store where I work.  I wasn't there at the time.  My son, I'll call him Cee, was browsing the toy department with his dad while they were waiting for me to finish my shift.  

While Cee and his dad are looking at the toys, a woman with two children comes into the aisle they are in.  The older of the two, who is about the same age as Cee, sees something she wants and asks her mom for it.  Mom says no.  The little girl begs and pleads but mom holds firm and keeps telling her no.  Then the girl pulls out all the stops and throws herself on the floor, kicking and screaming, in a full blown tantrum.

Cee watches for a few seconds and then walks over to the girl.  He kneels in front of her and says:  ""Well, if you act like that, you really won't get anything.""  And then he walked back to his dad.  

Cee's dad was trying hard not to laugh but the woman didn't find it so funny.  She looked embarrassed and angry.  She grabbed her kids and stormed off.

copisreallybad,4,,6,1rhulb,,22,"a few days ago, i get called down to the returns desk from the paint desk. the return policy for the chain i work at is very lenient, but we aren't supposed to take mixed paint back, so already walking down there i had a bad feeling that i would have to get a manager involved (and we all know how incompetent they can be)

so i get there, and to my surprise it's just a regular can of unmixed, white, exterior paint, which *is* returnable without manager involvement. i ask the guy what's wrong with the paint and he says that it's frozen and we need to fix it or give him another can.

i bring the can to the paint desk and open it up. now, imagine what half frozen, hardened paint looks like. that's what this paint looked like, and the following conversation sort of went like this.

me: ""this paint is frozen, did you leave it in the garage or something?""

customer (now visibly irate): ""ABSOLUTELY NOT I BOUGHT IT AND I JUST OPENED IT THIS MORNING AND TO MY SURPRISE IT LOOKS LIKE THIS""

me: ""I'm sorry but we really aren't supposed to take paint like this back, it's useless to us returned""

customer (literally about to pop a blood vessel in his brain at this point): ""WELL MAYBE IF YOU GUYS HAD FUCKING SOLD ME A GOOD CAN OF PAINT IT WOULDNT BE FUCKING FROZEN. I WANT A MANAGER, NOW""

great, this guy knows how to get what he wants. i call a manager and explain the situation to him. the manager, being a typical manager, offers him a plethora of free things, including brushes and a brand new can of paint. the customer walks away with his free things (that i have to get for him) with the smuggiest ass look on his face.

story over, right? nope. i bring the can of paint to receiving, ZMA and hazmat it (since we can't sell it, it's fucking frozen and you can't paint with it). done deal im thinking, right?

not even close, bby. picture a hambeast of a woman. ok, maybe not that big, but she had a hard time fitting inside the reach truck sometimes. she is the department head of receiving. basically she sits in receiving on her computer waiting for trucks to arrive. 

now picture her carrying the frozen can of paint to the desk, except i actually had to see it happen. 

okay, okay, what the fuck is going on, im thinking. maybe i didnt mark it down correctly or something, maybe she'll show me how to hazmat it, i have no idea. im also in the middle of explaining to an older woman the different paint finishes we sell. 

nope, she has the nerve to tell me to just ""stick it in the paint shaker for a minute or two and see if we can try and sell it as OOPS paint."" at this point im all whatthefuck.jpeg, the paint is fucking frozen and shaking it won't help. i try to explain this to her but she would have none of it and walks away, and me, being the lowly, minimum wage paint associate that i am, do as she says. i stick it on the OOPS rack and continue my day.

the story ends when the department head of paint sees it on the OOPS rack, laughs, and takes it to receiving himself to hazmat it.

One of the things he'd do would come up to me and say something along the lines of
""Hey Champ, can you cut me a piece of this ""insert fruit here"" , ive heard this batch is extra juicy"" and then once hed taste it hed spit it out and say 
""Yuck thats disgusting, im glad i wasnt going to buy it"" and just storm off. He did this to me quite a few times and hed throw the skin or peel of it onto my displays and I was quite pissed off with all of it. 

He came in and and I recognised him. And the convorsation went as follows. 

Him: Hey Champ, do you mind if I try one of these Mandarins, they seem mighty delicious. 

Me: No you cant

Him: Why the hell not?

Me: Because its shoplifting, you have no intention of buying it, youve done this before you ask if you can try some and say its disgusting then walk off and all youre going to do is peel it, take one bite leave the the rest of the fruit and peel on my display and im not paid to clean up after you and its not a buffet either, what youre doing is taking stuff you havnt paid for, so its actually theft. So no you cant!

He stood there for about 6 seconds trying to think of something to say and all he could muster up was yelling:

The only thing we have to deal with really is the law which is one of the more annoying things. People who steal metal makes it tough for the honest guys who recycle.

I get several customers who come in every day or several times a week (we're open 6 days a week, 9 to 5). 80% of these customers are never ready. We require valid ID for every transaction and though I remember a good amount of people's names, some I don't. Those that know I ask for ID every time never had it ready. While they're standing in line why wouldn't they pull it out of their wallets instead of when they are at the front of the line? Or sign the receipt which is also required by law. I have to ask them EVERY SINGLE TIME. It's very frustrating. I go through the same thing every day and they never learn. I also get several customers who don't even speak English which is also frustrating. How can I ask you for things that are required by law when you don't speak my language? Most of them when I ask for ID just nod their heads. What are you nodding too? I asked for something, I didn't ask you to agree with me...

BefuddledBison,2,,3,1ric04,,24,"Howdy TFR. Turns out /u/BaffledBuffalo is taken on Gmail and Xbox Live so I changed my username to match my other accounts. At least my one post with it was sort of a one-hit wonder. 

Anyway, this next story was also from Barschmucks. If I didn't mention before, this was a franchise location inside of a large supermarket. We were technically employees of the supermarket even though we were real certified baristas. But this meant that many of our coworkers were cashiers and stock guys. One of the stock guys was Otis. He was a huuuuuge black dude who didn't converse much when he came by for his free cup of ice water but seemed like a pretty good guy.

I wasn't working when this happened, but my AST (Evan) told me about it. It's dead and he's just cleaning up waiting for the last few stragglers to wander in when Otis cruises up to the counter. Evan asks him what he'd like but Otis doesn't say anything and just stares at the menu. Evan goes back to cleaning while Otis contemplates the meaning of life. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Otis opening up the tea rack and fumbling for a tea bag (already this is a no-no, not only are we the only ones supposed to touch that tea, but we have to use tongs because it goes right in a customer's drink.) 

Evan doesn't have time to say anything before Otis lifts a bag to his nose and takes a deep whiff. 

He goes: ""What is this? Vanilla Rooibos? (He pronounced it ""roo-bis""; it's actually ""roy-bohs"".) Mmmmmmm. If a girl smell like dis, I'd lick her all *up* and down.""

Then, as quickly as he came, he put the tea back back, and left without saying a word. 

Evan dumped out all the Vanilla Rooibos and replaced it (not a big deal, nobody gets it anyway.)

**TL;DR:** Large man sexually assaults a tea bag in the middle of our store and left my coworker to clean up the mess.

Also, for anyone wondering why we keep the tea where the customers can reach it, it's because apparently people need to be able to see the bags before they can pick a drink for some reason.

j-sap,3,,5,1rigon,,17,"Some back story: I work the front desk at a gym a couple of days a week after class. We specialize in helping people with injuries and have a very specialized staff, program, and equipment. We are attached to an apartment complex that is spread out over a couple of buildings. The laundry for the complex is in the building adjacent to us. Now to use the laundry machines you are required to use a proprietary card that has to be purchased from a machine. I don't know what someone was smoking one day but instead of putting the machine that dispenses and allows people to add money to there card next to the laundry machines (even though there is plenty of room), someone decided to put the machine in the lobby of the gym. 

Where I work I have a very large window that overlooks the parking lot and see everyone who comes and goes and where people park. I had someone park or fly in the handicap spot (we'll call him Scumbag Steve or SS to keep things simple). SS jumps out of the car and runs full sprint into the lobby to add money onto his laundry card. After a minute or so I hear a knock on the window and we a quick interaction that goes like this:

SS: ""Hey yo man you got change for a $20?""

Now I absolutely do have the change for this guy in my drawer but if I used it then I would not have any for transaction at my desk.

Me: ""Sorry.""

SS: ""Yo man what about in your wallet, I know you can personally make me change?""

Now I am taken aback a little from this second question and am smart enough to never take out personal items around customers or even let them know where personal things are. I take a couple of seconds to think about everything and then respond.

Me: ""No I don't, but we have a great physical therapy program if you are interested.""

SS: ""Man why would I be interested in physical therapy, I am as fit as a horse?""

Me: ""Because you parked in a handicap spot and those spots are almost always full of clients.""

SS just sort of gave me a defeated look and slinked out the door and back to his car. He was back 20-30 minutes later and was good enough to not park in the handicap spot, instead he pulled up to the curb and made people walk around his vehicle.

adelajoy,0,,1,1ri8kg,,22,"I spent two years working at a big warehouse-style grocery store. I worked mostly as a cashier, but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a week.

Most of the crappy moments have all blurred together, but there are a few particular moments that stick out.

I realize this isn't the craziest story on here, but I will probably never forget this lady. 

Backstory: Our store had a policy that if an item scanned differently than the price tag, the customer would get it for free, up to $10. The mistake happened because the price tag didn't get changed, or was misplaced. If they spotted a problem, we would go look. If we found a tag in front of their item with the same code and a different price, we gave it to them and changed the tag. If the tag was for a different item, they didn't get anything. 

I was working the customer service desk, and a lady stormed up. I had several customers on the go at the moment, but it was pretty clear she *needed* help right away. As soon as I could, I asked what I could help her with. She was holding a bottle of toilet cleaner, her receipt and a price tag. Let's call her Crazy Customer, CC for short.

**CC**: ""I bought this bottle of toilet cleaner, but it was the wrong price! You guys are trying to charge me too much!""

**Me**: ""Okay, can I see your receipt?""

**CC**: *Hands me the receipt.* ""I tried to tell the cashier, but she didn't believe me!""

**Me**: *I checked who her cashier was, and it was one of our long-time girls. She knew the policy. There was no way she ""didn't believe"" the customer.* ""Okay, so the price came up $3.99, I'll just send a price-checker out to see what the tag said.""

**CC**: ""Oh, I grabbed the price tag already."" *She hands me the price tag. This lady is pretty worked up,  I'm not sure if she just wants to get out of the store, or if she's trying to pull one on me.*

A policy was that the tag had to be on the shelf. If a customer brings it to you, who's to say they didn't take it off the shelf last week and save it? They also could have found it in the wrong place, somewhere that the stock employees wouldn't have checked to fix the tag. As with most stores I've been to, store policy is to inform the customer about the relative store policies, and then see if you can help them anyways. No matter the problem.

It study the tag, and inform her of the policy, that the tag would have to be on the shelf. I start to let her know I can contact a manager, but she snatches the tag back and interrupts me.

**CC**: ""Well if that's your policy, I'll just put it back on the shelf! I was trying to save you some goddamn work, but I guess if you guys want to work extra, I'll just go put it back!""

She took off before I could say anything. I was just standing at the desk, aghast. I didn't even know what to say. 

The supervisor that was on shift was the scary kind. You know, the kind that isn't afraid to yell a little, handles the worst customers, and isn't phased when people call her names. Let's call her Jane. When the woman was gone, I grabbed Jane and told her the whole story. She said, ""Okay. When she comes back, let me know who she is. I'll handle her.""

As soon as I saw the customer coming back, I hissed, ""Jane! Jane! Jane! White hat! That's her."" I then ducked behind the display at customer service, and quite actually hid back there until the customer was gone. I could hear her yelling at Jane. I don't know what the verdict was. Any other manager, and the customer would have gotten the item for free, but it's hard to say with Jane.

I remember one of my coworkers came around the display and exclaimed my name. I hushed them, and told them I was hiding. I was so afraid the woman would see me and do one of those, ""Her! That's the one I was talking to! She told me this!"" And drag me back into it.

I've never hid from a customer before or since. Oh! Fun fact: The price tag she was holding said $3.29, a $0.70 difference from what she paid, and the tag was dated for the week before, which means it wasn't the current price. Not to say it wasn't still on the shelf, but there is a chance she did save it and bring it back in, especially with how worked up she was.

Thank goodness for thick-skinned supervisors who can handle being yelled at.","""I guess if you guys want to work extra, I'll just go put it back!""",23,talesFromRetail
Dannythegirl,5,,6,1rh77t,,7,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this but I needed to share. Long time lurker of this subreddit. On my phone, sorry for wall. 
I am a customer in this story, but former multi-year service/retail employee.
Today, I was grocery shopping with my two very little children. Not a huge chain store, but prominent in my state for supporting local foods. Many locations. 
I got in line to check out after an eventful and frustrating trip around the store with the kids. There was an elderly man checking out ahead of me. He was friendly and talkative to my kids and was asking me about my tattoos while we were waiting. The cashier was probably 55, spacey, but very sweet woman. When it was old guys turn to check out, I overheard their conversation at the register, and it was obvious they were both long time veterans to the store. 
The man had some trouble checking out. He rang his credit card through the machine multiple times while chatting with the cashier and he seemed confused. Eventually, she explained that he didn't have to keep swiping his card, and that his transaction was complete. In the mean time, she was scanning my items. 
The cashier chatted up a storm with me too. Asking about my kids while I was trying to wrangle them. I was getting a little impatient at this point because my 1 and 3 year old were ready to get the hell out of there, but I listened to her stories with patience. She was kind too.
When she finished scanning my food I pulled my card out to run through the machine, but it was asking for a signature, when I hadn't scanned my card yet. 
Me: ""there must be a mistake, I haven't slid my card through but it's already asking for a signature""
Cashier: ""no, you did, you must have forgot"" -looks at screen- ""you swiped your America express""
Me: ""No, I don't have an Amex, see?.. Oh no did the man in front of me swipe his card while you were ringing me up?""
Cashier: ""uh oh, that must have been what happened""
She looked panicked, but printed the receipt and said ""I'll just do this"" AND SIGNED THE RECEIPT
Cashier: ""He'll be okay, he can be so spacey. Don't even worry about it""
She at first folded up the receipt like she was going to trash it but I asked her if that was really ok, and that I could wait for a manger. She unfolded the receipt and told me not to worry. There was a long line behind me and frankly I was ready to get the fuck out of there with my crazy kids. I asked her ""are you sure? I feel uncomfortable"" 
She told me not to worry, and to go ahead and leave. And I did. 
I think her career might have ended today.
TLDR; Elderly man in line ahead of me accidentally paid for my groceries, cashier eventually realized but didn't give a fuck to fix it. I got free groceries :/

EDIT/UPDATE: I can see how it looks like I was unsympathetic in my post. I was in fact, horrified. I know the groceries weren't free, I just did not pay for them. In my car, I wrote down the time, my total $78.43 and what I thought the mans total was before me $43, and the name of the cashier. I should have stuck around and put my foot down but I was flustered and unsure how to proceed.  I was planning on calling when I got home, and totally forgot about the whole thing until I was in bed redditing from my phone late at night.
This morning I called and spoke with a manager, giving him all of my information. I told him I would happily come back and pay for the groceries and to please make sure the man did not actually get charged (hoping the cashier took the issue to the manager after I left). He said he will look into the receipts from last night and give me a call back. I will update again when I hear from him.

insecure_shit_knob,3,,2,1rie8h,,21,"Short and sweet one today. For new readers of my stories (welcome back to the other three), I'm a front end manager at a giant retail chain. Dealing with customers and cashiers is my job, and I only have the job because I'd rather work than be bored. I have enough money to not work, so I am not scared of losing my job.


On to the story:

One of my favorite cashier's (seriously, she's so sweet and helpful. I always drop what I'm doing to answer her questions because she's one of the three that I trust) calls me over for a price check on a set of plates. Customer says they were $29.99, but when I go check they're $49.99. She says that's fine and she pays for them. Done and over, right?

Wrong.

About ten minutes later she comes over to my podium. I already know she's getting coal from me in her stockings (merry Christmas bitch).

Her- ""I was just over there looking at the plates again. They were there just in the wrong spot.""

Me- ""I'm sorry ma'am, I'll let an associate know so he can fix it. I'm a little busy to get to it."" Which I was, I was getting five different change orders ready.

Her- ""Isn't it your job to fix it?""

Me- ""actually no it's not. I'm the front end manager. There are two managers who work in that area, it's actually their job technically. If I would've seen the plates,I would've put them in the right spot.""

Her- ""So you're just a lazy asshole.""

Ok, I'm done. I talk to everyone in a civil manner, but when they take that tone with me, I'm done.

Me- ""yep""

Her- ""You're not going to fix it?""

Me- ""Nope, too lazy right now.""

This was followed by more angry questions and statements until I walked away to deliver my change orders. She tracked an assistant manager down and let him have it about my attitude. He's a pretty cool guy, came up to me later, asked what the deal was and just laughed when I told him. Now he always asks if I'm lazy today when he sees me.

I don't remember much from it except for this story. Working storefront; typical day, typical customers. This older, possibly Italian gentleman came up and I asked to take his order.

Man: May I see your hand?

I think I just stood there looking at him for a moment. He had an Italian accent so I was thinking I may have misheard him, and asked for his order again. He held his hand out and insisted to see mine.

Now, this guy didn't look creepy or scary or anything. If so I would have just bolted. But I was 17 and put on the spot so I gave him my hand.

Man: What is your name?

At the time I still had my ""Trainee"" name tag so it wasn't on there. I don't know why I gave him my name. I didn't really know what else to do.

He then proceeded to serenade me in front of the entire store. Granted, there were only about 10 people around. He held my hand with enough force that I could not easily pull it away and I stood there flushed red while the rest of the staff laughed at me. Apparently it's happened before.

He sang in deep Italian (and I heard my name thrown in there) for a good two minutes before he let me go.

I was volunteering at a local zoo for a special Halloween event for about 3 - 4 hours. It was the last night of the event, and I was in charge of handing out prizes for games. It was a pretty good job, and I got to have as much free soda as I wanted, since I was in the concessions booth. I had to set out prizes, read tickets to see how many points a kid had, tell them how much each prize was (They could mix and match), then calculate how many points they had left as they chose. They'd choose their prizes, I'd hand it to them, and they'd leave. 

I had a friend of mine with me for the first hour, and we split the customers when it got busy. (Around 5 people at the same time.) At one point I spilled my soda, and she handled the crowd as I cleaned up the mess.

Then she left. Oh god.

I was left to set out prizes for display, serve customers, and translate kid-speak by myself. At some points I was so swamped with customers that I could barely figure out the total points for each kid as they got prizes.

Another girl came it at low tide, but left before it got busy again. (Around twenty minutes.) I wasn't allowed to leave my station to try and find her, so I had to deal with all the customers alone. (She wasn't actually allowed to leave either, but she gave zero fucks. Bitch.)

Scott5114,0,,3,1riony,,13,"I've met a lot of strange customers in my time at the casino. This guy takes the cake as the most fucked-up, unpleasant guy that's ever darkened our doorstep. We'll call him Dick because he is one.

To begin with, Dick is in the casino for a fucked-up reason. He's dying of cancer, or some other terminal disease. He spends his last days in our casino trying to win an inheritance for his children. Of course, mathematics says it's not going to happen, so he's squandering what money he does have and the remainder of his life sitting in a smoky room with no natural light playing $25 per spin on a slot machine. 

I wouldn't judge him so harshly for that if he wasn't a colossal asshole. Pretty much everyone who has had to pay a jackpot for him has some sort of unpleasant experience to share. Mine was when I was processing a jackpot for him and I go to clear the jackpot message from the screen. See, if you win, say, $1500, and you had $80 in credit when you hit it, when the attendant clears the jackpot your $80 will still be left on the machine. People sometimes forget or don't know this, and will leave the money on the machine and walk away, so after clearing it most of us will say ""You still have $80 left on the machine."" Of course, when I mention this to Dick, he flies into a rage, screaming ""I CAN SEE THAT! GOD!"" I started dodging his jackpots when I knew where he was playing after that—I don't put up with that sort of BS—though I still had to pay him out a couple of times after that because I didn't realize who it was. 

And Dick did hit a lot of jackpots. He would usually destroy the copy of the W2-G tax forms we would give him, I guess thinking since he's dying he won't need to worry about paying taxes, though you would think he would realize his kids would be on the hook for all of it. He also had the tendency to swear ambiguously so you never really knew whether he was calling the machine or you a piece of shit. Management had talked to him a couple of times about treating the attendants better. He did tip the bare minimum to not be considered an ass in that department, at least.

All of that is backstory to properly put in context what happened this week. At this point, Dick's managed to piss off enough attendants that most of the shift is dodging his calls, so it takes him probably twice as long to get someone over there than it would anyone else. This, coupled with the fact that he's losing heavily, pisses him off. 

Management gets called over to a machine in my section. I'm generally pretty curious about these things, so I head over there. The machine's touchscreen (retail price quoted to me by a tech as $700 or so) is totally shattered. The machine still has $20 on it—with an inoperable touchscreen, there's no way to cash that out on this machine. There's a patron further down the bank who saw the whole thing. Said the guy was losing, got pissed, punched the screen, threw a piece of paper down, and stormed off. One of the managers that showed up picks up the paper.

It's a torn-up W2-G with Dick's name, address, and social security number on it. A little bit of searching in the computers turns up copies of his driver license and the hotel room he is in. And of course the whole incident is caught on tape.

We don't know what happened to Dick after that. Apparently it became the responsibility of the casino's assistant general manager, and she isn't talking. We're all watching the usual locations for ban notices to go up, though.",The worst casino patron in the world,16,talesFromRetail
GlowingBall,2,,2,1rioer,,16,"These are my Tales of Retail Loss Prevention....

Part Three – Citizen Snips (Aka - The Pants Aquatic)



As a recap for those of you who have never read one of my stories before – I am a male in the midwest who is on the wrong side of his twenties and works retail loss prevention for a major retailer (one of the 'Big 5').  I am underpaid for what I do but enjoy my job none the less.  A majority of my time is spent wandering the floor or watching middle aged moms shop for clothing far too skimpy on them via CCTV (closed circuit television or 'security cameras').  Every once in awhile I get a case that is just so mind blowingly 'WTF' that I have to share.  

This story opens up with me doing just as I said above – watching people on CCTV.  It is a blisteringly cold afternoon so the customers, far more content to stay in their warm homes and snuggled beneath their blankets, are few and far between.  I, as the ever watchful hawk of justice that I am, was busy playing a Marvel version of Candy Crush Saga.  My job provides me the liberty of slacking off a good amount and my boss is rather lenient as long as I continue to bring in a good amount of stops per month.  I am sitting there diligently trying to match up small colored tiles with one another when I am startled by a sudden ring – the phone is going off!  

Now the phone going off is common place.  We get tons of calls a day ranging from the frozen dairy department calling to tell us a temperature alarm is going off (we know...it goes off for us as well) to people asking us to deactivate a door alarm (we also know...we see you standing at the door).  This happened to be a call from one of the few places that doesn't call us often – the meat department.  The guy on the other end, a tall black man with more muscle than he knows what to do with, calls to tell us that there is a guy standing in front of the freshly butchered meat.  The guy has refused any help the meat employee has offered and continues to say he is 'just browsing' for over ten minutes.  This strikes me as rather odd.  Who just hangs out around the meat department?  I quickly devise a plan for the situation.  I tell the employee to walk into the back so I could see just what the person was going to do.  

The employee hangs up and walks over to the man to let him know he is going to be into the back and to ring the bell if he needs anything.  No sooner than when he had walked into the back but the man glanced around and then walked behind the counter.  My adrenaline already began to rush as my suspicions came to fruition – he was going to steal!  “Oh shit here we go, ” I declared, only to watch in confusion and frustration as he walked right past all the glass displays full of meat and right over to the lobster tank.  Now if you aren't familiar with these tanks they are exactly just what the name implies – a water filled tank full of live lobsters we sell by the pound.  Their claws are bound and they just kind of hang out crawling all over one another.  Kids love to sit there and watch them.

“No way...is he really going to...” I whispered as I watched on in awe.  Sure enough he reached right into the live lobster display tank we have.  After a moment of 'fishing around' he plucked the lobster he wanted from the tank and pulled it out of the water.  Before I could even make heads or tails of the situation he glanced around once more and shoved the lobster right down the front of his pants.  The guy, whom shall be hence forth called Lobster Johnson, then proceeded to shuffle run his way out of the meat department and through the grocery department towards the front of the store.  The only way I can really describe how he ran was a forward version of Zoidberg's shuffle.  All he was missing was yelping out “Woop woop woop woop!” loudly as he went.  

Needless to say he wasn't too hard to stop.  I may not be in the best shape of my life but I can still move quicker than a guy with a large lobster squirming around in his pants.  He didn't fight me at the door or even try to argue what he was doing.  After all, it is kind of hard to argue that you aren't stealing when you have a large, lobster shaped bulge in your pants.

Bonus icing on top of the cake: I usually ask the person why they are stealing.  It usually won't change anything but it fulfills my curiosity and keeps them talking which usually calms them down a bit.  This guy tried to say that he was stealing the lobster for his kids...

As I come around a corner in said hallway I almost bump into our Store Manager (SM from here on out) who is in the middle of cleaning the bathrooms.  SM and I start chatting and from the men's room I hear some loud noises.

""Damn kids screwing around."" SM replies as he sets down the bag of trash he had been holding and walks over to the men's room.

Now, SM isn't a particularly tall guy, but he lifts weights quite a bit and could very well be described as being jacked.  Somehow, from time to time, people think it is a good idea to fight him, so I stuck around in case he needed backup.

SM opens the men's room door hard, slamming it into the wall and bellows, ""What the HELL are you doing in my bathroom?""

--inaudible reply--

""Yeah, well it is a pretty sad day when I have to kick someone out of the bathroom, now get the hell out."" SM says at a slightly reduced volume.

""B..But my stomach hurts."" says a meek voice from inside the bathroom.

Then at a normal volume, but with a tone of voice that sounded like SM had ice in his veins he replies, ""Carry it somewhere else.""  Then he stared into the bathroom in a manner that was somewhat intense.

To avoid angry customers being stuck with something they dont like, we offer a 'comfort guarantee' where you have 90days to decide you dont like it and come exchange it for something else. This comes with a fee of $200 as we have to throw the like new mattress out.  

STORY: In comes a guy. Hes visibly upset, all I can think is [""here we go""](http://i.imgur.com/8MmamRX.gif) lets call him Angry Asshat(AA)

AA: I hate my mattress! 

ME: Im so sorry to hear that sir woul-

(he cut me off)

AA: I want my money refunded immediately, and I want you to come get that shit off my property **Today**

ME: Im very sorry but we cant refund your money. 

AA: [WHAT?! WHAT DO YOU MEAN](http://i.imgur.com/HouBhTG.gif)

ME: Well sir its illegal in the state of North Carolina to take used mattresses and we cant take it back. 

AA: WELL I WANT IT THE FUCK BACK NOW I DONT RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE([he was just yelling nonsense at me about how this is whats wrong with the world and its all the dirty liberals fault](http://i.imgur.com/OudLd7s.gif))

ME: Sir, I cannot break the law for you. Not only is it the store policy its **the law**

Now hes raging, but Im trying to salvage the situation

ME: What we can do for you though is our 90 day comfort guarantee swap out. Can I have your name Ill look your ticket up and well see what we can do. 

He seems to calm down a little bit and he takes a seat across from my desk and he gives me hi name. I look up his name and pull up his ticket as Im explaining the comfort guarantee I look at his ticket. And then at the date he bought it(ya know to make sure its at least close to 90 days) I was willing to be flexible to make this guy happy when I notice he bought this mattress 9months ago!! Im flexible but not *that* flexible

ME: Uhh Sir, Im sorry to say this but you bought this mattress 9months ago, that 6months over the 90days. Theres nothing we can do for you. 

That when he became absolutely IRATE with me. Screaming something about how this is bad business practice, he deserves to get a refund, we owe it to him. Blah blah blah. [Im done this this shit](http://i.imgur.com/InDPcFn.gif)

ME: SIR. There is nothing we can do, the comfort exchange policy was explained to you when you bought it, if you didnt like the mattress you should have come back 6months ago, now Im going to have to ask you to leave the store. 

Well he didnt like that very much. He was becoming increasingly angry and hostile. Hes leaning over my desk pointing his finger right in my face([Which I hate](http://i.imgur.com/u77ThfE.gif)) but I keep my cool, and as sternly as I can say

ME: Sir if you dont leave immediately I will be forced to call the police and have you removed from my store. 

He paused for a moment with sheer rage in his eyes. Then he SLAPS!(yes slaps) the coffee on my desk across the 5mattresses that are close to my desk, gives me the finger and walkes out! I was in shock I composed myself quickly, called the police, and then my boss and explained everything that happened. 

I guess that asshat forgot that he gave us his address to deliver the mattress to, he ruined about 5beds which he was made to pay sticker price for on all of them(sticker price is close to $300 more than what we normally sell for) 


Although I was scared I made a great commission on all the beds he had to replace. There was justice that day and it was great.

jessajuhanabi,30,,94,1rhnqp,,397,"As of last Thursday, I am the head manager of a retail outlet and cafe, answering only to my boss, since the only girl above me quit. All people that walk in, call or email come through me. My boss is normally around but he works on coffee machines most days. 

As backgound for this story: His brother is a c*nt. I live in Australia, so that term seriously fits him. He owes a bunch of people money, is generally an asshole, and my boss is very sad his brother has changed so much. It stresses my boss out as their finances are tied due to a trust. 

Today, a lady walks in around 11:30, and walks up to the front desk. Politely, she asks me, ""Is (boss) in?""

In my mind, she was another person that he knew since he's been running this business for 20+ years, or a rep from some company that I didn't care about. He turned around to look at her, and I pointed in his direction. 

She immediately starts spouting about how boss's brother, we'll call him AH for asshole, owed her money. This is not a surprise to boss. He knows her. He's heard from her over email before. In which he told her he has no access to the trust and he's also fighting AH for money. 

This does not please the lady, henceforth known as douchecanoe. DC repeats over and over, despite pleas from my boss to chase down AH, ""I'm not leaving without my money. Get it for me.""

Now, DC wants a hefty sum. A couple thousand dollars. My boss offers her a coffee while he tries to reach AH. A water. A chair. Nothing. She stands in front of our stock and repeats herself over and over. ""Give me my money. Give me my money. I don't care its not my problem. YOU pay me.""

Why is she going after my boss? Because she's gone through the courts, they told AH to pay, and he still hasn't. Her response? Come into my store and stand there all day every day until HIS BROTHER, pays her. 

Now, my boss tries and tries to get her to understand he has no access to the money. No go. So instead she stands in our store, silent, for 4 fucking hours. Four. DC stands there so long my boss gets fed up and stressed, and leaves. 

The difference is, he's a peace keeper. I was itching for him to leave. I was just going to have the cops come eject her. I was EXCITED. 

Unfortunately she realized rather quickly I was not the ""nice cop"" type so she stood out the front, called in a few friends and intermittently yelled ""YOU KNOW THIS IS SO SILLY I JUST WANT MY MONEY FROM THE (BUSINESS)"" and ""I KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE IN XXXX SUBURB I COULD RUIN A BUSINESS IF I WANTED TO."" through the window at me. 

Oh god. You scare me so much. I might pee my pants. 

Anyway she eventually gave up and left without coming back inside, probably since I was watching her and smiling, willing her to come inside so I could call the cops. 

Oh well, another day I suppose! Maybe she'll be back tomorrow...

SS_material,103,,89,1rhs01,,308,"I work in a Pet store, and had a lady check out, take her stuff to her car, come back in, ask for the bathroom directions, and came back to me asking for a manager.

Now when I was calling my managers phone, I had asked her if there was a reason and she replied, ""Oh yeah, there's a reason alright.""

Hmm..okay. I told my manager and she came to the front to talk to the lady. She had stepped to the side, away from me and talked to her. Then she began to tell another customer what happened sayinf ""that's just anti christian! Can you beleieve that?""

So I think to myself, oh boy what sign pissed her off. Because we have celebrate the season everywhere. Later, I asked my manager what she had complained about and she told me that she was upset because I didn't tell her Merry Christmas.

What...it's not even Thanksgiving yet! My manager did say it's fine, and that I'm not in trouble. I don't have to tell her Merry Christmas, or Happy Holidays unless I wanted to. I started my first retail job in August of this year, so it's gonna be fun during the holidays when people get angry at me for ""offending"" them.

DolfyuttSrednaz,58,,48,1rh8hc,,200,"I have got to say, after working 4 years in retail, parents should be responsible for their children's actions. I have seen so many kids acting like demons that have just spawned from a dimension full of pointy sticks being shoved up their asses, but I never blame the kids. I usually don't even blame the parents, because kids are kids, but when customers blatantly let their kids run around like Sonic on meth, I blame the parents. that is why we have an announcement that plays every few minutes, reminding customers to keep their little shits in line. So when a customer like the one I had comes in, I usually inform my manager (who will be called Jared) of the situation and he watches the kid from a distance. 

A middle-aged couple stumbles into the store with their 7 year old son. They head off to furniture, but their son makes a bee-line to toys. I immediately call Jared, and let him know that this little tornado is heading to toys and he should try to contain the damage as much as possible. Before the kid makes it to toys, he stops over in the Halloween section and starts putting on masks and runs around the store trying to scare the other customers. After 4 complaints, Jared stops the kid, and drags him to his parents, who don't give one shit nor a giggle about what my manager has to say and wave him off. The kid bolts towards toys, and stars ripping toys down off the shelf. The floor looks like a miniature Antietam by the time he is finished. Now he has an armload of toys and decides to take them to the bathroom. Once in there, he places them on the floor, and proceeds to urinate on them. Jared walks in on him finishing up, and drags the kid back to his parents, leaving a trail of piss footprints behind him. Jared tells the parents what he did, and that they have to clean up the mess. This switches the parents into rage mode. They just cannot BELIEVE that their kid would do this! And he will be punished severely when they get home. Jared tells them calmly ""I am punishing you, not your child. You guys made no effort to control him, and even brushed me off after the first incident. You guys will clean up every mess he has made, and then you can leave. You are no longer welcomed here."" They start yelling profanities at him and their kid, saying how this is ridiculous and they shouldn't have to put up with this. 

After they cleaned up, they left empty handed. Jared received many compliments on how he handled the situation. It is the second worst customers I have ever had, even if I didn't directly deal with them. The worst, by far, has to be a couple out of towners. That is for another day though.

racheecakes,8,,48,1rhjav,,206,"This sub is usually full of complaints and although I have quite a few I have a short, nice story to tell. I work in the dining room at one of the lovely bakery/cafe chains in America. We are very lax on people lingering in our cafe, especially the homeless. We allow them to stay in our building in the single comfortable chairs for as long as they want as long as they're not pestering our customers. (It's not like we're hobo central, there are only two or three regulars). Usually our lunch rushes are filled with self centered people or angry people who just spent a dick load of money on presents for people they really didn't want to spend money on (we're located in a mall parking lot). In the midst of the chaos, bread bowls, and dirty tables I notice a customer approaching an obvious homeless man. This catches my eye so I go over and start cleaning a nearby table and eavesdrop. The customer hands the homeless man a gift card to our cafe for fifty dollars. He told him to stay full during this holiday season, to have a good one, and clenched his shoulder in a very comforting, almost fatherly like way. He walked away and back to his table before the homeless man got to say a word. The look on the homeless man's face was something worth remembering. It was nice to see someone think of someone they did not even know.

aturquoiseseashell,12,,25,1rg9do,,127,"End of shift at a famous, upscale department store, and I am already clocked out, with my purse on. I'm talking to my coworkers before I leave because I'm waiting on a ride home. I work in the lingerie department, which is near one of the 2nd story entrance doors to the store. 

A flustered woman comes up with three bags, one from Kate Spade, one from Michael Kors, and one from Tory Burch. She says she found the bags in the vestibule of the entrance to the store.
We thank her for her honesty and promise to call Loss Prevention to come and take the bags. She becomes agitated.

""Well I'm going to wait here and see that you do it,"" she snaps. She's suddenly riled up.

We're a bit taken aback, but continue to be polite to her and my coworker calls LP.

While my coworker waits on the phone to be connected to the security desk, I guess we kind of exchanged looks. (She was very antsy, and was holding onto the bags for dear life). The woman exclaims in outrage, ""Don't you all roll your eyes at me!"" 

""Ma'am,"" says my co-worker, ""No one is rolling their eyes. We're waiting for security to pick up the phone. They will make sure the bags are returned to the customer. Thank you very much for bringing them to our attention, we will see to it that they are returned to the customer."" 

The woman becomes more agitated and irritated. Finally, security picks up and my coworker says, ""A customer found some bags; one's from MK, one is from Tory Burch…""
The woman snaps, before my coworker is quite finished, ""And one from Kate Spade!!"" as though we purposely left that one out so we could steal it or something. 

""And one from Kate Spade,"" my co-worker adds. We're all getting kind of insulted by this woman's attitude. She seems convinced we're plotting to steal the bags, despite the fact that they remain in plain sight of the security camera. We're all well-dressed, well-spoken girls in our early twenties, and we are acting calm and polite. No apparent cause for suspicion.

Security says they can't help and to turn the bags into customer service, who coworker speaks to.
""Ma'am, please give me the bags. Customer service is coming to pick them up,"" my coworker says. We really want her to leave at this point. She's staring at us through narrowed eyes and she's breathing heavily.

""No!"" the woman shrieks, and clutches them to her chest. She tears frantically at one of them and finds a receipt. She begins dialing the number of Kate Spade. We're stunned.
""Please, ma'am…"" the coworker begins, but the woman literally shushes her and begins frantically reading the details of the receipt to the cashier at Kate Spade who is on the other end of the phone. 

She convinces an employee at Kate Spade to come to the dept. store to identify the bags.
Meanwhile, she announces that she will take the bags to customer service herself, in a very angry tone. ""You all are acting VERY suspicious!"" she declares, still clutching the bags to her breast almost maniacally. 

At this point, we're pretty alarmed by her behavior and beginning to wonder if she plans to steal the bags herself after seeing the prices on the receipt. My coworker calls the store manager, and we inform the customer that we would prefer that she remain in lingerie with the bags and wait for the manager. She loudly refuses to stay put. My coworker follows her to customer service.

From all the way in our department on the other end of the floor, we can hear the woman yelling. She had a quavery voice and a really strong British accent. 
Apparently, she got to customer service, and the couple who had left the bags was there. The woman refused to give them the bags without proof of their identity!! Finally the Kate Spade employee arrived and confirmed that yes, the bags belonged to the couple. 

I guess the woman was trying to do the right thing, but she insulted my coworkers and me and frightened various customers in the process. I still don't get why she became so suspicious or why she didn't just bring the bags to customer service in the first place. Of course, since we were lowly retail workers we must have been plotting to steal the lost merchandise.

KroipyBill,11,,40,1rhynu,,123,"After [writing about our cheering seasonal workers from Black Friday yesterday,](http://redd.it/1rf92j) it reminded me of this other story involving my goofy manager. 

When I first started working for this place, I came in clean shaven, and patchy hair. I was in denial that mother nature was closing my hair follicles for business, and it wasn't until after my engagement photos I decided to make a change. I shaved my head and have kept it that way ever since. I then grew a goatee to compensate for my loss. Honestly I looked much sharper than having the grassy field of hair you can see the horizon through. It was a relief to embrace it, and feel like I looked decent again. There was one manager who enjoyed messing with me however. In fact in my previous stories, I've quoted him several times in our conversations, since he was my favorite manager to talk to, and the biggest goof ball there. He vowed he would draw on my head when I wasn't ready for it. 

**Me:** Dude I'm taller than you. So unless you parachute from the rafters onto my cranium with your sharpie, you will not succeed. 

**Manager:** We'll see...we'll...see...

At that moment I wondered if he really was contemplating that attack strategy. At least he left it at just contemplating. 

One day, we were pretty busy. It was pre-holiday, post-black Friday days. I'm sure you all know the type. Everybody is getting geared up for Christmas. I found my way over to the computer department helping a customer decide what Mac they wanted. I was describing the hardware specs, how it works with their Apple products etc. During this I felt I was going to make a decent sale. However I made a massive mistake...

*I sat down.* 

Yes I slipped up big time. My manager saw this opportunity from what it seemed immediately. He walked over and distracted me by having another employee ask me a question. 

**Employee:** Hey KroipyBill you know where I can find [some bullcrap item that he knew the answer to.]

**Me:** Yeah sure. Remember they're eh...ahh...AHH!!!

Right then, my manager walks up to me with his pen, and I felt the coldness of the ballpoint touch my head, while it was dragged across my chrome dome. My entire body froze as if somebody stiffed my spine. I made a weird breathing noise, like I was experiencing sharp pains when it was just mainly a very tiny cold piece of metal on my head. Kind of like EAHH!! EAHH!! EAHH!!! (That's the best I can do textually.) They were quiet, sharp noises.

He walked off, cackling like the joker. I looked at my customer with this super surprised look on my face. He lost his crap, and just laughed. Because of this I sold him more attachments, but that's beside the point. 

Over the radio:

**Me:** The person who drew on my head. You know who you are. Thanks for helping my sale out by doodling with a ballpoint pen on my cranium. 

I looked around the store and saw those with a radio express such confusion. I'm a pretty tall dude, so for those who were in eye sight, I bent my head down so they could see the graffiti my manager brought forth upon my person. Much laughter followed, including my manager.

**Manager:** You said I would never get you. 

**Me:** Well bucket head, you're lucky I was sitting so your midget self could strike me. 

**Manager:** My strike is now complete. 

**Me:** It's a good thing I don't just go over there and rub my greasy head all over your face. I'm glad you feel all militaristic about your approach. 

**Manager:** Oh...this would be a much more fun Call of Duty game if this were part of the game play. 

I never got him back. And he has since left the store after I left. Despite us still being good friends, he's still a bucket head.

It was a beautiful sunny day, which is not common in these parts from oh...October to May.

At this point I realized that I'm dealing with some sort of royalty by the way she's talking to me and looking at me like I was clearly beneath her.    
    
We walked out side and toward the Avalon's and as we rounded the corner I was blinded by the light of 1 sun (that mutha fucker is bright when we only see it a few times a year) so I do what I thought was natural, I put on my sun glasses. You'd think I killed her 2nd born spawn.    
        
UB stopped in her tracks and said, ""Excuse me, how long have you been in sales.""     
    
Me, ""About 15 years now, why do you ask?""    
    
UB, ""How dare you put your sunglasses on in front of a customer. You should know better.""    
    
At this point I'm done with her attitude. She can; buy a car, sell a car, die in fire for all that I'm concerned.    
    
Me, ""While were walking into the direct sunlight I'm keeping them on, once we get into a car I'll make sure to take them off so you can see my pretty greens again.""     
     
The look and sound of disgust from her should of withered some near by plants.     
    
UB, "" I don't want to look at the Avalon unless it has what I want on it.""      
        
I acted all surprised and said, ""Ahhh in that case thus far all you've told me is that you want technology on it. Every car on my lot has technology, how about you fill in the blanks for me and I'll get you what you need.""   I finished that last part with a touch of sarcasm.
    
UB, "" You don't have to take that tone with me.""     
    
I just started at her until she finally answered my question.    
   
UB, ""I want....""  Imagine everything every car in every scfi movie has done (some highlights: Voice activated everything, self driving, self maintaining, color changing, all electric or non-gas, The list goes on)

Maloth_Warblade,6,,17,1rhx0y,,94,"Black Friday, 2011. Big, blue, zombie-filled box store. I was a photo tech.

It's been almost 2 years now, as I no longer work for retail. I did my 5 years with it and I'm done.

I'm glad I'm out, too. I don't hate people, I just learned that I hate being treated like less than crap, filth, and told I'm worthless on a daily basis. But this one was so irritating I spoke up.

I worked 2 stores on Black Friday in 2011, both the BBS and the famous game store. I was basically at work from Noon-8 on Thanksgiving at the BBS, missing all family gatherings, by the way, and then 11:30pm-7am at the games store (I was the only cashier by the way, in the most populated area of the county/city), and then 12-8 again on Black Friday at the BBS. 

I was tired, beyond tired, essentially 20hrs of work, on my feet with no breaks for food or bathroom due to chaos. The BBS frequently refused to give me my lunches until I was mandatorily locked out, and even then they simply made me work anyway (even got reported for going over 8 hrs without a break, wasn't given a choice).

 Needless to say, by the time 5pm rolled around, and not having eaten but a pop tart in 24hrs, I was having a sugar crash. These make you lightheaded, these make it hard to think and respond quickly. I was working my ass off to get greeting cards printed, packaged, priced and all the while walking everyone through how to use our touch-screen computers and simple tasks. 

One customer didn't like that I wasn't answering fast enough. Of course she didn't, it's Black Friday, and that I was being far too rude for her. She told me she didn't like how tired I was, that I shouldn't work at all if I was so tired. How worthless I was to be there, on the busiest day of the year, if I couldn't be bothered to be awake. 

At this point I interrupted her. I told her ""Lady, listen. I don't need this from you, not today. Not the day people die from customers entitlement. No. I've been working since pretty much Noon yesterday. I had to miss my family's Thanksgiving, again, and not only that, I couldn't even EAT any food yet. There's no time. I'm beyond having a sugar crash, I'm hungry, and beyond normal tired. If you're going to sit there and belittle me over this, you can just get out of my face and leave this place"" (or something VERY close to this, been a few years).

Of course I got loud to say this, and everyone looked at her. Associates, customers, even her husband. She tried apologizing, I kept interrupting her asking what else she needed, and she kept trying to change subjects..I wouldn't let her. She was the last straw I needed that day, and I wasn't having it.

Good news though, wasn't reported, wasn't written up. Had a very nice and thoughtful customer buy me a bag of chips and a soda after seeing me be berated by not only her but other customers. Made it home and promptly slept for 15 hours.

adelajoy,15,,15,1rg29x,,73,"I spent two years working at a big warehouse-style grocery store. I worked mostly as a cashier, but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a week.

Most of the crappy moments have all blurred together, but there are a few particular moments that stick out.

This grocery store is the only one in the area that doesn't bag your groceries for you. Each till has two long conveyor belts to hold your groceries while you bag them (Both the customer and the cashier have buttons to move the groceries down, away from the till). This speeds orders up, requires less staff, saves money and drops prices. People occasionally complain about it, but if they want to pay more for their groceries and have someone else bag them, they're welcome to. ... The store isn't exactly famous for customer service, but I think the prices make up for this.

I was one of the fastest cashiers on staff at the time. This meant that my belts would often get full. I had ways to deal with this. I knew how fast people packed, I knew how soon a belt would clear. I was really good at my job. One day, the lines were insanely long, I was working really fast, everyone was buying a lot. I got to a point that there were groceries on both of my belts, so I squeezed the smaller order down a little, watched for a moment, and knew that he would be down before the next order crowded him. I started scanning the next order, and smiled at the customers - a man and his very pregnant wife.

The wife snapped at me, ""Can you just wait!""

""Excuse me?""

""Can you wait? I don't want you to crowd out that other guy!""

I looked, and he was literally loading his last bag with groceries. I stopped scanning anyways, and maybe glared at the lady. I don't really like it when other people tell me how to do my job.

Eventually he was packed and gone, so I started scanning again. While I had been waiting, I had lined all of their canned goods up. I can scan cans super fast if they're all really close. I started scanning the canned goods, grabbing a can, tossing it to my other hand, and setting it on the other belt. Except that this woman had walked around (The belt she got was behind me) and was standing behind me, trying to bag the cans as I scanned them. I'm sorry, but I'm not actually looking where the cans go. I know the space, and I need to watch the computer screen, not my hands. Well, she kept trying to grab the one I'd just set down, which meant that I kept hitting her hand with the next can. I wasn't by any means throwing the cans, but I was moving quickly and she was in my space, so she was getting hit. I didn't actually realize that I was hitting her until she complained to her husband. So I slowed down, apologized, and moved on to her other groceries.

She then had a bag of apples. She had grabbed one of our bags and put three different apples in it, and tied it shut. I have to weigh each type of fruit separately, so I opened the bag, weighed the first apple, set it aside. I noticed her husband grabbed the apple right away. I weighed the second apple, and set it aside. He grabbed that one too. When I weighed the third, my plan had been to put all three back in the bag and tie it shut, but the other two apples were gone. I tied the bag around the last one and set it on the belt. If the husband wanted to pack the apples separately, he was welcome to.

The couple also bought about half a dozen little bags of frozen perogies. One of the bags had been ripped all the open, right down the middle, and frozen perogies were laying all over the belt. I considered not telling them, because I was mad, but I took a deep breath, rounded up all of the stray perogies, put them in a plastic bag, and informed the lady. I asked her if she would like me to send for a new bag. She snippily replied ""Yes"" as if I should have just known. Some people don't bother to get a new bag because it can hold up the line, so I always ask. Our runner quickly returned with an identical bag and I kept going.

When I finally finished (They bought *a lot* of stuff), the husband paid, while the wife stormed over to customer service. I watched as she talked to my supervisor, and eventually a store manager. I was getting pretty nervous. Oh, also I should mention this woman was rude and snapped every time I asked her a question. I was pretty angry by the time they left.

After they were completely done, my supervisor closed my till and asked to speak to me at customer service.

She said the lady had filed a formal complaint against me. Apparently the conversation went something like this:

**Pregnant Lady**: ""I want to complain about the cashier on till 9!""

**Nice Supervisor**: ""Till 9? Do you mean till 8?"" (I was on 9 - one of my quick-to-anger coworkers was on 8)

**PL**: ""No, I mean 9!""

**NS**: ""Like the girl with brown hair, *not* the blonde?""

**PL**: (getting frustrated) ""Yes!""

**NS**: ""So what did adelajoy do?""

**PL**: ""She was rude and short with me!""

**NS**: ""Adelajoy? Are you sure?""

**PL**: ""Yes! She also threw canned goods at me, *ripped* open a bag of perogies, scattered them *everywhere* and scattered all of my apples too! She also bruised all of my fruit because she was throwing them around!""

A store manager was brought down to take a formal complaint, which means it probably went in my employee file. The lady was calmed down and left, and that was the end of it. Typically, the store managers will meet with you to discuss complaints, and make sure they won't happen again. The fact that I didn't means either the manager simply didn't believe the woman, or wasn't concerned because it was my first (and only). The supervisor who helped her said she closed my till because I looked upset and she thought I needed a break. The only reason she told me was to find out what really happened. I told her my side, and she just laughed it off. I admitted to being short and snippy, but the rest was just ludicrous. I still cannot beleive she blamed me for the bag of perogies being ripped open, considering I told her about them, got a new bag, and spent a minute or two picking up all of the perogies. Also, why would I take the time to do that, when I was clearly rushed with everything else?

I get that pregnant women have a lot of hormones, and tend to be angry, short-tempered, whatnot, but I think there's a line. Also, the fact that her husband didn't stop her, stand up for me, or admit to grabbing all the apples kind of pissed me off.

Tl;dr: Crazy-hormones pregnant lady complained about me, but the supervisor didn't believe her.","In my spare time, I like to rip open your groceries and scatter them",88,talesFromRetail
unidentifiableblarg,12,,9,1rhfwt,,65,"**Back story:** I worked in a small convenience store in a town on the outskirts of a city. A lot of the customer's are regulars and have been coming here for years, decades even.

About 6 years ago the place changed hands, names and management too. Still provided the same sort of stuff though, so the locals kept calling it by it's old name. 

This is relevant, I swear.



**The story:** I'm serving on the registers at the front of the store, just doin ma biz, when a flustered woman comes up to the counter demanding my attention. I tell her I'll be with her as soon as I finish processing my currant customer.

This somehow seemed to offended her, so I was already off to a bad start. But I get to her and try to smooth things over with my best customer service voice (you know the one).

After a bit of just listening to her complaining and bitching in general she finally gets to the point.

""I bought this product here earlier and you (not me) charged me the wrong price! It's on special, why is it wrong blah blah blah""

The outrage was dripping off her.

Now, normally I'd be prepared to fix this, sometimes we just straight up get it wrong and stuff isn't the right price.

*But*, while she's ranting she's waving around a catalogue, that contains the magical special that we failed to give her.

Eventually she shoves it in my face to accent a point, and shows me what it should have been.

The catalogue wasn't for our store, we don't even sell the brand (ice cream, I think it was) that she seemed to have thought she purchased.

I politely explain that we're not an [old store] any more and that was why she didn't get the discount. But I'd be happy t...

Her: What?! I've lived her FOR YEARS and it's always been [old store]. You've got to be kidding me.

I point out the signs (they're everywhere) and shirts of the employees and explain that we've been [new store] for quite a while.

She persists though, demanding to get her discount because it's ""always been that way and why should I get screwed for what you did..."" just generally giving me a hard time; that kind of bullshit.

The managers will usually give the discount to them anyway, just to keep them happy, but I was sick of getting abused by people who apparently can't read and wasn't about to let this one fly. Pety, I know.

Eventually I get to the point where I'm just repeating myself and she's adamantly refusing to be 'robbed' of forty cents. So I call my manager to come up.

By this stage I'm sick of her shit and just want her to leave, customers are waiting to be served and I'm meant to be serving. Small store, small number of staff.

Finally my duty manager meanders up and he immediately grovels at her feet, begging her forgiveness and taking her to a spare register to sort out her problem. 


I'm not bitter (lies), but the smug grin she threw me on her way out made me really wish that our management stood up for us, at least sometimes.

And that I had a crowbar handy.

CommandoDerp,9,,17,1rhsfa,,62,"First off, I would like to say that I had two days off before this incident so I was unaware of any changes at work.

So I was at work after two days off when I was serving an elderly man, who was a regular, cigarettes. He asked for a particular brand in a carton of twin packs. I tell him unfortunately that the twin packs are classified as cartons themselves, and you cannot purchase a carton of a carton. He rolled his eyes and asked for 4 individual twin packs.

I immediately check the cupboard nearby of said twin packs of cigarettes that he wanted and I inform him that we are all sold out. This is the conversation that follows:

Him: ""Are you serious?""
Me: ""Yes, sorry. We are unfortunately all sold out until we get some more.""
Him: ""This is pathetic!""
Me: ""Would you like another flavor?""
He mumbles something to me which I repeat my previous question.
Me: ""Would you like another flavor?""
Him: ""No. This unacceptable. You are refusing sale""
Me: ""Is there anything else I can help you with as we don't seem to have what you are after?""
Him: ""I would like to speak to your manager.""
Me: ""Actually there might be some here""

I had a thought and I turned around and checked the display rack to see if there are any more in the display. To which I found 4 individual twin packs sitting there, I felt like an idiot not checking there first.

Me: ""I didn't realize that there was any in the display, I...""
Him: ""Your very lucky""
Me: ""I'm very sorry I did not check there first. I recently had two days off and I wasn't informed that what you were after was in the display. I'm sorry for any unconvinced""

He just sighs loudly and rolls his eyes and tells me one last thing while paying for his cigarettes.

Him: ""Your very lucky you found them or otherwise you would have lost hundreds and hundreds of dollars in sales and quite a few hundred customers because of your poor service.""

Payment is finished and I tell him I'm sorry again and to enjoy his night. He storms back into the store and complains to another staff member who was not in charge for the night.

The man left and the employee approached me asking what happened. I told them and they said not to worry, they knew it wasn't on purpose. The actual supervisor for the night approached me and asked what happened, they knew it wasn't intentional so they didn't seem too phased by it; even though I was the back up person in charge that night.","I don't know how to feel after my ""complaint""?",79,talesFromRetail
Drunken_Black_Belt,7,,8,1rhw8z,,59,"I'm back bitches!  About 2 months ago, I got a second job working part time at a men's Big &amp;Tall store.  The hours are easy, commision is alright, and to be honest, the customers are generally friendly and awesome.  It helps that a lot of them don't have anywhere else to shop. Unfortunantly the store isn't as eventul as my past retail jobs.  Its just selling clothes and shoes.  But I've gotten a few funny stories that I'll share over time here. And with the holiday's coming up, i'm sure I'll have plenty more.  

Welll, for your pleasure (hopefully), I present **Boy, Are My Feet Sore!**

**WARNING: GROSS!**

So recently I began working in a men's store for Big &amp; Tall sizes.  I knew of it because I buy my shoes there.  Only store that carries a size 15/16.  I am too small for the clothes, despite being 6'4 and slightly overweight.  And if I'm being honest,  seeing some of the people who come in makes me more motivated to keep losing weight (50 lbs this year alone).  

Now, don't get me wrong, SOME of the people have legitimate health concerns.  One gentleman was born with his left foot backwards.  During his childhood they would constantly have to break his foot, set it slightly closer to the proper position, let it heal, and repeat. But it never set 100% correct, keeping him from being able to run or exercise, or even stand for long periods of time.  It's guys like him I feel for.  Given a shitty deal in life and just having to suffer for it. 

Most customers, however, are just plain old fat guys.  I don't want to sound mean, or ""fat shame"".  But it's just poor lifestyle choices and such.  I was there.  I was 5lbs shy of 300 last new years.  And it was just being lazy and making bad choices.  I don't have as much sympathy for these guys.  And that brings us to our story today.

It's a sunny fall day.  It's midweek, and pretty dead.  I'm in my suit, fixing clothes, putzing around, pretty much just pretending to work.  I hear the door chime, and in walks an older couple.  Probably late 60's, very early 70's.  The lady was using a walker to move around, and the gentleman was resting his weight on a cane as he slowly moved with her.  They seemed like a nice enough couple, but as you know, those are the ones who always turn into assholes.

I introduced myself, asked how I could help them that day.  The man gruffly replied ""shoes"".  I brought them to the shoe department.  Now my store is small, and there is only one small bench to sit on, and it's in the shoe department.  Naturally, this oaf takes the seat, leaving his frail wife to stand.  I could tell she was having difficulty, being particularly petire and frail, so I went in the back and got her a folding chair to sit in next to her husband.  She thanked me, because manners.  The man, charming fellow that he was, just said ""can you get me some shoes now?"".  

It was about this time that I realized this was going to go south faster than a my ex g/f in a dick sucking contest.

I offered several suggestions, as the gentleman didn't seem to know what kind of shoes he wanted.  The man complained that most of our shoes don't even fit him. I expressed sympathy, as I have large feet and can only fit into the largest size available in store.  The man looked me up and down and sneered ""Well, you just have big feet. I have a health condition that causes this, so consider yourself lucky"".  

Eventually we found a pair he liked and thought may just fit his feet.  And that's when the real horror of this story starts.  The man then proceeds to roll up his sweatpants.  He was wearing ankle socks and sandals.  His feet are hugely swollen, and covered in open sores.  This guy has diabetes, and it's eating away at his foot.  Sadly it's fairly common where I work.  What came next, however, is not.

I hand him the shoes, and take a step back, giving him some space to put the shoes on, look at them in the mirror, see how they feel, etc.  

NOPE!  

He looks at me like an idiot and says ""Well I can't put them on myself.  I can't bend that far.  Put them on for me"".   

Now I am no fan of feet, even on a good day.  Sure if I'm dating someone, and they want a footrub, and their feet are clean, then i'll oblige.  But other than that, I just want nothing to do with that area of the body.  Add to the fact that we are talking about a stranger whose foot is literally covered in open, oozing sores.  

DBB: Sir I just can't do that, I'm sorry.

Man:  You need to help me.  I'm a customer and I need service.

DBB: There is no way I am doing that sir.  I am sorry but you have open sores on your foot and leg. It's unsanitary for both me and YOU, to have me do that.

Man: Oh just wash your hands after it'll be fine.

How this man survived 70 or so years with logic like that, will forever amaze me.  

DBB: Absolutely not.  

Man: I want the manger!  I'll have your ass for discrimination and harrassment

DBB:  I am the manager.  If you want the store manager call back tomorrow.  If you want corporate's phone number I'll give it with my name gladly.  


The man continued to yell and scream about receiving the shoes at a discount and having me fired.  Typical stuff for anyone who works in retail really.  I essentially told him that I wasn't going to touch his feet, and if he didn't like the service he could leave. Wife is trying to keep the peace.  It's not very effective.  Husband used Rage!  It's inneffective against DBB!  Besides my DEF is to high.  

Anyways, i wish there was some more to this.  Eventually he stormed out as dramatically as one can when you can barely walk under your own weight, and your wife is frail and moves about as fast a christian school girl with a chastity belt.  I did hear from corporate the next day though.  Naturally some of the details were changed when he called in, but once I explained about the sores, I receieve a ""Yea that happens all the time. Don't worry about it"".  

Sorry if it's not very exciting.  I'm sure I'll have some good ones coming up.  Hope you all are surviving the holidays!

Turns out, the woman was making a sizeable purchase and couldn't supply an adequate form of ID. I explained to her that we simply couldn't process her credit card without proper identification. She dug through her purse and tossed a bottle of birth control pills on the counter and was like ""Will this bottle work?

She then threw a world class tantrum using colorful language that would even make a seasoned sailor blush.

I was working in the jewelry department of a department/grocery store at the time. I'd been in that same department for 2 years by the time this incident took place. It was very early on a Saturday, before the rush, and a lady comes up to my counter to do a return. No problemo, I thought.

Me: I can do that return for you. Can I see your receipt ma'am?

Customer: I don't have it anymore. 

Me: I'll only be able to refund it to a gift card then, is that ok?

Customer: yeah, that's fine. 

One hurdle jumped. She hands me the item and I notice that it is in a package I have never seen before. I know my department like the back of my hand cause I'm the one that checks in -all- of the merchandise. Every item that has gone into the department in the last two years had to pass by me first. 

Me: ma'am are you sure you bought this here? I don't recognize this package. 

Customer, suddenly angry: of course I bought it here. (Spoiler, this a lie)

Me: ok, let me see if the system recognizes it. 

I scan the item at the register and I get an error. I look at the barcode and it's half as long as it needs to be (6 characters instead of 12, which is the store norm). 

Me: ma'am my register does not recognize this item. 

Customer: I bought it here!

Me, getting cranky at this point: are you -sure-? I've been in the department for two years and I've never seen this package before. Are you certain you didn't buy this at [dept store x] or [dept store y]?

Customer: I'm certain. I'm returning this for a friend and she bought it here! (Told ya)

Me: I'm sorry but I can't take an Item that doesn't even come up in the system. Especially if you don't have a receipt. 

Customer snatches the item from me and pulls her cell phone out: I am going to call her (the friend) and prove to you that it was bought here!! (She's nearly screaming at this point)

ScaldingSoup,5,,6,1rha57,,26,"So several  years ago I worked for a very popular lingerie store.  This store didn't pay commission, but would give us more or less hours per week based on sales performance.  My sales performance was VERY good.  I got more hours a week than most people.  

During the holiday season, we had a lot of seasonal employees, as any big retail store normally does.  One of the workers hired seasonally was this lady who was a lot older than the rest of us.  This was not the problem.  Her hair was bleached blonde, and growing out (showing obvious roots), and styled in a ""feathered"" fashion.  She did not know how to wear make-up and what she wore did not flatter her.  In this store our dress code was all black.   She wore skirts with no stockings, but with slouch socks and yeah, that was a hot mess.  

People began to call her the ""missing link"", as in to the 1980s because of the hair and her wearing slouch socks that were probably black in the 1980s but grey now.  Reading this, you may think that I judged her based on this, or have some animosity for people older than me.  I do not, but this just sort of describes what she looked like because it is important.  Black Friday rolls around, and she wears her normal dress of skirt, slouch socks and what-not.  Surrounding her socks are these bells that jingle..  

She begins waving panties in the air, helicopter style, like a stripper, chanting what the sale is as customers are passing by.  One of our gay male managers passes me by and mutters so only I can hear it ""I want her out"".  I was dying trying not to laugh at the situation, and meanwhile feeling very embarrassed for her.  Everywhere she walked, she jingled.

Some time during her short career with the lingerie store, she found my phone number on the schedule.  I guess they weren't giving her enough hours, because she had the nerve to leave me a message asking me for some of mine.

**Story (er, stories)**: 

1) I walk by the front door. Man approached with wife, stopped and said Excuse Me? Fine. I go over, and he started counting out a huge wad of cash. He counts $100 in small bills out, gives it to me, then says, ""Now, I want a propane tank, honey..."" 

He got the manager who resembles an NFL player instead. (Yes, I gave him the money back.)

2) Two young guys came through the checkout line with four carts of Head &amp; Shoulders, Dove bars, and some razors, I forgot the brand. This is ***-mart, it's cheap, and that's what matters. Three products. They racked up $1800 in this stuff. The one guy then pulled out of his pocket a pile of coupons that was quite literally a foot high. Mind already blown, I said half-jokingly, ""Those aren't all for me, are they?""

Yes. Yes they were. $1500 in coupons, $3 at a time. Do the math. And you couldn't do coupon repeats. Due to the volume, the *CSM thing came up halfway through, and I said ""Oh, the supervisor's going to have to turn the key..."" and they were all ""Ok, cool.""

So they hand over the remaining $300 cash (and people pay 500-600 all the time-that was normal) and the supervisor sees the key message on the palm pilot. I had every CSM (three on duty), the front end supervisor, two assistant managers, and every loss prevention person in the building (three-two associates &amp; the manager) at the register in what seemed like two seconds. 

The guy who'd had the coupons recognized the front end supervisor. He (coupon guy) went off and started going into it with the supervisor. The friend stands there numb, all the managers start talking at me, a CSM sticks the key in to abort this transaction, and I'm standing here holding $300 cash and a hell's lot of coupons. 

Then:
The customer let out a primal yell, the supervisor took the coupons from me, stuck them in the guy's hand, and wished him a good day-anywhere else. 

Turns out they were known scammers. The coupons would scan, but we can't get money back for them. I knew something was up, but I didn't know the back story. I just was asking myself over and over after this: If it had all gone through, and they'd walked out with $1800 of soap and shampoo, what the hell were they going to do with it all? Sell it at less than cost? Fill a swimming pool? Get ridiculously clean?

While Cee and his dad are looking at the toys, a woman with two children comes into the aisle they are in.  The older of the two, who is about the same age as Cee, sees something she wants and asks her mom for it.  Mom says no.  The little girl begs and pleads but mom holds firm and keeps telling her no.

Cee watches for a few seconds and then walks over to the girl.  He kneels in front of her and says:  ""Well, if you act like that, you really won't get anything.""  And then he walked back to his dad.

Me: Do you have the canceled check?

Customer: No, I threw it in your trash.

Me, cringing: How about a receipt?

Customer: In the gar-bage. What don’t you understand?

Me:  I think I need to transfer you to the Customer Service Desk. Let me just find the number…

Customer: NO, you will NOT! I need the movie about…(another two, three minutes)…now!

Customer: Getting my movie!

Me: I can’t give you a physical object through the phone. Why don’t you come in and see Customer Service?  They should be able to help you.

Customer: …I’ll be there in fifteen minutes. Let me get the kids.

copisreallybad,4,,6,1rhulb,,22,"a few days ago, i get called down to the returns desk from the paint desk. the return policy for the chain i work at is very lenient, but we aren't supposed to take mixed paint back, so already walking down there i had a bad feeling that i would have to get a manager involved (and we all know how incompetent they can be)

so i get there, and to my surprise it's just a regular can of unmixed, white, exterior paint, which *is* returnable without manager involvement. i ask the guy what's wrong with the paint and he says that it's frozen and we need to fix it or give him another can.

i bring the can to the paint desk and open it up. now, imagine what half frozen, hardened paint looks like. that's what this paint looked like, and the following conversation sort of went like this.

me: ""this paint is frozen, did you leave it in the garage or something?""

customer (now visibly irate): ""ABSOLUTELY NOT I BOUGHT IT AND I JUST OPENED IT THIS MORNING AND TO MY SURPRISE IT LOOKS LIKE THIS""

me: ""I'm sorry but we really aren't supposed to take paint like this back, it's useless to us returned""

customer (literally about to pop a blood vessel in his brain at this point): ""WELL MAYBE IF YOU GUYS HAD FUCKING SOLD ME A GOOD CAN OF PAINT IT WOULDNT BE FUCKING FROZEN. I WANT A MANAGER, NOW""

great, this guy knows how to get what he wants. i call a manager and explain the situation to him. the manager, being a typical manager, offers him a plethora of free things, including brushes and a brand new can of paint. the customer walks away with his free things (that i have to get for him) with the smuggiest ass look on his face.

story over, right? nope. i bring the can of paint to receiving, ZMA and hazmat it (since we can't sell it, it's fucking frozen and you can't paint with it). done deal im thinking, right?

not even close, bby. picture a hambeast of a woman. ok, maybe not that big, but she had a hard time fitting inside the reach truck sometimes. she is the department head of receiving. basically she sits in receiving on her computer waiting for trucks to arrive. 

now picture her carrying the frozen can of paint to the desk, except i actually had to see it happen. 

okay, okay, what the fuck is going on, im thinking. maybe i didnt mark it down correctly or something, maybe she'll show me how to hazmat it, i have no idea. im also in the middle of explaining to an older woman the different paint finishes we sell. 

nope, she has the nerve to tell me to just ""stick it in the paint shaker for a minute or two and see if we can try and sell it as OOPS paint."" at this point im all whatthefuck.jpeg, the paint is fucking frozen and shaking it won't help. i try to explain this to her but she would have none of it and walks away, and me, being the lowly, minimum wage paint associate that i am, do as she says. i stick it on the OOPS rack and continue my day.

the story ends when the department head of paint sees it on the OOPS rack, laughs, and takes it to receiving himself to hazmat it.

tl;dr - guy returns 3 year old can of frozen paint, manager gives him free shit, hambeast from receiving thinks that we can still sell it, paint department head saves the day.  ",i work at a home improvement store that sells paint (among other things),28,talesFromRetail

I worked in a a supermarket produce department for about 13 months.  But there was a guy who came in he'd wear a suit and gel his hair to make himself look important, but the only time id see him in my department was sampling my food or outright shoplifting. 
One of the things he'd do would come up to me and say something along the lines of
""Hey Champ, can you cut me a piece of this ""insert fruit here"" , ive heard this batch is extra juicy"" and then once hed taste it hed spit it out and say 
""Yuck thats disgusting, im glad i wasnt going to buy it"" and just storm off. He did this to me quite a few times and hed throw the skin or peel of it onto my displays and I was quite pissed off with all of it. 

He came in and and I recognised him. And the convorsation went as follows. 

Him: Hey Champ, do you mind if I try one of these Mandarins, they seem mighty delicious. 

Me: No you cant

Him: Why the hell not?

Me: Because its shoplifting, you have no intention of buying it, youve done this before you ask if you can try some and say its disgusting then walk off and all youre going to do is peel it, take one bite leave the the rest of the fruit and peel on my display and im not paid to clean up after you and its not a buffet either, what youre doing is taking stuff you havnt paid for, so its actually theft. So no you cant!

He stood there for about 6 seconds trying to think of something to say and all he could muster up was yelling:
Hey I use to work in a fruit store aswell, I know what its like, so deal with it!

And he just walked off, I kept an eye on him too, he didnt buy anything but just walked out the front of the store (giving me an evil eye) and then out the door to the carpark.

He did come back into the store a few days later, but I didnt see him in the produce department again while i was there ( I only did 3pm until Midnight, but he might have come in between 7am and 3pm or while someone else was on) but when I saw him ordering things from the deli hed give me a bitter stare but that was it.

One day, I have a guy come in with a bunch of stuff and some rain cheques. I take them from him and noticed that they're all photocopied. I look at them and notice they have a different store number on them. So, since I can't blatantly say ""I think you faked these"", I made up some policy on the spot. I told him that we couldn't take another stores rain cheques, how we had to have the matching piece of the rain cheque, and that our stores order inventory specifically to cover rain cheques.

A little back story. I actually PAY customers for metal. We are private and can choose what prices we pay for what material etc. We do not have any pricing criteria. The only thing we have to deal with really is the law which is one of the more annoying things. People who steal metal makes it tough for the honest guys who recycle.

I get several customers who come in every day or several times a week (we're open 6 days a week, 9 to 5). 80% of these customers are never ready. We require valid ID for every transaction and though I remember a good amount of people's names, some I don't. Those that know I ask for ID every time never had it ready. While they're standing in line why wouldn't they pull it out of their wallets instead of when they are at the front of the line? Or sign the receipt which is also required by law. I have to ask them EVERY SINGLE TIME. It's very frustrating. I go through the same thing every day and they never learn. I also get several customers who don't even speak English which is also frustrating. How can I ask you for things that are required by law when you don't speak my language?

Anyway, this next story was also from Barschmucks. If I didn't mention before, this was a franchise location inside of a large supermarket. We were technically employees of the supermarket even though we were real certified baristas. But this meant that many of our coworkers were cashiers and stock guys. One of the stock guys was Otis. He was a huuuuuge black dude who didn't converse much when he came by for his free cup of ice water but seemed like a pretty good guy.

I wasn't working when this happened, but my AST (Evan) told me about it. It's dead and he's just cleaning up waiting for the last few stragglers to wander in when Otis cruises up to the counter. Evan asks him what he'd like but Otis doesn't say anything and just stares at the menu. Evan goes back to cleaning while Otis contemplates the meaning of life. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Otis opening up the tea rack and fumbling for a tea bag (already this is a no-no, not only are we the only ones supposed to touch that tea, but we have to use tongs because it goes right in a customer's drink.) 

Evan doesn't have time to say anything before Otis lifts a bag to his nose and takes a deep whiff. 

He goes: ""What is this? Vanilla Rooibos? (He pronounced it ""roo-bis""; it's actually ""roy-bohs"".) Mmmmmmm. If a girl smell like dis, I'd lick her all *up* and down.""

Then, as quickly as he came, he put the tea back back, and left without saying a word. 

Evan dumped out all the Vanilla Rooibos and replaced it (not a big deal, nobody gets it anyway.)

**TL;DR:** Large man sexually assaults a tea bag in the middle of our store and left my coworker to clean up the mess.

j-sap,3,,5,1rigon,,17,"Some back story: I work the front desk at a gym a couple of days a week after class. We specialize in helping people with injuries and have a very specialized staff, program, and equipment. We are attached to an apartment complex that is spread out over a couple of buildings. The laundry for the complex is in the building adjacent to us. Now to use the laundry machines you are required to use a proprietary card that has to be purchased from a machine. I don't know what someone was smoking one day but instead of putting the machine that dispenses and allows people to add money to there card next to the laundry machines (even though there is plenty of room), someone decided to put the machine in the lobby of the gym. 

Where I work I have a very large window that overlooks the parking lot and see everyone who comes and goes and where people park. I had someone park or fly in the handicap spot (we'll call him Scumbag Steve or SS to keep things simple). SS jumps out of the car and runs full sprint into the lobby to add money onto his laundry card. After a minute or so I hear a knock on the window and we a quick interaction that goes like this:

SS: ""Hey yo man you got change for a $20?""

Now I absolutely do have the change for this guy in my drawer but if I used it then I would not have any for transaction at my desk.

Me: ""Sorry.""

SS: ""Yo man what about in your wallet, I know you can personally make me change?""

Now I am taken aback a little from this second question and am smart enough to never take out personal items around customers or even let them know where personal things are. I take a couple of seconds to think about everything and then respond.

Me: ""No I don't, but we have a great physical therapy program if you are interested.""

SS: ""Man why would I be interested in physical therapy, I am as fit as a horse?""

Me: ""Because you parked in a handicap spot and those spots are almost always full of clients.""

SS just sort of gave me a defeated look and slinked out the door and back to his car. He was back 20-30 minutes later and was good enough to not park in the handicap spot, instead he pulled up to the curb and made people walk around his vehicle.

adelajoy,0,,1,1ri8kg,,22,"I spent two years working at a big warehouse-style grocery store. I worked mostly as a cashier, but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a week.

Most of the crappy moments have all blurred together, but there are a few particular moments that stick out.

I realize this isn't the craziest story on here, but I will probably never forget this lady. 

Backstory: Our store had a policy that if an item scanned differently than the price tag, the customer would get it for free, up to $10. The mistake happened because the price tag didn't get changed, or was misplaced. If they spotted a problem, we would go look. If we found a tag in front of their item with the same code and a different price, we gave it to them and changed the tag. If the tag was for a different item, they didn't get anything. 

I was working the customer service desk, and a lady stormed up. I had several customers on the go at the moment, but it was pretty clear she *needed* help right away. As soon as I could, I asked what I could help her with. She was holding a bottle of toilet cleaner, her receipt and a price tag. Let's call her Crazy Customer, CC for short.

**CC**: ""I bought this bottle of toilet cleaner, but it was the wrong price! You guys are trying to charge me too much!""

**Me**: ""Okay, can I see your receipt?""

**CC**: *Hands me the receipt.* ""I tried to tell the cashier, but she didn't believe me!""

**Me**: *I checked who her cashier was, and it was one of our long-time girls. She knew the policy. There was no way she ""didn't believe"" the customer.* ""Okay, so the price came up $3.99, I'll just send a price-checker out to see what the tag said.""

**CC**: ""Oh, I grabbed the price tag already."" *She hands me the price tag. This lady is pretty worked up,  I'm not sure if she just wants to get out of the store, or if she's trying to pull one on me.*

A policy was that the tag had to be on the shelf. If a customer brings it to you, who's to say they didn't take it off the shelf last week and save it? They also could have found it in the wrong place, somewhere that the stock employees wouldn't have checked to fix the tag. As with most stores I've been to, store policy is to inform the customer about the relative store policies, and then see if you can help them anyways. No matter the problem.

It study the tag, and inform her of the policy, that the tag would have to be on the shelf. I start to let her know I can contact a manager, but she snatches the tag back and interrupts me.

**CC**: ""Well if that's your policy, I'll just put it back on the shelf! I was trying to save you some goddamn work, but I guess if you guys want to work extra, I'll just go put it back!""

She took off before I could say anything. I was just standing at the desk, aghast. I didn't even know what to say. 

The supervisor that was on shift was the scary kind. You know, the kind that isn't afraid to yell a little, handles the worst customers, and isn't phased when people call her names. Let's call her Jane. When the woman was gone, I grabbed Jane and told her the whole story. She said, ""Okay. When she comes back, let me know who she is. I'll handle her.""

As soon as I saw the customer coming back, I hissed, ""Jane! Jane! Jane! White hat! That's her."" I then ducked behind the display at customer service, and quite actually hid back there until the customer was gone. I could hear her yelling at Jane. I don't know what the verdict was. Any other manager, and the customer would have gotten the item for free, but it's hard to say with Jane.

I remember one of my coworkers came around the display and exclaimed my name. I hushed them, and told them I was hiding. I was so afraid the woman would see me and do one of those, ""Her! That's the one I was talking to! She told me this!"" And drag me back into it.

I've never hid from a customer before or since. Oh! Fun fact: The price tag she was holding said $3.29, a $0.70 difference from what she paid, and the tag was dated for the week before, which means it wasn't the current price. Not to say it wasn't still on the shelf, but there is a chance she did save it and bring it back in, especially with how worked up she was.

Dannythegirl,5,,6,1rh77t,,7,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this but I needed to share. Long time lurker of this subreddit. On my phone, sorry for wall. 
I am a customer in this story, but former multi-year service/retail employee.
Today, I was grocery shopping with my two very little children. Not a huge chain store, but prominent in my state for supporting local foods. Many locations. 
I got in line to check out after an eventful and frustrating trip around the store with the kids. There was an elderly man checking out ahead of me. He was friendly and talkative to my kids and was asking me about my tattoos while we were waiting. The cashier was probably 55, spacey, but very sweet woman. When it was old guys turn to check out, I overheard their conversation at the register, and it was obvious they were both long time veterans to the store. 
The man had some trouble checking out. He rang his credit card through the machine multiple times while chatting with the cashier and he seemed confused. Eventually, she explained that he didn't have to keep swiping his card, and that his transaction was complete. In the mean time, she was scanning my items. 
The cashier chatted up a storm with me too. Asking about my kids while I was trying to wrangle them. I was getting a little impatient at this point because my 1 and 3 year old were ready to get the hell out of there, but I listened to her stories with patience. She was kind too.
When she finished scanning my food I pulled my card out to run through the machine, but it was asking for a signature, when I hadn't scanned my card yet. 
Me: ""there must be a mistake, I haven't slid my card through but it's already asking for a signature""
Cashier: ""no, you did, you must have forgot"" -looks at screen- ""you swiped your America express""
Me: ""No, I don't have an Amex, see?.. Oh no did the man in front of me swipe his card while you were ringing me up?""
Cashier: ""uh oh, that must have been what happened""
She looked panicked, but printed the receipt and said ""I'll just do this"" AND SIGNED THE RECEIPT
Cashier: ""He'll be okay, he can be so spacey. Don't even worry about it""
She at first folded up the receipt like she was going to trash it but I asked her if that was really ok, and that I could wait for a manger. She unfolded the receipt and told me not to worry. There was a long line behind me and frankly I was ready to get the fuck out of there with my crazy kids. I asked her ""are you sure? I feel uncomfortable"" 
She told me not to worry, and to go ahead and leave. And I did. 
I think her career might have ended today.
TLDR; Elderly man in line ahead of me accidentally paid for my groceries, cashier eventually realized but didn't give a fuck to fix it. I got free groceries :/

EDIT/UPDATE: I can see how it looks like I was unsympathetic in my post. I was in fact, horrified. I know the groceries weren't free, I just did not pay for them. In my car, I wrote down the time, my total $78.43 and what I thought the mans total was before me $43, and the name of the cashier. I should have stuck around and put my foot down but I was flustered and unsure how to proceed.  I was planning on calling when I got home, and totally forgot about the whole thing until I was in bed redditing from my phone late at night.
This morning I called and spoke with a manager, giving him all of my information. I told him I would happily come back and pay for the groceries and to please make sure the man did not actually get charged (hoping the cashier took the issue to the manager after I left). He said he will look into the receipts from last night and give me a call back. I will update again when I hear from him.

On to the story:

One of my favorite cashier's (seriously, she's so sweet and helpful. I always drop what I'm doing to answer her questions because she's one of the three that I trust) calls me over for a price check on a set of plates. Customer says they were $29.99, but when I go check they're $49.99. She says that's fine and she pays for them. Done and over, right?

Wrong.

About ten minutes later she comes over to my podium. I already know she's getting coal from me in her stockings (merry Christmas bitch).

Her- ""I was just over there looking at the plates again. They were there just in the wrong spot.""

Me- ""I'm sorry ma'am, I'll let an associate know so he can fix it. I'm a little busy to get to it."" Which I was, I was getting five different change orders ready.

Her- ""Isn't it your job to fix it?""

Me- ""actually no it's not. I'm the front end manager. There are two managers who work in that area, it's actually their job technically. If I would've seen the plates,I would've put them in the right spot.""

Her- ""So you're just a lazy asshole.""

Ok, I'm done. I talk to everyone in a civil manner, but when they take that tone with me, I'm done.

Me- ""yep""

Her- ""You're not going to fix it?""

Me- ""Nope, too lazy right now.""

This was followed by more angry questions and statements until I walked away to deliver my change orders. She tracked an assistant manager down and let him have it about my attitude. He's a pretty cool guy, came up to me later, asked what the deal was and just laughed when I told him. Now he always asks if I'm lazy today when he sees me.

I think I just stood there looking at him for a moment. He had an Italian accent so I was thinking I may have misheard him, and asked for his order again. He held his hand out and insisted to see mine.

Now, this guy didn't look creepy or scary or anything. If so I would have just bolted. But I was 17 and put on the spot so I gave him my hand.

It was a pretty good job, and I got to have as much free soda as I wanted, since I was in the concessions booth. I had to set out prizes, read tickets to see how many points a kid had, tell them how much each prize was (They could mix and match), then calculate how many points they had left as they chose. They'd choose their prizes, I'd hand it to them, and they'd leave. 

I had a friend of mine with me for the first hour, and we split the customers when it got busy. (Around 5 people at the same time.) At one point I spilled my soda, and she handled the crowd as I cleaned up the mess.

Then she left. Oh god.

I was left to set out prizes for display, serve customers, and translate kid-speak by myself. At some points I was so swamped with customers that I could barely figure out the total points for each kid as they got prizes.

Another girl came it at low tide, but left before it got busy again. (Around twenty minutes.) I wasn't allowed to leave my station to try and find her, so I had to deal with all the customers alone. (She wasn't actually allowed to leave either, but she gave zero fucks. Bitch.)

Scott5114,0,,3,1riony,,13,"I've met a lot of strange customers in my time at the casino. This guy takes the cake as the most fucked-up, unpleasant guy that's ever darkened our doorstep. We'll call him Dick because he is one.

To begin with, Dick is in the casino for a fucked-up reason. He's dying of cancer, or some other terminal disease. He spends his last days in our casino trying to win an inheritance for his children. Of course, mathematics says it's not going to happen, so he's squandering what money he does have and the remainder of his life sitting in a smoky room with no natural light playing $25 per spin on a slot machine. 

I wouldn't judge him so harshly for that if he wasn't a colossal asshole. Pretty much everyone who has had to pay a jackpot for him has some sort of unpleasant experience to share. Mine was when I was processing a jackpot for him and I go to clear the jackpot message from the screen. See, if you win, say, $1500, and you had $80 in credit when you hit it, when the attendant clears the jackpot your $80 will still be left on the machine. People sometimes forget or don't know this, and will leave the money on the machine and walk away, so after clearing it most of us will say ""You still have $80 left on the machine."" Of course, when I mention this to Dick, he flies into a rage, screaming ""I CAN SEE THAT! GOD!"" I started dodging his jackpots when I knew where he was playing after that—I don't put up with that sort of BS—though I still had to pay him out a couple of times after that because I didn't realize who it was. 

And Dick did hit a lot of jackpots. He would usually destroy the copy of the W2-G tax forms we would give him, I guess thinking since he's dying he won't need to worry about paying taxes, though you would think he would realize his kids would be on the hook for all of it. He also had the tendency to swear ambiguously so you never really knew whether he was calling the machine or you a piece of shit. Management had talked to him a couple of times about treating the attendants better. He did tip the bare minimum to not be considered an ass in that department, at least.

All of that is backstory to properly put in context what happened this week. At this point, Dick's managed to piss off enough attendants that most of the shift is dodging his calls, so it takes him probably twice as long to get someone over there than it would anyone else. This, coupled with the fact that he's losing heavily, pisses him off. 

Management gets called over to a machine in my section. I'm generally pretty curious about these things, so I head over there. The machine's touchscreen (retail price quoted to me by a tech as $700 or so) is totally shattered. The machine still has $20 on it—with an inoperable touchscreen, there's no way to cash that out on this machine. There's a patron further down the bank who saw the whole thing. Said the guy was losing, got pissed, punched the screen, threw a piece of paper down, and stormed off. One of the managers that showed up picks up the paper.

It's a torn-up W2-G with Dick's name, address, and social security number on it. A little bit of searching in the computers turns up copies of his driver license and the hotel room he is in. And of course the whole incident is caught on tape.

We don't know what happened to Dick after that. Apparently it became the responsibility of the casino's assistant general manager, and she isn't talking. We're all watching the usual locations for ban notices to go up, though.",The worst casino patron in the world,16,talesFromRetail
GlowingBall,2,,2,1rioer,,16,"These are my Tales of Retail Loss Prevention....

Part Three – Citizen Snips (Aka - The Pants Aquatic)



As a recap for those of you who have never read one of my stories before – I am a male in the midwest who is on the wrong side of his twenties and works retail loss prevention for a major retailer (one of the 'Big 5').  I am underpaid for what I do but enjoy my job none the less.  A majority of my time is spent wandering the floor or watching middle aged moms shop for clothing far too skimpy on them via CCTV (closed circuit television or 'security cameras').  Every once in awhile I get a case that is just so mind blowingly 'WTF' that I have to share.  

This story opens up with me doing just as I said above – watching people on CCTV.  It is a blisteringly cold afternoon so the customers, far more content to stay in their warm homes and snuggled beneath their blankets, are few and far between.  I, as the ever watchful hawk of justice that I am, was busy playing a Marvel version of Candy Crush Saga.  My job provides me the liberty of slacking off a good amount and my boss is rather lenient as long as I continue to bring in a good amount of stops per month.  I am sitting there diligently trying to match up small colored tiles with one another when I am startled by a sudden ring – the phone is going off!  

Now the phone going off is common place.  We get tons of calls a day ranging from the frozen dairy department calling to tell us a temperature alarm is going off (we know...it goes off for us as well) to people asking us to deactivate a door alarm (we also know...we see you standing at the door).  This happened to be a call from one of the few places that doesn't call us often – the meat department.  The guy on the other end, a tall black man with more muscle than he knows what to do with, calls to tell us that there is a guy standing in front of the freshly butchered meat.  The guy has refused any help the meat employee has offered and continues to say he is 'just browsing' for over ten minutes.  This strikes me as rather odd.  Who just hangs out around the meat department?  I quickly devise a plan for the situation.  I tell the employee to walk into the back so I could see just what the person was going to do.  

The employee hangs up and walks over to the man to let him know he is going to be into the back and to ring the bell if he needs anything.  No sooner than when he had walked into the back but the man glanced around and then walked behind the counter.  My adrenaline already began to rush as my suspicions came to fruition – he was going to steal!  “Oh shit here we go, ” I declared, only to watch in confusion and frustration as he walked right past all the glass displays full of meat and right over to the lobster tank.  Now if you aren't familiar with these tanks they are exactly just what the name implies – a water filled tank full of live lobsters we sell by the pound.  Their claws are bound and they just kind of hang out crawling all over one another.  Kids love to sit there and watch them.

“No way...is he really going to...” I whispered as I watched on in awe.  Sure enough he reached right into the live lobster display tank we have.  After a moment of 'fishing around' he plucked the lobster he wanted from the tank and pulled it out of the water.  Before I could even make heads or tails of the situation he glanced around once more and shoved the lobster right down the front of his pants.  The guy, whom shall be hence forth called Lobster Johnson, then proceeded to shuffle run his way out of the meat department and through the grocery department towards the front of the store.  The only way I can really describe how he ran was a forward version of Zoidberg's shuffle.  All he was missing was yelping out “Woop woop woop woop!” loudly as he went.  

Needless to say he wasn't too hard to stop.  I may not be in the best shape of my life but I can still move quicker than a guy with a large lobster squirming around in his pants.  He didn't fight me at the door or even try to argue what he was doing.  After all, it is kind of hard to argue that you aren't stealing when you have a large, lobster shaped bulge in your pants.

Bonus icing on top of the cake: I usually ask the person why they are stealing.  It usually won't change anything but it fulfills my curiosity and keeps them talking which usually calms them down a bit.  This guy tried to say that he was stealing the lobster for his kids...

His kids have some expensive tastes.",Loss Prevention Tales Pt 3. - Citizen Snips,18,talesFromRetail
tankenka,5,,9,1rgfao,,0,"I work for a phallic retailer with lots of balls. (hehehe)

I decided to go get some water during my shift the other day so I headed towards our water fountain, which happens to be down a narrow hallway and is between the bathrooms and is opposite the hallway from our offices/breakroom area.  As I come around a corner in said hallway I almost bump into our Store Manager (SM from here on out) who is in the middle of cleaning the bathrooms.  SM and I start chatting and from the men's room I hear some loud noises.

""What the hell was that?"" I ask

""Damn kids screwing around."" SM replies as he sets down the bag of trash he had been holding and walks over to the men's room.

Now, SM isn't a particularly tall guy, but he lifts weights quite a bit and could very well be described as being jacked.  Somehow, from time to time, people think it is a good idea to fight him, so I stuck around in case he needed backup.

SM opens the men's room door hard, slamming it into the wall and bellows, ""What the HELL are you doing in my bathroom?""

--inaudible reply--

""Yeah, well it is a pretty sad day when I have to kick someone out of the bathroom, now get the hell out."" SM says at a slightly reduced volume.

""B..But my stomach hurts."" says a meek voice from inside the bathroom.

Then at a normal volume, but with a tone of voice that sounded like SM had ice in his veins he replies, ""Carry it somewhere else.""  Then he stared into the bathroom in a manner that was somewhat intense.

With that the teens walked out of the store with their heads hung in shame.

Princess_Honey_Bunny,114,,162,1rg853,,569,"BACKGROUND: I work at a mattress store. Selling(whatelse) mattresses. The law in North Carolina says that we cannot sell used mattresses. We follow this law strictly. To avoid angry customers being stuck with something they dont like, we offer a 'comfort guarantee' where you have 90days to decide you dont like it and come exchange it for something else. This comes with a fee of $200 as we have to throw the like new mattress out.  

STORY: In comes a guy. Hes visibly upset, all I can think is [""here we go""](http://i.imgur.com/8MmamRX.gif) lets call him Angry Asshat(AA)

AA: I hate my mattress! 

ME: Im so sorry to hear that sir woul-

(he cut me off)

AA: I want my money refunded immediately, and I want you to come get that shit off my property **Today**

ME: Im very sorry but we cant refund your money. 

AA: [WHAT?! WHAT DO YOU MEAN](http://i.imgur.com/HouBhTG.gif)

ME: Well sir its illegal in the state of North Carolina to take used mattresses and we cant take it back. 

AA: WELL I WANT IT THE FUCK BACK NOW I DONT RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE([he was just yelling nonsense at me about how this is whats wrong with the world and its all the dirty liberals fault](http://i.imgur.com/OudLd7s.gif))

ME: Sir, I cannot break the law for you. Not only is it the store policy its **the law**

Now hes raging, but Im trying to salvage the situation

ME: What we can do for you though is our 90 day comfort guarantee swap out. Can I have your name Ill look your ticket up and well see what we can do. 

He seems to calm down a little bit and he takes a seat across from my desk and he gives me hi name. I look up his name and pull up his ticket as Im explaining the comfort guarantee I look at his ticket. And then at the date he bought it(ya know to make sure its at least close to 90 days) I was willing to be flexible to make this guy happy when I notice he bought this mattress 9months ago!! Im flexible but not *that* flexible

ME: Uhh Sir, Im sorry to say this but you bought this mattress 9months ago, that 6months over the 90days. Theres nothing we can do for you. 

That when he became absolutely IRATE with me. Screaming something about how this is bad business practice, he deserves to get a refund, we owe it to him. Blah blah blah. [Im done this this shit](http://i.imgur.com/InDPcFn.gif)

ME: SIR. There is nothing we can do, the comfort exchange policy was explained to you when you bought it, if you didnt like the mattress you should have come back 6months ago, now Im going to have to ask you to leave the store. 

Well he didnt like that very much. He was becoming increasingly angry and hostile. Hes leaning over my desk pointing his finger right in my face([Which I hate](http://i.imgur.com/u77ThfE.gif)) but I keep my cool, and as sternly as I can say

ME: Sir if you dont leave immediately I will be forced to call the police and have you removed from my store. 

He paused for a moment with sheer rage in his eyes. Then he SLAPS!(yes slaps) the coffee on my desk across the 5mattresses that are close to my desk, gives me the finger and walkes out! I was in shock I composed myself quickly, called the police, and then my boss and explained everything that happened. 

I guess that asshat forgot that he gave us his address to deliver the mattress to, he ruined about 5beds which he was made to pay sticker price for on all of them(sticker price is close to $300 more than what we normally sell for) 


Although I was scared I made a great commission on all the beds he had to replace. There was justice that day and it was great.

jessajuhanabi,30,,94,1rhnqp,,397,"As of last Thursday, I am the head manager of a retail outlet and cafe, answering only to my boss, since the only girl above me quit. All people that walk in, call or email come through me. My boss is normally around but he works on coffee machines most days. 

As backgound for this story: His brother is a c*nt. I live in Australia, so that term seriously fits him. He owes a bunch of people money, is generally an asshole, and my boss is very sad his brother has changed so much. It stresses my boss out as their finances are tied due to a trust. 

Today, a lady walks in around 11:30, and walks up to the front desk. Politely, she asks me, ""Is (boss) in?""

In my mind, she was another person that he knew since he's been running this business for 20+ years, or a rep from some company that I didn't care about. He turned around to look at her, and I pointed in his direction. 

She immediately starts spouting about how boss's brother, we'll call him AH for asshole, owed her money. This is not a surprise to boss. He knows her. He's heard from her over email before. In which he told her he has no access to the trust and he's also fighting AH for money. 

This does not please the lady, henceforth known as douchecanoe. DC repeats over and over, despite pleas from my boss to chase down AH, ""I'm not leaving without my money. Get it for me.""

Now, DC wants a hefty sum. A couple thousand dollars. My boss offers her a coffee while he tries to reach AH. A water. A chair. Nothing. She stands in front of our stock and repeats herself over and over. ""Give me my money. Give me my money. I don't care its not my problem. YOU pay me.""

Why is she going after my boss? Because she's gone through the courts, they told AH to pay, and he still hasn't. Her response? Come into my store and stand there all day every day until HIS BROTHER, pays her. 

Now, my boss tries and tries to get her to understand he has no access to the money. No go. So instead she stands in our store, silent, for 4 fucking hours. Four. DC stands there so long my boss gets fed up and stressed, and leaves. 

The difference is, he's a peace keeper. I was itching for him to leave. I was just going to have the cops come eject her. I was EXCITED. 

Unfortunately she realized rather quickly I was not the ""nice cop"" type so she stood out the front, called in a few friends and intermittently yelled ""YOU KNOW THIS IS SO SILLY I JUST WANT MY MONEY FROM THE (BUSINESS)"" and ""I KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE IN XXXX SUBURB I COULD RUIN A BUSINESS IF I WANTED TO."" through the window at me. 

Oh god. You scare me so much. I might pee my pants. 

Anyway she eventually gave up and left without coming back inside, probably since I was watching her and smiling, willing her to come inside so I could call the cops. 

Oh well, another day I suppose! Maybe she'll be back tomorrow...

DolfyuttSrednaz,58,,48,1rh8hc,,200,"I have got to say, after working 4 years in retail, parents should be responsible for their children's actions. I have seen so many kids acting like demons that have just spawned from a dimension full of pointy sticks being shoved up their asses, but I never blame the kids. I usually don't even blame the parents, because kids are kids, but when customers blatantly let their kids run around like Sonic on meth, I blame the parents. that is why we have an announcement that plays every few minutes, reminding customers to keep their little shits in line. So when a customer like the one I had comes in, I usually inform my manager (who will be called Jared) of the situation and he watches the kid from a distance. 

A middle-aged couple stumbles into the store with their 7 year old son. They head off to furniture, but their son makes a bee-line to toys. I immediately call Jared, and let him know that this little tornado is heading to toys and he should try to contain the damage as much as possible. Before the kid makes it to toys, he stops over in the Halloween section and starts putting on masks and runs around the store trying to scare the other customers. After 4 complaints, Jared stops the kid, and drags him to his parents, who don't give one shit nor a giggle about what my manager has to say and wave him off. The kid bolts towards toys, and stars ripping toys down off the shelf. The floor looks like a miniature Antietam by the time he is finished. Now he has an armload of toys and decides to take them to the bathroom. Once in there, he places them on the floor, and proceeds to urinate on them. Jared walks in on him finishing up, and drags the kid back to his parents, leaving a trail of piss footprints behind him. Jared tells the parents what he did, and that they have to clean up the mess. This switches the parents into rage mode. They just cannot BELIEVE that their kid would do this! And he will be punished severely when they get home. Jared tells them calmly ""I am punishing you, not your child. You guys made no effort to control him, and even brushed me off after the first incident. You guys will clean up every mess he has made, and then you can leave. You are no longer welcomed here."" They start yelling profanities at him and their kid, saying how this is ridiculous and they shouldn't have to put up with this. 

After they cleaned up, they left empty handed. Jared received many compliments on how he handled the situation. It is the second worst customers I have ever had, even if I didn't directly deal with them. The worst, by far, has to be a couple out of towners. That is for another day though.

aturquoiseseashell,12,,25,1rg9do,,127,"End of shift at a famous, upscale department store, and I am already clocked out, with my purse on. I'm talking to my coworkers before I leave because I'm waiting on a ride home. I work in the lingerie department, which is near one of the 2nd story entrance doors to the store. 

A flustered woman comes up with three bags, one from Kate Spade, one from Michael Kors, and one from Tory Burch. She says she found the bags in the vestibule of the entrance to the store.
We thank her for her honesty and promise to call Loss Prevention to come and take the bags. She becomes agitated.

""Well I'm going to wait here and see that you do it,"" she snaps. She's suddenly riled up.

We're a bit taken aback, but continue to be polite to her and my coworker calls LP.

While my coworker waits on the phone to be connected to the security desk, I guess we kind of exchanged looks. (She was very antsy, and was holding onto the bags for dear life). The woman exclaims in outrage, ""Don't you all roll your eyes at me!"" 

""Ma'am,"" says my co-worker, ""No one is rolling their eyes. We're waiting for security to pick up the phone. They will make sure the bags are returned to the customer. Thank you very much for bringing them to our attention, we will see to it that they are returned to the customer."" 

The woman becomes more agitated and irritated. Finally, security picks up and my coworker says, ""A customer found some bags; one's from MK, one is from Tory Burch…""
The woman snaps, before my coworker is quite finished, ""And one from Kate Spade!!"" as though we purposely left that one out so we could steal it or something. 

""And one from Kate Spade,"" my co-worker adds. We're all getting kind of insulted by this woman's attitude. She seems convinced we're plotting to steal the bags, despite the fact that they remain in plain sight of the security camera. We're all well-dressed, well-spoken girls in our early twenties, and we are acting calm and polite. No apparent cause for suspicion.

Security says they can't help and to turn the bags into customer service, who coworker speaks to.
""Ma'am, please give me the bags. Customer service is coming to pick them up,"" my coworker says. We really want her to leave at this point. She's staring at us through narrowed eyes and she's breathing heavily.

""No!"" the woman shrieks, and clutches them to her chest. She tears frantically at one of them and finds a receipt. She begins dialing the number of Kate Spade. We're stunned.
""Please, ma'am…"" the coworker begins, but the woman literally shushes her and begins frantically reading the details of the receipt to the cashier at Kate Spade who is on the other end of the phone. 

She convinces an employee at Kate Spade to come to the dept. store to identify the bags.
Meanwhile, she announces that she will take the bags to customer service herself, in a very angry tone. ""You all are acting VERY suspicious!"" she declares, still clutching the bags to her breast almost maniacally. 

At this point, we're pretty alarmed by her behavior and beginning to wonder if she plans to steal the bags herself after seeing the prices on the receipt. My coworker calls the store manager, and we inform the customer that we would prefer that she remain in lingerie with the bags and wait for the manager. She loudly refuses to stay put. My coworker follows her to customer service.

From all the way in our department on the other end of the floor, we can hear the woman yelling. She had a quavery voice and a really strong British accent. 
Apparently, she got to customer service, and the couple who had left the bags was there. The woman refused to give them the bags without proof of their identity!! Finally the Kate Spade employee arrived and confirmed that yes, the bags belonged to the couple. 

I guess the woman was trying to do the right thing, but she insulted my coworkers and me and frightened various customers in the process. I still don't get why she became so suspicious or why she didn't just bring the bags to customer service in the first place.

KroipyBill,11,,40,1rhynu,,123,"After [writing about our cheering seasonal workers from Black Friday yesterday,](http://redd.it/1rf92j) it reminded me of this other story involving my goofy manager. 

When I first started working for this place, I came in clean shaven, and patchy hair. I was in denial that mother nature was closing my hair follicles for business, and it wasn't until after my engagement photos I decided to make a change. I shaved my head and have kept it that way ever since. I then grew a goatee to compensate for my loss. Honestly I looked much sharper than having the grassy field of hair you can see the horizon through. It was a relief to embrace it, and feel like I looked decent again. There was one manager who enjoyed messing with me however. In fact in my previous stories, I've quoted him several times in our conversations, since he was my favorite manager to talk to, and the biggest goof ball there. He vowed he would draw on my head when I wasn't ready for it. 

**Me:** Dude I'm taller than you. So unless you parachute from the rafters onto my cranium with your sharpie, you will not succeed. 

**Manager:** We'll see...we'll...see...

At that moment I wondered if he really was contemplating that attack strategy. At least he left it at just contemplating. 

One day, we were pretty busy. It was pre-holiday, post-black Friday days. I'm sure you all know the type. Everybody is getting geared up for Christmas. I found my way over to the computer department helping a customer decide what Mac they wanted. I was describing the hardware specs, how it works with their Apple products etc. During this I felt I was going to make a decent sale. However I made a massive mistake...

*I sat down.* 

Yes I slipped up big time. My manager saw this opportunity from what it seemed immediately. He walked over and distracted me by having another employee ask me a question. 

**Employee:** Hey KroipyBill you know where I can find [some bullcrap item that he knew the answer to.]

**Me:** Yeah sure. Remember they're eh...ahh...AHH!!!

Right then, my manager walks up to me with his pen, and I felt the coldness of the ballpoint touch my head, while it was dragged across my chrome dome. My entire body froze as if somebody stiffed my spine. I made a weird breathing noise, like I was experiencing sharp pains when it was just mainly a very tiny cold piece of metal on my head. Kind of like EAHH!! EAHH!! EAHH!!! (That's the best I can do textually.) They were quiet, sharp noises.

He walked off, cackling like the joker. I looked at my customer with this super surprised look on my face. He lost his crap, and just laughed. Because of this I sold him more attachments, but that's beside the point. 

Over the radio:

**Me:** The person who drew on my head. You know who you are. Thanks for helping my sale out by doodling with a ballpoint pen on my cranium. 

I looked around the store and saw those with a radio express such confusion. I'm a pretty tall dude, so for those who were in eye sight, I bent my head down so they could see the graffiti my manager brought forth upon my person. Much laughter followed, including my manager.

**Manager:** You said I would never get you. 

**Me:** Well bucket head, you're lucky I was sitting so your midget self could strike me. 

**Manager:** My strike is now complete. 

**Me:** It's a good thing I don't just go over there and rub my greasy head all over your face. I'm glad you feel all militaristic about your approach. 

**Manager:** Oh...this would be a much more fun Call of Duty game if this were part of the game play. 

I never got him back. And he has since left the store after I left. Despite us still being good friends, he's still a bucket head.

Minja78,35,,16,1rgqvv,,81,"Preface, I sell cars in the Pacific Northwest.  This story occurred back in October.   
    
It was a beautiful sunny day, which is not common in these parts from oh...October to May.    
    
A very proper looking lady walks up and asks for a salesmen that is off.  Lets call her Uber bitch (UB).  
    
Me, ""He's off today, is there something I can help you with?"" 
       
UB, ""I'm not sure your capable, 'L' was very knowledgeable.""  
       
Her tone was very matter of fact and frankly bitchy.     
     
Me, ""Lets do it this way, I'll help you to the best of my ability and if you're not satisfied you can come back and see 'L' when he gets back.""     
    
UB sighed and said, ""I suppose that will do. Tell me about your most advanced car.""     
    
Me, ""Advanced how?""     
   
UB, ""Technologically.""    
    
Me, ""That's a pretty broad spectrum, lets start with what kind of car do you want?  Like an SUV or Sedan.""      
       
UB, ""I don't see why this matters.""     
    
Me, ""I'm just trying to help you to the best of my ability.""    
    
UB, ""Well that clearly lacking.""      
    
Me, ""Apparently. I have an idea though lets go look at the new Avalon, they just had a fresh rebuild this year so I would say the have the most gadgets and cool technology in them.""     
    
UB, ""That's a start show me the way.""      
    
At this point I realized that I'm dealing with some sort of royalty by the way she's talking to me and looking at me like I was clearly beneath her.    
    
We walked out side and toward the Avalon's and as we rounded the corner I was blinded by the light of 1 sun (that mutha fucker is bright when we only see it a few times a year) so I do what I thought was natural, I put on my sun glasses. You'd think I killed her 2nd born spawn.    
        
UB stopped in her tracks and said, ""Excuse me, how long have you been in sales.""     
    
Me, ""About 15 years now, why do you ask?""    
    
UB, ""How dare you put your sunglasses on in front of a customer. You should know better.""    
    
At this point I'm done with her attitude. She can; buy a car, sell a car, die in fire for all that I'm concerned.    
    
Me, ""While were walking into the direct sunlight I'm keeping them on, once we get into a car I'll make sure to take them off so you can see my pretty greens again.""     
     
The look and sound of disgust from her should of withered some near by plants.     
    
UB, "" I don't want to look at the Avalon unless it has what I want on it.""      
        
I acted all surprised and said, ""Ahhh in that case thus far all you've told me is that you want technology on it. Every car on my lot has technology, how about you fill in the blanks for me and I'll get you what you need.""   I finished that last part with a touch of sarcasm.
    
UB, "" You don't have to take that tone with me.""     
    
I just started at her until she finally answered my question.    
   
UB, ""I want....""  Imagine everything every car in every scfi movie has done (some highlights: Voice activated everything, self driving, self maintaining, color changing, all electric or non-gas, The list goes on)     

Me, ""Mam for me to get you even a small percentage of these option I would need a time machine, what you asking for simply does not exist.""     
    
UB, "" You never tell a customer you can't get something for them it's improper sales.""    
    
Me, ""What's your thoughts on a Prius that parks for you, stops for you in emergencies and has rain sensing wipers?""    
    
UB let here vileness spew out of her and she said, ""That's all been out for years I don't want dated technology.""    
   
Me, ""What your asking for doesn't exist, I think the closest you'll come is the new Tesla but I can't think of anything in the mainstream car world that's even close to half of your list.""     
   
UB, ""You are an awful salesman then.""

Maloth_Warblade,6,,17,1rhx0y,,94,"Black Friday, 2011. Big, blue, zombie-filled box store. I was a photo tech.

It's been almost 2 years now, as I no longer work for retail. I did my 5 years with it and I'm done.

I'm glad I'm out, too. I don't hate people, I just learned that I hate being treated like less than crap, filth, and told I'm worthless on a daily basis. But this one was so irritating I spoke up.

I worked 2 stores on Black Friday in 2011, both the BBS and the famous game store. I was basically at work from Noon-8 on Thanksgiving at the BBS, missing all family gatherings, by the way, and then 11:30pm-7am at the games store (I was the only cashier by the way, in the most populated area of the county/city), and then 12-8 again on Black Friday at the BBS. 

I was tired, beyond tired, essentially 20hrs of work, on my feet with no breaks for food or bathroom due to chaos. The BBS frequently refused to give me my lunches until I was mandatorily locked out, and even then they simply made me work anyway (even got reported for going over 8 hrs without a break, wasn't given a choice).

 Needless to say, by the time 5pm rolled around, and not having eaten but a pop tart in 24hrs, I was having a sugar crash. These make you lightheaded, these make it hard to think and respond quickly. I was working my ass off to get greeting cards printed, packaged, priced and all the while walking everyone through how to use our touch-screen computers and simple tasks. 

One customer didn't like that I wasn't answering fast enough. Of course she didn't, it's Black Friday, and that I was being far too rude for her. She told me she didn't like how tired I was, that I shouldn't work at all if I was so tired. How worthless I was to be there, on the busiest day of the year, if I couldn't be bothered to be awake. 

At this point I interrupted her. I told her ""Lady, listen. I don't need this from you, not today. Not the day people die from customers entitlement. No. I've been working since pretty much Noon yesterday. I had to miss my family's Thanksgiving, again, and not only that, I couldn't even EAT any food yet. There's no time. I'm beyond having a sugar crash, I'm hungry, and beyond normal tired. If you're going to sit there and belittle me over this, you can just get out of my face and leave this place"" (or something VERY close to this, been a few years).

Of course I got loud to say this, and everyone looked at her. Associates, customers, even her husband. She tried apologizing, I kept interrupting her asking what else she needed, and she kept trying to change subjects..I wouldn't let her. She was the last straw I needed that day, and I wasn't having it.

Good news though, wasn't reported, wasn't written up. Had a very nice and thoughtful customer buy me a bag of chips and a soda after seeing me be berated by not only her but other customers. Made it home and promptly slept for 15 hours.

adelajoy,15,,15,1rg29x,,73,"I spent two years working at a big warehouse-style grocery store. I worked mostly as a cashier, but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a week.

Most of the crappy moments have all blurred together, but there are a few particular moments that stick out.

This grocery store is the only one in the area that doesn't bag your groceries for you. Each till has two long conveyor belts to hold your groceries while you bag them (Both the customer and the cashier have buttons to move the groceries down, away from the till). This speeds orders up, requires less staff, saves money and drops prices. People occasionally complain about it, but if they want to pay more for their groceries and have someone else bag them, they're welcome to. ... The store isn't exactly famous for customer service, but I think the prices make up for this.

I was one of the fastest cashiers on staff at the time. This meant that my belts would often get full. I had ways to deal with this. I knew how fast people packed, I knew how soon a belt would clear. I was really good at my job. One day, the lines were insanely long, I was working really fast, everyone was buying a lot. I got to a point that there were groceries on both of my belts, so I squeezed the smaller order down a little, watched for a moment, and knew that he would be down before the next order crowded him. I started scanning the next order, and smiled at the customers - a man and his very pregnant wife.

The wife snapped at me, ""Can you just wait!""

""Excuse me?""

""Can you wait? I don't want you to crowd out that other guy!""

I looked, and he was literally loading his last bag with groceries. I stopped scanning anyways, and maybe glared at the lady. I don't really like it when other people tell me how to do my job.

Eventually he was packed and gone, so I started scanning again. While I had been waiting, I had lined all of their canned goods up. I can scan cans super fast if they're all really close. I started scanning the canned goods, grabbing a can, tossing it to my other hand, and setting it on the other belt. Except that this woman had walked around (The belt she got was behind me) and was standing behind me, trying to bag the cans as I scanned them. I'm sorry, but I'm not actually looking where the cans go. I know the space, and I need to watch the computer screen, not my hands. Well, she kept trying to grab the one I'd just set down, which meant that I kept hitting her hand with the next can. I wasn't by any means throwing the cans, but I was moving quickly and she was in my space, so she was getting hit. I didn't actually realize that I was hitting her until she complained to her husband. So I slowed down, apologized, and moved on to her other groceries.

She then had a bag of apples. She had grabbed one of our bags and put three different apples in it, and tied it shut. I have to weigh each type of fruit separately, so I opened the bag, weighed the first apple, set it aside. I noticed her husband grabbed the apple right away. I weighed the second apple, and set it aside. He grabbed that one too. When I weighed the third, my plan had been to put all three back in the bag and tie it shut, but the other two apples were gone. I tied the bag around the last one and set it on the belt. If the husband wanted to pack the apples separately, he was welcome to.

The couple also bought about half a dozen little bags of frozen perogies. One of the bags had been ripped all the open, right down the middle, and frozen perogies were laying all over the belt. I considered not telling them, because I was mad, but I took a deep breath, rounded up all of the stray perogies, put them in a plastic bag, and informed the lady. I asked her if she would like me to send for a new bag. She snippily replied ""Yes"" as if I should have just known. Some people don't bother to get a new bag because it can hold up the line, so I always ask. Our runner quickly returned with an identical bag and I kept going.

When I finally finished (They bought *a lot* of stuff), the husband paid, while the wife stormed over to customer service. I watched as she talked to my supervisor, and eventually a store manager. I was getting pretty nervous. Oh, also I should mention this woman was rude and snapped every time I asked her a question. I was pretty angry by the time they left.

After they were completely done, my supervisor closed my till and asked to speak to me at customer service.

She said the lady had filed a formal complaint against me. Apparently the conversation went something like this:

**Pregnant Lady**: ""I want to complain about the cashier on till 9!""

**Nice Supervisor**: ""Till 9? Do you mean till 8?"" (I was on 9 - one of my quick-to-anger coworkers was on 8)

**PL**: ""No, I mean 9!""

**NS**: ""Like the girl with brown hair, *not* the blonde?""

**PL**: (getting frustrated) ""Yes!""

**NS**: ""So what did adelajoy do?""

**PL**: ""She was rude and short with me!""

**NS**: ""Adelajoy? Are you sure?""

**PL**: ""Yes! She also threw canned goods at me, *ripped* open a bag of perogies, scattered them *everywhere* and scattered all of my apples too! She also bruised all of my fruit because she was throwing them around!""

A store manager was brought down to take a formal complaint, which means it probably went in my employee file. The lady was calmed down and left, and that was the end of it. Typically, the store managers will meet with you to discuss complaints, and make sure they won't happen again. The fact that I didn't means either the manager simply didn't believe the woman, or wasn't concerned because it was my first (and only). The supervisor who helped her said she closed my till because I looked upset and she thought I needed a break. The only reason she told me was to find out what really happened. I told her my side, and she just laughed it off. I admitted to being short and snippy, but the rest was just ludicrous. I still cannot beleive she blamed me for the bag of perogies being ripped open, considering I told her about them, got a new bag, and spent a minute or two picking up all of the perogies. Also, why would I take the time to do that, when I was clearly rushed with everything else?

I get that pregnant women have a lot of hormones, and tend to be angry, short-tempered, whatnot, but I think there's a line. Also, the fact that her husband didn't stop her, stand up for me, or admit to grabbing all the apples kind of pissed me off.

Tl;dr: Crazy-hormones pregnant lady complained about me, but the supervisor didn't believe her.","In my spare time, I like to rip open your groceries and scatter them",88,talesFromRetail
unidentifiableblarg,12,,9,1rhfwt,,65,"**Back story:** I worked in a small convenience store in a town on the outskirts of a city. A lot of the customer's are regulars and have been coming here for years, decades even.

About 6 years ago the place changed hands, names and management too. Still provided the same sort of stuff though, so the locals kept calling it by it's old name. 

This is relevant, I swear.



**The story:** I'm serving on the registers at the front of the store, just doin ma biz, when a flustered woman comes up to the counter demanding my attention. I tell her I'll be with her as soon as I finish processing my currant customer.

This somehow seemed to offended her, so I was already off to a bad start. But I get to her and try to smooth things over with my best customer service voice (you know the one).

After a bit of just listening to her complaining and bitching in general she finally gets to the point.

""I bought this product here earlier and you (not me) charged me the wrong price! It's on special, why is it wrong blah blah blah""

The outrage was dripping off her.

Now, normally I'd be prepared to fix this, sometimes we just straight up get it wrong and stuff isn't the right price.

*But*, while she's ranting she's waving around a catalogue, that contains the magical special that we failed to give her.

Eventually she shoves it in my face to accent a point, and shows me what it should have been.

The catalogue wasn't for our store, we don't even sell the brand (ice cream, I think it was) that she seemed to have thought she purchased.

I politely explain that we're not an [old store] any more and that was why she didn't get the discount. But I'd be happy t...

Her: What?! I've lived her FOR YEARS and it's always been [old store]. You've got to be kidding me.

I point out the signs (they're everywhere) and shirts of the employees and explain that we've been [new store] for quite a while.

She persists though, demanding to get her discount because it's ""always been that way and why should I get screwed for what you did..."" just generally giving me a hard time; that kind of bullshit.

The managers will usually give the discount to them anyway, just to keep them happy, but I was sick of getting abused by people who apparently can't read and wasn't about to let this one fly. Pety, I know.

Eventually I get to the point where I'm just repeating myself and she's adamantly refusing to be 'robbed' of forty cents. So I call my manager to come up.

By this stage I'm sick of her shit and just want her to leave, customers are waiting to be served and I'm meant to be serving. Small store, small number of staff.

Finally my duty manager meanders up and he immediately grovels at her feet, begging her forgiveness and taking her to a spare register to sort out her problem. 


I'm not bitter (lies), but the smug grin she threw me on her way out made me really wish that our management stood up for us, at least sometimes.

And that I had a crowbar handy.

CommandoDerp,9,,17,1rhsfa,,62,"First off, I would like to say that I had two days off before this incident so I was unaware of any changes at work.

So I was at work after two days off when I was serving an elderly man, who was a regular, cigarettes. He asked for a particular brand in a carton of twin packs. I tell him unfortunately that the twin packs are classified as cartons themselves, and you cannot purchase a carton of a carton. He rolled his eyes and asked for 4 individual twin packs.

I immediately check the cupboard nearby of said twin packs of cigarettes that he wanted and I inform him that we are all sold out. This is the conversation that follows:

Him: ""Are you serious?""
Me: ""Yes, sorry. We are unfortunately all sold out until we get some more.""
Him: ""This is pathetic!""
Me: ""Would you like another flavor?""
He mumbles something to me which I repeat my previous question.
Me: ""Would you like another flavor?""
Him: ""No. This unacceptable. You are refusing sale""
Me: ""Is there anything else I can help you with as we don't seem to have what you are after?""
Him: ""I would like to speak to your manager.""
Me: ""Actually there might be some here""

I had a thought and I turned around and checked the display rack to see if there are any more in the display. To which I found 4 individual twin packs sitting there, I felt like an idiot not checking there first.

Me: ""I didn't realize that there was any in the display, I...""
Him: ""Your very lucky""
Me: ""I'm very sorry I did not check there first. I recently had two days off and I wasn't informed that what you were after was in the display. I'm sorry for any unconvinced""

He just sighs loudly and rolls his eyes and tells me one last thing while paying for his cigarettes.

Him: ""Your very lucky you found them or otherwise you would have lost hundreds and hundreds of dollars in sales and quite a few hundred customers because of your poor service.""

Payment is finished and I tell him I'm sorry again and to enjoy his night. He storms back into the store and complains to another staff member who was not in charge for the night.

The man left and the employee approached me asking what happened. I told them and they said not to worry, they knew it wasn't on purpose. The actual supervisor for the night approached me and asked what happened, they knew it wasn't intentional so they didn't seem too phased by it; even though I was the back up person in charge that night.","I don't know how to feel after my ""complaint""?",79,talesFromRetail
Drunken_Black_Belt,7,,8,1rhw8z,,59,"I'm back bitches!  About 2 months ago, I got a second job working part time at a men's Big &amp;Tall store.  The hours are easy, commision is alright, and to be honest, the customers are generally friendly and awesome.  It helps that a lot of them don't have anywhere else to shop. Unfortunantly the store isn't as eventul as my past retail jobs.  Its just selling clothes and shoes.  But I've gotten a few funny stories that I'll share over time here. And with the holiday's coming up, i'm sure I'll have plenty more.  

Welll, for your pleasure (hopefully), I present **Boy, Are My Feet Sore!**

**WARNING: GROSS!**

So recently I began working in a men's store for Big &amp; Tall sizes.  I knew of it because I buy my shoes there.  Only store that carries a size 15/16.  I am too small for the clothes, despite being 6'4 and slightly overweight.  And if I'm being honest,  seeing some of the people who come in makes me more motivated to keep losing weight (50 lbs this year alone).  

Now, don't get me wrong, SOME of the people have legitimate health concerns.  One gentleman was born with his left foot backwards.  During his childhood they would constantly have to break his foot, set it slightly closer to the proper position, let it heal, and repeat. But it never set 100% correct, keeping him from being able to run or exercise, or even stand for long periods of time.  It's guys like him I feel for.  Given a shitty deal in life and just having to suffer for it. 

Most customers, however, are just plain old fat guys.  I don't want to sound mean, or ""fat shame"".  But it's just poor lifestyle choices and such.  I was there.  I was 5lbs shy of 300 last new years.  And it was just being lazy and making bad choices.  I don't have as much sympathy for these guys.  And that brings us to our story today.

It's a sunny fall day.  It's midweek, and pretty dead.  I'm in my suit, fixing clothes, putzing around, pretty much just pretending to work.  I hear the door chime, and in walks an older couple.  Probably late 60's, very early 70's.  The lady was using a walker to move around, and the gentleman was resting his weight on a cane as he slowly moved with her.  They seemed like a nice enough couple, but as you know, those are the ones who always turn into assholes.

I introduced myself, asked how I could help them that day.  The man gruffly replied ""shoes"".  I brought them to the shoe department.  Now my store is small, and there is only one small bench to sit on, and it's in the shoe department.  Naturally, this oaf takes the seat, leaving his frail wife to stand.  I could tell she was having difficulty, being particularly petire and frail, so I went in the back and got her a folding chair to sit in next to her husband.  She thanked me, because manners.  The man, charming fellow that he was, just said ""can you get me some shoes now?"".  

It was about this time that I realized this was going to go south faster than a my ex g/f in a dick sucking contest.

I offered several suggestions, as the gentleman didn't seem to know what kind of shoes he wanted.  The man complained that most of our shoes don't even fit him. I expressed sympathy, as I have large feet and can only fit into the largest size available in store.  The man looked me up and down and sneered ""Well, you just have big feet. I have a health condition that causes this, so consider yourself lucky"".  

Eventually we found a pair he liked and thought may just fit his feet.  And that's when the real horror of this story starts.  The man then proceeds to roll up his sweatpants.  He was wearing ankle socks and sandals.  His feet are hugely swollen, and covered in open sores.  This guy has diabetes, and it's eating away at his foot.  Sadly it's fairly common where I work.  What came next, however, is not.

I hand him the shoes, and take a step back, giving him some space to put the shoes on, look at them in the mirror, see how they feel, etc.  

NOPE!  

He looks at me like an idiot and says ""Well I can't put them on myself.  I can't bend that far.  Put them on for me"".   

Now I am no fan of feet, even on a good day.  Sure if I'm dating someone, and they want a footrub, and their feet are clean, then i'll oblige.  But other than that, I just want nothing to do with that area of the body.  Add to the fact that we are talking about a stranger whose foot is literally covered in open, oozing sores.  

DBB: Sir I just can't do that, I'm sorry.

Man:  You need to help me.  I'm a customer and I need service.

DBB: There is no way I am doing that sir.  I am sorry but you have open sores on your foot and leg. It's unsanitary for both me and YOU, to have me do that.

Man: Oh just wash your hands after it'll be fine.

How this man survived 70 or so years with logic like that, will forever amaze me.  

DBB: Absolutely not.  

Man: I want the manger!  I'll have your ass for discrimination and harrassment

DBB:  I am the manager.  If you want the store manager call back tomorrow.  If you want corporate's phone number I'll give it with my name gladly.  


The man continued to yell and scream about receiving the shoes at a discount and having me fired.  Typical stuff for anyone who works in retail really.  I essentially told him that I wasn't going to touch his feet, and if he didn't like the service he could leave. Wife is trying to keep the peace.  It's not very effective.  Husband used Rage!  It's inneffective against DBB!  Besides my DEF is to high.  

Anyways, i wish there was some more to this.  Eventually he stormed out as dramatically as one can when you can barely walk under your own weight, and your wife is frail and moves about as fast a christian school girl with a chastity belt.  I did hear from corporate the next day though.  Naturally some of the details were changed when he called in, but once I explained about the sores, I receieve a ""Yea that happens all the time. Don't worry about it"".  

Sorry if it's not very exciting.  I'm sure I'll have some good ones coming up.  Hope you all are surviving the holidays!

Turns out, the woman was making a sizeable purchase and couldn't supply an adequate form of ID. I explained to her that we simply couldn't process her credit card without proper identification. She dug through her purse and tossed a bottle of birth control pills on the counter and was like ""Will this bottle work? No one can have these pills but me"" No ma'am ... birth control pills are not a form of identification. She then threw a world class tantrum using colorful language that would even make a seasoned sailor blush.

At that point, I let her know she was no longer welcomed at any of the locations in our state. She wanted my DM's info and I was like you're looking at her but if you'd like to talk to my Regional, I'll dial the number for you. She left at that point.

I was working in the jewelry department of a department/grocery store at the time. I'd been in that same department for 2 years by the time this incident took place. It was very early on a Saturday, before the rush, and a lady comes up to my counter to do a return. No problemo, I thought.

Me: I can do that return for you. Can I see your receipt ma'am?

Customer: I don't have it anymore. 

Me: I'll only be able to refund it to a gift card then, is that ok?

Customer: yeah, that's fine. 

One hurdle jumped. She hands me the item and I notice that it is in a package I have never seen before. I know my department like the back of my hand cause I'm the one that checks in -all- of the merchandise. Every item that has gone into the department in the last two years had to pass by me first. 

Me: ma'am are you sure you bought this here? I don't recognize this package. 

Customer, suddenly angry: of course I bought it here. (Spoiler, this a lie)

Me: ok, let me see if the system recognizes it. 

I scan the item at the register and I get an error. I look at the barcode and it's half as long as it needs to be (6 characters instead of 12, which is the store norm). 

Me: ma'am my register does not recognize this item. 

Customer: I bought it here!

Me, getting cranky at this point: are you -sure-? I've been in the department for two years and I've never seen this package before. Are you certain you didn't buy this at [dept store x] or [dept store y]?

Customer: I'm certain. I'm returning this for a friend and she bought it here! (Told ya)

Me: I'm sorry but I can't take an Item that doesn't even come up in the system. Especially if you don't have a receipt. 

Customer snatches the item from me and pulls her cell phone out: I am going to call her (the friend) and prove to you that it was bought here!! (She's nearly screaming at this point)

The customer walks away and makes her call. I watch her patiently from the counter and wait for her to return. She finally gets her friend on the line but is far enough away that I can't hear her. She's visibly pissed off and ranting to her friend. There's a short pause as she listens to her friend. Her demeanor changes completely. She looks at me once, turns, and walks out the door, presumably to return the item at the place it was bought from. ",Just discovered this sub today.

ScaldingSoup,5,,6,1rha57,,26,"So several  years ago I worked for a very popular lingerie store.  This store didn't pay commission, but would give us more or less hours per week based on sales performance.  My sales performance was VERY good.  I got more hours a week than most people.  

During the holiday season, we had a lot of seasonal employees, as any big retail store normally does.  One of the workers hired seasonally was this lady who was a lot older than the rest of us.  This was not the problem.  Her hair was bleached blonde, and growing out (showing obvious roots), and styled in a ""feathered"" fashion.  She did not know how to wear make-up and what she wore did not flatter her.  In this store our dress code was all black.   She wore skirts with no stockings, but with slouch socks and yeah, that was a hot mess.  

People began to call her the ""missing link"", as in to the 1980s because of the hair and her wearing slouch socks that were probably black in the 1980s but grey now.  Reading this, you may think that I judged her based on this, or have some animosity for people older than me.  I do not, but this just sort of describes what she looked like because it is important.  Black Friday rolls around, and she wears her normal dress of skirt, slouch socks and what-not.  Surrounding her socks are these bells that jingle..  

She begins waving panties in the air, helicopter style, like a stripper, chanting what the sale is as customers are passing by.  One of our gay male managers passes me by and mutters so only I can hear it ""I want her out"".  I was dying trying not to laugh at the situation, and meanwhile feeling very embarrassed for her.  Everywhere she walked, she jingled.

Some time during her short career with the lingerie store, she found my phone number on the schedule.  I guess they weren't giving her enough hours, because she had the nerve to leave me a message asking me for some of mine.

BlankName55,14,,6,1rgvl7,,23,"**Background**: I work for the spark store at a mega sized location. It's a regular location with a grocery store on one side and a nursery, essentially, on the other. I work in the party/craft/office section, although I've done everything and anything, from service desk to the truck to the phones (no, I believe you want the health clinic down the street, ma'am).

**Story (er, stories)**: 

1) I walk by the front door. Man approached with wife, stopped and said Excuse Me? Fine. I go over, and he started counting out a huge wad of cash. He counts $100 in small bills out, gives it to me, then says, ""Now, I want a propane tank, honey..."" 

He got the manager who resembles an NFL player instead. (Yes, I gave him the money back.)

2) Two young guys came through the checkout line with four carts of Head &amp; Shoulders, Dove bars, and some razors, I forgot the brand. This is ***-mart, it's cheap, and that's what matters. Three products. They racked up $1800 in this stuff. The one guy then pulled out of his pocket a pile of coupons that was quite literally a foot high. Mind already blown, I said half-jokingly, ""Those aren't all for me, are they?""

Yes. Yes they were. $1500 in coupons, $3 at a time. Do the math. And you couldn't do coupon repeats. Due to the volume, the *CSM thing came up halfway through, and I said ""Oh, the supervisor's going to have to turn the key..."" and they were all ""Ok, cool.""

So they hand over the remaining $300 cash (and people pay 500-600 all the time-that was normal) and the supervisor sees the key message on the palm pilot. I had every CSM (three on duty), the front end supervisor, two assistant managers, and every loss prevention person in the building (three-two associates &amp; the manager) at the register in what seemed like two seconds. 

The guy who'd had the coupons recognized the front end supervisor. He (coupon guy) went off and started going into it with the supervisor. The friend stands there numb, all the managers start talking at me, a CSM sticks the key in to abort this transaction, and I'm standing here holding $300 cash and a hell's lot of coupons. 

Then:
The customer let out a primal yell, the supervisor took the coupons from me, stuck them in the guy's hand, and wished him a good day-anywhere else. 

Turns out they were known scammers. The coupons would scan, but we can't get money back for them. I knew something was up, but I didn't know the back story. I just was asking myself over and over after this: If it had all gone through, and they'd walked out with $1800 of soap and shampoo, what the hell were they going to do with it all? Sell it at less than cost? Fill a swimming pool? Get ridiculously clean?

Well, because the star of this story is my son but, after reading all the posts about awful parents/kids, I wanted to share a funny story about a good kid and parents who are trying their best.

This story happened when my son was 4.  It takes place in the store where I work.  I wasn't there at the time.  My son, I'll call him Cee, was browsing the toy department with his dad while they were waiting for me to finish my shift.  

While Cee and his dad are looking at the toys, a woman with two children comes into the aisle they are in.  The older of the two, who is about the same age as Cee, sees something she wants and asks her mom for it.  Mom says no.  The little girl begs and pleads but mom holds firm and keeps telling her no.  Then the girl pulls out all the stops and throws herself on the floor, kicking and screaming, in a full blown tantrum.

Cee watches for a few seconds and then walks over to the girl.  He kneels in front of her and says:  ""Well, if you act like that, you really won't get anything.""  And then he walked back to his dad.  

Cee's dad was trying hard not to laugh but the woman didn't find it so funny.  She looked embarrassed and angry.  She grabbed her kids and stormed off.

copisreallybad,4,,6,1rhulb,,22,"a few days ago, i get called down to the returns desk from the paint desk. the return policy for the chain i work at is very lenient, but we aren't supposed to take mixed paint back, so already walking down there i had a bad feeling that i would have to get a manager involved (and we all know how incompetent they can be)

so i get there, and to my surprise it's just a regular can of unmixed, white, exterior paint, which *is* returnable without manager involvement. i ask the guy what's wrong with the paint and he says that it's frozen and we need to fix it or give him another can.

i bring the can to the paint desk and open it up. now, imagine what half frozen, hardened paint looks like. that's what this paint looked like, and the following conversation sort of went like this.

me: ""this paint is frozen, did you leave it in the garage or something?""

customer (now visibly irate): ""ABSOLUTELY NOT I BOUGHT IT AND I JUST OPENED IT THIS MORNING AND TO MY SURPRISE IT LOOKS LIKE THIS""

me: ""I'm sorry but we really aren't supposed to take paint like this back, it's useless to us returned""

customer (literally about to pop a blood vessel in his brain at this point): ""WELL MAYBE IF YOU GUYS HAD FUCKING SOLD ME A GOOD CAN OF PAINT IT WOULDNT BE FUCKING FROZEN. I WANT A MANAGER, NOW""

great, this guy knows how to get what he wants. i call a manager and explain the situation to him. the manager, being a typical manager, offers him a plethora of free things, including brushes and a brand new can of paint. the customer walks away with his free things (that i have to get for him) with the smuggiest ass look on his face.

story over, right? nope. i bring the can of paint to receiving, ZMA and hazmat it (since we can't sell it, it's fucking frozen and you can't paint with it). done deal im thinking, right?

not even close, bby. picture a hambeast of a woman. ok, maybe not that big, but she had a hard time fitting inside the reach truck sometimes. she is the department head of receiving. basically she sits in receiving on her computer waiting for trucks to arrive. 

now picture her carrying the frozen can of paint to the desk, except i actually had to see it happen. 

okay, okay, what the fuck is going on, im thinking. maybe i didnt mark it down correctly or something, maybe she'll show me how to hazmat it, i have no idea. im also in the middle of explaining to an older woman the different paint finishes we sell. 

nope, she has the nerve to tell me to just ""stick it in the paint shaker for a minute or two and see if we can try and sell it as OOPS paint."" at this point im all whatthefuck.jpeg, the paint is fucking frozen and shaking it won't help. i try to explain this to her but she would have none of it and walks away, and me, being the lowly, minimum wage paint associate that i am, do as she says. i stick it on the OOPS rack and continue my day.

the story ends when the department head of paint sees it on the OOPS rack, laughs, and takes it to receiving himself to hazmat it.

I worked in a a supermarket produce department for about 13 months.  But there was a guy who came in he'd wear a suit and gel his hair to make himself look important, but the only time id see him in my department was sampling my food or outright shoplifting. 
One of the things he'd do would come up to me and say something along the lines of
""Hey Champ, can you cut me a piece of this ""insert fruit here"" , ive heard this batch is extra juicy"" and then once hed taste it hed spit it out and say 
""Yuck thats disgusting, im glad i wasnt going to buy it"" and just storm off. He did this to me quite a few times and hed throw the skin or peel of it onto my displays and I was quite pissed off with all of it. 

He came in and and I recognised him. And the convorsation went as follows. 

Him: Hey Champ, do you mind if I try one of these Mandarins, they seem mighty delicious. 

Me: No you cant

Him: Why the hell not?

Me: Because its shoplifting, you have no intention of buying it, youve done this before you ask if you can try some and say its disgusting then walk off and all youre going to do is peel it, take one bite leave the the rest of the fruit and peel on my display and im not paid to clean up after you and its not a buffet either, what youre doing is taking stuff you havnt paid for, so its actually theft. So no you cant!

He stood there for about 6 seconds trying to think of something to say and all he could muster up was yelling:
Hey I use to work in a fruit store aswell, I know what its like, so deal with it!

And he just walked off, I kept an eye on him too, he didnt buy anything but just walked out the front of the store (giving me an evil eye) and then out the door to the carpark.

He did come back into the store a few days later, but I didnt see him in the produce department again while i was there ( I only did 3pm until Midnight, but he might have come in between 7am and 3pm or while someone else was on) but when I saw him ordering things from the deli hed give me a bitter stare but that was it.

While they're standing in line why wouldn't they pull it out of their wallets instead of when they are at the front of the line? Or sign the receipt which is also required by law. I have to ask them EVERY SINGLE TIME. It's very frustrating. I go through the same thing every day and they never learn. I also get several customers who don't even speak English which is also frustrating. How can I ask you for things that are required by law when you don't speak my language?

Anyway, this next story was also from Barschmucks. If I didn't mention before, this was a franchise location inside of a large supermarket. We were technically employees of the supermarket even though we were real certified baristas. But this meant that many of our coworkers were cashiers and stock guys. One of the stock guys was Otis. He was a huuuuuge black dude who didn't converse much when he came by for his free cup of ice water but seemed like a pretty good guy.

I wasn't working when this happened, but my AST (Evan) told me about it. It's dead and he's just cleaning up waiting for the last few stragglers to wander in when Otis cruises up to the counter. Evan asks him what he'd like but Otis doesn't say anything and just stares at the menu. Evan goes back to cleaning while Otis contemplates the meaning of life. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Otis opening up the tea rack and fumbling for a tea bag (already this is a no-no, not only are we the only ones supposed to touch that tea, but we have to use tongs because it goes right in a customer's drink.) 

Evan doesn't have time to say anything before Otis lifts a bag to his nose and takes a deep whiff. 

He goes: ""What is this? Vanilla Rooibos? (He pronounced it ""roo-bis""; it's actually ""roy-bohs"".) Mmmmmmm. If a girl smell like dis, I'd lick her all *up* and down.""

Then, as quickly as he came, he put the tea back back, and left without saying a word.

We specialize in helping people with injuries and have a very specialized staff, program, and equipment. We are attached to an apartment complex that is spread out over a couple of buildings. The laundry for the complex is in the building adjacent to us. Now to use the laundry machines you are required to use a proprietary card that has to be purchased from a machine. I don't know what someone was smoking one day but instead of putting the machine that dispenses and allows people to add money to there card next to the laundry machines (even though there is plenty of room), someone decided to put the machine in the lobby of the gym. 

Where I work I have a very large window that overlooks the parking lot and see everyone who comes and goes and where people park. I had someone park or fly in the handicap spot (we'll call him Scumbag Steve or SS to keep things simple). SS jumps out of the car and runs full sprint into the lobby to add money onto his laundry card. After a minute or so I hear a knock on the window and we a quick interaction that goes like this:

Me: ""Sorry.""

SS: ""Yo man what about in your wallet, I know you can personally make me change?""

adelajoy,0,,1,1ri8kg,,22,"I spent two years working at a big warehouse-style grocery store. I worked mostly as a cashier, but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a week.

Most of the crappy moments have all blurred together, but there are a few particular moments that stick out.

I realize this isn't the craziest story on here, but I will probably never forget this lady. 

Backstory: Our store had a policy that if an item scanned differently than the price tag, the customer would get it for free, up to $10. The mistake happened because the price tag didn't get changed, or was misplaced. If they spotted a problem, we would go look. If we found a tag in front of their item with the same code and a different price, we gave it to them and changed the tag. If the tag was for a different item, they didn't get anything. 

I was working the customer service desk, and a lady stormed up. I had several customers on the go at the moment, but it was pretty clear she *needed* help right away. As soon as I could, I asked what I could help her with. She was holding a bottle of toilet cleaner, her receipt and a price tag. Let's call her Crazy Customer, CC for short.

**CC**: ""I bought this bottle of toilet cleaner, but it was the wrong price! You guys are trying to charge me too much!""

**Me**: ""Okay, can I see your receipt?""

**CC**: *Hands me the receipt.* ""I tried to tell the cashier, but she didn't believe me!""

**Me**: *I checked who her cashier was, and it was one of our long-time girls. She knew the policy. There was no way she ""didn't believe"" the customer.* ""Okay, so the price came up $3.99, I'll just send a price-checker out to see what the tag said.""

**CC**: ""Oh, I grabbed the price tag already."" *She hands me the price tag. This lady is pretty worked up,  I'm not sure if she just wants to get out of the store, or if she's trying to pull one on me.*

A policy was that the tag had to be on the shelf. If a customer brings it to you, who's to say they didn't take it off the shelf last week and save it? They also could have found it in the wrong place, somewhere that the stock employees wouldn't have checked to fix the tag. As with most stores I've been to, store policy is to inform the customer about the relative store policies, and then see if you can help them anyways. No matter the problem.

It study the tag, and inform her of the policy, that the tag would have to be on the shelf. I start to let her know I can contact a manager, but she snatches the tag back and interrupts me.

**CC**: ""Well if that's your policy, I'll just put it back on the shelf! I was trying to save you some goddamn work, but I guess if you guys want to work extra, I'll just go put it back!""

She took off before I could say anything. I was just standing at the desk, aghast. I didn't even know what to say. 

The supervisor that was on shift was the scary kind. You know, the kind that isn't afraid to yell a little, handles the worst customers, and isn't phased when people call her names. Let's call her Jane. When the woman was gone, I grabbed Jane and told her the whole story. She said, ""Okay. When she comes back, let me know who she is. I'll handle her.""

As soon as I saw the customer coming back, I hissed, ""Jane! Jane! Jane! White hat! That's her."" I then ducked behind the display at customer service, and quite actually hid back there until the customer was gone. I could hear her yelling at Jane. I don't know what the verdict was. Any other manager, and the customer would have gotten the item for free, but it's hard to say with Jane.

I remember one of my coworkers came around the display and exclaimed my name. I hushed them, and told them I was hiding. I was so afraid the woman would see me and do one of those, ""Her! That's the one I was talking to! She told me this!"" And drag me back into it.

I've never hid from a customer before or since. Oh! Fun fact: The price tag she was holding said $3.29, a $0.70 difference from what she paid, and the tag was dated for the week before, which means it wasn't the current price. Not to say it wasn't still on the shelf, but there is a chance she did save it and bring it back in, especially with how worked up she was.

He was friendly and talkative to my kids and was asking me about my tattoos while we were waiting. The cashier was probably 55, spacey, but very sweet woman. When it was old guys turn to check out, I overheard their conversation at the register, and it was obvious they were both long time veterans to the store. 
The man had some trouble checking out. He rang his credit card through the machine multiple times while chatting with the cashier and he seemed confused. Eventually, she explained that he didn't have to keep swiping his card, and that his transaction was complete. In the mean time, she was scanning my items. 
The cashier chatted up a storm with me too. Asking about my kids while I was trying to wrangle them. I was getting a little impatient at this point because my 1 and 3 year old were ready to get the hell out of there, but I listened to her stories with patience. She was kind too.
When she finished scanning my food I pulled my card out to run through the machine, but it was asking for a signature, when I hadn't scanned my card yet. 
Me: ""there must be a mistake, I haven't slid my card through but it's already asking for a signature""
Cashier: ""no, you did, you must have forgot"" -looks at screen- ""you swiped your America express""
Me: ""No, I don't have an Amex, see?.. Oh no did the man in front of me swipe his card while you were ringing me up?""
Cashier: ""uh oh, that must have been what happened""
She looked panicked, but printed the receipt and said ""I'll just do this"" AND SIGNED THE RECEIPT
Cashier: ""He'll be okay, he can be so spacey. Don't even worry about it""
She at first folded up the receipt like she was going to trash it but I asked her if that was really ok, and that I could wait for a manger. She unfolded the receipt and told me not to worry. There was a long line behind me and frankly I was ready to get the fuck out of there with my crazy kids. I asked her ""are you sure? I feel uncomfortable"" 
She told me not to worry, and to go ahead and leave. And I did. 
I think her career might have ended today.
TLDR; Elderly man in line ahead of me accidentally paid for my groceries, cashier eventually realized but didn't give a fuck to fix it. I got free groceries :/

EDIT/UPDATE: I can see how it looks like I was unsympathetic in my post. I was in fact, horrified. I know the groceries weren't free, I just did not pay for them. In my car, I wrote down the time, my total $78.43 and what I thought the mans total was before me $43, and the name of the cashier. I should have stuck around and put my foot down but I was flustered and unsure how to proceed.  I was planning on calling when I got home, and totally forgot about the whole thing until I was in bed redditing from my phone late at night.
This morning I called and spoke with a manager, giving him all of my information. I told him I would happily come back and pay for the groceries and to please make sure the man did not actually get charged (hoping the cashier took the issue to the manager after I left). He said he will look into the receipts from last night and give me a call back. I will update again when I hear from him.

I was behind the register filling out the daily statistics and my manager was folding some clothes. The mall was about to close and we were all just finishing up, trying to go home. 

So, this kid walks in dressed as Gumby and we all laughed/joked around with him for a minute. Then, I was pretty sure I saw him walk out of the store since the mall was closing. 

10 minutes later I was ringing the last customer out and thought I saw my boss out of the corner of my eye so I turned around to talk to her. Turns out it wasn't my boss. Gumby had somehow snuck back in and thought it would be funny to come behind the register and stand over my shoulder and scream ""Boo!"" in my face as soon as I turned around.

insecure_shit_knob,3,,2,1rie8h,,21,"Short and sweet one today. For new readers of my stories (welcome back to the other three), I'm a front end manager at a giant retail chain. Dealing with customers and cashiers is my job, and I only have the job because I'd rather work than be bored. I have enough money to not work, so I am not scared of losing my job.


On to the story:

One of my favorite cashier's (seriously, she's so sweet and helpful. I always drop what I'm doing to answer her questions because she's one of the three that I trust) calls me over for a price check on a set of plates. Customer says they were $29.99, but when I go check they're $49.99. She says that's fine and she pays for them. Done and over, right?

Wrong.

About ten minutes later she comes over to my podium. I already know she's getting coal from me in her stockings (merry Christmas bitch).

Her- ""I was just over there looking at the plates again. They were there just in the wrong spot.""

Me- ""I'm sorry ma'am, I'll let an associate know so he can fix it. I'm a little busy to get to it."" Which I was, I was getting five different change orders ready.

Her- ""Isn't it your job to fix it?""

Me- ""actually no it's not. I'm the front end manager. There are two managers who work in that area, it's actually their job technically. If I would've seen the plates,I would've put them in the right spot.""

Her- ""So you're just a lazy asshole.""

Ok, I'm done. I talk to everyone in a civil manner, but when they take that tone with me, I'm done.

Me- ""yep""

Her- ""You're not going to fix it?""

Me- ""Nope, too lazy right now.""

This was followed by more angry questions and statements until I walked away to deliver my change orders. She tracked an assistant manager down and let him have it about my attitude. He's a pretty cool guy, came up to me later, asked what the deal was and just laughed when I told him. Now he always asks if I'm lazy today when he sees me.

I don't remember much from it except for this story. Working storefront; typical day, typical customers. This older, possibly Italian gentleman came up and I asked to take his order.

Man: May I see your hand?

I think I just stood there looking at him for a moment. He had an Italian accent so I was thinking I may have misheard him, and asked for his order again. He held his hand out and insisted to see mine.

Now, this guy didn't look creepy or scary or anything. If so I would have just bolted. But I was 17 and put on the spot so I gave him my hand.

Man: What is your name?

At the time I still had my ""Trainee"" name tag so it wasn't on there. I don't know why I gave him my name. I didn't really know what else to do.

He then proceeded to serenade me in front of the entire store. Granted, there were only about 10 people around. He held my hand with enough force that I could not easily pull it away and I stood there flushed red while the rest of the staff laughed at me. Apparently it's happened before.

He sang in deep Italian (and I heard my name thrown in there) for a good two minutes before he let me go. I had to stand there awkwardly while begging with my eyes to be saved by my coworkers, but they certainly weren't going to put an end to their amusement any earlier than necessary. I don't even remember if he ordered anything.

IIWinterbreezeII,2,,3,1rhy5m,,2,"I'm not a retailer, but this story's close enough, so screw it.

I was volunteering at a local zoo for a special Halloween event for about 3 - 4 hours. It was the last night of the event, and I was in charge of handing out prizes for games. It was a pretty good job, and I got to have as much free soda as I wanted, since I was in the concessions booth. I had to set out prizes, read tickets to see how many points a kid had, tell them how much each prize was (They could mix and match), then calculate how many points they had left as they chose. They'd choose their prizes, I'd hand it to them, and they'd leave. 

I had a friend of mine with me for the first hour, and we split the customers when it got busy. (Around 5 people at the same time.) At one point I spilled my soda, and she handled the crowd as I cleaned up the mess.

Then she left. Oh god.

I was left to set out prizes for display, serve customers, and translate kid-speak by myself. At some points I was so swamped with customers that I could barely figure out the total points for each kid as they got prizes.

Another girl came it at low tide, but left before it got busy again. (Around twenty minutes.) I wasn't allowed to leave my station to try and find her, so I had to deal with all the customers alone. (She wasn't actually allowed to leave either, but she gave zero fucks. Bitch.)

Scott5114,0,,3,1riony,,13,"I've met a lot of strange customers in my time at the casino. This guy takes the cake as the most fucked-up, unpleasant guy that's ever darkened our doorstep. We'll call him Dick because he is one.

To begin with, Dick is in the casino for a fucked-up reason. He's dying of cancer, or some other terminal disease. He spends his last days in our casino trying to win an inheritance for his children. Of course, mathematics says it's not going to happen, so he's squandering what money he does have and the remainder of his life sitting in a smoky room with no natural light playing $25 per spin on a slot machine. 

I wouldn't judge him so harshly for that if he wasn't a colossal asshole. Pretty much everyone who has had to pay a jackpot for him has some sort of unpleasant experience to share. Mine was when I was processing a jackpot for him and I go to clear the jackpot message from the screen. See, if you win, say, $1500, and you had $80 in credit when you hit it, when the attendant clears the jackpot your $80 will still be left on the machine. People sometimes forget or don't know this, and will leave the money on the machine and walk away, so after clearing it most of us will say ""You still have $80 left on the machine."" Of course, when I mention this to Dick, he flies into a rage, screaming ""I CAN SEE THAT! GOD!"" I started dodging his jackpots when I knew where he was playing after that—I don't put up with that sort of BS—though I still had to pay him out a couple of times after that because I didn't realize who it was. 

And Dick did hit a lot of jackpots. He would usually destroy the copy of the W2-G tax forms we would give him, I guess thinking since he's dying he won't need to worry about paying taxes, though you would think he would realize his kids would be on the hook for all of it. He also had the tendency to swear ambiguously so you never really knew whether he was calling the machine or you a piece of shit. Management had talked to him a couple of times about treating the attendants better. He did tip the bare minimum to not be considered an ass in that department, at least.

All of that is backstory to properly put in context what happened this week. At this point, Dick's managed to piss off enough attendants that most of the shift is dodging his calls, so it takes him probably twice as long to get someone over there than it would anyone else. This, coupled with the fact that he's losing heavily, pisses him off. 

Management gets called over to a machine in my section. I'm generally pretty curious about these things, so I head over there. The machine's touchscreen (retail price quoted to me by a tech as $700 or so) is totally shattered. The machine still has $20 on it—with an inoperable touchscreen, there's no way to cash that out on this machine. There's a patron further down the bank who saw the whole thing. Said the guy was losing, got pissed, punched the screen, threw a piece of paper down, and stormed off. One of the managers that showed up picks up the paper.

It's a torn-up W2-G with Dick's name, address, and social security number on it. A little bit of searching in the computers turns up copies of his driver license and the hotel room he is in. And of course the whole incident is caught on tape.

We don't know what happened to Dick after that. Apparently it became the responsibility of the casino's assistant general manager, and she isn't talking. We're all watching the usual locations for ban notices to go up, though.",The worst casino patron in the world,16,talesFromRetail
GlowingBall,2,,2,1rioer,,16,"These are my Tales of Retail Loss Prevention....

Part Three – Citizen Snips (Aka - The Pants Aquatic)



As a recap for those of you who have never read one of my stories before – I am a male in the midwest who is on the wrong side of his twenties and works retail loss prevention for a major retailer (one of the 'Big 5').  I am underpaid for what I do but enjoy my job none the less.  A majority of my time is spent wandering the floor or watching middle aged moms shop for clothing far too skimpy on them via CCTV (closed circuit television or 'security cameras').  Every once in awhile I get a case that is just so mind blowingly 'WTF' that I have to share.  

This story opens up with me doing just as I said above – watching people on CCTV.  It is a blisteringly cold afternoon so the customers, far more content to stay in their warm homes and snuggled beneath their blankets, are few and far between.  I, as the ever watchful hawk of justice that I am, was busy playing a Marvel version of Candy Crush Saga.  My job provides me the liberty of slacking off a good amount and my boss is rather lenient as long as I continue to bring in a good amount of stops per month.  I am sitting there diligently trying to match up small colored tiles with one another when I am startled by a sudden ring – the phone is going off!  

Now the phone going off is common place.  We get tons of calls a day ranging from the frozen dairy department calling to tell us a temperature alarm is going off (we know...it goes off for us as well) to people asking us to deactivate a door alarm (we also know...we see you standing at the door).  This happened to be a call from one of the few places that doesn't call us often – the meat department.  The guy on the other end, a tall black man with more muscle than he knows what to do with, calls to tell us that there is a guy standing in front of the freshly butchered meat.  The guy has refused any help the meat employee has offered and continues to say he is 'just browsing' for over ten minutes.  This strikes me as rather odd.  Who just hangs out around the meat department?  I quickly devise a plan for the situation.  I tell the employee to walk into the back so I could see just what the person was going to do.  

The employee hangs up and walks over to the man to let him know he is going to be into the back and to ring the bell if he needs anything.  No sooner than when he had walked into the back but the man glanced around and then walked behind the counter.  My adrenaline already began to rush as my suspicions came to fruition – he was going to steal!  “Oh shit here we go, ” I declared, only to watch in confusion and frustration as he walked right past all the glass displays full of meat and right over to the lobster tank.  Now if you aren't familiar with these tanks they are exactly just what the name implies – a water filled tank full of live lobsters we sell by the pound.  Their claws are bound and they just kind of hang out crawling all over one another.  Kids love to sit there and watch them.

“No way...is he really going to...” I whispered as I watched on in awe.  Sure enough he reached right into the live lobster display tank we have.  After a moment of 'fishing around' he plucked the lobster he wanted from the tank and pulled it out of the water.  Before I could even make heads or tails of the situation he glanced around once more and shoved the lobster right down the front of his pants.  The guy, whom shall be hence forth called Lobster Johnson, then proceeded to shuffle run his way out of the meat department and through the grocery department towards the front of the store.  The only way I can really describe how he ran was a forward version of Zoidberg's shuffle.  All he was missing was yelping out “Woop woop woop woop!” loudly as he went.  

Needless to say he wasn't too hard to stop.  I may not be in the best shape of my life but I can still move quicker than a guy with a large lobster squirming around in his pants.  He didn't fight me at the door or even try to argue what he was doing.  After all, it is kind of hard to argue that you aren't stealing when you have a large, lobster shaped bulge in your pants.

Bonus icing on top of the cake: I usually ask the person why they are stealing.  It usually won't change anything but it fulfills my curiosity and keeps them talking which usually calms them down a bit.  This guy tried to say that he was stealing the lobster for his kids...

I decided to go get some water during my shift the other day so I headed towards our water fountain, which happens to be down a narrow hallway and is between the bathrooms and is opposite the hallway from our offices/breakroom area.  As I come around a corner in said hallway I almost bump into our Store Manager (SM from here on out) who is in the middle of cleaning the bathrooms.  SM and I start chatting and from the men's room I hear some loud noises.

""What the hell was that?"" I ask

""Damn kids screwing around."" SM replies as he sets down the bag of trash he had been holding and walks over to the men's room.

Now, SM isn't a particularly tall guy, but he lifts weights quite a bit and could very well be described as being jacked.  Somehow, from time to time, people think it is a good idea to fight him, so I stuck around in case he needed backup.

SM opens the men's room door hard, slamming it into the wall and bellows, ""What the HELL are you doing in my bathroom?""

--inaudible reply--

""Yeah, well it is a pretty sad day when I have to kick someone out of the bathroom, now get the hell out."" SM says at a slightly reduced volume.

""B..But my stomach hurts."" says a meek voice from inside the bathroom.

Then at a normal volume, but with a tone of voice that sounded like SM had ice in his veins he replies, ""Carry it somewhere else.""  Then he stared into the bathroom in a manner that was somewhat intense.

With that the teens walked out of the store with their heads hung in shame.

ME: What we can do for you though is our 90 day comfort guarantee swap out. Can I have your name Ill look your ticket up and well see what we can do. 

He seems to calm down a little bit and he takes a seat across from my desk and he gives me hi name. I look up his name and pull up his ticket as Im explaining the comfort guarantee I look at his ticket. And then at the date he bought it(ya know to make sure its at least close to 90 days) I was willing to be flexible to make this guy happy when I notice he bought this mattress 9months ago!! Im flexible but not *that* flexible

ME: Uhh Sir, Im sorry to say this but you bought this mattress 9months ago, that 6months over the 90days. Theres nothing we can do for you. 

That when he became absolutely IRATE with me. Screaming something about how this is bad business practice, he deserves to get a refund, we owe it to him. Blah blah blah. [Im done this this shit](http://i.imgur.com/InDPcFn.gif)

ME: SIR. There is nothing we can do, the comfort exchange policy was explained to you when you bought it, if you didnt like the mattress you should have come back 6months ago, now Im going to have to ask you to leave the store. 

Well he didnt like that very much. He was becoming increasingly angry and hostile. Hes leaning over my desk pointing his finger right in my face([Which I hate](http://i.imgur.com/u77ThfE.gif)) but I keep my cool, and as sternly as I can say

ME: Sir if you dont leave immediately I will be forced to call the police and have you removed from my store.

I was in shock I composed myself quickly, called the police, and then my boss and explained everything that happened. 

I guess that asshat forgot that he gave us his address to deliver the mattress to, he ruined about 5beds which he was made to pay sticker price for on all of them(sticker price is close to $300 more than what we normally sell for)

jessajuhanabi,30,,94,1rhnqp,,397,"As of last Thursday, I am the head manager of a retail outlet and cafe, answering only to my boss, since the only girl above me quit. All people that walk in, call or email come through me. My boss is normally around but he works on coffee machines most days. 

As backgound for this story: His brother is a c*nt. I live in Australia, so that term seriously fits him. He owes a bunch of people money, is generally an asshole, and my boss is very sad his brother has changed so much. It stresses my boss out as their finances are tied due to a trust. 

Today, a lady walks in around 11:30, and walks up to the front desk. Politely, she asks me, ""Is (boss) in?""

In my mind, she was another person that he knew since he's been running this business for 20+ years, or a rep from some company that I didn't care about. He turned around to look at her, and I pointed in his direction. 

She immediately starts spouting about how boss's brother, we'll call him AH for asshole, owed her money. This is not a surprise to boss. He knows her. He's heard from her over email before. In which he told her he has no access to the trust and he's also fighting AH for money. 

This does not please the lady, henceforth known as douchecanoe. DC repeats over and over, despite pleas from my boss to chase down AH, ""I'm not leaving without my money. Get it for me.""

Now, DC wants a hefty sum. A couple thousand dollars. My boss offers her a coffee while he tries to reach AH. A water. A chair. Nothing. She stands in front of our stock and repeats herself over and over. ""Give me my money. Give me my money. I don't care its not my problem. YOU pay me.""

Why is she going after my boss? Because she's gone through the courts, they told AH to pay, and he still hasn't. Her response? Come into my store and stand there all day every day until HIS BROTHER, pays her. 

Now, my boss tries and tries to get her to understand he has no access to the money. No go. So instead she stands in our store, silent, for 4 fucking hours. Four. DC stands there so long my boss gets fed up and stressed, and leaves. 

The difference is, he's a peace keeper. I was itching for him to leave. I was just going to have the cops come eject her. I was EXCITED. 

Unfortunately she realized rather quickly I was not the ""nice cop"" type so she stood out the front, called in a few friends and intermittently yelled ""YOU KNOW THIS IS SO SILLY I JUST WANT MY MONEY FROM THE (BUSINESS)"" and ""I KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE IN XXXX SUBURB I COULD RUIN A BUSINESS IF I WANTED TO."" through the window at me. 

Oh god. You scare me so much. I might pee my pants. 

Anyway she eventually gave up and left without coming back inside, probably since I was watching her and smiling, willing her to come inside so I could call the cops. 

Oh well, another day I suppose! Maybe she'll be back tomorrow...

DolfyuttSrednaz,58,,48,1rh8hc,,200,"I have got to say, after working 4 years in retail, parents should be responsible for their children's actions. I have seen so many kids acting like demons that have just spawned from a dimension full of pointy sticks being shoved up their asses, but I never blame the kids. I usually don't even blame the parents, because kids are kids, but when customers blatantly let their kids run around like Sonic on meth, I blame the parents. that is why we have an announcement that plays every few minutes, reminding customers to keep their little shits in line. So when a customer like the one I had comes in, I usually inform my manager (who will be called Jared) of the situation and he watches the kid from a distance. 

A middle-aged couple stumbles into the store with their 7 year old son. They head off to furniture, but their son makes a bee-line to toys. I immediately call Jared, and let him know that this little tornado is heading to toys and he should try to contain the damage as much as possible. Before the kid makes it to toys, he stops over in the Halloween section and starts putting on masks and runs around the store trying to scare the other customers. After 4 complaints, Jared stops the kid, and drags him to his parents, who don't give one shit nor a giggle about what my manager has to say and wave him off. The kid bolts towards toys, and stars ripping toys down off the shelf. The floor looks like a miniature Antietam by the time he is finished. Now he has an armload of toys and decides to take them to the bathroom. Once in there, he places them on the floor, and proceeds to urinate on them. Jared walks in on him finishing up, and drags the kid back to his parents, leaving a trail of piss footprints behind him. Jared tells the parents what he did, and that they have to clean up the mess. This switches the parents into rage mode. They just cannot BELIEVE that their kid would do this! And he will be punished severely when they get home. Jared tells them calmly ""I am punishing you, not your child. You guys made no effort to control him, and even brushed me off after the first incident. You guys will clean up every mess he has made, and then you can leave. You are no longer welcomed here."" They start yelling profanities at him and their kid, saying how this is ridiculous and they shouldn't have to put up with this. 

After they cleaned up, they left empty handed. Jared received many compliments on how he handled the situation.

racheecakes,8,,48,1rhjav,,206,"This sub is usually full of complaints and although I have quite a few I have a short, nice story to tell. I work in the dining room at one of the lovely bakery/cafe chains in America. We are very lax on people lingering in our cafe, especially the homeless. We allow them to stay in our building in the single comfortable chairs for as long as they want as long as they're not pestering our customers. (It's not like we're hobo central, there are only two or three regulars). Usually our lunch rushes are filled with self centered people or angry people who just spent a dick load of money on presents for people they really didn't want to spend money on (we're located in a mall parking lot). In the midst of the chaos, bread bowls, and dirty tables I notice a customer approaching an obvious homeless man. This catches my eye so I go over and start cleaning a nearby table and eavesdrop. The customer hands the homeless man a gift card to our cafe for fifty dollars. He told him to stay full during this holiday season, to have a good one, and clenched his shoulder in a very comforting, almost fatherly like way. He walked away and back to his table before the homeless man got to say a word. The look on the homeless man's face was something worth remembering. It was nice to see someone think of someone they did not even know. Although it didn't happen to me, I witnessed it happen, and it's something I will be passing forward.",A little holiday cheer early this year.,254,talesFromRetail

aturquoiseseashell,12,,25,1rg9do,,127,"End of shift at a famous, upscale department store, and I am already clocked out, with my purse on. I'm talking to my coworkers before I leave because I'm waiting on a ride home. I work in the lingerie department, which is near one of the 2nd story entrance doors to the store. 

A flustered woman comes up with three bags, one from Kate Spade, one from Michael Kors, and one from Tory Burch. She says she found the bags in the vestibule of the entrance to the store.
We thank her for her honesty and promise to call Loss Prevention to come and take the bags. She becomes agitated.

""Well I'm going to wait here and see that you do it,"" she snaps. She's suddenly riled up.

We're a bit taken aback, but continue to be polite to her and my coworker calls LP.

While my coworker waits on the phone to be connected to the security desk, I guess we kind of exchanged looks. (She was very antsy, and was holding onto the bags for dear life). The woman exclaims in outrage, ""Don't you all roll your eyes at me!"" 

""Ma'am,"" says my co-worker, ""No one is rolling their eyes. We're waiting for security to pick up the phone. They will make sure the bags are returned to the customer. Thank you very much for bringing them to our attention, we will see to it that they are returned to the customer."" 

The woman becomes more agitated and irritated. Finally, security picks up and my coworker says, ""A customer found some bags; one's from MK, one is from Tory Burch…""
The woman snaps, before my coworker is quite finished, ""And one from Kate Spade!!"" as though we purposely left that one out so we could steal it or something. 

""And one from Kate Spade,"" my co-worker adds. We're all getting kind of insulted by this woman's attitude. She seems convinced we're plotting to steal the bags, despite the fact that they remain in plain sight of the security camera. We're all well-dressed, well-spoken girls in our early twenties, and we are acting calm and polite. No apparent cause for suspicion.

Security says they can't help and to turn the bags into customer service, who coworker speaks to.
""Ma'am, please give me the bags. Customer service is coming to pick them up,"" my coworker says. We really want her to leave at this point. She's staring at us through narrowed eyes and she's breathing heavily.

""No!"" the woman shrieks, and clutches them to her chest. She tears frantically at one of them and finds a receipt. She begins dialing the number of Kate Spade. We're stunned.
""Please, ma'am…"" the coworker begins, but the woman literally shushes her and begins frantically reading the details of the receipt to the cashier at Kate Spade who is on the other end of the phone. 

She convinces an employee at Kate Spade to come to the dept. store to identify the bags.
Meanwhile, she announces that she will take the bags to customer service herself, in a very angry tone. ""You all are acting VERY suspicious!"" she declares, still clutching the bags to her breast almost maniacally. 

At this point, we're pretty alarmed by her behavior and beginning to wonder if she plans to steal the bags herself after seeing the prices on the receipt. My coworker calls the store manager, and we inform the customer that we would prefer that she remain in lingerie with the bags and wait for the manager. She loudly refuses to stay put. My coworker follows her to customer service.

From all the way in our department on the other end of the floor, we can hear the woman yelling. She had a quavery voice and a really strong British accent. 
Apparently, she got to customer service, and the couple who had left the bags was there. The woman refused to give them the bags without proof of their identity!! Finally the Kate Spade employee arrived and confirmed that yes, the bags belonged to the couple. 

I guess the woman was trying to do the right thing, but she insulted my coworkers and me and frightened various customers in the process. I still don't get why she became so suspicious or why she didn't just bring the bags to customer service in the first place. Of course, since we were lowly retail workers we must have been plotting to steal the lost merchandise.

KroipyBill,11,,40,1rhynu,,123,"After [writing about our cheering seasonal workers from Black Friday yesterday,](http://redd.it/1rf92j) it reminded me of this other story involving my goofy manager. 

When I first started working for this place, I came in clean shaven, and patchy hair. I was in denial that mother nature was closing my hair follicles for business, and it wasn't until after my engagement photos I decided to make a change. I shaved my head and have kept it that way ever since. I then grew a goatee to compensate for my loss. Honestly I looked much sharper than having the grassy field of hair you can see the horizon through. It was a relief to embrace it, and feel like I looked decent again. There was one manager who enjoyed messing with me however. In fact in my previous stories, I've quoted him several times in our conversations, since he was my favorite manager to talk to, and the biggest goof ball there. He vowed he would draw on my head when I wasn't ready for it. 

**Me:** Dude I'm taller than you. So unless you parachute from the rafters onto my cranium with your sharpie, you will not succeed. 

**Manager:** We'll see...we'll...see...

At that moment I wondered if he really was contemplating that attack strategy. At least he left it at just contemplating. 

One day, we were pretty busy. It was pre-holiday, post-black Friday days. I'm sure you all know the type. Everybody is getting geared up for Christmas. I found my way over to the computer department helping a customer decide what Mac they wanted. I was describing the hardware specs, how it works with their Apple products etc. During this I felt I was going to make a decent sale. However I made a massive mistake...

*I sat down.* 

Yes I slipped up big time. My manager saw this opportunity from what it seemed immediately. He walked over and distracted me by having another employee ask me a question. 

**Employee:** Hey KroipyBill you know where I can find [some bullcrap item that he knew the answer to.]

**Me:** Yeah sure. Remember they're eh...ahh...AHH!!!

Right then, my manager walks up to me with his pen, and I felt the coldness of the ballpoint touch my head, while it was dragged across my chrome dome. My entire body froze as if somebody stiffed my spine. I made a weird breathing noise, like I was experiencing sharp pains when it was just mainly a very tiny cold piece of metal on my head. Kind of like EAHH!! EAHH!! EAHH!!! (That's the best I can do textually.) They were quiet, sharp noises.

He walked off, cackling like the joker. I looked at my customer with this super surprised look on my face. He lost his crap, and just laughed. Because of this I sold him more attachments, but that's beside the point. 

Over the radio:

**Me:** The person who drew on my head. You know who you are. Thanks for helping my sale out by doodling with a ballpoint pen on my cranium. 

I looked around the store and saw those with a radio express such confusion. I'm a pretty tall dude, so for those who were in eye sight, I bent my head down so they could see the graffiti my manager brought forth upon my person. Much laughter followed, including my manager.

**Manager:** You said I would never get you. 

**Me:** Well bucket head, you're lucky I was sitting so your midget self could strike me. 

**Manager:** My strike is now complete. 

**Me:** It's a good thing I don't just go over there and rub my greasy head all over your face. I'm glad you feel all militaristic about your approach. 

**Manager:** Oh...this would be a much more fun Call of Duty game if this were part of the game play. 

I never got him back. And he has since left the store after I left. Despite us still being good friends, he's still a bucket head.

It was a beautiful sunny day, which is not common in these parts from oh...October to May.    
    
A very proper looking lady walks up and asks for a salesmen that is off.  Lets call her Uber bitch (UB).  
    
Me, ""He's off today, is there something I can help you with?"" 
       
UB, ""I'm not sure your capable, 'L' was very knowledgeable.""  
       
Her tone was very matter of fact and frankly bitchy.     
     
Me, ""Lets do it this way, I'll help you to the best of my ability and if you're not satisfied you can come back and see 'L' when he gets back.""     
    
UB sighed and said, ""I suppose that will do. Tell me about your most advanced car.""     
    
Me, ""Advanced how?""     
   
UB, ""Technologically.""    
    
Me, ""That's a pretty broad spectrum, lets start with what kind of car do you want?  Like an SUV or Sedan.""      
       
UB, ""I don't see why this matters.""     
    
Me, ""I'm just trying to help you to the best of my ability.""    
    
UB, ""Well that clearly lacking.""      
    
Me, ""Apparently. I have an idea though lets go look at the new Avalon, they just had a fresh rebuild this year so I would say the have the most gadgets and cool technology in them.""     
    
UB, ""That's a start show me the way.""      
    
At this point I realized that I'm dealing with some sort of royalty by the way she's talking to me and looking at me like I was clearly beneath her.    
    
We walked out side and toward the Avalon's and as we rounded the corner I was blinded by the light of 1 sun (that mutha fucker is bright when we only see it a few times a year) so I do what I thought was natural, I put on my sun glasses. You'd think I killed her 2nd born spawn.    
        
UB stopped in her tracks and said, ""Excuse me, how long have you been in sales.""     
    
Me, ""About 15 years now, why do you ask?""    
    
UB, ""How dare you put your sunglasses on in front of a customer. You should know better.""    
    
At this point I'm done with her attitude. She can; buy a car, sell a car, die in fire for all that I'm concerned.    
    
Me, ""While were walking into the direct sunlight I'm keeping them on, once we get into a car I'll make sure to take them off so you can see my pretty greens again.""     
     
The look and sound of disgust from her should of withered some near by plants.     
    
UB, "" I don't want to look at the Avalon unless it has what I want on it.""      
        
I acted all surprised and said, ""Ahhh in that case thus far all you've told me is that you want technology on it. Every car on my lot has technology, how about you fill in the blanks for me and I'll get you what you need.""   I finished that last part with a touch of sarcasm.
    
UB, "" You don't have to take that tone with me.""     
    
I just started at her until she finally answered my question.    
   
UB, ""I want....""  Imagine everything every car in every scfi movie has done (some highlights: Voice activated everything, self driving, self maintaining, color changing, all electric or non-gas, The list goes on)

Me, ""What's your thoughts on a Prius that parks for you, stops for you in emergencies and has rain sensing wipers?""    
    
UB let here vileness spew out of her and she said, ""That's all been out for years I don't want dated technology.""

Maloth_Warblade,6,,17,1rhx0y,,94,"Black Friday, 2011. Big, blue, zombie-filled box store. I was a photo tech.

It's been almost 2 years now, as I no longer work for retail. I did my 5 years with it and I'm done.

I'm glad I'm out, too. I don't hate people, I just learned that I hate being treated like less than crap, filth, and told I'm worthless on a daily basis. But this one was so irritating I spoke up.

I worked 2 stores on Black Friday in 2011, both the BBS and the famous game store. I was basically at work from Noon-8 on Thanksgiving at the BBS, missing all family gatherings, by the way, and then 11:30pm-7am at the games store (I was the only cashier by the way, in the most populated area of the county/city), and then 12-8 again on Black Friday at the BBS. 

I was tired, beyond tired, essentially 20hrs of work, on my feet with no breaks for food or bathroom due to chaos. The BBS frequently refused to give me my lunches until I was mandatorily locked out, and even then they simply made me work anyway (even got reported for going over 8 hrs without a break, wasn't given a choice).

 Needless to say, by the time 5pm rolled around, and not having eaten but a pop tart in 24hrs, I was having a sugar crash. These make you lightheaded, these make it hard to think and respond quickly. I was working my ass off to get greeting cards printed, packaged, priced and all the while walking everyone through how to use our touch-screen computers and simple tasks. 

One customer didn't like that I wasn't answering fast enough. Of course she didn't, it's Black Friday, and that I was being far too rude for her. She told me she didn't like how tired I was, that I shouldn't work at all if I was so tired. How worthless I was to be there, on the busiest day of the year, if I couldn't be bothered to be awake. 

At this point I interrupted her. I told her ""Lady, listen. I don't need this from you, not today. Not the day people die from customers entitlement. No. I've been working since pretty much Noon yesterday. I had to miss my family's Thanksgiving, again, and not only that, I couldn't even EAT any food yet. There's no time. I'm beyond having a sugar crash, I'm hungry, and beyond normal tired. If you're going to sit there and belittle me over this, you can just get out of my face and leave this place"" (or something VERY close to this, been a few years).

Of course I got loud to say this, and everyone looked at her. Associates, customers, even her husband. She tried apologizing, I kept interrupting her asking what else she needed, and she kept trying to change subjects..I wouldn't let her. She was the last straw I needed that day, and I wasn't having it.

Good news though, wasn't reported, wasn't written up. Had a very nice and thoughtful customer buy me a bag of chips and a soda after seeing me be berated by not only her but other customers. Made it home and promptly slept for 15 hours.

adelajoy,15,,15,1rg29x,,73,"I spent two years working at a big warehouse-style grocery store. I worked mostly as a cashier, but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a week.

Most of the crappy moments have all blurred together, but there are a few particular moments that stick out.

This grocery store is the only one in the area that doesn't bag your groceries for you. Each till has two long conveyor belts to hold your groceries while you bag them (Both the customer and the cashier have buttons to move the groceries down, away from the till). This speeds orders up, requires less staff, saves money and drops prices. People occasionally complain about it, but if they want to pay more for their groceries and have someone else bag them, they're welcome to. ... The store isn't exactly famous for customer service, but I think the prices make up for this.

I was one of the fastest cashiers on staff at the time. This meant that my belts would often get full. I had ways to deal with this. I knew how fast people packed, I knew how soon a belt would clear. I was really good at my job. One day, the lines were insanely long, I was working really fast, everyone was buying a lot. I got to a point that there were groceries on both of my belts, so I squeezed the smaller order down a little, watched for a moment, and knew that he would be down before the next order crowded him. I started scanning the next order, and smiled at the customers - a man and his very pregnant wife.

The wife snapped at me, ""Can you just wait!""

""Excuse me?""

""Can you wait? I don't want you to crowd out that other guy!""

I looked, and he was literally loading his last bag with groceries. I stopped scanning anyways, and maybe glared at the lady. I don't really like it when other people tell me how to do my job.

Eventually he was packed and gone, so I started scanning again. While I had been waiting, I had lined all of their canned goods up. I can scan cans super fast if they're all really close. I started scanning the canned goods, grabbing a can, tossing it to my other hand, and setting it on the other belt. Except that this woman had walked around (The belt she got was behind me) and was standing behind me, trying to bag the cans as I scanned them. I'm sorry, but I'm not actually looking where the cans go. I know the space, and I need to watch the computer screen, not my hands. Well, she kept trying to grab the one I'd just set down, which meant that I kept hitting her hand with the next can. I wasn't by any means throwing the cans, but I was moving quickly and she was in my space, so she was getting hit. I didn't actually realize that I was hitting her until she complained to her husband. So I slowed down, apologized, and moved on to her other groceries.

She then had a bag of apples. She had grabbed one of our bags and put three different apples in it, and tied it shut. I have to weigh each type of fruit separately, so I opened the bag, weighed the first apple, set it aside. I noticed her husband grabbed the apple right away. I weighed the second apple, and set it aside. He grabbed that one too. When I weighed the third, my plan had been to put all three back in the bag and tie it shut, but the other two apples were gone. I tied the bag around the last one and set it on the belt. If the husband wanted to pack the apples separately, he was welcome to.

The couple also bought about half a dozen little bags of frozen perogies. One of the bags had been ripped all the open, right down the middle, and frozen perogies were laying all over the belt. I considered not telling them, because I was mad, but I took a deep breath, rounded up all of the stray perogies, put them in a plastic bag, and informed the lady. I asked her if she would like me to send for a new bag. She snippily replied ""Yes"" as if I should have just known. Some people don't bother to get a new bag because it can hold up the line, so I always ask. Our runner quickly returned with an identical bag and I kept going.

When I finally finished (They bought *a lot* of stuff), the husband paid, while the wife stormed over to customer service. I watched as she talked to my supervisor, and eventually a store manager. I was getting pretty nervous. Oh, also I should mention this woman was rude and snapped every time I asked her a question. I was pretty angry by the time they left.

After they were completely done, my supervisor closed my till and asked to speak to me at customer service.

She said the lady had filed a formal complaint against me. Apparently the conversation went something like this:

**Pregnant Lady**: ""I want to complain about the cashier on till 9!""

**Nice Supervisor**: ""Till 9? Do you mean till 8?"" (I was on 9 - one of my quick-to-anger coworkers was on 8)

**PL**: ""No, I mean 9!""

**NS**: ""Like the girl with brown hair, *not* the blonde?""

**PL**: (getting frustrated) ""Yes!""

**NS**: ""So what did adelajoy do?""

**PL**: ""She was rude and short with me!""

**NS**: ""Adelajoy? Are you sure?""

**PL**: ""Yes! She also threw canned goods at me, *ripped* open a bag of perogies, scattered them *everywhere* and scattered all of my apples too! She also bruised all of my fruit because she was throwing them around!""

A store manager was brought down to take a formal complaint, which means it probably went in my employee file. The lady was calmed down and left, and that was the end of it. Typically, the store managers will meet with you to discuss complaints, and make sure they won't happen again. The fact that I didn't means either the manager simply didn't believe the woman, or wasn't concerned because it was my first (and only). The supervisor who helped her said she closed my till because I looked upset and she thought I needed a break. The only reason she told me was to find out what really happened. I told her my side, and she just laughed it off. I admitted to being short and snippy, but the rest was just ludicrous. I still cannot beleive she blamed me for the bag of perogies being ripped open, considering I told her about them, got a new bag, and spent a minute or two picking up all of the perogies. Also, why would I take the time to do that, when I was clearly rushed with everything else?

I get that pregnant women have a lot of hormones, and tend to be angry, short-tempered, whatnot, but I think there's a line. Also, the fact that her husband didn't stop her, stand up for me, or admit to grabbing all the apples kind of pissed me off.

unidentifiableblarg,12,,9,1rhfwt,,65,"**Back story:** I worked in a small convenience store in a town on the outskirts of a city. A lot of the customer's are regulars and have been coming here for years, decades even.

About 6 years ago the place changed hands, names and management too. Still provided the same sort of stuff though, so the locals kept calling it by it's old name. 

This is relevant, I swear.



**The story:** I'm serving on the registers at the front of the store, just doin ma biz, when a flustered woman comes up to the counter demanding my attention. I tell her I'll be with her as soon as I finish processing my currant customer.

This somehow seemed to offended her, so I was already off to a bad start. But I get to her and try to smooth things over with my best customer service voice (you know the one).

After a bit of just listening to her complaining and bitching in general she finally gets to the point.

""I bought this product here earlier and you (not me) charged me the wrong price! It's on special, why is it wrong blah blah blah""

The outrage was dripping off her.

Now, normally I'd be prepared to fix this, sometimes we just straight up get it wrong and stuff isn't the right price.

*But*, while she's ranting she's waving around a catalogue, that contains the magical special that we failed to give her.

Eventually she shoves it in my face to accent a point, and shows me what it should have been.

The catalogue wasn't for our store, we don't even sell the brand (ice cream, I think it was) that she seemed to have thought she purchased.

I politely explain that we're not an [old store] any more and that was why she didn't get the discount. But I'd be happy t...

Her: What?! I've lived her FOR YEARS and it's always been [old store]. You've got to be kidding me.

I point out the signs (they're everywhere) and shirts of the employees and explain that we've been [new store] for quite a while.

She persists though, demanding to get her discount because it's ""always been that way and why should I get screwed for what you did..."" just generally giving me a hard time; that kind of bullshit.

The managers will usually give the discount to them anyway, just to keep them happy, but I was sick of getting abused by people who apparently can't read and wasn't about to let this one fly. Pety, I know.

Eventually I get to the point where I'm just repeating myself and she's adamantly refusing to be 'robbed' of forty cents. So I call my manager to come up.

By this stage I'm sick of her shit and just want her to leave, customers are waiting to be served and I'm meant to be serving. Small store, small number of staff.

Finally my duty manager meanders up and he immediately grovels at her feet, begging her forgiveness and taking her to a spare register to sort out her problem. 


I'm not bitter (lies), but the smug grin she threw me on her way out made me really wish that our management stood up for us, at least sometimes.

And that I had a crowbar handy.

CommandoDerp,9,,17,1rhsfa,,62,"First off, I would like to say that I had two days off before this incident so I was unaware of any changes at work.

So I was at work after two days off when I was serving an elderly man, who was a regular, cigarettes. He asked for a particular brand in a carton of twin packs. I tell him unfortunately that the twin packs are classified as cartons themselves, and you cannot purchase a carton of a carton. He rolled his eyes and asked for 4 individual twin packs.

I immediately check the cupboard nearby of said twin packs of cigarettes that he wanted and I inform him that we are all sold out. This is the conversation that follows:

Him: ""Are you serious?""
Me: ""Yes, sorry. We are unfortunately all sold out until we get some more.""
Him: ""This is pathetic!""
Me: ""Would you like another flavor?""
He mumbles something to me which I repeat my previous question.
Me: ""Would you like another flavor?""
Him: ""No. This unacceptable. You are refusing sale""
Me: ""Is there anything else I can help you with as we don't seem to have what you are after?""
Him: ""I would like to speak to your manager.""
Me: ""Actually there might be some here""

I had a thought and I turned around and checked the display rack to see if there are any more in the display. To which I found 4 individual twin packs sitting there, I felt like an idiot not checking there first.

Me: ""I didn't realize that there was any in the display, I...""
Him: ""Your very lucky""

Him: ""Your very lucky you found them or otherwise you would have lost hundreds and hundreds of dollars in sales and quite a few hundred customers because of your poor service.""

Drunken_Black_Belt,7,,8,1rhw8z,,59,"I'm back bitches!  About 2 months ago, I got a second job working part time at a men's Big &amp;Tall store.  The hours are easy, commision is alright, and to be honest, the customers are generally friendly and awesome.  It helps that a lot of them don't have anywhere else to shop. Unfortunantly the store isn't as eventul as my past retail jobs.  Its just selling clothes and shoes.  But I've gotten a few funny stories that I'll share over time here. And with the holiday's coming up, i'm sure I'll have plenty more.  

Welll, for your pleasure (hopefully), I present **Boy, Are My Feet Sore!**

**WARNING: GROSS!**

So recently I began working in a men's store for Big &amp; Tall sizes.  I knew of it because I buy my shoes there.  Only store that carries a size 15/16.  I am too small for the clothes, despite being 6'4 and slightly overweight.  And if I'm being honest,  seeing some of the people who come in makes me more motivated to keep losing weight (50 lbs this year alone).  

Now, don't get me wrong, SOME of the people have legitimate health concerns.  One gentleman was born with his left foot backwards.  During his childhood they would constantly have to break his foot, set it slightly closer to the proper position, let it heal, and repeat. But it never set 100% correct, keeping him from being able to run or exercise, or even stand for long periods of time.  It's guys like him I feel for.  Given a shitty deal in life and just having to suffer for it. 

Most customers, however, are just plain old fat guys.  I don't want to sound mean, or ""fat shame"".  But it's just poor lifestyle choices and such.  I was there.  I was 5lbs shy of 300 last new years.  And it was just being lazy and making bad choices.  I don't have as much sympathy for these guys.  And that brings us to our story today.

It's a sunny fall day.  It's midweek, and pretty dead.  I'm in my suit, fixing clothes, putzing around, pretty much just pretending to work.  I hear the door chime, and in walks an older couple.  Probably late 60's, very early 70's.  The lady was using a walker to move around, and the gentleman was resting his weight on a cane as he slowly moved with her.  They seemed like a nice enough couple, but as you know, those are the ones who always turn into assholes.

I introduced myself, asked how I could help them that day.  The man gruffly replied ""shoes"".  I brought them to the shoe department.  Now my store is small, and there is only one small bench to sit on, and it's in the shoe department.  Naturally, this oaf takes the seat, leaving his frail wife to stand.  I could tell she was having difficulty, being particularly petire and frail, so I went in the back and got her a folding chair to sit in next to her husband.  She thanked me, because manners.  The man, charming fellow that he was, just said ""can you get me some shoes now?"".  

It was about this time that I realized this was going to go south faster than a my ex g/f in a dick sucking contest.

I offered several suggestions, as the gentleman didn't seem to know what kind of shoes he wanted.  The man complained that most of our shoes don't even fit him. I expressed sympathy, as I have large feet and can only fit into the largest size available in store.  The man looked me up and down and sneered ""Well, you just have big feet. I have a health condition that causes this, so consider yourself lucky"".  

Eventually we found a pair he liked and thought may just fit his feet.  And that's when the real horror of this story starts.  The man then proceeds to roll up his sweatpants.  He was wearing ankle socks and sandals.  His feet are hugely swollen, and covered in open sores.  This guy has diabetes, and it's eating away at his foot.  Sadly it's fairly common where I work.  What came next, however, is not.

I hand him the shoes, and take a step back, giving him some space to put the shoes on, look at them in the mirror, see how they feel, etc.  

NOPE!  

He looks at me like an idiot and says ""Well I can't put them on myself.  I can't bend that far.  Put them on for me"".   

Now I am no fan of feet, even on a good day.  Sure if I'm dating someone, and they want a footrub, and their feet are clean, then i'll oblige.  But other than that, I just want nothing to do with that area of the body.  Add to the fact that we are talking about a stranger whose foot is literally covered in open, oozing sores.  

DBB: Sir I just can't do that, I'm sorry.

Man:  You need to help me.  I'm a customer and I need service.

DBB: There is no way I am doing that sir.  I am sorry but you have open sores on your foot and leg. It's unsanitary for both me and YOU, to have me do that.

Man: Oh just wash your hands after it'll be fine.

How this man survived 70 or so years with logic like that, will forever amaze me.  

DBB: Absolutely not.  

Man: I want the manger!  I'll have your ass for discrimination and harrassment

DBB:  I am the manager.  If you want the store manager call back tomorrow.  If you want corporate's phone number I'll give it with my name gladly.  


The man continued to yell and scream about receiving the shoes at a discount and having me fired.  Typical stuff for anyone who works in retail really.  I essentially told him that I wasn't going to touch his feet, and if he didn't like the service he could leave. Wife is trying to keep the peace.  It's not very effective.  Husband used Rage!  It's inneffective against DBB!  Besides my DEF is to high.  

Anyways, i wish there was some more to this.  Eventually he stormed out as dramatically as one can when you can barely walk under your own weight, and your wife is frail and moves about as fast a christian school girl with a chastity belt.  I did hear from corporate the next day though.  Naturally some of the details were changed when he called in, but once I explained about the sores, I receieve a ""Yea that happens all the time. Don't worry about it"".  

Sorry if it's not very exciting.  I'm sure I'll have some good ones coming up.  Hope you all are surviving the holidays!

Turns out, the woman was making a sizeable purchase and couldn't supply an adequate form of ID. I explained to her that we simply couldn't process her credit card without proper identification. She dug through her purse and tossed a bottle of birth control pills on the counter and was like ""Will this bottle work?

She then threw a world class tantrum using colorful language that would even make a seasoned sailor blush.

kyatel,6,,8,1riaxl,,46,"*sorry for any typos or errors. Typing this on my phone on lunch break*

I was working in the jewelry department of a department/grocery store at the time. I'd been in that same department for 2 years by the time this incident took place. It was very early on a Saturday, before the rush, and a lady comes up to my counter to do a return. No problemo, I thought.

Me: I can do that return for you. Can I see your receipt ma'am?

Customer: I don't have it anymore. 

Me: I'll only be able to refund it to a gift card then, is that ok?

Customer: yeah, that's fine. 

One hurdle jumped. She hands me the item and I notice that it is in a package I have never seen before. I know my department like the back of my hand cause I'm the one that checks in -all- of the merchandise. Every item that has gone into the department in the last two years had to pass by me first. 

Me: ma'am are you sure you bought this here? I don't recognize this package. 

Customer, suddenly angry: of course I bought it here. (Spoiler, this a lie)

Me: ok, let me see if the system recognizes it. 

I scan the item at the register and I get an error. I look at the barcode and it's half as long as it needs to be (6 characters instead of 12, which is the store norm). 

Me: ma'am my register does not recognize this item. 

Customer: I bought it here!

Me, getting cranky at this point: are you -sure-? I've been in the department for two years and I've never seen this package before. Are you certain you didn't buy this at [dept store x] or [dept store y]?

Customer: I'm certain. I'm returning this for a friend and she bought it here! (Told ya)

Me: I'm sorry but I can't take an Item that doesn't even come up in the system. Especially if you don't have a receipt. 

Customer snatches the item from me and pulls her cell phone out: I am going to call her (the friend) and prove to you that it was bought here!! (She's nearly screaming at this point)

The customer walks away and makes her call. I watch her patiently from the counter and wait for her to return. She finally gets her friend on the line but is far enough away that I can't hear her. She's visibly pissed off and ranting to her friend. There's a short pause as she listens to her friend. Her demeanor changes completely. She looks at me once, turns, and walks out the door, presumably to return the item at the place it was bought from. ",Just discovered this sub today.

ScaldingSoup,5,,6,1rha57,,26,"So several  years ago I worked for a very popular lingerie store.  This store didn't pay commission, but would give us more or less hours per week based on sales performance.  My sales performance was VERY good.  I got more hours a week than most people.  

During the holiday season, we had a lot of seasonal employees, as any big retail store normally does.  One of the workers hired seasonally was this lady who was a lot older than the rest of us.  This was not the problem.  Her hair was bleached blonde, and growing out (showing obvious roots), and styled in a ""feathered"" fashion.  She did not know how to wear make-up and what she wore did not flatter her.  In this store our dress code was all black.   She wore skirts with no stockings, but with slouch socks and yeah, that was a hot mess.  

People began to call her the ""missing link"", as in to the 1980s because of the hair and her wearing slouch socks that were probably black in the 1980s but grey now.  Reading this, you may think that I judged her based on this, or have some animosity for people older than me.  I do not, but this just sort of describes what she looked like because it is important.  Black Friday rolls around, and she wears her normal dress of skirt, slouch socks and what-not.  Surrounding her socks are these bells that jingle..  

She begins waving panties in the air, helicopter style, like a stripper, chanting what the sale is as customers are passing by.  One of our gay male managers passes me by and mutters so only I can hear it ""I want her out"".  I was dying trying not to laugh at the situation, and meanwhile feeling very embarrassed for her.  Everywhere she walked, she jingled.

Some time during her short career with the lingerie store, she found my phone number on the schedule.  I guess they weren't giving her enough hours, because she had the nerve to leave me a message asking me for some of mine.

BlankName55,14,,6,1rgvl7,,23,"**Background**: I work for the spark store at a mega sized location. It's a regular location with a grocery store on one side and a nursery, essentially, on the other. I work in the party/craft/office section, although I've done everything and anything, from service desk to the truck to the phones (no, I believe you want the health clinic down the street, ma'am).

**Story (er, stories)**: 

1) I walk by the front door. Man approached with wife, stopped and said Excuse Me? Fine. I go over, and he started counting out a huge wad of cash. He counts $100 in small bills out, gives it to me, then says, ""Now, I want a propane tank, honey..."" 

He got the manager who resembles an NFL player instead. (Yes, I gave him the money back.)

2) Two young guys came through the checkout line with four carts of Head &amp; Shoulders, Dove bars, and some razors, I forgot the brand. This is ***-mart, it's cheap, and that's what matters. Three products. They racked up $1800 in this stuff. The one guy then pulled out of his pocket a pile of coupons that was quite literally a foot high. Mind already blown, I said half-jokingly, ""Those aren't all for me, are they?""

Yes. Yes they were. $1500 in coupons, $3 at a time. Do the math. And you couldn't do coupon repeats. Due to the volume, the *CSM thing came up halfway through, and I said ""Oh, the supervisor's going to have to turn the key..."" and they were all ""Ok, cool.""

So they hand over the remaining $300 cash (and people pay 500-600 all the time-that was normal) and the supervisor sees the key message on the palm pilot. I had every CSM (three on duty), the front end supervisor, two assistant managers, and every loss prevention person in the building (three-two associates &amp; the manager) at the register in what seemed like two seconds. 

The guy who'd had the coupons recognized the front end supervisor. He (coupon guy) went off and started going into it with the supervisor. The friend stands there numb, all the managers start talking at me, a CSM sticks the key in to abort this transaction, and I'm standing here holding $300 cash and a hell's lot of coupons. 

Then:
The customer let out a primal yell, the supervisor took the coupons from me, stuck them in the guy's hand, and wished him a good day-anywhere else. 

Turns out they were known scammers. The coupons would scan, but we can't get money back for them. I knew something was up, but I didn't know the back story. I just was asking myself over and over after this: If it had all gone through, and they'd walked out with $1800 of soap and shampoo, what the hell were they going to do with it all? Sell it at less than cost? Fill a swimming pool? Get ridiculously clean?

Well, because the star of this story is my son but, after reading all the posts about awful parents/kids, I wanted to share a funny story about a good kid and parents who are trying their best.

This story happened when my son was 4.  It takes place in the store where I work.  I wasn't there at the time.  My son, I'll call him Cee, was browsing the toy department with his dad while they were waiting for me to finish my shift.  

While Cee and his dad are looking at the toys, a woman with two children comes into the aisle they are in.  The older of the two, who is about the same age as Cee, sees something she wants and asks her mom for it.  Mom says no.  The little girl begs and pleads but mom holds firm and keeps telling her no.  Then the girl pulls out all the stops and throws herself on the floor, kicking and screaming, in a full blown tantrum.

Cee watches for a few seconds and then walks over to the girl.  He kneels in front of her and says:  ""Well, if you act like that, you really won't get anything.""  And then he walked back to his dad.  

Cee's dad was trying hard not to laugh but the woman didn't find it so funny.  She looked embarrassed and angry.  She grabbed her kids and stormed off.

copisreallybad,4,,6,1rhulb,,22,"a few days ago, i get called down to the returns desk from the paint desk. the return policy for the chain i work at is very lenient, but we aren't supposed to take mixed paint back, so already walking down there i had a bad feeling that i would have to get a manager involved (and we all know how incompetent they can be)

so i get there, and to my surprise it's just a regular can of unmixed, white, exterior paint, which *is* returnable without manager involvement. i ask the guy what's wrong with the paint and he says that it's frozen and we need to fix it or give him another can.

i bring the can to the paint desk and open it up. now, imagine what half frozen, hardened paint looks like. that's what this paint looked like, and the following conversation sort of went like this.

me: ""this paint is frozen, did you leave it in the garage or something?""

customer (now visibly irate): ""ABSOLUTELY NOT I BOUGHT IT AND I JUST OPENED IT THIS MORNING AND TO MY SURPRISE IT LOOKS LIKE THIS""

me: ""I'm sorry but we really aren't supposed to take paint like this back, it's useless to us returned""

customer (literally about to pop a blood vessel in his brain at this point): ""WELL MAYBE IF YOU GUYS HAD FUCKING SOLD ME A GOOD CAN OF PAINT IT WOULDNT BE FUCKING FROZEN. I WANT A MANAGER, NOW""

great, this guy knows how to get what he wants. i call a manager and explain the situation to him. the manager, being a typical manager, offers him a plethora of free things, including brushes and a brand new can of paint. the customer walks away with his free things (that i have to get for him) with the smuggiest ass look on his face.

story over, right? nope. i bring the can of paint to receiving, ZMA and hazmat it (since we can't sell it, it's fucking frozen and you can't paint with it). done deal im thinking, right?

not even close, bby. picture a hambeast of a woman. ok, maybe not that big, but she had a hard time fitting inside the reach truck sometimes. she is the department head of receiving. basically she sits in receiving on her computer waiting for trucks to arrive. 

now picture her carrying the frozen can of paint to the desk, except i actually had to see it happen. 

okay, okay, what the fuck is going on, im thinking. maybe i didnt mark it down correctly or something, maybe she'll show me how to hazmat it, i have no idea. im also in the middle of explaining to an older woman the different paint finishes we sell. 

nope, she has the nerve to tell me to just ""stick it in the paint shaker for a minute or two and see if we can try and sell it as OOPS paint."" at this point im all whatthefuck.jpeg, the paint is fucking frozen and shaking it won't help. i try to explain this to her but she would have none of it and walks away, and me, being the lowly, minimum wage paint associate that i am, do as she says. i stick it on the OOPS rack and continue my day.

the story ends when the department head of paint sees it on the OOPS rack, laughs, and takes it to receiving himself to hazmat it.

One of the things he'd do would come up to me and say something along the lines of
""Hey Champ, can you cut me a piece of this ""insert fruit here"" , ive heard this batch is extra juicy"" and then once hed taste it hed spit it out and say 
""Yuck thats disgusting, im glad i wasnt going to buy it"" and just storm off. He did this to me quite a few times and hed throw the skin or peel of it onto my displays and I was quite pissed off with all of it. 

He came in and and I recognised him. And the convorsation went as follows. 

Him: Hey Champ, do you mind if I try one of these Mandarins, they seem mighty delicious. 

Me: No you cant

Him: Why the hell not?

Me: Because its shoplifting, you have no intention of buying it, youve done this before you ask if you can try some and say its disgusting then walk off and all youre going to do is peel it, take one bite leave the the rest of the fruit and peel on my display and im not paid to clean up after you and its not a buffet either, what youre doing is taking stuff you havnt paid for, so its actually theft. So no you cant!

He stood there for about 6 seconds trying to think of something to say and all he could muster up was yelling:

The only thing we have to deal with really is the law which is one of the more annoying things. People who steal metal makes it tough for the honest guys who recycle.

I get several customers who come in every day or several times a week (we're open 6 days a week, 9 to 5). 80% of these customers are never ready. We require valid ID for every transaction and though I remember a good amount of people's names, some I don't. Those that know I ask for ID every time never had it ready. While they're standing in line why wouldn't they pull it out of their wallets instead of when they are at the front of the line? Or sign the receipt which is also required by law. I have to ask them EVERY SINGLE TIME. It's very frustrating. I go through the same thing every day and they never learn. I also get several customers who don't even speak English which is also frustrating. How can I ask you for things that are required by law when you don't speak my language? Most of them when I ask for ID just nod their heads. What are you nodding too? I asked for something, I didn't ask you to agree with me...

BefuddledBison,2,,3,1ric04,,24,"Howdy TFR. Turns out /u/BaffledBuffalo is taken on Gmail and Xbox Live so I changed my username to match my other accounts. At least my one post with it was sort of a one-hit wonder. 

Anyway, this next story was also from Barschmucks. If I didn't mention before, this was a franchise location inside of a large supermarket. We were technically employees of the supermarket even though we were real certified baristas. But this meant that many of our coworkers were cashiers and stock guys. One of the stock guys was Otis. He was a huuuuuge black dude who didn't converse much when he came by for his free cup of ice water but seemed like a pretty good guy.

I wasn't working when this happened, but my AST (Evan) told me about it. It's dead and he's just cleaning up waiting for the last few stragglers to wander in when Otis cruises up to the counter. Evan asks him what he'd like but Otis doesn't say anything and just stares at the menu. Evan goes back to cleaning while Otis contemplates the meaning of life. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Otis opening up the tea rack and fumbling for a tea bag (already this is a no-no, not only are we the only ones supposed to touch that tea, but we have to use tongs because it goes right in a customer's drink.) 

Evan doesn't have time to say anything before Otis lifts a bag to his nose and takes a deep whiff. 

He goes: ""What is this? Vanilla Rooibos? (He pronounced it ""roo-bis""; it's actually ""roy-bohs"".) Mmmmmmm. If a girl smell like dis, I'd lick her all *up* and down.""

Then, as quickly as he came, he put the tea back back, and left without saying a word. 

Evan dumped out all the Vanilla Rooibos and replaced it (not a big deal, nobody gets it anyway.)

**TL;DR:** Large man sexually assaults a tea bag in the middle of our store and left my coworker to clean up the mess.

Also, for anyone wondering why we keep the tea where the customers can reach it, it's because apparently people need to be able to see the bags before they can pick a drink for some reason.

j-sap,3,,5,1rigon,,17,"Some back story: I work the front desk at a gym a couple of days a week after class. We specialize in helping people with injuries and have a very specialized staff, program, and equipment. We are attached to an apartment complex that is spread out over a couple of buildings. The laundry for the complex is in the building adjacent to us. Now to use the laundry machines you are required to use a proprietary card that has to be purchased from a machine. I don't know what someone was smoking one day but instead of putting the machine that dispenses and allows people to add money to there card next to the laundry machines (even though there is plenty of room), someone decided to put the machine in the lobby of the gym. 

Where I work I have a very large window that overlooks the parking lot and see everyone who comes and goes and where people park. I had someone park or fly in the handicap spot (we'll call him Scumbag Steve or SS to keep things simple). SS jumps out of the car and runs full sprint into the lobby to add money onto his laundry card. After a minute or so I hear a knock on the window and we a quick interaction that goes like this:

SS: ""Hey yo man you got change for a $20?""

Now I absolutely do have the change for this guy in my drawer but if I used it then I would not have any for transaction at my desk.

Me: ""Sorry.""

SS: ""Yo man what about in your wallet, I know you can personally make me change?""

Now I am taken aback a little from this second question and am smart enough to never take out personal items around customers or even let them know where personal things are. I take a couple of seconds to think about everything and then respond.

Me: ""No I don't, but we have a great physical therapy program if you are interested.""

SS: ""Man why would I be interested in physical therapy, I am as fit as a horse?""

Me: ""Because you parked in a handicap spot and those spots are almost always full of clients.""

SS just sort of gave me a defeated look and slinked out the door and back to his car. He was back 20-30 minutes later and was good enough to not park in the handicap spot, instead he pulled up to the curb and made people walk around his vehicle.

adelajoy,0,,1,1ri8kg,,22,"I spent two years working at a big warehouse-style grocery store. I worked mostly as a cashier, but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a week.

Most of the crappy moments have all blurred together, but there are a few particular moments that stick out.

I realize this isn't the craziest story on here, but I will probably never forget this lady. 

Backstory: Our store had a policy that if an item scanned differently than the price tag, the customer would get it for free, up to $10. The mistake happened because the price tag didn't get changed, or was misplaced. If they spotted a problem, we would go look. If we found a tag in front of their item with the same code and a different price, we gave it to them and changed the tag. If the tag was for a different item, they didn't get anything. 

I was working the customer service desk, and a lady stormed up. I had several customers on the go at the moment, but it was pretty clear she *needed* help right away. As soon as I could, I asked what I could help her with. She was holding a bottle of toilet cleaner, her receipt and a price tag. Let's call her Crazy Customer, CC for short.

**CC**: ""I bought this bottle of toilet cleaner, but it was the wrong price! You guys are trying to charge me too much!""

**Me**: ""Okay, can I see your receipt?""

**CC**: *Hands me the receipt.* ""I tried to tell the cashier, but she didn't believe me!""

**Me**: *I checked who her cashier was, and it was one of our long-time girls. She knew the policy. There was no way she ""didn't believe"" the customer.* ""Okay, so the price came up $3.99, I'll just send a price-checker out to see what the tag said.""

**CC**: ""Oh, I grabbed the price tag already."" *She hands me the price tag. This lady is pretty worked up,  I'm not sure if she just wants to get out of the store, or if she's trying to pull one on me.*

A policy was that the tag had to be on the shelf. If a customer brings it to you, who's to say they didn't take it off the shelf last week and save it? They also could have found it in the wrong place, somewhere that the stock employees wouldn't have checked to fix the tag. As with most stores I've been to, store policy is to inform the customer about the relative store policies, and then see if you can help them anyways. No matter the problem.

It study the tag, and inform her of the policy, that the tag would have to be on the shelf. I start to let her know I can contact a manager, but she snatches the tag back and interrupts me.

**CC**: ""Well if that's your policy, I'll just put it back on the shelf! I was trying to save you some goddamn work, but I guess if you guys want to work extra, I'll just go put it back!""

She took off before I could say anything. I was just standing at the desk, aghast. I didn't even know what to say. 

The supervisor that was on shift was the scary kind. You know, the kind that isn't afraid to yell a little, handles the worst customers, and isn't phased when people call her names. Let's call her Jane. When the woman was gone, I grabbed Jane and told her the whole story. She said, ""Okay. When she comes back, let me know who she is. I'll handle her.""

As soon as I saw the customer coming back, I hissed, ""Jane! Jane! Jane! White hat! That's her."" I then ducked behind the display at customer service, and quite actually hid back there until the customer was gone. I could hear her yelling at Jane. I don't know what the verdict was. Any other manager, and the customer would have gotten the item for free, but it's hard to say with Jane.

I remember one of my coworkers came around the display and exclaimed my name. I hushed them, and told them I was hiding. I was so afraid the woman would see me and do one of those, ""Her! That's the one I was talking to! She told me this!"" And drag me back into it.

I've never hid from a customer before or since. Oh! Fun fact: The price tag she was holding said $3.29, a $0.70 difference from what she paid, and the tag was dated for the week before, which means it wasn't the current price. Not to say it wasn't still on the shelf, but there is a chance she did save it and bring it back in, especially with how worked up she was.

Thank goodness for thick-skinned supervisors who can handle being yelled at.","""I guess if you guys want to work extra, I'll just go put it back!""",23,talesFromRetail
Dannythegirl,5,,6,1rh77t,,7,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this but I needed to share. Long time lurker of this subreddit. On my phone, sorry for wall. 
I am a customer in this story, but former multi-year service/retail employee.
Today, I was grocery shopping with my two very little children. Not a huge chain store, but prominent in my state for supporting local foods. Many locations. 
I got in line to check out after an eventful and frustrating trip around the store with the kids. There was an elderly man checking out ahead of me. He was friendly and talkative to my kids and was asking me about my tattoos while we were waiting. The cashier was probably 55, spacey, but very sweet woman. When it was old guys turn to check out, I overheard their conversation at the register, and it was obvious they were both long time veterans to the store. 
The man had some trouble checking out. He rang his credit card through the machine multiple times while chatting with the cashier and he seemed confused. Eventually, she explained that he didn't have to keep swiping his card, and that his transaction was complete. In the mean time, she was scanning my items. 
The cashier chatted up a storm with me too. Asking about my kids while I was trying to wrangle them. I was getting a little impatient at this point because my 1 and 3 year old were ready to get the hell out of there, but I listened to her stories with patience. She was kind too.
When she finished scanning my food I pulled my card out to run through the machine, but it was asking for a signature, when I hadn't scanned my card yet. 
Me: ""there must be a mistake, I haven't slid my card through but it's already asking for a signature""
Cashier: ""no, you did, you must have forgot"" -looks at screen- ""you swiped your America express""
Me: ""No, I don't have an Amex, see?.. Oh no did the man in front of me swipe his card while you were ringing me up?""
Cashier: ""uh oh, that must have been what happened""
She looked panicked, but printed the receipt and said ""I'll just do this"" AND SIGNED THE RECEIPT
Cashier: ""He'll be okay, he can be so spacey. Don't even worry about it""
She at first folded up the receipt like she was going to trash it but I asked her if that was really ok, and that I could wait for a manger. She unfolded the receipt and told me not to worry. There was a long line behind me and frankly I was ready to get the fuck out of there with my crazy kids. I asked her ""are you sure? I feel uncomfortable"" 
She told me not to worry, and to go ahead and leave. And I did. 
I think her career might have ended today.
TLDR; Elderly man in line ahead of me accidentally paid for my groceries, cashier eventually realized but didn't give a fuck to fix it. I got free groceries :/

EDIT/UPDATE: I can see how it looks like I was unsympathetic in my post. I was in fact, horrified. I know the groceries weren't free, I just did not pay for them. In my car, I wrote down the time, my total $78.43 and what I thought the mans total was before me $43, and the name of the cashier. I should have stuck around and put my foot down but I was flustered and unsure how to proceed.  I was planning on calling when I got home, and totally forgot about the whole thing until I was in bed redditing from my phone late at night.
This morning I called and spoke with a manager, giving him all of my information. I told him I would happily come back and pay for the groceries and to please make sure the man did not actually get charged (hoping the cashier took the issue to the manager after I left). He said he will look into the receipts from last night and give me a call back. I will update again when I hear from him.

insecure_shit_knob,3,,2,1rie8h,,21,"Short and sweet one today. For new readers of my stories (welcome back to the other three), I'm a front end manager at a giant retail chain. Dealing with customers and cashiers is my job, and I only have the job because I'd rather work than be bored. I have enough money to not work, so I am not scared of losing my job.


On to the story:

One of my favorite cashier's (seriously, she's so sweet and helpful. I always drop what I'm doing to answer her questions because she's one of the three that I trust) calls me over for a price check on a set of plates. Customer says they were $29.99, but when I go check they're $49.99. She says that's fine and she pays for them. Done and over, right?

Wrong.

About ten minutes later she comes over to my podium. I already know she's getting coal from me in her stockings (merry Christmas bitch).

Her- ""I was just over there looking at the plates again. They were there just in the wrong spot.""

Me- ""I'm sorry ma'am, I'll let an associate know so he can fix it. I'm a little busy to get to it."" Which I was, I was getting five different change orders ready.

Her- ""Isn't it your job to fix it?""

Me- ""actually no it's not. I'm the front end manager. There are two managers who work in that area, it's actually their job technically. If I would've seen the plates,I would've put them in the right spot.""

Her- ""So you're just a lazy asshole.""

Ok, I'm done. I talk to everyone in a civil manner, but when they take that tone with me, I'm done.

Me- ""yep""

Her- ""You're not going to fix it?""

Me- ""Nope, too lazy right now.""

This was followed by more angry questions and statements until I walked away to deliver my change orders. She tracked an assistant manager down and let him have it about my attitude. He's a pretty cool guy, came up to me later, asked what the deal was and just laughed when I told him. Now he always asks if I'm lazy today when he sees me.

I don't remember much from it except for this story. Working storefront; typical day, typical customers. This older, possibly Italian gentleman came up and I asked to take his order.

Man: May I see your hand?

I think I just stood there looking at him for a moment. He had an Italian accent so I was thinking I may have misheard him, and asked for his order again. He held his hand out and insisted to see mine.

Now, this guy didn't look creepy or scary or anything. If so I would have just bolted. But I was 17 and put on the spot so I gave him my hand.

Man: What is your name?

At the time I still had my ""Trainee"" name tag so it wasn't on there. I don't know why I gave him my name. I didn't really know what else to do.

He then proceeded to serenade me in front of the entire store. Granted, there were only about 10 people around. He held my hand with enough force that I could not easily pull it away and I stood there flushed red while the rest of the staff laughed at me. Apparently it's happened before.

He sang in deep Italian (and I heard my name thrown in there) for a good two minutes before he let me go.

I was volunteering at a local zoo for a special Halloween event for about 3 - 4 hours. It was the last night of the event, and I was in charge of handing out prizes for games. It was a pretty good job, and I got to have as much free soda as I wanted, since I was in the concessions booth. I had to set out prizes, read tickets to see how many points a kid had, tell them how much each prize was (They could mix and match), then calculate how many points they had left as they chose. They'd choose their prizes, I'd hand it to them, and they'd leave. 

I had a friend of mine with me for the first hour, and we split the customers when it got busy. (Around 5 people at the same time.) At one point I spilled my soda, and she handled the crowd as I cleaned up the mess.

Then she left. Oh god.

I was left to set out prizes for display, serve customers, and translate kid-speak by myself. At some points I was so swamped with customers that I could barely figure out the total points for each kid as they got prizes.

Another girl came it at low tide, but left before it got busy again. (Around twenty minutes.) I wasn't allowed to leave my station to try and find her, so I had to deal with all the customers alone. (She wasn't actually allowed to leave either, but she gave zero fucks. Bitch.)

Scott5114,0,,3,1riony,,13,"I've met a lot of strange customers in my time at the casino. This guy takes the cake as the most fucked-up, unpleasant guy that's ever darkened our doorstep. We'll call him Dick because he is one.

To begin with, Dick is in the casino for a fucked-up reason. He's dying of cancer, or some other terminal disease. He spends his last days in our casino trying to win an inheritance for his children. Of course, mathematics says it's not going to happen, so he's squandering what money he does have and the remainder of his life sitting in a smoky room with no natural light playing $25 per spin on a slot machine. 

I wouldn't judge him so harshly for that if he wasn't a colossal asshole. Pretty much everyone who has had to pay a jackpot for him has some sort of unpleasant experience to share. Mine was when I was processing a jackpot for him and I go to clear the jackpot message from the screen. See, if you win, say, $1500, and you had $80 in credit when you hit it, when the attendant clears the jackpot your $80 will still be left on the machine. People sometimes forget or don't know this, and will leave the money on the machine and walk away, so after clearing it most of us will say ""You still have $80 left on the machine."" Of course, when I mention this to Dick, he flies into a rage, screaming ""I CAN SEE THAT! GOD!"" I started dodging his jackpots when I knew where he was playing after that—I don't put up with that sort of BS—though I still had to pay him out a couple of times after that because I didn't realize who it was. 

And Dick did hit a lot of jackpots. He would usually destroy the copy of the W2-G tax forms we would give him, I guess thinking since he's dying he won't need to worry about paying taxes, though you would think he would realize his kids would be on the hook for all of it. He also had the tendency to swear ambiguously so you never really knew whether he was calling the machine or you a piece of shit. Management had talked to him a couple of times about treating the attendants better. He did tip the bare minimum to not be considered an ass in that department, at least.

All of that is backstory to properly put in context what happened this week. At this point, Dick's managed to piss off enough attendants that most of the shift is dodging his calls, so it takes him probably twice as long to get someone over there than it would anyone else. This, coupled with the fact that he's losing heavily, pisses him off. 

Management gets called over to a machine in my section. I'm generally pretty curious about these things, so I head over there. The machine's touchscreen (retail price quoted to me by a tech as $700 or so) is totally shattered. The machine still has $20 on it—with an inoperable touchscreen, there's no way to cash that out on this machine. There's a patron further down the bank who saw the whole thing. Said the guy was losing, got pissed, punched the screen, threw a piece of paper down, and stormed off. One of the managers that showed up picks up the paper.

It's a torn-up W2-G with Dick's name, address, and social security number on it. A little bit of searching in the computers turns up copies of his driver license and the hotel room he is in. And of course the whole incident is caught on tape.

We don't know what happened to Dick after that. Apparently it became the responsibility of the casino's assistant general manager, and she isn't talking. We're all watching the usual locations for ban notices to go up, though.",The worst casino patron in the world,16,talesFromRetail
GlowingBall,2,,2,1rioer,,16,"These are my Tales of Retail Loss Prevention....

Part Three – Citizen Snips (Aka - The Pants Aquatic)



As a recap for those of you who have never read one of my stories before – I am a male in the midwest who is on the wrong side of his twenties and works retail loss prevention for a major retailer (one of the 'Big 5').  I am underpaid for what I do but enjoy my job none the less.  A majority of my time is spent wandering the floor or watching middle aged moms shop for clothing far too skimpy on them via CCTV (closed circuit television or 'security cameras').  Every once in awhile I get a case that is just so mind blowingly 'WTF' that I have to share.  

This story opens up with me doing just as I said above – watching people on CCTV.  It is a blisteringly cold afternoon so the customers, far more content to stay in their warm homes and snuggled beneath their blankets, are few and far between.  I, as the ever watchful hawk of justice that I am, was busy playing a Marvel version of Candy Crush Saga.  My job provides me the liberty of slacking off a good amount and my boss is rather lenient as long as I continue to bring in a good amount of stops per month.  I am sitting there diligently trying to match up small colored tiles with one another when I am startled by a sudden ring – the phone is going off!  

Now the phone going off is common place.  We get tons of calls a day ranging from the frozen dairy department calling to tell us a temperature alarm is going off (we know...it goes off for us as well) to people asking us to deactivate a door alarm (we also know...we see you standing at the door).  This happened to be a call from one of the few places that doesn't call us often – the meat department.  The guy on the other end, a tall black man with more muscle than he knows what to do with, calls to tell us that there is a guy standing in front of the freshly butchered meat.  The guy has refused any help the meat employee has offered and continues to say he is 'just browsing' for over ten minutes.  This strikes me as rather odd.  Who just hangs out around the meat department?  I quickly devise a plan for the situation.  I tell the employee to walk into the back so I could see just what the person was going to do.  

The employee hangs up and walks over to the man to let him know he is going to be into the back and to ring the bell if he needs anything.  No sooner than when he had walked into the back but the man glanced around and then walked behind the counter.  My adrenaline already began to rush as my suspicions came to fruition – he was going to steal!  “Oh shit here we go, ” I declared, only to watch in confusion and frustration as he walked right past all the glass displays full of meat and right over to the lobster tank.  Now if you aren't familiar with these tanks they are exactly just what the name implies – a water filled tank full of live lobsters we sell by the pound.  Their claws are bound and they just kind of hang out crawling all over one another.  Kids love to sit there and watch them.

“No way...is he really going to...” I whispered as I watched on in awe.  Sure enough he reached right into the live lobster display tank we have.  After a moment of 'fishing around' he plucked the lobster he wanted from the tank and pulled it out of the water.  Before I could even make heads or tails of the situation he glanced around once more and shoved the lobster right down the front of his pants.  The guy, whom shall be hence forth called Lobster Johnson, then proceeded to shuffle run his way out of the meat department and through the grocery department towards the front of the store.  The only way I can really describe how he ran was a forward version of Zoidberg's shuffle.  All he was missing was yelping out “Woop woop woop woop!” loudly as he went.  

Needless to say he wasn't too hard to stop.  I may not be in the best shape of my life but I can still move quicker than a guy with a large lobster squirming around in his pants.  He didn't fight me at the door or even try to argue what he was doing.  After all, it is kind of hard to argue that you aren't stealing when you have a large, lobster shaped bulge in your pants.

Bonus icing on top of the cake: I usually ask the person why they are stealing.  It usually won't change anything but it fulfills my curiosity and keeps them talking which usually calms them down a bit.  This guy tried to say that he was stealing the lobster for his kids...

As I come around a corner in said hallway I almost bump into our Store Manager (SM from here on out) who is in the middle of cleaning the bathrooms.  SM and I start chatting and from the men's room I hear some loud noises.

""Damn kids screwing around."" SM replies as he sets down the bag of trash he had been holding and walks over to the men's room.

Now, SM isn't a particularly tall guy, but he lifts weights quite a bit and could very well be described as being jacked.  Somehow, from time to time, people think it is a good idea to fight him, so I stuck around in case he needed backup.

SM opens the men's room door hard, slamming it into the wall and bellows, ""What the HELL are you doing in my bathroom?""

--inaudible reply--

""Yeah, well it is a pretty sad day when I have to kick someone out of the bathroom, now get the hell out."" SM says at a slightly reduced volume.

""B..But my stomach hurts."" says a meek voice from inside the bathroom.

Then at a normal volume, but with a tone of voice that sounded like SM had ice in his veins he replies, ""Carry it somewhere else.""  Then he stared into the bathroom in a manner that was somewhat intense.

To avoid angry customers being stuck with something they dont like, we offer a 'comfort guarantee' where you have 90days to decide you dont like it and come exchange it for something else. This comes with a fee of $200 as we have to throw the like new mattress out.  

STORY: In comes a guy. Hes visibly upset, all I can think is [""here we go""](http://i.imgur.com/8MmamRX.gif) lets call him Angry Asshat(AA)

AA: I hate my mattress! 

ME: Im so sorry to hear that sir woul-

(he cut me off)

AA: I want my money refunded immediately, and I want you to come get that shit off my property **Today**

ME: Im very sorry but we cant refund your money. 

AA: [WHAT?! WHAT DO YOU MEAN](http://i.imgur.com/HouBhTG.gif)

ME: Well sir its illegal in the state of North Carolina to take used mattresses and we cant take it back. 

AA: WELL I WANT IT THE FUCK BACK NOW I DONT RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE([he was just yelling nonsense at me about how this is whats wrong with the world and its all the dirty liberals fault](http://i.imgur.com/OudLd7s.gif))

ME: Sir, I cannot break the law for you. Not only is it the store policy its **the law**

Now hes raging, but Im trying to salvage the situation

ME: What we can do for you though is our 90 day comfort guarantee swap out. Can I have your name Ill look your ticket up and well see what we can do. 

He seems to calm down a little bit and he takes a seat across from my desk and he gives me hi name. I look up his name and pull up his ticket as Im explaining the comfort guarantee I look at his ticket. And then at the date he bought it(ya know to make sure its at least close to 90 days) I was willing to be flexible to make this guy happy when I notice he bought this mattress 9months ago!! Im flexible but not *that* flexible

ME: Uhh Sir, Im sorry to say this but you bought this mattress 9months ago, that 6months over the 90days. Theres nothing we can do for you. 

That when he became absolutely IRATE with me. Screaming something about how this is bad business practice, he deserves to get a refund, we owe it to him. Blah blah blah. [Im done this this shit](http://i.imgur.com/InDPcFn.gif)

ME: SIR. There is nothing we can do, the comfort exchange policy was explained to you when you bought it, if you didnt like the mattress you should have come back 6months ago, now Im going to have to ask you to leave the store. 

Well he didnt like that very much. He was becoming increasingly angry and hostile. Hes leaning over my desk pointing his finger right in my face([Which I hate](http://i.imgur.com/u77ThfE.gif)) but I keep my cool, and as sternly as I can say

ME: Sir if you dont leave immediately I will be forced to call the police and have you removed from my store. 

He paused for a moment with sheer rage in his eyes. Then he SLAPS!(yes slaps) the coffee on my desk across the 5mattresses that are close to my desk, gives me the finger and walkes out! I was in shock I composed myself quickly, called the police, and then my boss and explained everything that happened. 

I guess that asshat forgot that he gave us his address to deliver the mattress to, he ruined about 5beds which he was made to pay sticker price for on all of them(sticker price is close to $300 more than what we normally sell for) 


Although I was scared I made a great commission on all the beds he had to replace. There was justice that day and it was great.

jessajuhanabi,30,,94,1rhnqp,,397,"As of last Thursday, I am the head manager of a retail outlet and cafe, answering only to my boss, since the only girl above me quit. All people that walk in, call or email come through me. My boss is normally around but he works on coffee machines most days. 

As backgound for this story: His brother is a c*nt. I live in Australia, so that term seriously fits him. He owes a bunch of people money, is generally an asshole, and my boss is very sad his brother has changed so much. It stresses my boss out as their finances are tied due to a trust. 

Today, a lady walks in around 11:30, and walks up to the front desk. Politely, she asks me, ""Is (boss) in?""

In my mind, she was another person that he knew since he's been running this business for 20+ years, or a rep from some company that I didn't care about. He turned around to look at her, and I pointed in his direction. 

She immediately starts spouting about how boss's brother, we'll call him AH for asshole, owed her money. This is not a surprise to boss. He knows her. He's heard from her over email before. In which he told her he has no access to the trust and he's also fighting AH for money. 

This does not please the lady, henceforth known as douchecanoe. DC repeats over and over, despite pleas from my boss to chase down AH, ""I'm not leaving without my money. Get it for me.""

Now, DC wants a hefty sum. A couple thousand dollars. My boss offers her a coffee while he tries to reach AH. A water. A chair. Nothing. She stands in front of our stock and repeats herself over and over. ""Give me my money. Give me my money. I don't care its not my problem. YOU pay me.""

Why is she going after my boss? Because she's gone through the courts, they told AH to pay, and he still hasn't. Her response? Come into my store and stand there all day every day until HIS BROTHER, pays her. 

Now, my boss tries and tries to get her to understand he has no access to the money. No go. So instead she stands in our store, silent, for 4 fucking hours. Four. DC stands there so long my boss gets fed up and stressed, and leaves. 

The difference is, he's a peace keeper. I was itching for him to leave. I was just going to have the cops come eject her. I was EXCITED. 

Unfortunately she realized rather quickly I was not the ""nice cop"" type so she stood out the front, called in a few friends and intermittently yelled ""YOU KNOW THIS IS SO SILLY I JUST WANT MY MONEY FROM THE (BUSINESS)"" and ""I KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE IN XXXX SUBURB I COULD RUIN A BUSINESS IF I WANTED TO."" through the window at me. 

Oh god. You scare me so much. I might pee my pants. 

Anyway she eventually gave up and left without coming back inside, probably since I was watching her and smiling, willing her to come inside so I could call the cops. 

Oh well, another day I suppose! Maybe she'll be back tomorrow...

SS_material,103,,89,1rhs01,,308,"I work in a Pet store, and had a lady check out, take her stuff to her car, come back in, ask for the bathroom directions, and came back to me asking for a manager.

Now when I was calling my managers phone, I had asked her if there was a reason and she replied, ""Oh yeah, there's a reason alright.""

Hmm..okay. I told my manager and she came to the front to talk to the lady. She had stepped to the side, away from me and talked to her. Then she began to tell another customer what happened sayinf ""that's just anti christian! Can you beleieve that?""

So I think to myself, oh boy what sign pissed her off. Because we have celebrate the season everywhere. Later, I asked my manager what she had complained about and she told me that she was upset because I didn't tell her Merry Christmas.

What...it's not even Thanksgiving yet! My manager did say it's fine, and that I'm not in trouble. I don't have to tell her Merry Christmas, or Happy Holidays unless I wanted to. I started my first retail job in August of this year, so it's gonna be fun during the holidays when people get angry at me for ""offending"" them.

DolfyuttSrednaz,58,,48,1rh8hc,,200,"I have got to say, after working 4 years in retail, parents should be responsible for their children's actions. I have seen so many kids acting like demons that have just spawned from a dimension full of pointy sticks being shoved up their asses, but I never blame the kids. I usually don't even blame the parents, because kids are kids, but when customers blatantly let their kids run around like Sonic on meth, I blame the parents. that is why we have an announcement that plays every few minutes, reminding customers to keep their little shits in line. So when a customer like the one I had comes in, I usually inform my manager (who will be called Jared) of the situation and he watches the kid from a distance. 

A middle-aged couple stumbles into the store with their 7 year old son. They head off to furniture, but their son makes a bee-line to toys. I immediately call Jared, and let him know that this little tornado is heading to toys and he should try to contain the damage as much as possible. Before the kid makes it to toys, he stops over in the Halloween section and starts putting on masks and runs around the store trying to scare the other customers. After 4 complaints, Jared stops the kid, and drags him to his parents, who don't give one shit nor a giggle about what my manager has to say and wave him off. The kid bolts towards toys, and stars ripping toys down off the shelf. The floor looks like a miniature Antietam by the time he is finished. Now he has an armload of toys and decides to take them to the bathroom. Once in there, he places them on the floor, and proceeds to urinate on them. Jared walks in on him finishing up, and drags the kid back to his parents, leaving a trail of piss footprints behind him. Jared tells the parents what he did, and that they have to clean up the mess. This switches the parents into rage mode. They just cannot BELIEVE that their kid would do this! And he will be punished severely when they get home. Jared tells them calmly ""I am punishing you, not your child. You guys made no effort to control him, and even brushed me off after the first incident. You guys will clean up every mess he has made, and then you can leave. You are no longer welcomed here."" They start yelling profanities at him and their kid, saying how this is ridiculous and they shouldn't have to put up with this. 

After they cleaned up, they left empty handed. Jared received many compliments on how he handled the situation. It is the second worst customers I have ever had, even if I didn't directly deal with them. The worst, by far, has to be a couple out of towners. That is for another day though.

racheecakes,8,,48,1rhjav,,206,"This sub is usually full of complaints and although I have quite a few I have a short, nice story to tell. I work in the dining room at one of the lovely bakery/cafe chains in America. We are very lax on people lingering in our cafe, especially the homeless. We allow them to stay in our building in the single comfortable chairs for as long as they want as long as they're not pestering our customers. (It's not like we're hobo central, there are only two or three regulars). Usually our lunch rushes are filled with self centered people or angry people who just spent a dick load of money on presents for people they really didn't want to spend money on (we're located in a mall parking lot). In the midst of the chaos, bread bowls, and dirty tables I notice a customer approaching an obvious homeless man. This catches my eye so I go over and start cleaning a nearby table and eavesdrop. The customer hands the homeless man a gift card to our cafe for fifty dollars. He told him to stay full during this holiday season, to have a good one, and clenched his shoulder in a very comforting, almost fatherly like way. He walked away and back to his table before the homeless man got to say a word. The look on the homeless man's face was something worth remembering. It was nice to see someone think of someone they did not even know.

aturquoiseseashell,12,,25,1rg9do,,127,"End of shift at a famous, upscale department store, and I am already clocked out, with my purse on. I'm talking to my coworkers before I leave because I'm waiting on a ride home. I work in the lingerie department, which is near one of the 2nd story entrance doors to the store. 

A flustered woman comes up with three bags, one from Kate Spade, one from Michael Kors, and one from Tory Burch. She says she found the bags in the vestibule of the entrance to the store.
We thank her for her honesty and promise to call Loss Prevention to come and take the bags. She becomes agitated.

""Well I'm going to wait here and see that you do it,"" she snaps. She's suddenly riled up.

We're a bit taken aback, but continue to be polite to her and my coworker calls LP.

While my coworker waits on the phone to be connected to the security desk, I guess we kind of exchanged looks. (She was very antsy, and was holding onto the bags for dear life). The woman exclaims in outrage, ""Don't you all roll your eyes at me!"" 

""Ma'am,"" says my co-worker, ""No one is rolling their eyes. We're waiting for security to pick up the phone. They will make sure the bags are returned to the customer. Thank you very much for bringing them to our attention, we will see to it that they are returned to the customer."" 

The woman becomes more agitated and irritated. Finally, security picks up and my coworker says, ""A customer found some bags; one's from MK, one is from Tory Burch…""
The woman snaps, before my coworker is quite finished, ""And one from Kate Spade!!"" as though we purposely left that one out so we could steal it or something. 

""And one from Kate Spade,"" my co-worker adds. We're all getting kind of insulted by this woman's attitude. She seems convinced we're plotting to steal the bags, despite the fact that they remain in plain sight of the security camera. We're all well-dressed, well-spoken girls in our early twenties, and we are acting calm and polite. No apparent cause for suspicion.

Security says they can't help and to turn the bags into customer service, who coworker speaks to.
""Ma'am, please give me the bags. Customer service is coming to pick them up,"" my coworker says. We really want her to leave at this point. She's staring at us through narrowed eyes and she's breathing heavily.

""No!"" the woman shrieks, and clutches them to her chest. She tears frantically at one of them and finds a receipt. She begins dialing the number of Kate Spade. We're stunned.
""Please, ma'am…"" the coworker begins, but the woman literally shushes her and begins frantically reading the details of the receipt to the cashier at Kate Spade who is on the other end of the phone. 

She convinces an employee at Kate Spade to come to the dept. store to identify the bags.
Meanwhile, she announces that she will take the bags to customer service herself, in a very angry tone. ""You all are acting VERY suspicious!"" she declares, still clutching the bags to her breast almost maniacally. 

At this point, we're pretty alarmed by her behavior and beginning to wonder if she plans to steal the bags herself after seeing the prices on the receipt. My coworker calls the store manager, and we inform the customer that we would prefer that she remain in lingerie with the bags and wait for the manager. She loudly refuses to stay put. My coworker follows her to customer service.

From all the way in our department on the other end of the floor, we can hear the woman yelling. She had a quavery voice and a really strong British accent. 
Apparently, she got to customer service, and the couple who had left the bags was there. The woman refused to give them the bags without proof of their identity!! Finally the Kate Spade employee arrived and confirmed that yes, the bags belonged to the couple. 

I guess the woman was trying to do the right thing, but she insulted my coworkers and me and frightened various customers in the process. I still don't get why she became so suspicious or why she didn't just bring the bags to customer service in the first place. Of course, since we were lowly retail workers we must have been plotting to steal the lost merchandise.

KroipyBill,11,,40,1rhynu,,123,"After [writing about our cheering seasonal workers from Black Friday yesterday,](http://redd.it/1rf92j) it reminded me of this other story involving my goofy manager. 

When I first started working for this place, I came in clean shaven, and patchy hair. I was in denial that mother nature was closing my hair follicles for business, and it wasn't until after my engagement photos I decided to make a change. I shaved my head and have kept it that way ever since. I then grew a goatee to compensate for my loss. Honestly I looked much sharper than having the grassy field of hair you can see the horizon through. It was a relief to embrace it, and feel like I looked decent again. There was one manager who enjoyed messing with me however. In fact in my previous stories, I've quoted him several times in our conversations, since he was my favorite manager to talk to, and the biggest goof ball there. He vowed he would draw on my head when I wasn't ready for it. 

**Me:** Dude I'm taller than you. So unless you parachute from the rafters onto my cranium with your sharpie, you will not succeed. 

**Manager:** We'll see...we'll...see...

At that moment I wondered if he really was contemplating that attack strategy. At least he left it at just contemplating. 

One day, we were pretty busy. It was pre-holiday, post-black Friday days. I'm sure you all know the type. Everybody is getting geared up for Christmas. I found my way over to the computer department helping a customer decide what Mac they wanted. I was describing the hardware specs, how it works with their Apple products etc. During this I felt I was going to make a decent sale. However I made a massive mistake...

*I sat down.* 

Yes I slipped up big time. My manager saw this opportunity from what it seemed immediately. He walked over and distracted me by having another employee ask me a question. 

**Employee:** Hey KroipyBill you know where I can find [some bullcrap item that he knew the answer to.]

**Me:** Yeah sure. Remember they're eh...ahh...AHH!!!

Right then, my manager walks up to me with his pen, and I felt the coldness of the ballpoint touch my head, while it was dragged across my chrome dome. My entire body froze as if somebody stiffed my spine. I made a weird breathing noise, like I was experiencing sharp pains when it was just mainly a very tiny cold piece of metal on my head. Kind of like EAHH!! EAHH!! EAHH!!! (That's the best I can do textually.) They were quiet, sharp noises.

He walked off, cackling like the joker. I looked at my customer with this super surprised look on my face. He lost his crap, and just laughed. Because of this I sold him more attachments, but that's beside the point. 

Over the radio:

**Me:** The person who drew on my head. You know who you are. Thanks for helping my sale out by doodling with a ballpoint pen on my cranium. 

I looked around the store and saw those with a radio express such confusion. I'm a pretty tall dude, so for those who were in eye sight, I bent my head down so they could see the graffiti my manager brought forth upon my person. Much laughter followed, including my manager.

**Manager:** You said I would never get you. 

**Me:** Well bucket head, you're lucky I was sitting so your midget self could strike me. 

**Manager:** My strike is now complete. 

**Me:** It's a good thing I don't just go over there and rub my greasy head all over your face. I'm glad you feel all militaristic about your approach. 

**Manager:** Oh...this would be a much more fun Call of Duty game if this were part of the game play. 

I never got him back. And he has since left the store after I left. Despite us still being good friends, he's still a bucket head.

It was a beautiful sunny day, which is not common in these parts from oh...October to May.

At this point I realized that I'm dealing with some sort of royalty by the way she's talking to me and looking at me like I was clearly beneath her.    
    
We walked out side and toward the Avalon's and as we rounded the corner I was blinded by the light of 1 sun (that mutha fucker is bright when we only see it a few times a year) so I do what I thought was natural, I put on my sun glasses. You'd think I killed her 2nd born spawn.    
        
UB stopped in her tracks and said, ""Excuse me, how long have you been in sales.""     
    
Me, ""About 15 years now, why do you ask?""    
    
UB, ""How dare you put your sunglasses on in front of a customer. You should know better.""    
    
At this point I'm done with her attitude. She can; buy a car, sell a car, die in fire for all that I'm concerned.    
    
Me, ""While were walking into the direct sunlight I'm keeping them on, once we get into a car I'll make sure to take them off so you can see my pretty greens again.""     
     
The look and sound of disgust from her should of withered some near by plants.     
    
UB, "" I don't want to look at the Avalon unless it has what I want on it.""      
        
I acted all surprised and said, ""Ahhh in that case thus far all you've told me is that you want technology on it. Every car on my lot has technology, how about you fill in the blanks for me and I'll get you what you need.""   I finished that last part with a touch of sarcasm.
    
UB, "" You don't have to take that tone with me.""     
    
I just started at her until she finally answered my question.    
   
UB, ""I want....""  Imagine everything every car in every scfi movie has done (some highlights: Voice activated everything, self driving, self maintaining, color changing, all electric or non-gas, The list goes on)

Maloth_Warblade,6,,17,1rhx0y,,94,"Black Friday, 2011. Big, blue, zombie-filled box store. I was a photo tech.

It's been almost 2 years now, as I no longer work for retail. I did my 5 years with it and I'm done.

I'm glad I'm out, too. I don't hate people, I just learned that I hate being treated like less than crap, filth, and told I'm worthless on a daily basis. But this one was so irritating I spoke up.

I worked 2 stores on Black Friday in 2011, both the BBS and the famous game store. I was basically at work from Noon-8 on Thanksgiving at the BBS, missing all family gatherings, by the way, and then 11:30pm-7am at the games store (I was the only cashier by the way, in the most populated area of the county/city), and then 12-8 again on Black Friday at the BBS. 

I was tired, beyond tired, essentially 20hrs of work, on my feet with no breaks for food or bathroom due to chaos. The BBS frequently refused to give me my lunches until I was mandatorily locked out, and even then they simply made me work anyway (even got reported for going over 8 hrs without a break, wasn't given a choice).

 Needless to say, by the time 5pm rolled around, and not having eaten but a pop tart in 24hrs, I was having a sugar crash. These make you lightheaded, these make it hard to think and respond quickly. I was working my ass off to get greeting cards printed, packaged, priced and all the while walking everyone through how to use our touch-screen computers and simple tasks. 

One customer didn't like that I wasn't answering fast enough. Of course she didn't, it's Black Friday, and that I was being far too rude for her. She told me she didn't like how tired I was, that I shouldn't work at all if I was so tired. How worthless I was to be there, on the busiest day of the year, if I couldn't be bothered to be awake. 

At this point I interrupted her. I told her ""Lady, listen. I don't need this from you, not today. Not the day people die from customers entitlement. No. I've been working since pretty much Noon yesterday. I had to miss my family's Thanksgiving, again, and not only that, I couldn't even EAT any food yet. There's no time. I'm beyond having a sugar crash, I'm hungry, and beyond normal tired. If you're going to sit there and belittle me over this, you can just get out of my face and leave this place"" (or something VERY close to this, been a few years).

Of course I got loud to say this, and everyone looked at her. Associates, customers, even her husband. She tried apologizing, I kept interrupting her asking what else she needed, and she kept trying to change subjects..I wouldn't let her. She was the last straw I needed that day, and I wasn't having it.

Good news though, wasn't reported, wasn't written up. Had a very nice and thoughtful customer buy me a bag of chips and a soda after seeing me be berated by not only her but other customers. Made it home and promptly slept for 15 hours.

adelajoy,15,,15,1rg29x,,73,"I spent two years working at a big warehouse-style grocery store. I worked mostly as a cashier, but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a week.

Most of the crappy moments have all blurred together, but there are a few particular moments that stick out.

This grocery store is the only one in the area that doesn't bag your groceries for you. Each till has two long conveyor belts to hold your groceries while you bag them (Both the customer and the cashier have buttons to move the groceries down, away from the till). This speeds orders up, requires less staff, saves money and drops prices. People occasionally complain about it, but if they want to pay more for their groceries and have someone else bag them, they're welcome to. ... The store isn't exactly famous for customer service, but I think the prices make up for this.

I was one of the fastest cashiers on staff at the time. This meant that my belts would often get full. I had ways to deal with this. I knew how fast people packed, I knew how soon a belt would clear. I was really good at my job. One day, the lines were insanely long, I was working really fast, everyone was buying a lot. I got to a point that there were groceries on both of my belts, so I squeezed the smaller order down a little, watched for a moment, and knew that he would be down before the next order crowded him. I started scanning the next order, and smiled at the customers - a man and his very pregnant wife.

The wife snapped at me, ""Can you just wait!""

""Excuse me?""

""Can you wait? I don't want you to crowd out that other guy!""

I looked, and he was literally loading his last bag with groceries. I stopped scanning anyways, and maybe glared at the lady. I don't really like it when other people tell me how to do my job.

Eventually he was packed and gone, so I started scanning again. While I had been waiting, I had lined all of their canned goods up. I can scan cans super fast if they're all really close. I started scanning the canned goods, grabbing a can, tossing it to my other hand, and setting it on the other belt. Except that this woman had walked around (The belt she got was behind me) and was standing behind me, trying to bag the cans as I scanned them. I'm sorry, but I'm not actually looking where the cans go. I know the space, and I need to watch the computer screen, not my hands. Well, she kept trying to grab the one I'd just set down, which meant that I kept hitting her hand with the next can. I wasn't by any means throwing the cans, but I was moving quickly and she was in my space, so she was getting hit. I didn't actually realize that I was hitting her until she complained to her husband. So I slowed down, apologized, and moved on to her other groceries.

She then had a bag of apples. She had grabbed one of our bags and put three different apples in it, and tied it shut. I have to weigh each type of fruit separately, so I opened the bag, weighed the first apple, set it aside. I noticed her husband grabbed the apple right away. I weighed the second apple, and set it aside. He grabbed that one too. When I weighed the third, my plan had been to put all three back in the bag and tie it shut, but the other two apples were gone. I tied the bag around the last one and set it on the belt. If the husband wanted to pack the apples separately, he was welcome to.

The couple also bought about half a dozen little bags of frozen perogies. One of the bags had been ripped all the open, right down the middle, and frozen perogies were laying all over the belt. I considered not telling them, because I was mad, but I took a deep breath, rounded up all of the stray perogies, put them in a plastic bag, and informed the lady. I asked her if she would like me to send for a new bag. She snippily replied ""Yes"" as if I should have just known. Some people don't bother to get a new bag because it can hold up the line, so I always ask. Our runner quickly returned with an identical bag and I kept going.

When I finally finished (They bought *a lot* of stuff), the husband paid, while the wife stormed over to customer service. I watched as she talked to my supervisor, and eventually a store manager. I was getting pretty nervous. Oh, also I should mention this woman was rude and snapped every time I asked her a question. I was pretty angry by the time they left.

After they were completely done, my supervisor closed my till and asked to speak to me at customer service.

She said the lady had filed a formal complaint against me. Apparently the conversation went something like this:

**Pregnant Lady**: ""I want to complain about the cashier on till 9!""

**Nice Supervisor**: ""Till 9? Do you mean till 8?"" (I was on 9 - one of my quick-to-anger coworkers was on 8)

**PL**: ""No, I mean 9!""

**NS**: ""Like the girl with brown hair, *not* the blonde?""

**PL**: (getting frustrated) ""Yes!""

**NS**: ""So what did adelajoy do?""

**PL**: ""She was rude and short with me!""

**NS**: ""Adelajoy? Are you sure?""

**PL**: ""Yes! She also threw canned goods at me, *ripped* open a bag of perogies, scattered them *everywhere* and scattered all of my apples too! She also bruised all of my fruit because she was throwing them around!""

A store manager was brought down to take a formal complaint, which means it probably went in my employee file. The lady was calmed down and left, and that was the end of it. Typically, the store managers will meet with you to discuss complaints, and make sure they won't happen again. The fact that I didn't means either the manager simply didn't believe the woman, or wasn't concerned because it was my first (and only). The supervisor who helped her said she closed my till because I looked upset and she thought I needed a break. The only reason she told me was to find out what really happened. I told her my side, and she just laughed it off. I admitted to being short and snippy, but the rest was just ludicrous. I still cannot beleive she blamed me for the bag of perogies being ripped open, considering I told her about them, got a new bag, and spent a minute or two picking up all of the perogies. Also, why would I take the time to do that, when I was clearly rushed with everything else?

I get that pregnant women have a lot of hormones, and tend to be angry, short-tempered, whatnot, but I think there's a line. Also, the fact that her husband didn't stop her, stand up for me, or admit to grabbing all the apples kind of pissed me off.

Tl;dr: Crazy-hormones pregnant lady complained about me, but the supervisor didn't believe her.","In my spare time, I like to rip open your groceries and scatter them",88,talesFromRetail
unidentifiableblarg,12,,9,1rhfwt,,65,"**Back story:** I worked in a small convenience store in a town on the outskirts of a city. A lot of the customer's are regulars and have been coming here for years, decades even.

About 6 years ago the place changed hands, names and management too. Still provided the same sort of stuff though, so the locals kept calling it by it's old name. 

This is relevant, I swear.



**The story:** I'm serving on the registers at the front of the store, just doin ma biz, when a flustered woman comes up to the counter demanding my attention. I tell her I'll be with her as soon as I finish processing my currant customer.

This somehow seemed to offended her, so I was already off to a bad start. But I get to her and try to smooth things over with my best customer service voice (you know the one).

After a bit of just listening to her complaining and bitching in general she finally gets to the point.

""I bought this product here earlier and you (not me) charged me the wrong price! It's on special, why is it wrong blah blah blah""

The outrage was dripping off her.

Now, normally I'd be prepared to fix this, sometimes we just straight up get it wrong and stuff isn't the right price.

*But*, while she's ranting she's waving around a catalogue, that contains the magical special that we failed to give her.

Eventually she shoves it in my face to accent a point, and shows me what it should have been.

The catalogue wasn't for our store, we don't even sell the brand (ice cream, I think it was) that she seemed to have thought she purchased.

I politely explain that we're not an [old store] any more and that was why she didn't get the discount. But I'd be happy t...

Her: What?! I've lived her FOR YEARS and it's always been [old store]. You've got to be kidding me.

I point out the signs (they're everywhere) and shirts of the employees and explain that we've been [new store] for quite a while.

She persists though, demanding to get her discount because it's ""always been that way and why should I get screwed for what you did..."" just generally giving me a hard time; that kind of bullshit.

The managers will usually give the discount to them anyway, just to keep them happy, but I was sick of getting abused by people who apparently can't read and wasn't about to let this one fly. Pety, I know.

Eventually I get to the point where I'm just repeating myself and she's adamantly refusing to be 'robbed' of forty cents. So I call my manager to come up.

By this stage I'm sick of her shit and just want her to leave, customers are waiting to be served and I'm meant to be serving. Small store, small number of staff.

Finally my duty manager meanders up and he immediately grovels at her feet, begging her forgiveness and taking her to a spare register to sort out her problem. 


I'm not bitter (lies), but the smug grin she threw me on her way out made me really wish that our management stood up for us, at least sometimes.

And that I had a crowbar handy.

CommandoDerp,9,,17,1rhsfa,,62,"First off, I would like to say that I had two days off before this incident so I was unaware of any changes at work.

So I was at work after two days off when I was serving an elderly man, who was a regular, cigarettes. He asked for a particular brand in a carton of twin packs. I tell him unfortunately that the twin packs are classified as cartons themselves, and you cannot purchase a carton of a carton. He rolled his eyes and asked for 4 individual twin packs.

I immediately check the cupboard nearby of said twin packs of cigarettes that he wanted and I inform him that we are all sold out. This is the conversation that follows:

Him: ""Are you serious?""
Me: ""Yes, sorry. We are unfortunately all sold out until we get some more.""
Him: ""This is pathetic!""
Me: ""Would you like another flavor?""
He mumbles something to me which I repeat my previous question.
Me: ""Would you like another flavor?""
Him: ""No. This unacceptable. You are refusing sale""
Me: ""Is there anything else I can help you with as we don't seem to have what you are after?""
Him: ""I would like to speak to your manager.""
Me: ""Actually there might be some here""

I had a thought and I turned around and checked the display rack to see if there are any more in the display. To which I found 4 individual twin packs sitting there, I felt like an idiot not checking there first.

Me: ""I didn't realize that there was any in the display, I...""
Him: ""Your very lucky""
Me: ""I'm very sorry I did not check there first. I recently had two days off and I wasn't informed that what you were after was in the display. I'm sorry for any unconvinced""

He just sighs loudly and rolls his eyes and tells me one last thing while paying for his cigarettes.

Him: ""Your very lucky you found them or otherwise you would have lost hundreds and hundreds of dollars in sales and quite a few hundred customers because of your poor service.""

Payment is finished and I tell him I'm sorry again and to enjoy his night. He storms back into the store and complains to another staff member who was not in charge for the night.

The man left and the employee approached me asking what happened. I told them and they said not to worry, they knew it wasn't on purpose. The actual supervisor for the night approached me and asked what happened, they knew it wasn't intentional so they didn't seem too phased by it; even though I was the back up person in charge that night.","I don't know how to feel after my ""complaint""?",79,talesFromRetail
Drunken_Black_Belt,7,,8,1rhw8z,,59,"I'm back bitches!  About 2 months ago, I got a second job working part time at a men's Big &amp;Tall store.  The hours are easy, commision is alright, and to be honest, the customers are generally friendly and awesome.  It helps that a lot of them don't have anywhere else to shop. Unfortunantly the store isn't as eventul as my past retail jobs.  Its just selling clothes and shoes.  But I've gotten a few funny stories that I'll share over time here. And with the holiday's coming up, i'm sure I'll have plenty more.  

Welll, for your pleasure (hopefully), I present **Boy, Are My Feet Sore!**

**WARNING: GROSS!**

So recently I began working in a men's store for Big &amp; Tall sizes.  I knew of it because I buy my shoes there.  Only store that carries a size 15/16.  I am too small for the clothes, despite being 6'4 and slightly overweight.  And if I'm being honest,  seeing some of the people who come in makes me more motivated to keep losing weight (50 lbs this year alone).  

Now, don't get me wrong, SOME of the people have legitimate health concerns.  One gentleman was born with his left foot backwards.  During his childhood they would constantly have to break his foot, set it slightly closer to the proper position, let it heal, and repeat. But it never set 100% correct, keeping him from being able to run or exercise, or even stand for long periods of time.  It's guys like him I feel for.  Given a shitty deal in life and just having to suffer for it. 

Most customers, however, are just plain old fat guys.  I don't want to sound mean, or ""fat shame"".  But it's just poor lifestyle choices and such.  I was there.  I was 5lbs shy of 300 last new years.  And it was just being lazy and making bad choices.  I don't have as much sympathy for these guys.  And that brings us to our story today.

It's a sunny fall day.  It's midweek, and pretty dead.  I'm in my suit, fixing clothes, putzing around, pretty much just pretending to work.  I hear the door chime, and in walks an older couple.  Probably late 60's, very early 70's.  The lady was using a walker to move around, and the gentleman was resting his weight on a cane as he slowly moved with her.  They seemed like a nice enough couple, but as you know, those are the ones who always turn into assholes.

I introduced myself, asked how I could help them that day.  The man gruffly replied ""shoes"".  I brought them to the shoe department.  Now my store is small, and there is only one small bench to sit on, and it's in the shoe department.  Naturally, this oaf takes the seat, leaving his frail wife to stand.  I could tell she was having difficulty, being particularly petire and frail, so I went in the back and got her a folding chair to sit in next to her husband.  She thanked me, because manners.  The man, charming fellow that he was, just said ""can you get me some shoes now?"".  

It was about this time that I realized this was going to go south faster than a my ex g/f in a dick sucking contest.

I offered several suggestions, as the gentleman didn't seem to know what kind of shoes he wanted.  The man complained that most of our shoes don't even fit him. I expressed sympathy, as I have large feet and can only fit into the largest size available in store.  The man looked me up and down and sneered ""Well, you just have big feet. I have a health condition that causes this, so consider yourself lucky"".  

Eventually we found a pair he liked and thought may just fit his feet.  And that's when the real horror of this story starts.  The man then proceeds to roll up his sweatpants.  He was wearing ankle socks and sandals.  His feet are hugely swollen, and covered in open sores.  This guy has diabetes, and it's eating away at his foot.  Sadly it's fairly common where I work.  What came next, however, is not.

I hand him the shoes, and take a step back, giving him some space to put the shoes on, look at them in the mirror, see how they feel, etc.  

NOPE!  

He looks at me like an idiot and says ""Well I can't put them on myself.  I can't bend that far.  Put them on for me"".   

Now I am no fan of feet, even on a good day.  Sure if I'm dating someone, and they want a footrub, and their feet are clean, then i'll oblige.  But other than that, I just want nothing to do with that area of the body.  Add to the fact that we are talking about a stranger whose foot is literally covered in open, oozing sores.  

DBB: Sir I just can't do that, I'm sorry.

Man:  You need to help me.  I'm a customer and I need service.

DBB: There is no way I am doing that sir.  I am sorry but you have open sores on your foot and leg. It's unsanitary for both me and YOU, to have me do that.

Man: Oh just wash your hands after it'll be fine.

How this man survived 70 or so years with logic like that, will forever amaze me.  

DBB: Absolutely not.  

Man: I want the manger!  I'll have your ass for discrimination and harrassment

DBB:  I am the manager.  If you want the store manager call back tomorrow.  If you want corporate's phone number I'll give it with my name gladly.  


The man continued to yell and scream about receiving the shoes at a discount and having me fired.  Typical stuff for anyone who works in retail really.  I essentially told him that I wasn't going to touch his feet, and if he didn't like the service he could leave. Wife is trying to keep the peace.  It's not very effective.  Husband used Rage!  It's inneffective against DBB!  Besides my DEF is to high.  

Anyways, i wish there was some more to this.  Eventually he stormed out as dramatically as one can when you can barely walk under your own weight, and your wife is frail and moves about as fast a christian school girl with a chastity belt.  I did hear from corporate the next day though.  Naturally some of the details were changed when he called in, but once I explained about the sores, I receieve a ""Yea that happens all the time. Don't worry about it"".  

Sorry if it's not very exciting.  I'm sure I'll have some good ones coming up.  Hope you all are surviving the holidays!

Turns out, the woman was making a sizeable purchase and couldn't supply an adequate form of ID. I explained to her that we simply couldn't process her credit card without proper identification. She dug through her purse and tossed a bottle of birth control pills on the counter and was like ""Will this bottle work?

She then threw a world class tantrum using colorful language that would even make a seasoned sailor blush.

I was working in the jewelry department of a department/grocery store at the time. I'd been in that same department for 2 years by the time this incident took place. It was very early on a Saturday, before the rush, and a lady comes up to my counter to do a return. No problemo, I thought.

Me: I can do that return for you. Can I see your receipt ma'am?

Customer: I don't have it anymore. 

Me: I'll only be able to refund it to a gift card then, is that ok?

Customer: yeah, that's fine. 

One hurdle jumped. She hands me the item and I notice that it is in a package I have never seen before. I know my department like the back of my hand cause I'm the one that checks in -all- of the merchandise. Every item that has gone into the department in the last two years had to pass by me first. 

Me: ma'am are you sure you bought this here? I don't recognize this package. 

Customer, suddenly angry: of course I bought it here. (Spoiler, this a lie)

Me: ok, let me see if the system recognizes it. 

I scan the item at the register and I get an error. I look at the barcode and it's half as long as it needs to be (6 characters instead of 12, which is the store norm). 

Me: ma'am my register does not recognize this item. 

Customer: I bought it here!

Me, getting cranky at this point: are you -sure-? I've been in the department for two years and I've never seen this package before. Are you certain you didn't buy this at [dept store x] or [dept store y]?

Customer: I'm certain. I'm returning this for a friend and she bought it here! (Told ya)

Me: I'm sorry but I can't take an Item that doesn't even come up in the system. Especially if you don't have a receipt. 

Customer snatches the item from me and pulls her cell phone out: I am going to call her (the friend) and prove to you that it was bought here!! (She's nearly screaming at this point)

ScaldingSoup,5,,6,1rha57,,26,"So several  years ago I worked for a very popular lingerie store.  This store didn't pay commission, but would give us more or less hours per week based on sales performance.  My sales performance was VERY good.  I got more hours a week than most people.  

During the holiday season, we had a lot of seasonal employees, as any big retail store normally does.  One of the workers hired seasonally was this lady who was a lot older than the rest of us.  This was not the problem.  Her hair was bleached blonde, and growing out (showing obvious roots), and styled in a ""feathered"" fashion.  She did not know how to wear make-up and what she wore did not flatter her.  In this store our dress code was all black.   She wore skirts with no stockings, but with slouch socks and yeah, that was a hot mess.  

People began to call her the ""missing link"", as in to the 1980s because of the hair and her wearing slouch socks that were probably black in the 1980s but grey now.  Reading this, you may think that I judged her based on this, or have some animosity for people older than me.  I do not, but this just sort of describes what she looked like because it is important.  Black Friday rolls around, and she wears her normal dress of skirt, slouch socks and what-not.  Surrounding her socks are these bells that jingle..  

She begins waving panties in the air, helicopter style, like a stripper, chanting what the sale is as customers are passing by.  One of our gay male managers passes me by and mutters so only I can hear it ""I want her out"".  I was dying trying not to laugh at the situation, and meanwhile feeling very embarrassed for her.  Everywhere she walked, she jingled.

Some time during her short career with the lingerie store, she found my phone number on the schedule.  I guess they weren't giving her enough hours, because she had the nerve to leave me a message asking me for some of mine.

**Story (er, stories)**: 

1) I walk by the front door. Man approached with wife, stopped and said Excuse Me? Fine. I go over, and he started counting out a huge wad of cash. He counts $100 in small bills out, gives it to me, then says, ""Now, I want a propane tank, honey..."" 

He got the manager who resembles an NFL player instead. (Yes, I gave him the money back.)

2) Two young guys came through the checkout line with four carts of Head &amp; Shoulders, Dove bars, and some razors, I forgot the brand. This is ***-mart, it's cheap, and that's what matters. Three products. They racked up $1800 in this stuff. The one guy then pulled out of his pocket a pile of coupons that was quite literally a foot high. Mind already blown, I said half-jokingly, ""Those aren't all for me, are they?""

Yes. Yes they were. $1500 in coupons, $3 at a time. Do the math. And you couldn't do coupon repeats. Due to the volume, the *CSM thing came up halfway through, and I said ""Oh, the supervisor's going to have to turn the key..."" and they were all ""Ok, cool.""

So they hand over the remaining $300 cash (and people pay 500-600 all the time-that was normal) and the supervisor sees the key message on the palm pilot. I had every CSM (three on duty), the front end supervisor, two assistant managers, and every loss prevention person in the building (three-two associates &amp; the manager) at the register in what seemed like two seconds. 

The guy who'd had the coupons recognized the front end supervisor. He (coupon guy) went off and started going into it with the supervisor. The friend stands there numb, all the managers start talking at me, a CSM sticks the key in to abort this transaction, and I'm standing here holding $300 cash and a hell's lot of coupons. 

Then:
The customer let out a primal yell, the supervisor took the coupons from me, stuck them in the guy's hand, and wished him a good day-anywhere else. 

Turns out they were known scammers. The coupons would scan, but we can't get money back for them. I knew something was up, but I didn't know the back story. I just was asking myself over and over after this: If it had all gone through, and they'd walked out with $1800 of soap and shampoo, what the hell were they going to do with it all? Sell it at less than cost? Fill a swimming pool? Get ridiculously clean?

While Cee and his dad are looking at the toys, a woman with two children comes into the aisle they are in.  The older of the two, who is about the same age as Cee, sees something she wants and asks her mom for it.  Mom says no.  The little girl begs and pleads but mom holds firm and keeps telling her no.

Cee watches for a few seconds and then walks over to the girl.  He kneels in front of her and says:  ""Well, if you act like that, you really won't get anything.""  And then he walked back to his dad.

Me: Do you have the canceled check?

Customer: No, I threw it in your trash.

Me, cringing: How about a receipt?

Customer: In the gar-bage. What don’t you understand?

Me:  I think I need to transfer you to the Customer Service Desk. Let me just find the number…

Customer: NO, you will NOT! I need the movie about…(another two, three minutes)…now!

Customer: Getting my movie!

Me: I can’t give you a physical object through the phone. Why don’t you come in and see Customer Service?  They should be able to help you.

Customer: …I’ll be there in fifteen minutes. Let me get the kids.

copisreallybad,4,,6,1rhulb,,22,"a few days ago, i get called down to the returns desk from the paint desk. the return policy for the chain i work at is very lenient, but we aren't supposed to take mixed paint back, so already walking down there i had a bad feeling that i would have to get a manager involved (and we all know how incompetent they can be)

so i get there, and to my surprise it's just a regular can of unmixed, white, exterior paint, which *is* returnable without manager involvement. i ask the guy what's wrong with the paint and he says that it's frozen and we need to fix it or give him another can.

i bring the can to the paint desk and open it up. now, imagine what half frozen, hardened paint looks like. that's what this paint looked like, and the following conversation sort of went like this.

me: ""this paint is frozen, did you leave it in the garage or something?""

customer (now visibly irate): ""ABSOLUTELY NOT I BOUGHT IT AND I JUST OPENED IT THIS MORNING AND TO MY SURPRISE IT LOOKS LIKE THIS""

me: ""I'm sorry but we really aren't supposed to take paint like this back, it's useless to us returned""

customer (literally about to pop a blood vessel in his brain at this point): ""WELL MAYBE IF YOU GUYS HAD FUCKING SOLD ME A GOOD CAN OF PAINT IT WOULDNT BE FUCKING FROZEN. I WANT A MANAGER, NOW""

great, this guy knows how to get what he wants. i call a manager and explain the situation to him. the manager, being a typical manager, offers him a plethora of free things, including brushes and a brand new can of paint. the customer walks away with his free things (that i have to get for him) with the smuggiest ass look on his face.

story over, right? nope. i bring the can of paint to receiving, ZMA and hazmat it (since we can't sell it, it's fucking frozen and you can't paint with it). done deal im thinking, right?

not even close, bby. picture a hambeast of a woman. ok, maybe not that big, but she had a hard time fitting inside the reach truck sometimes. she is the department head of receiving. basically she sits in receiving on her computer waiting for trucks to arrive. 

now picture her carrying the frozen can of paint to the desk, except i actually had to see it happen. 

okay, okay, what the fuck is going on, im thinking. maybe i didnt mark it down correctly or something, maybe she'll show me how to hazmat it, i have no idea. im also in the middle of explaining to an older woman the different paint finishes we sell. 

nope, she has the nerve to tell me to just ""stick it in the paint shaker for a minute or two and see if we can try and sell it as OOPS paint."" at this point im all whatthefuck.jpeg, the paint is fucking frozen and shaking it won't help. i try to explain this to her but she would have none of it and walks away, and me, being the lowly, minimum wage paint associate that i am, do as she says. i stick it on the OOPS rack and continue my day.

the story ends when the department head of paint sees it on the OOPS rack, laughs, and takes it to receiving himself to hazmat it.

tl;dr - guy returns 3 year old can of frozen paint, manager gives him free shit, hambeast from receiving thinks that we can still sell it, paint department head saves the day.  ",i work at a home improvement store that sells paint (among other things),28,talesFromRetail

I worked in a a supermarket produce department for about 13 months.  But there was a guy who came in he'd wear a suit and gel his hair to make himself look important, but the only time id see him in my department was sampling my food or outright shoplifting. 
One of the things he'd do would come up to me and say something along the lines of
""Hey Champ, can you cut me a piece of this ""insert fruit here"" , ive heard this batch is extra juicy"" and then once hed taste it hed spit it out and say 
""Yuck thats disgusting, im glad i wasnt going to buy it"" and just storm off. He did this to me quite a few times and hed throw the skin or peel of it onto my displays and I was quite pissed off with all of it. 

He came in and and I recognised him. And the convorsation went as follows. 

Him: Hey Champ, do you mind if I try one of these Mandarins, they seem mighty delicious. 

Me: No you cant

Him: Why the hell not?

Me: Because its shoplifting, you have no intention of buying it, youve done this before you ask if you can try some and say its disgusting then walk off and all youre going to do is peel it, take one bite leave the the rest of the fruit and peel on my display and im not paid to clean up after you and its not a buffet either, what youre doing is taking stuff you havnt paid for, so its actually theft. So no you cant!

He stood there for about 6 seconds trying to think of something to say and all he could muster up was yelling:
Hey I use to work in a fruit store aswell, I know what its like, so deal with it!

And he just walked off, I kept an eye on him too, he didnt buy anything but just walked out the front of the store (giving me an evil eye) and then out the door to the carpark.

He did come back into the store a few days later, but I didnt see him in the produce department again while i was there ( I only did 3pm until Midnight, but he might have come in between 7am and 3pm or while someone else was on) but when I saw him ordering things from the deli hed give me a bitter stare but that was it.

One day, I have a guy come in with a bunch of stuff and some rain cheques. I take them from him and noticed that they're all photocopied. I look at them and notice they have a different store number on them. So, since I can't blatantly say ""I think you faked these"", I made up some policy on the spot. I told him that we couldn't take another stores rain cheques, how we had to have the matching piece of the rain cheque, and that our stores order inventory specifically to cover rain cheques.

A little back story. I actually PAY customers for metal. We are private and can choose what prices we pay for what material etc. We do not have any pricing criteria. The only thing we have to deal with really is the law which is one of the more annoying things. People who steal metal makes it tough for the honest guys who recycle.

I get several customers who come in every day or several times a week (we're open 6 days a week, 9 to 5). 80% of these customers are never ready. We require valid ID for every transaction and though I remember a good amount of people's names, some I don't. Those that know I ask for ID every time never had it ready. While they're standing in line why wouldn't they pull it out of their wallets instead of when they are at the front of the line? Or sign the receipt which is also required by law. I have to ask them EVERY SINGLE TIME. It's very frustrating. I go through the same thing every day and they never learn. I also get several customers who don't even speak English which is also frustrating. How can I ask you for things that are required by law when you don't speak my language?

Anyway, this next story was also from Barschmucks. If I didn't mention before, this was a franchise location inside of a large supermarket. We were technically employees of the supermarket even though we were real certified baristas. But this meant that many of our coworkers were cashiers and stock guys. One of the stock guys was Otis. He was a huuuuuge black dude who didn't converse much when he came by for his free cup of ice water but seemed like a pretty good guy.

I wasn't working when this happened, but my AST (Evan) told me about it. It's dead and he's just cleaning up waiting for the last few stragglers to wander in when Otis cruises up to the counter. Evan asks him what he'd like but Otis doesn't say anything and just stares at the menu. Evan goes back to cleaning while Otis contemplates the meaning of life. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Otis opening up the tea rack and fumbling for a tea bag (already this is a no-no, not only are we the only ones supposed to touch that tea, but we have to use tongs because it goes right in a customer's drink.) 

Evan doesn't have time to say anything before Otis lifts a bag to his nose and takes a deep whiff. 

He goes: ""What is this? Vanilla Rooibos? (He pronounced it ""roo-bis""; it's actually ""roy-bohs"".) Mmmmmmm. If a girl smell like dis, I'd lick her all *up* and down.""

Then, as quickly as he came, he put the tea back back, and left without saying a word. 

Evan dumped out all the Vanilla Rooibos and replaced it (not a big deal, nobody gets it anyway.)

**TL;DR:** Large man sexually assaults a tea bag in the middle of our store and left my coworker to clean up the mess.

j-sap,3,,5,1rigon,,17,"Some back story: I work the front desk at a gym a couple of days a week after class. We specialize in helping people with injuries and have a very specialized staff, program, and equipment. We are attached to an apartment complex that is spread out over a couple of buildings. The laundry for the complex is in the building adjacent to us. Now to use the laundry machines you are required to use a proprietary card that has to be purchased from a machine. I don't know what someone was smoking one day but instead of putting the machine that dispenses and allows people to add money to there card next to the laundry machines (even though there is plenty of room), someone decided to put the machine in the lobby of the gym. 

Where I work I have a very large window that overlooks the parking lot and see everyone who comes and goes and where people park. I had someone park or fly in the handicap spot (we'll call him Scumbag Steve or SS to keep things simple). SS jumps out of the car and runs full sprint into the lobby to add money onto his laundry card. After a minute or so I hear a knock on the window and we a quick interaction that goes like this:

SS: ""Hey yo man you got change for a $20?""

Now I absolutely do have the change for this guy in my drawer but if I used it then I would not have any for transaction at my desk.

Me: ""Sorry.""

SS: ""Yo man what about in your wallet, I know you can personally make me change?""

Now I am taken aback a little from this second question and am smart enough to never take out personal items around customers or even let them know where personal things are. I take a couple of seconds to think about everything and then respond.

Me: ""No I don't, but we have a great physical therapy program if you are interested.""

SS: ""Man why would I be interested in physical therapy, I am as fit as a horse?""

Me: ""Because you parked in a handicap spot and those spots are almost always full of clients.""

SS just sort of gave me a defeated look and slinked out the door and back to his car. He was back 20-30 minutes later and was good enough to not park in the handicap spot, instead he pulled up to the curb and made people walk around his vehicle.

adelajoy,0,,1,1ri8kg,,22,"I spent two years working at a big warehouse-style grocery store. I worked mostly as a cashier, but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a week.

Most of the crappy moments have all blurred together, but there are a few particular moments that stick out.

I realize this isn't the craziest story on here, but I will probably never forget this lady. 

Backstory: Our store had a policy that if an item scanned differently than the price tag, the customer would get it for free, up to $10. The mistake happened because the price tag didn't get changed, or was misplaced. If they spotted a problem, we would go look. If we found a tag in front of their item with the same code and a different price, we gave it to them and changed the tag. If the tag was for a different item, they didn't get anything. 

I was working the customer service desk, and a lady stormed up. I had several customers on the go at the moment, but it was pretty clear she *needed* help right away. As soon as I could, I asked what I could help her with. She was holding a bottle of toilet cleaner, her receipt and a price tag. Let's call her Crazy Customer, CC for short.

**CC**: ""I bought this bottle of toilet cleaner, but it was the wrong price! You guys are trying to charge me too much!""

**Me**: ""Okay, can I see your receipt?""

**CC**: *Hands me the receipt.* ""I tried to tell the cashier, but she didn't believe me!""

**Me**: *I checked who her cashier was, and it was one of our long-time girls. She knew the policy. There was no way she ""didn't believe"" the customer.* ""Okay, so the price came up $3.99, I'll just send a price-checker out to see what the tag said.""

**CC**: ""Oh, I grabbed the price tag already."" *She hands me the price tag. This lady is pretty worked up,  I'm not sure if she just wants to get out of the store, or if she's trying to pull one on me.*

A policy was that the tag had to be on the shelf. If a customer brings it to you, who's to say they didn't take it off the shelf last week and save it? They also could have found it in the wrong place, somewhere that the stock employees wouldn't have checked to fix the tag. As with most stores I've been to, store policy is to inform the customer about the relative store policies, and then see if you can help them anyways. No matter the problem.

It study the tag, and inform her of the policy, that the tag would have to be on the shelf. I start to let her know I can contact a manager, but she snatches the tag back and interrupts me.

**CC**: ""Well if that's your policy, I'll just put it back on the shelf! I was trying to save you some goddamn work, but I guess if you guys want to work extra, I'll just go put it back!""

She took off before I could say anything. I was just standing at the desk, aghast. I didn't even know what to say. 

The supervisor that was on shift was the scary kind. You know, the kind that isn't afraid to yell a little, handles the worst customers, and isn't phased when people call her names. Let's call her Jane. When the woman was gone, I grabbed Jane and told her the whole story. She said, ""Okay. When she comes back, let me know who she is. I'll handle her.""

As soon as I saw the customer coming back, I hissed, ""Jane! Jane! Jane! White hat! That's her."" I then ducked behind the display at customer service, and quite actually hid back there until the customer was gone. I could hear her yelling at Jane. I don't know what the verdict was. Any other manager, and the customer would have gotten the item for free, but it's hard to say with Jane.

I remember one of my coworkers came around the display and exclaimed my name. I hushed them, and told them I was hiding. I was so afraid the woman would see me and do one of those, ""Her! That's the one I was talking to! She told me this!"" And drag me back into it.

I've never hid from a customer before or since. Oh! Fun fact: The price tag she was holding said $3.29, a $0.70 difference from what she paid, and the tag was dated for the week before, which means it wasn't the current price. Not to say it wasn't still on the shelf, but there is a chance she did save it and bring it back in, especially with how worked up she was.

Dannythegirl,5,,6,1rh77t,,7,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this but I needed to share. Long time lurker of this subreddit. On my phone, sorry for wall. 
I am a customer in this story, but former multi-year service/retail employee.
Today, I was grocery shopping with my two very little children. Not a huge chain store, but prominent in my state for supporting local foods. Many locations. 
I got in line to check out after an eventful and frustrating trip around the store with the kids. There was an elderly man checking out ahead of me. He was friendly and talkative to my kids and was asking me about my tattoos while we were waiting. The cashier was probably 55, spacey, but very sweet woman. When it was old guys turn to check out, I overheard their conversation at the register, and it was obvious they were both long time veterans to the store. 
The man had some trouble checking out. He rang his credit card through the machine multiple times while chatting with the cashier and he seemed confused. Eventually, she explained that he didn't have to keep swiping his card, and that his transaction was complete. In the mean time, she was scanning my items. 
The cashier chatted up a storm with me too. Asking about my kids while I was trying to wrangle them. I was getting a little impatient at this point because my 1 and 3 year old were ready to get the hell out of there, but I listened to her stories with patience. She was kind too.
When she finished scanning my food I pulled my card out to run through the machine, but it was asking for a signature, when I hadn't scanned my card yet. 
Me: ""there must be a mistake, I haven't slid my card through but it's already asking for a signature""
Cashier: ""no, you did, you must have forgot"" -looks at screen- ""you swiped your America express""
Me: ""No, I don't have an Amex, see?.. Oh no did the man in front of me swipe his card while you were ringing me up?""
Cashier: ""uh oh, that must have been what happened""
She looked panicked, but printed the receipt and said ""I'll just do this"" AND SIGNED THE RECEIPT
Cashier: ""He'll be okay, he can be so spacey. Don't even worry about it""
She at first folded up the receipt like she was going to trash it but I asked her if that was really ok, and that I could wait for a manger. She unfolded the receipt and told me not to worry. There was a long line behind me and frankly I was ready to get the fuck out of there with my crazy kids. I asked her ""are you sure? I feel uncomfortable"" 
She told me not to worry, and to go ahead and leave. And I did. 
I think her career might have ended today.
TLDR; Elderly man in line ahead of me accidentally paid for my groceries, cashier eventually realized but didn't give a fuck to fix it. I got free groceries :/

EDIT/UPDATE: I can see how it looks like I was unsympathetic in my post. I was in fact, horrified. I know the groceries weren't free, I just did not pay for them. In my car, I wrote down the time, my total $78.43 and what I thought the mans total was before me $43, and the name of the cashier. I should have stuck around and put my foot down but I was flustered and unsure how to proceed.  I was planning on calling when I got home, and totally forgot about the whole thing until I was in bed redditing from my phone late at night.
This morning I called and spoke with a manager, giving him all of my information. I told him I would happily come back and pay for the groceries and to please make sure the man did not actually get charged (hoping the cashier took the issue to the manager after I left). He said he will look into the receipts from last night and give me a call back. I will update again when I hear from him.

On to the story:

One of my favorite cashier's (seriously, she's so sweet and helpful. I always drop what I'm doing to answer her questions because she's one of the three that I trust) calls me over for a price check on a set of plates. Customer says they were $29.99, but when I go check they're $49.99. She says that's fine and she pays for them. Done and over, right?

Wrong.

About ten minutes later she comes over to my podium. I already know she's getting coal from me in her stockings (merry Christmas bitch).

Her- ""I was just over there looking at the plates again. They were there just in the wrong spot.""

Me- ""I'm sorry ma'am, I'll let an associate know so he can fix it. I'm a little busy to get to it."" Which I was, I was getting five different change orders ready.

Her- ""Isn't it your job to fix it?""

Me- ""actually no it's not. I'm the front end manager. There are two managers who work in that area, it's actually their job technically. If I would've seen the plates,I would've put them in the right spot.""

Her- ""So you're just a lazy asshole.""

Ok, I'm done. I talk to everyone in a civil manner, but when they take that tone with me, I'm done.

Me- ""yep""

Her- ""You're not going to fix it?""

Me- ""Nope, too lazy right now.""

This was followed by more angry questions and statements until I walked away to deliver my change orders. She tracked an assistant manager down and let him have it about my attitude. He's a pretty cool guy, came up to me later, asked what the deal was and just laughed when I told him. Now he always asks if I'm lazy today when he sees me.

I think I just stood there looking at him for a moment. He had an Italian accent so I was thinking I may have misheard him, and asked for his order again. He held his hand out and insisted to see mine.

Now, this guy didn't look creepy or scary or anything. If so I would have just bolted. But I was 17 and put on the spot so I gave him my hand.

It was a pretty good job, and I got to have as much free soda as I wanted, since I was in the concessions booth. I had to set out prizes, read tickets to see how many points a kid had, tell them how much each prize was (They could mix and match), then calculate how many points they had left as they chose. They'd choose their prizes, I'd hand it to them, and they'd leave. 

I had a friend of mine with me for the first hour, and we split the customers when it got busy. (Around 5 people at the same time.) At one point I spilled my soda, and she handled the crowd as I cleaned up the mess.

Then she left. Oh god.

I was left to set out prizes for display, serve customers, and translate kid-speak by myself. At some points I was so swamped with customers that I could barely figure out the total points for each kid as they got prizes.

Another girl came it at low tide, but left before it got busy again. (Around twenty minutes.) I wasn't allowed to leave my station to try and find her, so I had to deal with all the customers alone. (She wasn't actually allowed to leave either, but she gave zero fucks. Bitch.)

Scott5114,0,,3,1riony,,13,"I've met a lot of strange customers in my time at the casino. This guy takes the cake as the most fucked-up, unpleasant guy that's ever darkened our doorstep. We'll call him Dick because he is one.

To begin with, Dick is in the casino for a fucked-up reason. He's dying of cancer, or some other terminal disease. He spends his last days in our casino trying to win an inheritance for his children. Of course, mathematics says it's not going to happen, so he's squandering what money he does have and the remainder of his life sitting in a smoky room with no natural light playing $25 per spin on a slot machine. 

I wouldn't judge him so harshly for that if he wasn't a colossal asshole. Pretty much everyone who has had to pay a jackpot for him has some sort of unpleasant experience to share. Mine was when I was processing a jackpot for him and I go to clear the jackpot message from the screen. See, if you win, say, $1500, and you had $80 in credit when you hit it, when the attendant clears the jackpot your $80 will still be left on the machine. People sometimes forget or don't know this, and will leave the money on the machine and walk away, so after clearing it most of us will say ""You still have $80 left on the machine."" Of course, when I mention this to Dick, he flies into a rage, screaming ""I CAN SEE THAT! GOD!"" I started dodging his jackpots when I knew where he was playing after that—I don't put up with that sort of BS—though I still had to pay him out a couple of times after that because I didn't realize who it was. 

And Dick did hit a lot of jackpots. He would usually destroy the copy of the W2-G tax forms we would give him, I guess thinking since he's dying he won't need to worry about paying taxes, though you would think he would realize his kids would be on the hook for all of it. He also had the tendency to swear ambiguously so you never really knew whether he was calling the machine or you a piece of shit. Management had talked to him a couple of times about treating the attendants better. He did tip the bare minimum to not be considered an ass in that department, at least.

All of that is backstory to properly put in context what happened this week. At this point, Dick's managed to piss off enough attendants that most of the shift is dodging his calls, so it takes him probably twice as long to get someone over there than it would anyone else. This, coupled with the fact that he's losing heavily, pisses him off. 

Management gets called over to a machine in my section. I'm generally pretty curious about these things, so I head over there. The machine's touchscreen (retail price quoted to me by a tech as $700 or so) is totally shattered. The machine still has $20 on it—with an inoperable touchscreen, there's no way to cash that out on this machine. There's a patron further down the bank who saw the whole thing. Said the guy was losing, got pissed, punched the screen, threw a piece of paper down, and stormed off. One of the managers that showed up picks up the paper.

It's a torn-up W2-G with Dick's name, address, and social security number on it. A little bit of searching in the computers turns up copies of his driver license and the hotel room he is in. And of course the whole incident is caught on tape.

We don't know what happened to Dick after that. Apparently it became the responsibility of the casino's assistant general manager, and she isn't talking. We're all watching the usual locations for ban notices to go up, though.",The worst casino patron in the world,16,talesFromRetail

Part Three – Citizen Snips (Aka - The Pants Aquatic)



As a recap for those of you who have never read one of my stories before – I am a male in the midwest who is on the wrong side of his twenties and works retail loss prevention for a major retailer (one of the 'Big 5').  I am underpaid for what I do but enjoy my job none the less.  A majority of my time is spent wandering the floor or watching middle aged moms shop for clothing far too skimpy on them via CCTV (closed circuit television or 'security cameras').  Every once in awhile I get a case that is just so mind blowingly 'WTF' that I have to share.  

This story opens up with me doing just as I said above – watching people on CCTV.  It is a blisteringly cold afternoon so the customers, far more content to stay in their warm homes and snuggled beneath their blankets, are few and far between.  I, as the ever watchful hawk of justice that I am, was busy playing a Marvel version of Candy Crush Saga.  My job provides me the liberty of slacking off a good amount and my boss is rather lenient as long as I continue to bring in a good amount of stops per month.  I am sitting there diligently trying to match up small colored tiles with one another when I am startled by a sudden ring – the phone is going off!  

Now the phone going off is common place.  We get tons of calls a day ranging from the frozen dairy department calling to tell us a temperature alarm is going off (we know...it goes off for us as well) to people asking us to deactivate a door alarm (we also know...we see you standing at the door).  This happened to be a call from one of the few places that doesn't call us often – the meat department.  The guy on the other end, a tall black man with more muscle than he knows what to do with, calls to tell us that there is a guy standing in front of the freshly butchered meat.  The guy has refused any help the meat employee has offered and continues to say he is 'just browsing' for over ten minutes.  This strikes me as rather odd.  Who just hangs out around the meat department?  I quickly devise a plan for the situation.  I tell the employee to walk into the back so I could see just what the person was going to do.  

The employee hangs up and walks over to the man to let him know he is going to be into the back and to ring the bell if he needs anything.  No sooner than when he had walked into the back but the man glanced around and then walked behind the counter.  My adrenaline already began to rush as my suspicions came to fruition – he was going to steal!  “Oh shit here we go, ” I declared, only to watch in confusion and frustration as he walked right past all the glass displays full of meat and right over to the lobster tank.  Now if you aren't familiar with these tanks they are exactly just what the name implies – a water filled tank full of live lobsters we sell by the pound.  Their claws are bound and they just kind of hang out crawling all over one another.  Kids love to sit there and watch them.

“No way...is he really going to...” I whispered as I watched on in awe.  Sure enough he reached right into the live lobster display tank we have.  After a moment of 'fishing around' he plucked the lobster he wanted from the tank and pulled it out of the water.  Before I could even make heads or tails of the situation he glanced around once more and shoved the lobster right down the front of his pants.  The guy, whom shall be hence forth called Lobster Johnson, then proceeded to shuffle run his way out of the meat department and through the grocery department towards the front of the store.  The only way I can really describe how he ran was a forward version of Zoidberg's shuffle.  All he was missing was yelping out “Woop woop woop woop!” loudly as he went.  

Needless to say he wasn't too hard to stop.  I may not be in the best shape of my life but I can still move quicker than a guy with a large lobster squirming around in his pants.  He didn't fight me at the door or even try to argue what he was doing.  After all, it is kind of hard to argue that you aren't stealing when you have a large, lobster shaped bulge in your pants.

Bonus icing on top of the cake: I usually ask the person why they are stealing.  It usually won't change anything but it fulfills my curiosity and keeps them talking which usually calms them down a bit.  This guy tried to say that he was stealing the lobster for his kids...

tankenka,5,,9,1rgfao,,0,"I work for a phallic retailer with lots of balls. (hehehe)

I decided to go get some water during my shift the other day so I headed towards our water fountain, which happens to be down a narrow hallway and is between the bathrooms and is opposite the hallway from our offices/breakroom area.  As I come around a corner in said hallway I almost bump into our Store Manager (SM from here on out) who is in the middle of cleaning the bathrooms.  SM and I start chatting and from the men's room I hear some loud noises.

""What the hell was that?"" I ask

""Damn kids screwing around."" SM replies as he sets down the bag of trash he had been holding and walks over to the men's room.

Now, SM isn't a particularly tall guy, but he lifts weights quite a bit and could very well be described as being jacked.  Somehow, from time to time, people think it is a good idea to fight him, so I stuck around in case he needed backup.

SM opens the men's room door hard, slamming it into the wall and bellows, ""What the HELL are you doing in my bathroom?""

--inaudible reply--

""Yeah, well it is a pretty sad day when I have to kick someone out of the bathroom, now get the hell out."" SM says at a slightly reduced volume.

""B..But my stomach hurts."" says a meek voice from inside the bathroom.

Then at a normal volume, but with a tone of voice that sounded like SM had ice in his veins he replies, ""Carry it somewhere else.""  Then he stared into the bathroom in a manner that was somewhat intense.

With that the teens walked out of the store with their heads hung in shame.

HawaiianNoHam,4,,8,1rhi3l,,0,"I generally enjoy the stories I hear in TFR but I've come across a few that read like the shower fantasies of disgruntled workers. 

So a humble request. If it's fiction, put a tag in. Fiction is good, fiction is healthy, fiction is what makes us love Clerks, Dogma, and Catching Fire. It's what makes /u/rambles_off_topic my favorite novelty account.

But hearing the restaurant robbery scene from Pulp Fiction told as truth just ruins the story for me. Maybe just a [story] tag to let us know you're improving your imaginative skills.

There's no rule against fiction in this subreddit (I checked), so this is just a personal request. 

Thanks.",[META] Fiction is a buzzkill,5,talesFromRetail
