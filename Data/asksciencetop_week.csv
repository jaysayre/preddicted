YouRackaDisciprine,3,0,1r6tl1,2,It seems like as time passes DNA polymerase genes that make fewer and fewer errors are likely to become more common since they will more faithfully copy their own genes Obviously there is some baseline level of fidelity necessary for reproduction but a completely error free polymerase will not allow for any adaptation at all Is there an optimal error rate for evolution This question cant be answered without further qualification since it is not clear what exactly is being optimized ie evolution does not have a goal but Id like to hear your thoughts My real question is this Do all species ultimately reach some evolutionary plateau or at least approach it asymptotically as the fidelity of the DNA replication system approaches  Note Im aware that DNA copying relies on various proteins besides just DNA polymerase to copy genes but that doesnt really matter Ultimately there is some system of proteins that replicates DNA and their overall fidelity will tend to increase with time ,Does the genetic mutation rate level off with time,2

BackThatThangUp,1,0,1r6lk9,2,Hi allMy understanding as a layperson is that casein is the component in milk that helps to counteract the capsaicin that causes the hotness of spicy foods  It apparently does this by surrounding the fatty capsaicin molecule and dragging it away from the taste buds in much the way that soap surrounds and then pulls away grease Im curious if a solution containing a significant amount of isolated casein would do a better job of pulling away the capsaicin on the tongue and tastebuds or if milk already happens to contain the maximum effective amount of casein for that purpose Would it be effective enough to justify bothering with it Also would there be any drawbacks to a solution containing so much casein such as toxicity Would it be effective as a gargling solution like Listerine for spicy foods if that was the case,Would a solution containing a significant amount of casein do a more effective job of soothing the burn one experiences when eating spicy foods than an equivalent amount of milk,2

nygration,11,23,1qt7qr,29,I understand how freezing point depression works with the salt ions disrupting ice crystal lattice formation However when Im looking at pages for homemade ice cream they say that adding salt allows for the mixture to be below the freezing point of water While I can see that adding salt to the ice will melt some of the ice and water will allow for more heat transfer from the cream to the brine than just ice alone I dont see how the temperature can be reduced below  C There is nothing colder around it to remove heat from the mixture and everything around it is warmer and will be adding heat to the brine  How does the brine become colder than  C,Using freezing point depression how does adding salt to ice  C reduce the temp to lt C or does it,52
