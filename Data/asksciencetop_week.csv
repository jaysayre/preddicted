fencepost,7,1,1rgu88,3,I just started reading The Dragons of Eden and I found this paragraph very strangeQuoteThe information content of any message is usually described in units called bits which is short for binary digits The simplest arithmetical scheme uses not  digits as we do because of the evolutionary accident that we have ten fingers but only two  and  Thus any sufficiently crisp question can be answered by a single binary digit or  yes or no If the genetic code were written in a language of two letters rather than four letters the number of bits in a DNA molecule would equal twice the number of nucleotide pairs But since there are four different kinds of nucleotides the number of bits of information in DNA is four times the number of nucleotide pairs Thus if a single chromosome has five billion  x   nucleotides it contains twenty billion  x   bits of informationEnd QuoteIt seems to me that if the genetic code where written in a two letter alphabet instead of four the number of bits of information associated with a DNA molecule consisting n nucleotide pairs would be n not n Each letter would provide a single bit of information Since the there are actually four letters in the genetic code however each letter represents two bits of information and the number of bits associated with a DNA molecule of n nucleotide pairs would be n Thus if a single chromosome has  billion nucleotides Im assuming this means nucleotide PAIRS if it means actual nucleotide bases the error is even worse the chromosome contains  billion bits of information not Am I just misreading this or do you guys agree that there is an error here I would hate to think that such a well known book by such a famous author had such an obvious mistake in it but thats what it looks like to me Any commentary,Has Carl Sagan made an information theory mistake here or am I just misunderstanding something,4,askscience

YouRackaDisciprine,4,1,1r6tl1,1,It seems like as time passes DNA polymerase genes that make fewer and fewer errors are likely to become more common since they will more faithfully copy their own genes Obviously there is some baseline level of fidelity necessary for reproduction but a completely error free polymerase will not allow for any adaptation at all Is there an optimal error rate for evolution This question cant be answered without further qualification since it is not clear what exactly is being optimized ie evolution does not have a goal but Id like to hear your thoughts My real question is this Do all species ultimately reach some evolutionary plateau or at least approach it asymptotically as the fidelity of the DNA replication system approaches  Note Im aware that DNA copying relies on various proteins besides just DNA polymerase to copy genes but that doesnt really matter Ultimately there is some system of proteins that replicates DNA and their overall fidelity will tend to increase with time ,Does the genetic mutation rate level off with time,2,askscience

BackThatThangUp,1,1,1r6lk9,1,Hi allMy understanding as a layperson is that casein is the component in milk that helps to counteract the capsaicin that causes the hotness of spicy foods  It apparently does this by surrounding the fatty capsaicin molecule and dragging it away from the taste buds in much the way that soap surrounds and then pulls away grease Im curious if a solution containing a significant amount of isolated casein would do a better job of pulling away the capsaicin on the tongue and tastebuds or if milk already happens to contain the maximum effective amount of casein for that purpose Would it be effective enough to justify bothering with it Also would there be any drawbacks to a solution containing so much casein such as toxicity Would it be effective as a gargling solution like Listerine for spicy foods if that was the case,Would a solution containing a significant amount of casein do a more effective job of soothing the burn one experiences when eating spicy foods than an equivalent amount of milk,2,askscience
