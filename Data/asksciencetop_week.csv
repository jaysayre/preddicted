Naturally he chose the heavier one, and since at this weight air resistance wasn't an issue, much learning occurred. I explained that gravity pulls on EVERYTHING the same amount. Everything would fall at the same speed.

But eventually came the rock-vs-feather and rock-vs-paper and of course, in the atmosphere, paper loses to rock (we did not test scissors).  The paper lost, I explained that it was the shape of the paper, catching the air, which was effectively pushing back against it.

So THEN came book-vs-paper, and book won handily.  He rightfully pointed out that the book and the sheet of paper are the same shape.  I said the weight of the book was pulling it more effectively through the air, and he reminded me that my claim was that regardless of the weight of the object, it would fall at the same speed.

Which, of course, is true.  So in his mind, it's not the shape because they're both rectangular things, and it's not the weight because I say it's not...

If it's not a bird, complex carbohydrate consumption seems to be opportunistic instead of a dietary staple. I think pigs seems to be okay with a starchy diet.

The only studies I know concern corn-fed cows, in which the trade-off is from grass to corn.

So nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. And the closer something does travel to the speed of light, the slower time goes relative to that object. Is this correct? So theoretically, if something travels faster than the speed of light, this object would travel back in time. I was hoping someone could explain to me why light and time are directly related.

I believe my confusion arises because I find myself comparing light to sound. For example, if someone fires a gun, it takes time before that sound reaches you. If you outrun the sound, you will not hear the gunshot for a second, but it doesn't mean the gunshot never happened.

Why is it different for light? Using a similar example, if a star explodes, it takes time before that light reaches you. I would assume that if you outran the light, it would only mean that you wouldn't see that happen for a bit, and not that you were outrunning the event itself.

I am be no means a scientist, neither am I sure my question is supposed to be in this sub, but I thought I give it a shot.

While looking up some information on power plants and power consumption I got intrigued by some numbers:

The Jiangxia Tidal Power Plant, China's largest tidal power plant, produces 6,5 GWh annually(according to my ever faithful source, Wikipedia). However, according to that same faithful source, China's average power demand is 18,608 KWh/capita. So far, so good.

Now looking at the closest city to the Jiangxia Tidal Power Plant is Taizhou (Zhejiang province). This city has 5.87 million inhabitants. But while doing my Excel stuff, I calculated that the power plant only generates power for about 350,000 people!

Is there something wrong with my sources, does the world's 4th largest tidal power plant only supply power for a measly 350,000 people or am I just totally not understanding how to calculate poer generation vs consumption?

Quote------------------------------------------

The information content of any message is usually described in units called bits, which is short for ""binary digits."" The simplest arithmetical scheme uses not 10 digits (as we do because of the evolutionary accident that we have ten fingers) but only two, 0 and 1. Thus any sufficiently crisp question can be answered by a single binary digit--0 or 1, yes or no. If the genetic code were written in a language of two letters rather than four letters, the number of bits in a DNA molecule would equal twice the number of nucleotide pairs. But since there are four different kinds of nucleotides, the number of bits of information in DNA is four times the number of nucleotide pairs. Thus if a single chromosome has five billion (5 x 10^9 ) nucleotides, it contains twenty billion (2 x 10^10 ) bits of information.

End Quote------------------------------------------

It seems to me that if the genetic code where written in a two letter alphabet instead of four, the number of bits of information associated with a DNA molecule consisting n nucleotide pairs, would be n, not 2n. Each letter would provide a single bit of information. Since the there are actually four letters in the genetic code however, each letter represents two bits of information, and the number of bits associated with a DNA molecule of n nucleotide pairs would be 2n. Thus if a single chromosome has 5 billion nucleotides (I'm assuming this means nucleotide PAIRS; if it means actual nucleotide bases the error is even worse) the chromosome contains 10 billion bits of information not 20.

* I understand what happens when the limit is smaller than 1 (every element of the series is smaller than the previous by a factor L, hence the series tend to stabilize and converge).

I'm wondering what does it mean when the limit equals 1 and [the test is inconclusive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_test#Inconclusive_because_L.3D1).

Slowly but divergent.

I assume it means the ratio gets *close* to 1, but if it's ever so slightly less or more than 1, that throws the series behavior into the two cases listed above. The only case i can think of where the limit AND term-by-term magnitude ratio are dead-on 1 is when you have every term of the series equal to any other. But it is obvious that if you add together the same finite number infinite times you get infinite and thus the series diverge.

a) Getting close to a huge mass (in this case ignoring the MASSIVE doses of radiation you'd take orbiting a supermassive black hole)

b) Going really really really really fast. In this case the ship got up to .99c and slowed down significantly. This protects anything on the ship from going faster than light relative to the universe.

As I understand it, the observable universe is made up of everything that is within our 'past light cone'. But the universe is expanding at an increasing rate, the more distant the object the faster it is moving away from us, and at the threshold of the observable universe space is effectively becoming more distant from us at the speed of light (and objects outside the observable universe are presumably becoming more distant at greater than the speed of light).

So does this mean that over time, observable objects (galaxies etc.) which are right at the edge of the observable universe will eventually pass the 'observable' threshold, will be moving from us at greater than the speed of light, and suddenly blink out of existence from our point of view?

Let's say I'm living on the asteroid 4 Vesta. I'm unlucky enough to only have solar panels, but it's mitigated somewhat in that I live in a rover that can move to where the most sunlight is. 

I know that the high axial tilt of Vesta (29 degrees) means that during the ""summer"" and ""winter"" of a pole, it will experience continuous illumination or darkness. 

However, Vesta's orbit is pretty eccentric, aphelion at ~2.5 AU and perihelion at ~2.1 AU. This means where I am in Vesta's orbit has a huge effect on how much power I can generate. 

If the northern summer solstice precisely coincides with perihelion, this would mean my imaginary explorer self would have tons of excess power by moving my rover to the north and staying there the whole season. It would be a boon time of doing things other than just staying alive. 

If instead perihelion/aphelion are close to the equinoxes, I would experience a period lasting almost an Earth year where I'm as far from the sun as I'm going to get and have no choice but to park my rover in a place where it will be in darkness 50% of the time. This would mean much less solar energy collected.

Naturally he chose the heavier one, and since at this weight air resistance wasn't an issue, much learning occurred. I explained that gravity pulls on EVERYTHING the same amount. Everything would fall at the same speed.

But eventually came the rock-vs-feather and rock-vs-paper and of course, in the atmosphere, paper loses to rock (we did not test scissors).  The paper lost, I explained that it was the shape of the paper, catching the air, which was effectively pushing back against it.

So THEN came book-vs-paper, and book won handily.  He rightfully pointed out that the book and the sheet of paper are the same shape.  I said the weight of the book was pulling it more effectively through the air, and he reminded me that my claim was that regardless of the weight of the object, it would fall at the same speed.

Which, of course, is true.  So in his mind, it's not the shape because they're both rectangular things, and it's not the weight because I say it's not...

  I'm finding it a lot harder to find information about other mammals and their consumption of starch. If it's not a bird, complex carbohydrate consumption seems to be opportunistic instead of a dietary staple. I think pigs seems to be okay with a starchy diet.

  The other question is about what happens to other animals if they are put on a complex carbohydrate diet. The only studies I know concern corn-fed cows, in which the trade-off is from grass to corn. Just from wikipedia.org, corn-fed cows have a more acidic digestive process, leading to a more virulent strain of E. Coli surviving in their intestinal tracts. Corn-fed cows are also fatter.

So nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. And the closer something does travel to the speed of light, the slower time goes relative to that object. Is this correct? So theoretically, if something travels faster than the speed of light, this object would travel back in time. I was hoping someone could explain to me why light and time are directly related.

I believe my confusion arises because I find myself comparing light to sound. For example, if someone fires a gun, it takes time before that sound reaches you. If you outrun the sound, you will not hear the gunshot for a second, but it doesn't mean the gunshot never happened.

Why is it different for light? Using a similar example, if a star explodes, it takes time before that light reaches you. I would assume that if you outran the light, it would only mean that you wouldn't see that happen for a bit, and not that you were outrunning the event itself.

I am be no means a scientist, neither am I sure my question is supposed to be in this sub, but I thought I give it a shot.

While looking up some information on power plants and power consumption I got intrigued by some numbers:

The Jiangxia Tidal Power Plant, China's largest tidal power plant, produces 6,5 GWh annually(according to my ever faithful source, Wikipedia). However, according to that same faithful source, China's average power demand is 18,608 KWh/capita. So far, so good.

Now looking at the closest city to the Jiangxia Tidal Power Plant is Taizhou (Zhejiang province). This city has 5.87 million inhabitants. But while doing my Excel stuff, I calculated that the power plant only generates power for about 350,000 people!

Is there something wrong with my sources, does the world's 4th largest tidal power plant only supply power for a measly 350,000 people or am I just totally not understanding how to calculate poer generation vs consumption?

Quote------------------------------------------

The information content of any message is usually described in units called bits, which is short for ""binary digits."" The simplest arithmetical scheme uses not 10 digits (as we do because of the evolutionary accident that we have ten fingers) but only two, 0 and 1. Thus any sufficiently crisp question can be answered by a single binary digit--0 or 1, yes or no. If the genetic code were written in a language of two letters rather than four letters, the number of bits in a DNA molecule would equal twice the number of nucleotide pairs. But since there are four different kinds of nucleotides, the number of bits of information in DNA is four times the number of nucleotide pairs. Thus if a single chromosome has five billion (5 x 10^9 ) nucleotides, it contains twenty billion (2 x 10^10 ) bits of information.

End Quote------------------------------------------

It seems to me that if the genetic code where written in a two letter alphabet instead of four, the number of bits of information associated with a DNA molecule consisting n nucleotide pairs, would be n, not 2n. Each letter would provide a single bit of information. Since the there are actually four letters in the genetic code however, each letter represents two bits of information, and the number of bits associated with a DNA molecule of n nucleotide pairs would be 2n. Thus if a single chromosome has 5 billion nucleotides (I'm assuming this means nucleotide PAIRS; if it means actual nucleotide bases the error is even worse) the chromosome contains 10 billion bits of information not 20.

* I understand what happens when the limit is smaller than 1 (every element of the series is smaller than the previous by a factor L, hence the series tend to stabilize and converge).

I'm wondering what does it mean when the limit equals 1 and [the test is inconclusive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_test#Inconclusive_because_L.3D1). My current understanding is that, being the limit an approximation, this doesn't mean that every term-by-term ratio is exactly 1, otherwise you'd end up with a situation where you are adding infinite non-zero positive terms that never change and that would make the series divergent. Slowly but divergent.

I assume it means the ratio gets *close* to 1, but if it's ever so slightly less or more than 1, that throws the series behavior into the two cases listed above. The only case i can think of where the limit AND term-by-term magnitude ratio are dead-on 1 is when you have every term of the series equal to any other. But it is obvious that if you add together the same finite number infinite times you get infinite and thus the series diverge.

The two ""legitimate"" ways of traveling forward are listed as: 

a) Getting close to a huge mass (in this case ignoring the MASSIVE doses of radiation you'd take orbiting a supermassive black hole)

b) Going really really really really fast. In this case the ship got up to .99c and slowed down significantly. This protects anything on the ship from going faster than light relative to the universe. 

So my question is, do both mass and velocity BOTH have the effect of dilation?

Okay, so from what I've read we're hurtling through the universe at 370 kilometers per second relative to CMBR and from what I understand time moves slower the closer you get to the speed of light. So, given that we're moving, how slowly are we experiencing time, relative to an observer who is stationary to CMBR?","At what rate are we experiencing time, relative to CMBR?",3,askscience

Bangkok_Dave,3,,3,1r4bju,,2,"First a disclaimer - I am not an astronomer or a physicist, so please let me know if any assumptions made in this question are fundamentally wrong.

As I understand it, the observable universe is made up of everything that is within our 'past light cone'. But the universe is expanding at an increasing rate, the more distant the object the faster it is moving away from us, and at the threshold of the observable universe space is effectively becoming more distant from us at the speed of light (and objects outside the observable universe are presumably becoming more distant at greater than the speed of light).

So does this mean that over time, observable objects (galaxies etc.) which are right at the edge of the observable universe will eventually pass the 'observable' threshold, will be moving from us at greater than the speed of light, and suddenly blink out of existence from our point of view?

If this is correct, have we ever witnessed any objects crossing this threshold and becoming un-observable?

In the article, they mention that the planet, HAT-P-1, has the lowest density of any known planet. How are we able to determine the density of an object that is 450 light years away? I know that a great deal can be learned about the age, composition, temperature, etc. of stars through spectroscopic analysis, but planets are not luminous.
