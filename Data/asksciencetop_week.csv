Naturally he chose the heavier one, and since at this weight air resistance wasn't an issue, much learning occurred. I explained that gravity pulls on EVERYTHING the same amount. Everything would fall at the same speed.

But eventually came the rock-vs-feather and rock-vs-paper and of course, in the atmosphere, paper loses to rock (we did not test scissors).  The paper lost, I explained that it was the shape of the paper, catching the air, which was effectively pushing back against it.

So THEN came book-vs-paper, and book won handily.  He rightfully pointed out that the book and the sheet of paper are the same shape.  I said the weight of the book was pulling it more effectively through the air, and he reminded me that my claim was that regardless of the weight of the object, it would fall at the same speed.

Which, of course, is true.  So in his mind, it's not the shape because they're both rectangular things, and it's not the weight because I say it's not...

If it's not a bird, complex carbohydrate consumption seems to be opportunistic instead of a dietary staple. I think pigs seems to be okay with a starchy diet.

The only studies I know concern corn-fed cows, in which the trade-off is from grass to corn.

So nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. And the closer something does travel to the speed of light, the slower time goes relative to that object. Is this correct? So theoretically, if something travels faster than the speed of light, this object would travel back in time. I was hoping someone could explain to me why light and time are directly related.

I believe my confusion arises because I find myself comparing light to sound. For example, if someone fires a gun, it takes time before that sound reaches you. If you outrun the sound, you will not hear the gunshot for a second, but it doesn't mean the gunshot never happened.

Why is it different for light? Using a similar example, if a star explodes, it takes time before that light reaches you. I would assume that if you outran the light, it would only mean that you wouldn't see that happen for a bit, and not that you were outrunning the event itself.

Sarial,2,1,1qqb23,3,"Working on some stuff about hemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve, and I'd just like some fact-checking on my understanding.

1) As you vary the amount of Hgb in the blood (like from 10g to 15g of Hgb) you wouldn't change the shape of the saturation curve (pO2 vs % Hgb saturation), but you would change the overall amount of oxygen that the person can store in their blood (higher maximum on ml O2 vs 100 ml blood), while retaining the shape. Correct?

2) Having 30% carboxyhemoglobin would result in the same maximum on a graph of pO2 vs % O2 saturation, but it would lose the sigmodal shape and be left-shifted (more affinity for O2 as the CO2 will not unbind, allosteric interaction keeps O2 bound).

3) While in #2 the level of saturation would remain the same, in a graph of pO2 vs ml O2/100 ml blood, the maximum amount of O2/100 ml would only be 70% that of someone with the same amount of Hgb in their blood.

&gt; A collection of galaxies that is a whopping four billion light years long is the biggest cosmic structure ever seen.

- NewScientist in summary of a paper from Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, DOI: 10.1093/mnras/sts497

There is on the flip side another paper ""Seeing patterns in noise: Gigaparsec-scale `structures' that do not violate homogeneity"" (arXiv:1306.1700 [astro-ph.CO] [[Link](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.1700v2.pdf)]) which states in the abstract:

&gt; If true, this would represent a serious challenge to the standard cosmological model. However, the homogeneity scale is an average property which is not necessarily affected by the discovery of a single large structure. I clarify this point and provide the first fractal dimension analysis of the DR7 quasar catalogue to demonstrate that it is in fact homogeneous above scales of at most 130 Mpc/h, which is much less than the upper limit for \Lambda CDM. In addition, I show that the algorithm used to identify the Huge-LQG regularly finds even larger clusters of points, extending over Gpc scales, in explicitly homogeneous simulations of a Poisson point process with the same density as the quasar catalogue. This provides a simple null test to be applied to any cluster thus found in a real catalogue, and suggests that the interpretation of LQGs as `structures' is misleading.

Has the discovery of U1.27 actually cast any doubt on the cosmological principle, is there actually any serious debate on this subject, and are there any additional resources that may cast light on the subject?

My understanding as a layperson is that casein is the component in milk that helps to counteract the capsaicin that causes the 'hotness' of spicy foods.

I'm curious if a solution containing a significant amount of isolated casein would do a better job of 'pulling away' the capsaicin on the tongue and tastebuds, or if milk already happens to contain the maximum effective amount of casein for that purpose.

As I understand it, the observable universe is made up of everything that is within our 'past light cone'.

So does this mean that over time, observable objects (galaxies etc.) which are right at the edge of the observable universe will eventually pass the 'observable' threshold, will be moving from us at greater than the speed of light, and suddenly blink out of existence from our point of view?
