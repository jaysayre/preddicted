fuzzyblackyeti,50,,135,1rgt0e,,384,"So a man is driving home from a buisness trip. He has a pretty low paying job, so obviously he doesn't have the best of cars.

After a few hours of driving, he drives past a monastery. That kind with all the monks.

And holy tits, his car breaks down right in front of the monastery.

Being a man of God, he obviously figures, ""I bet the monks will let me stay with them while my car is repaired."" So he goes to the front gate and knocks on the door. A man in robes answers.
He tells the monk his predicament and the monk, being a monk, lets him stay the night, and even helps with repair costs for his car.

While the business man is sleeping that night, he hears this strange noise.
It just perplexes him, and for the life of him, he can't figure out what it is. He decides when he wakes up in the morning, he'll ask the monks about it.

When he wakes up, he finds the monk who he met when his car first broke down, and asks him, ""Can you tell me what that noise I heard was last night?""

The monk replies, ""I'm sorry, brother. I cannot tell you, for you are not a monk."" The man accepts this. He thanks the monks for their graciousness, and goes about his way when he gets his car back.
3 years later, he is driving on another buisness trip. And wouldn't you know it, his car breaks down in front of the monastery again.

Again, he figures, he can stay the night. And, of course, the monks let him stay and offer him the same help as before.

And once again, during the night, he hears that noise. He has no idea what it could be. He decides to ask the monk once again, with hopes that he would trust him more this time around.
In the morning he meets the monk again, and asks, ""I'm sorry for asking again, but what is that noise!?""

The monk replies, ""I cannot tell you, for you are not a monk.""

The man says, ""Alright! I'll become a monk! What do I need to do!?""

The monk replies, ""I need you to travel the world, and count every blade of grass if you truly wish to become a monk.""

The man swiftly accepts and leaves all of his worldly possessions behind him to travel the world on this mission.

He goes to all corners of the globe counting grass blades.

After 50 years, he comes back to the monastery.
He gives the monk accurate numbers and the monks give him monk-hood.
And obviously, the first thing he wants to do is find out what that noise was. So he asks the head monk.

The head monk beckons him to follow him and he does.
After a few minutes of walking through corridors and rooms, they happen upon a wooden door. 

The man can hear the noise. He gets excited. The head monk hands him a brass key.
He reaches with the key to the lock, and unlocks the door.

There is another door though. This time iron. And the monk hands him an iron key.

This happens again and again.
So many types of doors and keys. Every thing you could imagine. Glass doors, gold doors. Everything

Finally, they get to a door made of solid diamond. The noise is louder than ever. The monk hands the man the final key.

He opens the door and finally sees what has been making the noise.

The Trids, tired of the giant, sent a group led by the community's minister to reason with the giant. But before they could even say one word the giant kicked them down the mountain. The Trids thought maybe this was because the giant was Catholic, so they sent another group, this time led by the local priest. But alas, as they approached, the giant once again kicked them all down the mountain.

The Trids were upset until they thought that perhaps the giant was Jewish. Unfortunately, no Trids were Jewish, so they asked a rabbi of a different community for help. The Rabbi led a group of Trids up the mountain. The giant saw them coming and kicked all of them, except for the Rabbi, down the mountain. The Rabbi, knowing the giant's past, wondered why he alone had not been kicked down the mountain, so he asked the giant. The giant laughed and replied

The vet tells the farmer that he should try artificial insemination. The farmer doesn't have the slightest idea what this means but, not wanting to display his ignorance, only asks the vet how he will know when the pigs are pregnant. The vet tells him that they will stop standing around and will, instead, lay down and wallow in the mud when they are pregnant. the farmer hangs up and gives it some thought.

He comes to the conclusion that artificial insemination means he has to impregnate the pigs. So, he loads the pigs into his truck, drives them out into the woods, has sex with them all, brings them back and goes to bed. Next morning, he wakes and looks out at the pigs. Seeing that they are all still standing around, he concludes that the first try didn't take effect, and loads them into the truck again. He drives them out to the woods, bangs each pig twice for good measure, brings them back and goes to bed.

Next morning, he wakes to find the pigs still just standing around. ""One more try"", he tells himself, and proceeds to load them up and drive them out to the woods.

After a few hours of walking through the woods and not finding anything the hunter was about to walk back home, but suddenly he saw a bear. 

Just around 50 meters away. He took his rifle, aimed, and...BANG!

As the smoke got blown away by the wind the hunter looked at the place the bear sleept just a few seconds ago. But...but...where did it go?! OH MY GOD! HE IS GOING TO KILL ME!!! NO...

Suddenly something tapped on the hunters shoulder. The hunter slowly turned around...and there he stood...the mighty bear he was about to shoot...it was big, black and had giant claws on its feet.

The bear said:""Hunter...either you will let me fuck you or I will kill you. Your choice.

The hunter was stunned...a speaking bear? What? He...how did he move that quickly anyways? Why...why does he want to fuck me...

But the hunter quickly managed to rearange his thoughts and said:""Well...I dont want to die...so-"" ""Excellent! Now bend over!"" Interrupted the bear. The hunter did what the bear wanted him to do. He bent over and the bear fucked his ass.

The next day the hunter said to himself:""I am getting that bitch. My anus is still bleeding and I have to kill him before any of my friends find out!"" So he grabs his rifle and leaves! 

Still a little wobbly on his legs he sneaks through the woods. After just a few minutes he finds the bear again. Sleeping at tge same spot as last time.

After a few seconds the hunter looked up. But...WHAT?! I HIT THAT BI-""Well...well...hello there hunter."" Said the bear. ""Thats how we meet again"" ""God dammit!"" Said the hunter. ""You know the deal hunter. You will let me fuck you and I will let you live."".

So the hunter bends forward and the bear takes him again. This time even harder than last time.

After hours of torture by the bear the hunter walks back home. 

The next day the hunter gets really mad. He grabs hus rifle and storms out. I WILL KILL THAT SON OF A BITCH! I WILL CUT HIS THROAT! USE HIS SKIN AS A TOWEL!

Two nuns walk into a bar. The first is elderly, and seems to be fully devout. The other is young, blonde, and appears to be new to the convent. 
 “Bartender,” says the elderly nun, “I was wondering if you could settle a little dispute for us. You see, my trainee believes that true holiness can be achieved in a matter of days, rather than with the years on end that I’ve been practicing. One year out of catholic school, and she thinks that she is as holy as me!”
“I’ll tell you what,” replies the bartender, “both of your write down your arguments, and I’ll decide who among you is most holy.”
The sisters begin to write their cases. The elder nun finishes first, and slides her paper toward the bartender. At this point, the blonde sister has pulled out a calculator, and starts to plug away at the buttons.
The bartender reads the first paper aloud. “‘Everyday, for the last 40 years, I’ve woken at dawn for morning prayer. I prepare breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the entire convent, while using any spare hours for reading the texts and scripture. In case that isn’t holy enough, I volunteer on the weekends.’ Good gracious, sister!” Says the bartender, “this is quite exemplary.” 
By now, the young nun has finished and has passed her paper to the bartender.
“All this says is πr^2, r=2… Hold on, is this an equation for the area of a circle?!” exclaims the bartender.
“Oh, sorry,” says the blonde, blushing.
 “It was supposed to be circumference.”

A bartender has been going through a financial rough patch, and hoped that his wife would accommodate for the tough times by letting him try anal. Now, the wife resents her husband, and was appalled by his audacity to ask for such a thing with their marriage on the fritz. She denies his request.
Later in the week, a man walks into the bar and asks the bartender for a prostitute. The bartender is about to send the man on his way, when he gets an idea that would make him some money while simultaneously punishing his wife.
“You see that woman in the corner?” He asks, “Well, she’s one of the best girls we got. You go over to her and take her into the private room. You can do whatever you want with her, no matter how much she resists. It’s all part of the act. After you’re through, come back here and pay full price, $2000.”
The man nods his head excitedly in agreement and walks toward the wife. The bartender watches from afar as the two exchange a few quick words. All of a sudden, he sees the man grab his wife by the arm and pull her into the private room.
The bartender smiles inwardly to himself and thinks “Ha! That’ll teach the bitch to appreciate me. Plus, I’m making a small fortune!”
After about twenty minutes, the wife comes out, alone. She heads over to the bartender with a slight limp.
“Where’s your new friend?” asks the bartender, smiling. “He owes me a little money.”
The wife snickers, pulls her husband in close and whispers in his ear “I let him use the back door,” and walks away.

But ten minutes before their time was up, lightning suddenly flashed across the sky, thunder rolled, the rain poured and, of course, the electricity went off.

Satan stared at his blank screen and screamed every curse word known in the underworld. Jesus just sighed.

The electricity finally flickered back on, and each of them restarted their computers. Satan started searching frantically, screaming ""It's gone! It's all gone! I lost everything when the power went out!""

Meanwhile, Jesus quietly started printing out all of his files from the past two hours. Satan observed this and became irate. ""Wait! He cheated, how did he do it?""

kokain711,5,,12,1qwp4n,,23,"It was getting a little crowded in heaven, so God decided to change the admittance policy. The new law was that, in order to get into heaven, you had to have had a really bad day the day you died.

So the next day the first person came to the gates of heaven. The angel at the gate promptly asked the man to tell him about the day he died.

""Well, for some time now, I thought my wife was having an affair and that each day on her lunch hour she'd bring her lover home to our 25th floor apartment and have sex with him. So today I was going to come home too, and catch them. Well, I got there and busted in, and immediately began searching for this guy. My wife was half-naked and yelling at me as I searched the entire apartment. But, damn it, I couldn't find him! Just when I was about to give up, I happened to glance out onto the balcony and noticed that there was a man hanging off the edge by his fingertips ! The nerve of that guy to think he could hide from me! Well, I ran out there and promptly stomped on his fingers until he fell to the ground. But, wouldn't you know it, he landed in some bushes that broke his fall, and he didn't die. This got me even more enraged so I went back inside to get the first thing I could get my hands on to throw at him, which turned out to be the refrigerator. I unplugged it, pushed it out onto the balcony and heaved it over the side. It plummeted 25 stories and crushed him !

The excitement of the moment was so great that I had a heart attack and died almost instantly.""

The angel sat back and thought for a moment.

Technically, the guy DID have a bad day. So he announced, ""OK, sir, welcome to the kingdom of heaven,"" and let him in. A few seconds later the next guy came up. ""OK, here's the rule. Before I can let you in, I need to hear about the day you died.""

""Sure thing,"" the next man replied. ""But you're not going to believe this. I was out on the balcony of my 26th floor apartment doing my daily exercises when I got a little carried away and accidentally fell over the side! Luckily I was able to catch myself by my fingertips on the balcony directly beneath mine, when, all of a sudden, this crazy man came running out of his apartment and started cussing and stomping on my fingers! Well, of course I fell. I hit some trees and bushes on the way down which broke my fall so I didn't die right away. As I lay there face up on the ground, unable to move and in excruciating pain, I saw the man push his refrigerator, of all things, over the ledge and it fell directly on top of me and killed me ! ""

The angel is quietly laughing to himself as the man finishes his story. ""Very well, "" he announces. ""Welcome to the kingdom of heaven, "" and lets the man enter.

A few seconds later a third man comes up to the gate. ""Tell me about the day you died,"" says the angel.

MoralLesson,6,,83,1qvop2,,165,"There was this male engineer, on a cruise ship in the Caribbean for the first time. It was wonderful, the experience of his life. He was being waited on hand and foot. But, it did not last. A Hurricane came up unexpectedly. The ship went down almost instantly.

The man found himself, he knew not how, swept up on the shore of an island. There was nothing else anywhere to be seen. No people, no supplies, nothing. The man looked around. There were some bananas and coconuts, but that was it. He was desperate, and forlorn, but decided to make the best of it. So for the next four months he ate bananas, drank coconut juice and mostly looked to the sea mightily for a ship to come to his rescue.

One day, as he was lying on the beach stroking his beard and looking for a ship, he spotted movement out of the corner of his eye. Could it be true, was it a ship? No, from around the corner of the island came this row-boat. In it was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen, or at least seen in 4 months. She was tall, tanned, and her blond hair flowing in the sea breeze gave her an almost ethereal quality. She spotted him also as he was waving and yelling and screaming to get her attention. 

She rowed her boat towards him. In disbelief, he asked, ""Where did you come from? How did you get here?"" 

She said, ""I rowed from the other side of the island. I landed on this island when my cruise ship sank."" 

""Amazing"", he said, ""I didn't know anyone else had survived. How many of you are there? Where did you get the row-boat? You must have been really lucky to have a row-boat wash-up with you?"" 

""It is only me"", she said, ""and the row-boat didn't wash up, nothing else did.""

""Well then"", said the man, ""how did you get the row-boat?"" 

""I made the row-boat out of raw material that I found on the island"", replied the woman. ""The oars were whittled from Gum tree branches, I wove the bottom from Palm branches, and the sides and stern came from a Eucalyptus tree""

""But, but,"" asked the man, ""what about tools and hardware, how did you do that?""

""Oh, no problem"", replied the woman, ""on the south side of the island there is a very unusual strata of alluvial rock exposed. I found that If I fired it to a certain temperature in my kiln, it melted into forgeable ductile iron. I used that for tools, and used the tools to make the hardware. But, enough of that,"" she continued. ""Where do you live?"" At last the man was forced to confess that he had been sleeping on the beach. 

""Well, let's row over to my place"", she said. So they both got into the row-boat and left for her side of island. The woman easily rowed them around to a wharf that led to the approach to her place. She tied up the row-boat with a beautifully woven hemp rope. They walked up a stone walk and around a Palm tree, there stood an exquisite bungalow painted in blue and white.

""It's not much"", she said, ""but I call it home. Sit down please, would you like to have a drink?"" 

""No"", said the man, ""one more coconut juice and I will puke.""

""It won't be coconut juice"", the woman replied, ""I have a still, how about a Pina Colada?"" Trying to hide his continued amazement, the man accepted, and they sat down on her couch to talk. After a while, when they had exchanged their stories, the woman asked, ""Tell me, have you always had a beard?"" 

""No"", the man replied, ""I was clean shaven all of my life, and even on the cruise ship.""

""Well if you would like to shave, there is a man's razor upstairs in the cabinet in the bathroom."" So, the man, no longer questioning anything, went upstairs to the bathroom. There in the cabinet was a razor made from a bone handle, two shells honed to a hollow ground edge were fastened on to its end inside of a swivel mechanism. The man shaved, showered and went back down stairs.

""You look great"", said the woman, ""I think I will go up and slip into something more comfortable."" So she did. And, the man continued to sip his Pina Colada. After a short time, the woman returned - this time wearing fig leafs strategically positioned and smelling faintly of gardenia.

""Tell me"", she asked, ""we have both been out here for a very long time with no companionship. You know what I mean. Have you been lonely, is there anything that you really miss? Something that all men and women need? Something that it would be really nice to have right now?""

If you can read this whole story without laughing, then there's no hope for you. I was crying by the end. This is an actual account as relayed to paramedics at a chili cook-off in New Mexico. 


For those of you who have lived in New Mexico, you know how true this is. They actually have a Chili Cook-off about the time Halloween comes around. It takes up a major portion of a parking lot at the Santa Fe Plaza. Judge #3 was an inexperienced Chili taster named Frank, who was visiting from Springfield, IL.


Frank: ""Recently, I was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cook-off. The original person called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table, asking for directions to the Coors Light truck, when the call came in... I was assured by the other two judges (Native New Mexicans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy; and, besides, they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted and became Judge 3.""


Here are the scorecard notes from the event:



CHILI # 1 - MIKE'S MANIAC MONSTER CHILE

Judge # 1 -- A little too heavy on the tomato. Amusing kick.

Judge # 2 -- Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.

Judge # 3 (Frank) -- Holy crap, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway. It took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that's the worst one. These New Mexicans are crazy.



CHILE # 2 - EL RANCHO'S AFTERBURNER CHILE

Judge # 1 -- Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight jalapeno tang..

Judge # 2 -- Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.

Judge # 3 -- Keep this out of the reach of children. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face.



CHILI # 3 - ALFREDO'S FAMOUS BURN DOWN THE BARN CHILI

Judge # 1 -- Excellent firehouse chile. Great kick.

Judge # 2 -- A bit salty, good use of peppers.

Judge # 3 -- Call the EPA. I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now. Get me more beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back, now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting ****-faced from all of the beer.



CHILI # 4 - BUBBA'S BLACK MAGIC

Judge # 1 -- Black bean chile with almost no spice. Disappointing.

Judge # 2 -- Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chile.

Judge # 3 -- I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Is it possible to burn out taste buds? Sally, the beer maid, was standing behind me with fresh refills. This 300 lb. woman is starting to look HOT ... just like this nuclear waste I'm eating! Is chili an aphrodisiac?



CHILE # 5 - LISA'S LEGAL LIP REMOVER

Judge # 1 -- Meaty, strong chili. Jalapeno peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive.

Judge # 2 -- Chili using shredded beef, could use more tomato. Must admit the jalapeno peppers make a strong statement.

Judge # 3 -- My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted, and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from the pitcher. I wonder if I'm burning my lips off. It really ticks me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Screw them.



CHILE # 6 - VARGA'S VERY VEGETARIAN VARIETY

Judge # 1 -- Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spices and peppers.

Judge # 2 -- The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, garlic. Superb.

Judge # 3 -- My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames. I crapped on myself when I farted, and I'm worried it will eat through the chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that Sally. Can't feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe my butt with a snow cone.



CHILE # 7 - SUSAN'S SCREAMING SENSATION CHILI

Judge # 1 -- A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.

Judge # 2 -- Ho hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. **I should take note that I am worried about judge number 3. He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably.

Judge # 3 -- You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a thing. I've lost sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava to match my shirt. At least during the autopsy, they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing. It's too painful. I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole in my stomach.



CHILE # 8 - BIG TOM'S TOENAIL CURLING CHILE

Judge # 1 -- The perfect ending, this is a nice
blend chile. Not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence.

Judge # 2 -- This final entry is a good, balanced chili. Neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge #3 farted, passed out, fell over and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor feller, wonder how he'd have reacted to really hot chili?

When the farmer answered the door and asked what he was selling, the salesman first asked about the three legged pig.
""That pig is the most amazing pig in the land, son."" The farmer said
""Last year, our house caught fire when we were all asleep and that pig ran in and woke us all up one by one and saved our lives!""
The salesman was surprised. ""That is one special pig"" He said.
The Farmer replied, ""That's not all. Last summer, that pig jumped into the pond and dragged my drowning son to safety. He would have died.""

The French woman sniffed and said to no one in particular, ""Americans are so rude.. My little Fifi is using that seat..""
The Marine walked the entire train again, but the only seat available was under that dog. ""Please, Ma'am. May I sit down? I'm very tired."" She snorted, ""Not only are you Americans rude, you are also arrogant!"" This time the Marine didn't say a word; he just picked up the little dog, tossed it out the train window and sat down.

“YOU STUPID REDNECK!” shouted the lawyer, looking with contempt at the redneck in his dirty overalls.

“Now how am I gonna get outa this?” though the redneck to himself. Then he had an idea…

After looking over the impressive, impeccably dressed and dignified city lawyer in his $2,000 navy blue pinstriped suit, carefully knotted red silk tie, starched white shirt, silver cufflinks and black dress shoes polished like mirrors, $1,000 briefcase and hundred dollar haircut, the redneck walked back to his car, got out a bottle, and brought it back.

He handed it to the hotshot and said, “Here, you look pretty shook up. I think you ought to take a nip of this. It’ll steady your nerves….IT’S HOMEMADE…”

The lawyer did, but was so angry about the wreck, he refused to speak. The redneck then said, “You still look a little bit pale. How about another?” And the smug, pompous lawyer took another swallow. After a few minutes, he began to feel the heat of the sun through his wool suit.

Then the redneck said “It’s mighty hot today. Folks ’round here don’t usually wear shoes on a day like those. Why don’t you take off them fancy shoes, and the socks, too?”

The lawyer frowned: “Take off my shoes and socks? Do I LOOK like someone who would walk around barefoot? That’s fine for hicks, but not for a professional like ME! These are $500 shoes!”

But after a few more sips, the redneck asked him again, and then again, and then again, and finally the lawyer, feeling the white lightnin’, let out a laugh and took off his polished shoes and socks.
The redneck picked up the polished shoes and smiled. “Might fancy shoes you got here, boy!” Then the redneck said: “Why don’t you take off that fancy necktie?”

The lawyer said: “My tie!”, but in a minute, the silk tie was dropped on top of the shoes and the socks.

The redneck grinned and held up an extra pair of overalls he found in his pickup. “And that fancy business suit? You look kind of funny standing there barefoot in a suit on a 100 degree day! You can wear these while we figger out what to do about this situation! Just strip that suit off…”

The lawyer tried to give him an arrogant look, but he was feeling the heat of the sun and the liquor. He tried to resist, but…

Off came the jacket of the $2,000 pinstriped suit. Then the starched white shirt and the cufflinks. Finally, the trousers, too, and the lawyer pulled on the overalls.

“Now ain’t that more comfortable?!” said the redneck.

At the urging of the redneck, the lawyer then took another sip, and another, and another.

The suspenders and the cufflinks and the briefcase were all in a heap now, and the lawyer was having a hard time standing up. After another half hour, the lawyer said he was feeling pretty good, and asked the redneck if he didn’t think that he ought to have a little nip, too. Then he realized he couldn’t find the redneck…

“Not me”, the redneck replied, stepping out from behind a tree. The lawyer stared at him in shock, but was now so drunk he couldn’t stand up. The redneck was wearing the lawyer’s suit, shirt and tie, his feet were in the lawyer’s shoes and socks; he was holding his briefcase, shaving with a razor he found in the briefcase and holding the keys to his BMW.

The lawyer mumbled “You look like me! What…. Why… Give me my clothes back! Take off my shoes! My car…What are you….”

But he was so drunk he couldn’t move.

Then he reached over and pulled the Rolex off the lawyer’s wrist and as a final touch, rubbed some dirt into the lawyer’s manicured hands and expensive haircut.

theonewhowrites,2,,10,1qk3ei,,0,"A factory worker dressed in overalls, sat down to have his lunch in a park across from his office.

Then he noticed a very distinguished and dignified man step out of a top of the line BMW, walk into the park and sit down a few feet away on the grass; he was extremely well dressed in a hand tailored Brioni pinstriped business suit, perfectly tied silk necktie, starched white dress shirt, monogrammed cuff links, silver tiepin, Rolex watch, immaculately polished black leather shoes and silk socks. He placed his expensive briefcase next to him and prepared for lunch.

“One of those executives, I’ll bet” thought the factory worker, and after introducing himself, he found out he was right not only an executive, but an investment banker!

The factory worker glanced at the banker’s shoes, glistening in the sunlight.

“You have those polished every day, don’t you?” he asked.

The Investment Banker nodded “Just about. I have to look good for the clients. These were handmade for me. The first thing people notice are your shoes, at least in my line of work. And I keep the shoeshine men busy!”

The factory worker snapped “What about the poor? A few shoeshines would pay for a lot food. You “suits” are all alike! Tell me something. How much money did you pay for those fancy shoes?”

The Investment Banker looked surprised and said calmly “Eight hundred dollars”

The factory worker yelled “Just for ONE pair of shoes! How are you helping out other people? Never trust a suit! And how much was that suit?”

The banker said quietly: “Well, it’s none of your business but it was two thousand for the suit and two hundred for the tie and two hundred for the shirt, since you ask. I help them through taxes, but we all have a personal responsibility. Brioni pinstripes are expensive.”

The factory worker said “I’m telling you, the poor only need a chance! You should be GIVING them money; they haven’t had your advantages!”

The Investment Banker shrugged and said “We all have to work for what we have. I have worked VERY hard for what I have.”

“I saw you get out of that car. Pretty classy!” said the factory worker. “That BMW would pay for several cheap cars!”

“Yes, it is a classy car” said the banker smiling and pulled out his computer. “I am trading stocks so I would prefer some privacy”

The factory worker said “Stocks! Look, poverty can happen to anyone! There’s no way you can know that from where you sit with your high and mighty job and your car and your hotshot clothes! If you were not a SUIT, you would KNOW that! You need to know what it’s like to NOT be a suit!”

The Investment Banker smiled and said “Keep talking if you want to. When I sleep, nothing wakes me – and I mean NOTHING! I sleep like a rock.”

The investment banker put down his computer, sighed, relaxed on the grass and fell into a deep sleep.

Then a barefoot homeless man appeared holding whiskey, and asked the factory worker for change. The factory worker apologized, and said he had nothing, but then he saw the investment banker’s wallet in his suit pocket.

He had an idea. He slipped the wallet out, and handed it to the homeless man, ID, credit cards and all.

Then he had another idea – a riskier one. He looked at the banker’s feet.

Why not! This is a Suit who needs to give to society! The homeless man needs shoes, and the banker definitely needs to be humbled. 

“What size shoe?” he asked the homeless man.

“Ten!” 

He looked again at the feet of the sleeping investment banker. “Wait! I’m sure you need these more than he does.” He then started to slowly untie the investment banker’s mirror polished $800 shoes and very slowly and very carefully pulled them off his feet.

He looked inside. “Size ten! You’re in luck! Give me your whiskey and I’ll give you the shoes”

“Deal!’ said the homeless man.

“You have to have socks to go with these shoes!” he said, “and he won’t be needing socks now!” 

And even more carefully, he reached up under the banker’s suit cuffs to his knees and peeled the thin black dress socks off the banker’s legs, heels, soles and finally his toes, and held them up like trophies. He handed both shoes and socks to the homeless man, who grinned.

The factory worker said: “With my compliments! They are handmade and they were just polished! Somebody told me that the first thing people notice are your SHOES!”

The factory worker took the bottle of whiskey.

The investment banker, now barefoot, yawned, stretched, but continued to sleep; soon he started to snore again, while the bum walked off in the banker’s shoes.

“I guess he won’t be seeing any more clients today, and he’ll have to miss that board meeting”, said the factory worker to himself, “but he’ll be a much better person now that he’s humbled! I’m changing his destiny!”

An old man walked by and stared at the sleeping banker and the contrast between the tailored suit and his bare feet; he laughed out loud and walked on.

Then a mugger ran by, holding on to money he had just stolen. “A victim of society!” thought the factory worker.

He slid the keys to the BMW out of the banker’s suit pocket, threw them to the mugger, and pointed to the car.

The mugger didn’t stop to ask questions – he just drove off.

Then the factory worker saw a sad woman with a baby walking by. 

“Can I help you?” he asked her. When he found out that she needed money for her rent, the factory worker again approached the snoring investment banker and removed his cuff links; then he slipped the tiepin out of the silk tie.

“His wristwatch will be worth plenty!” said the factory worker to himself, and slipped the Rolex off the banker’s manicured hand. He handed them all to the delighted woman. “Sell these!” the factory worker cried. “Oh, thank you sir” said the woman, and ran off.

“It’s the least I can do!” said the factory worker.

He then thought: “Well, he has no more fancy shoes, no socks, no keys, no car, no ID or credit cards or wristwatch or license or money. I guess I’m turning him from a Suit into something much better! I might as well finish the job!”

The factory worker then noticed the banker’s computer and the password on a piece of paper. He sold all of the banker’s stocks and bonds, and gave the money to the charities.

Next, a man in a janitor’s uniform walked by, looking dejected.

“What’s the matter, my friend?” said the factory worker sympathetically. “I..lost my job. I have a chance for a better one, but I don’t have the clothes! This is all I have!” and he held up a pair of old polyester pants.

The factory worker sighed, and then looked at the banker’s navy blue pinstriped business suit.

“Would this help? It’s a two thousand dollar suit! A Brioni!” he asked the man.

“Sure!” cried the man “But how are you going to strip it off him?”

“Just watch and see!” said the factory worker.

He very slowly moved one of the banker’s arms and then the other and the banker rolled on to his stomach, still sleeping and removed the suit jacket.

“You could use a briefcase, too!” said the factory worker and opened up the investment banker’s briefcase.

He removed the contents and handed it to the joyful man. He also gave him the banker’s Blackberry and computer and password. Then he looked at the banker’s expensive silk tie and white shirt. Could he manage it?

He had to move the banker again a few times, but he only snored and slept as he untied the tie and pulled off the shirt. Then he unbuttoned the banker’s suspenders and pulled them off.

Triumphantly he handed the starched white shirt, suspenders and necktie to the man, leaving their formerly well-dressed owner in his t-shirt.

“Wait” the factory worker said. “You really need the full suit. Give me a hand and I’ll need those polyester pants. I’m getting good at this. taking his suit pants off him will be the hardest job yet” and with great care and trouble, set to work removing the suit trousers. 

Ten minutes later, the man was holding up the full pinstriped suit with admiration while its former owner was reduced to wearing the polyester pants.

He thanked the factory worker profusely and ran off, who brushed off his words: “I’m always glad to help those who need it! I’ve always been generous!”

“How good it is to help people!” he said to himself. “And mister hotshot isn’t a “Suit” anymore!”

He sprinkled some of the whiskey on the banker’s shirt and hair and placed the bottle next to him.

Twenty minutes later, a policeman walks up to the formerly impeccably dressed investment banker, slapped him on the soles of his naked size tens and snapped: “Hey buddy, wake up, no loitering! We don’t allow drunk bums to sleep here. I can smell it from here!”
Finally the investment banker woke up with a start and looked down at himself with astonishment.

There was nothing left of the perfectly dressed banker he had been when he fell asleep. He was barefoot, and wearing only cheap trousers and a t-shirt. It took him a moment to realize that his suit, shoes, socks, tie, shirt, watch, jewelry, money, credit cards, ID, computer and briefcase had all been stripped from him.

He turned to the factory worker in astonished fury. “WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?! WHERE IS MY SUIT, MY TIE, MY SHIRT! WHERE ARE MY SHOES AND SOCKS!? MY BRIEFCASE! MY WALLET! HOW CAN I GO BACK TO MY OFFICE LIKE THIS!? I LOOK LIKE A BUM! I smell like a bum too!”

The factory worker then told him about his car and stocks. The banker began to yell.

The policeman then turned to the factory worker and said “Is this bum disturbing you?” and grabbed the struggling investment banker by the arm and says: “You can sleep it off in the tank, buddy! Vagrancy, disturbing the peace, resisting arrest, assaulting an officer, harassment!”

At that moment, his boss walked by on a stroll, saw his bedraggled employee being dragged away and cried out, “What are you doing?! You’re fired!”

Three months later, the factory worker wandered into the park, and saw the homeless man on the corner, as usual, wearing the same gleaming black shoes and socks, but now there was a new panhandler with him, barefoot with matted hair and a grizzled face, wearing polyester pants and a T-shirt. 

“It can’t be!” he says, as he walked up to him. But it is.

The homeless man looked up and winked: “He’s one of us now!” he said laughing “And I’m even wearing HIS fancy shoes!”

The expensive haircut and the manicure were gone, along with everything else, and the former investment banker is now an unemployed homeless bum with a criminal record; he had been thrown out of his condo and his wife had left him. It’s hard to believe this was the same confident man in the expensive suit and the polished shoes he had seen that day in the park.

“I have been stripped of everything and my life is destroyed. Spare change, sir? Can I give you a shoeshine?” said the banker-turned-panhandler, without looking up. He pulled out a shoeshine kit.

It's used and in pretty good condition except the gas tank has a little leak so he has to carry around some Vaseline to seal up the hole should it start raining. He takes it around to all the biker bars and meets this girl. They hit it off and eventually start dating.

One day, the girl tells Mike she wants to take him to her folks place for dinner. He agrees but she warns him, ""listen there are a lot of dishes and the rule of the house is that if you say anything over dinner, you have to do them all.""

The night comes and they go inside and Mike sees the mountain of dishes. Pots and pans stacked inside each other. Piles of plates. Flies buzzing around. ""Well, shit, I'm really not going to say anything at dinner,"" Mike thinks. They all sit down to their meal.

Mike can see the father already looking at him with some distaste and, being an asshole, decides to piss him off more. He grabs his girlfriend, puts her on the table and starts fucking her. The father's eyes get wide and fiery, but he just quietly eats his peas because he doesn't want to do the dishes.

Mike finishes up and his girlfriend is breathless. She almost says something like ""My God"" but slaps her hands over her mouth because she doesn't want to do the dishes. Mike, being an asshole, thinks to himself ""how can I push this farther?"" He goes around the table, grabs the mother, puts her on the table and starts fucking her. The father is so filled with rage he can hardly contain himself, let alone keep the peas on his fork anymore. But he doesn't say anything because he doesn't want to do the dishes.

Mike finishes up, goes back to his seat and is just about to sit down when he realizes it's raining out. He grabs the Vaseline from his pocket and the father stands up and screams ""ALRIGHT, I'LL DO THE FUCKIN' DISHES!""",Mike the Biker,70,jokes

During one of the Papal processions, he manages to make his way to the front of the barrier as the Pontiff walks past them. Instead, the Pope completely blanks the man, and stops several metres after him and stoops down to talk to an old and ragged-looking homeless person. The wealthy man is insanely jealous, and later finds the homeless person that the Pope had talked to and offers him his own fine suit as well as €2000, in exchange for the hobo's rags, to which the man greatly obliges.

The next day, the man positions himself in his ""new"" hobo clothing in  roughly the same spot the original man was in the previous day. And sure enough, as the Pope came down the procession, he stopped by the homeless man, bent down and whispered in his ear:

We checked you out and found that you are a multimillionaire.

 Now this is before all the austerity stuff was really kicking in,and he fells like he deserves a bit of a treat since hes been doing some great Popeing lately so he wanders into the Mercedes dealership and like a good German Lad,heads directly to the AMG`s.

And there is the one he figures will be a great upgrade.It's white, so it still goes with the uniform,but it's a 700 horse power twin superchaged monster of a car.Not exactly practical,but the Holy Father reckons he could get the back end redone with a nice low profile glass box for waving and blessing.

So he talks to the dealer,who is pretty awestruck that the Pope,..*The FUCKING POPE!* is in his dealership asking about zero to sixty times.

""Whats it's top speed?""
""Is it much of a hassel to disable the speed limiters?""

Then the Pope asks,""Can we go for a test run?"" and ""Do you think I could drive? The Cardinals never let me up front when I'm working.""

Well,the dealer is not going to say no to the Pope,even though company policy is as definative as Leviticus on the subject of clients in the driverseats of the high end performance models.He say's ""Sure thing your Holiness"" and they head out for a quick spin around Rome.

Well its not long before the special red leather papal slippers are putting far to much torque to the road and then of course **Wha wha,Wha wha,** up pops the Law on a bike from nowhere and he pulls over the crisp white AMG and saunters over to the car with ticket book in hand.

""Drivers licence and regis,......""
The Policeman does a double take,and tries again,but words fail him,Looks at the Driver..is that?....No it can't be,....but,....Looks at the passenger,the driver again.

After a moments confused silence he just raises a finger and says ""Excuse me please ,I'll just be one moment.""

And so he does the best thing he could do in this situation,call the base and ask them what he should do.

One day during the Gulf War, an Iraqi general and his army were patrolling through semi-mountainous terrain. Suddenly, over one of the hills they hear a soldier.

""One American soldier can take out 10 Iraqi soldiers!""

The Iraqi general smirks, then sends 10 of his soldiers over the hill. A brief firefight ensues, and then everything goes quiet...

""One American soldier can take out 100 Iraqi soldiers!""

The Iraqi general is rightfully impressed, so he laughs and sends 100 of his soldiers over the hill to finish the job. A large battle is heard over the hill that lasts much longer than the previous fight. Finally, everything calms down...

""One American soldier can take out 1000 Iraqi soldiers!""

The Iraqi general is furious, and sends over 1000 of his best soldiers. A massive and lengthy battle takes place over the hill. During the fight, a wounded Iraqi soldier comes crawling back over the hill toward the general.

""What are you going to do.?"" the homeowner asked. 

""I'm going to put this ladder up against the roof, then I'm going to go

Puzzled by this house in the middle of nowhere, they decide to look inside one of the windows to see if they can get any idea of what's going on. Upon looking in, they see an old man with his eighteen young, beautiful daughters. They decide that it is at least nothing paranormal, and decide to ask for shelter for the night. So they knock on the door. Almost immediately, it opens, and the man waits expectantly for them to start.

The first friend decides he will be bold, and asks, ""Sir, may I sleep with your daughters tonight?""
The man says, ""You can sleep with my pigs in the barn over there, or chance your luck in the woods.""
The first friend decides to stay in the barn.

The second friend asks, ""Sir, may I sleep with any one of your daughters tonight?"" 
The man replies, ""No. You can sleep with my chickens in the barn.""
And so the second friend also ends up staying in the barn for the night.

The third man humbly asks, ""Kind sir, may I seek shelter in your house for the night?""
The man says, ""For not asking, you may sleep with my daughters tonight.""
The third friend eagerly heads to the bedroom.

Next morning, the man bids the friends good luck, and shows them a trail to follow to get out of the forest. As they walk down the track, the first friend says, ""I feel like a pig, since I had to sleep with them all night.""
The second friend says, ""I feel like a chicken, because I had to sleep with them all night.""
The third friend thinks for a second, then says, ""I feel like a golfer, because I got into all 18 holes.""

Although he did not identify the man, he confirmed the man has been charged by the FBI with carrying weapons of math instruction.

‘Al-Gebra is a problem for us’, the Attorney General said. ‘They derive solutions by means and extremes, and sometimes go off on tangents in search of absolute values.’ They use secret code names like “X” and “Y” and refer to themselves as “unknowns” but we have determined that they belong to a common denominator of the axis of medieval with coordinates in every country.

theretheresweetthing,8,,7,1q5tu3,,9,"A few years ago, there was a hitman named Artemis who was known and sought after for his uncanny ability to strangle people. One day, he got an assignment from the local mob to take out a man who owed huge amounts of money and was refusing to pay it back. Artemis took the job, but the man turned out to be almost impossible to find. The target would seemingly vanish whenever Artemis was in the vicinity and tracking him was practically impossible.

However, one day Artemis got a call from his boss. The man had been spotted at a local Kroger and, since nobody knew when he would appear again, Artemis was to strangle the man in the store. Artemis was reluctant at first, but he was getting very tired of the long project and agreed to track the man inside.

Luckily, Artemis was able to corner the man in the produce aisle and strangle him. Unluckily, just as he was laying the man's body down, a woman came around the corner. Artemis panicked and in his desperation strangled the woman, only to see a poor store clerk out of the corner of his eye. Artemis strangled this man too. Finally, a manager came around the corner and also met his end.

All of this became too much for Artemis to cover up and he was arrested outside of the store. The next day, the local paper ran the headline:

The man said that he would allow her to stay in his attic and he would provide food, as long as they could make love at his whim. The girl gladly agreed.

The urn was all dusty and dented and cracked and bent and generally broken. However, Benny decided to rub the urn with his sleeve, thinking he might be able to get a few coins out of it. But suddenly, out of the urn came a Genie!

The genie stretched and yawned and said: ""Oh! Thank you! Thank you so much! I can't tell you how long I've been in that urn! You're a lucky man, fella. Very lucky.""

""Why?"" said Benny.

""Because you've got wishes coming your way, friend. Three, to be exact.""

So Benny thought for a while and said, ""Ok, I want some new threads."" And thus he got a fancy toga. And then he said ""I could use a new house."" And a fancy mansion made of fine marble popped up.

Finally, Benny said: ""And, for my final wish, I'd like to be immortal. I wanna live forever.""

The genie was taken back a bit and thought for a while: ""Well, that's, um, that's a bit of an expensive wish, you see. Hm. Tell you what. I'll make you immortal, but on one condition. You can never, ever, shave your beard or cut your hair. If you do, you're gonna get sucked into an urn. That's how I ended up like this. Deal?""

""Deal,"" said Benny.

So the Genie granted his wish and Benny began wandering the world. He saw Rome rise and fall, the Dark Ages get lighter, the New World grow and prosper. He went all over the planet, from China to Germany to Canada to Brazil. But all this time, Benny had never fallen in love.

But one day, Benny came across a beautiful woman on the beach. He walked up to her and introduced himself. And as the woman brushed the hair out of his face they gazed into each other's eyes, and it was love at first sight. They danced and they laughed and they sung, and it was a happy time for both of them.

One day, on the same beach they had met on, Benny got down on one knee and asked the woman to marry him. The woman thought for a while.

""Benny,"" she said, ""I'll marry you. But only if you shave your beard and cut your hair. It's long and dirty and full of rats, and whenever we go to see a movie it takes up eight seats.""

Benny sat down and mulled this over. The Genie and the urn were long gone, he thought. Who would notice if he cut his hair and shaved his beard. He happily agreed, and went to the pharmacy and bought 400 disposable razors and 25 cans of shaving cream.

He went into the bathroom, and waved to his girlfriend, saying he'd be out in a bit. You could hear the *chic, chic* of the razor and the *pst, pst* of the shaving cream. Then suddenly, it all went quiet.

His girlfriend, after a while, knocked on the door. *Tap tap* ""Benny?"" *Tap Tap* ""Benny?!"" *TAP TAP* ""BENNY?!?""

Finally she pushed open the door, and on the ground lay around 8 cubic yards of hair, and an urn.
