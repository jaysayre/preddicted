Kahluka,0,3,1ripm6,6,I used to work at a local fast food franchise and there I met the two most frustrating people I have ever met Along with a few other lovelies along the wayLet me introduce our duo here Their nicknames in this story will be Crabbey and Sandy Vagina These were their nicknames at work yes were mature Crabbey and SV were the children of the owner who owned five restaraunt in our town and a surrounding town three in one and two in the otherSV has worked at one located in a mall as a teen and then later moved to another when he got older The man managed to drive both stores into the ground This is seriously the only job the he has ever held and he got made GM at my store Crabbey had been fired by her own brother  times when I started working there and lost every other job she ever had SV would loudly say to anyone who would listen that she needed to marry rich or die in a gutter shes fucking uselessAs it says in the title these guys are spoiled and bitchy They start fights with anyone and everyone for no reason yet SV is a pushover I once went to him threatening sexual harrasment because I was sent home for being a woman Seriously My managers girlfriend also a manager didnt want me there because I might try to fuck her boyfriend in the cooler He openly admitted this to me in front of another employee SV panicked tried to make peace between me and the other woman She simply ripped him a new asshole and he rolled overI should also mention that other employees would constantly sneak off to smoke a joint or get wasted in the cooler Itll come as no surprise to most fast food workers but he knew and didnt give a shit Customers often complained that the store reeked of weed when they smoked in the cooler and the female manager from earlier got caught by customers more than one with liquor on the desk Never said anything or fired anyone As for Crabbey she just went around causing hell with everyone She was constantly glued to her phone was loud and lazy as hell She would wear gloves while she texted and then prepare food with those same gloves More than once customers complained about that and she would give them attitude right back She also felt the need to let any complaining customers know that her dad was the owner So of course theyd call him directly It was damn entertainingMy favorite thing about Crabbey was how she was addicted to everything she put in her body Soda Her lifeblood Weed OmgIneedtosmokeabowlNOW While standing in front of customers no less When she tried to quit smoking cigarettes she went to the hospital claiming she was dying She missed her shift because she lacked nicotine You know what was wrong She was dehydrated because she doesnt drink water Apparently its disgusting because it doesnt taste like anything But she drank pink lemonade for water SrslyThe list goes on and on I have a lot more funny stories of these two From Crabbey dating a guy who smokes meth to SV throwing temper tantrums in front of customers Arguments swearing and screaming in front of people I could write for hours Maybe Ill add another installment tomorrow if its wanted ,Spoiled catty and working for daddy A tale of a brother and sister working together,9,talesFromRetail
Scott,0,2,1riony,14,Ive met a lot of strange customers in my time at the casino This guy takes the cake as the most fuckedup unpleasant guy thats ever darkened our doorstep Well call him Dick because he is oneTo begin with Dick is in the casino for a fuckedup reason Hes dying of cancer or some other terminal disease He spends his last days in our casino trying to win an inheritance for his children Of course mathematics says its not going to happen so hes squandering what money he does have and the remainder of his life sitting in a smoky room with no natural light playing  per spin on a slot machine I wouldnt judge him so harshly for that if he wasnt a colossal asshole Pretty much everyone who has had to pay a jackpot for him has some sort of unpleasant experience to share Mine was when I was processing a jackpot for him and I go to clear the jackpot message from the screen See if you win say  and you had  in credit when you hit it when the attendant clears the jackpot your  will still be left on the machine People sometimes forget or dont know this and will leave the money on the machine and walk away so after clearing it most of us will say You still have  left on the machine Of course when I mention this to Dick he flies into a rage screaming I CAN SEE THAT GOD I started dodging his jackpots when I knew where he was playing after thatI dont put up with that sort of BSthough I still had to pay him out a couple of times after that because I didnt realize who it was And Dick did hit a lot of jackpots He would usually destroy the copy of the WG tax forms we would give him I guess thinking since hes dying he wont need to worry about paying taxes though you would think he would realize his kids would be on the hook for all of it He also had the tendency to swear ambiguously so you never really knew whether he was calling the machine or you a piece of shit Management had talked to him a couple of times about treating the attendants better He did tip the bare minimum to not be considered an ass in that department at leastAll of that is backstory to properly put in context what happened this week At this point Dicks managed to piss off enough attendants that most of the shift is dodging his calls so it takes him probably twice as long to get someone over there than it would anyone else This coupled with the fact that hes losing heavily pisses him off Management gets called over to a machine in my section Im generally pretty curious about these things so I head over there The machines touchscreen retail price quoted to me by a tech as  or so is totally shattered The machine still has  on itwith an inoperable touchscreen theres no way to cash that out on this machine Theres a patron further down the bank who saw the whole thing Said the guy was losing got pissed punched the screen threw a piece of paper down and stormed off One of the managers that showed up picks up the paperIts a tornup WG with Dicks name address and social security number on it A little bit of searching in the computers turns up copies of his driver license and the hotel room he is in And of course the whole incident is caught on tapeWe dont know what happened to Dick after that Apparently it became the responsibility of the casinos assistant general manager and she isnt talking Were all watching the usual locations for ban notices to go up though,The worst casino patron in the world,16,talesFromRetail
GlowingBall,2,3,1rioer,15,These are my Tales of Retail Loss PreventionPart Three  Citizen Snips Aka  The Pants AquaticAs a recap for those of you who have never read one of my stories before  I am a male in the midwest who is on the wrong side of his twenties and works retail loss prevention for a major retailer one of the Big   I am underpaid for what I do but enjoy my job none the less  A majority of my time is spent wandering the floor or watching middle aged moms shop for clothing far too skimpy on them via CCTV closed circuit television or security cameras  Every once in awhile I get a case that is just so mind blowingly WTF that I have to share  This story opens up with me doing just as I said above  watching people on CCTV  It is a blisteringly cold afternoon so the customers far more content to stay in their warm homes and snuggled beneath their blankets are few and far between  I as the ever watchful hawk of justice that I am was busy playing a Marvel version of Candy Crush Saga  My job provides me the liberty of slacking off a good amount and my boss is rather lenient as long as I continue to bring in a good amount of stops per month  I am sitting there diligently trying to match up small colored tiles with one another when I am startled by a sudden ring  the phone is going off  Now the phone going off is common place  We get tons of calls a day ranging from the frozen dairy department calling to tell us a temperature alarm is going off we knowit goes off for us as well to people asking us to deactivate a door alarm we also knowwe see you standing at the door  This happened to be a call from one of the few places that doesnt call us often  the meat department  The guy on the other end a tall black man with more muscle than he knows what to do with calls to tell us that there is a guy standing in front of the freshly butchered meat  The guy has refused any help the meat employee has offered and continues to say he is just browsing for over ten minutes  This strikes me as rather odd  Who just hangs out around the meat department  I quickly devise a plan for the situation  I tell the employee to walk into the back so I could see just what the person was going to do  The employee hangs up and walks over to the man to let him know he is going to be into the back and to ring the bell if he needs anything  No sooner than when he had walked into the back but the man glanced around and then walked behind the counter  My adrenaline already began to rush as my suspicions came to fruition  he was going to steal  Oh shit here we go  I declared only to watch in confusion and frustration as he walked right past all the glass displays full of meat and right over to the lobster tank  Now if you arent familiar with these tanks they are exactly just what the name implies  a water filled tank full of live lobsters we sell by the pound  Their claws are bound and they just kind of hang out crawling all over one another  Kids love to sit there and watch themNo wayis he really going to I whispered as I watched on in awe  Sure enough he reached right into the live lobster display tank we have  After a moment of fishing around he plucked the lobster he wanted from the tank and pulled it out of the water  Before I could even make heads or tails of the situation he glanced around once more and shoved the lobster right down the front of his pants  The guy whom shall be hence forth called Lobster Johnson then proceeded to shuffle run his way out of the meat department and through the grocery department towards the front of the store  The only way I can really describe how he ran was a forward version of Zoidbergs shuffle  All he was missing was yelping out Woop woop woop woop loudly as he went  Needless to say he wasnt too hard to stop  I may not be in the best shape of my life but I can still move quicker than a guy with a large lobster squirming around in his pants  He didnt fight me at the door or even try to argue what he was doing  After all it is kind of hard to argue that you arent stealing when you have a large lobster shaped bulge in your pantsBonus icing on top of the cake I usually ask the person why they are stealing  It usually wont change anything but it fulfills my curiosity and keeps them talking which usually calms them down a bit  This guy tried to say that he was stealing the lobster for his kidsHis kids have some expensive tastes,Loss Prevention Tales Pt   Citizen Snips,18,talesFromRetail

DrunkenBlackBelt,7,9,1rhw8z,58,Im back bitches  About  months ago I got a second job working part time at a mens Big ampTall store  The hours are easy commision is alright and to be honest the customers are generally friendly and awesome  It helps that a lot of them dont have anywhere else to shop Unfortunantly the store isnt as eventul as my past retail jobs  Its just selling clothes and shoes  But Ive gotten a few funny stories that Ill share over time here And with the holidays coming up im sure Ill have plenty more  Welll for your pleasure hopefully I present Boy Are My Feet SoreWARNING GROSSSo recently I began working in a mens store for Big amp Tall sizes  I knew of it because I buy my shoes there  Only store that carries a size   I am too small for the clothes despite being  and slightly overweight  And if Im being honest  seeing some of the people who come in makes me more motivated to keep losing weight  lbs this year alone  Now dont get me wrong SOME of the people have legitimate health concerns  One gentleman was born with his left foot backwards  During his childhood they would constantly have to break his foot set it slightly closer to the proper position let it heal and repeat But it never set  correct keeping him from being able to run or exercise or even stand for long periods of time  Its guys like him I feel for  Given a shitty deal in life and just having to suffer for it Most customers however are just plain old fat guys  I dont want to sound mean or fat shame  But its just poor lifestyle choices and such  I was there  I was lbs shy of  last new years  And it was just being lazy and making bad choices  I dont have as much sympathy for these guys  And that brings us to our story todayIts a sunny fall day  Its midweek and pretty dead  Im in my suit fixing clothes putzing around pretty much just pretending to work  I hear the door chime and in walks an older couple  Probably late s very early s  The lady was using a walker to move around and the gentleman was resting his weight on a cane as he slowly moved with her  They seemed like a nice enough couple but as you know those are the ones who always turn into assholesI introduced myself asked how I could help them that day  The man gruffly replied shoes  I brought them to the shoe department  Now my store is small and there is only one small bench to sit on and its in the shoe department  Naturally this oaf takes the seat leaving his frail wife to stand  I could tell she was having difficulty being particularly petire and frail so I went in the back and got her a folding chair to sit in next to her husband  She thanked me because manners  The man charming fellow that he was just said can you get me some shoes now  It was about this time that I realized this was going to go south faster than a my ex gf in a dick sucking contestI offered several suggestions as the gentleman didnt seem to know what kind of shoes he wanted  The man complained that most of our shoes dont even fit him I expressed sympathy as I have large feet and can only fit into the largest size available in store  The man looked me up and down and sneered Well you just have big feet I have a health condition that causes this so consider yourself lucky  Eventually we found a pair he liked and thought may just fit his feet  And thats when the real horror of this story starts  The man then proceeds to roll up his sweatpants  He was wearing ankle socks and sandals  His feet are hugely swollen and covered in open sores  This guy has diabetes and its eating away at his foot  Sadly its fairly common where I work  What came next however is notI hand him the shoes and take a step back giving him some space to put the shoes on look at them in the mirror see how they feel etc  NOPE  He looks at me like an idiot and says Well I cant put them on myself  I cant bend that far  Put them on for me   Now I am no fan of feet even on a good day  Sure if Im dating someone and they want a footrub and their feet are clean then ill oblige  But other than that I just want nothing to do with that area of the body  Add to the fact that we are talking about a stranger whose foot is literally covered in open oozing sores  DBB Sir I just cant do that Im sorryMan  You need to help me  Im a customer and I need serviceDBB There is no way I am doing that sir  I am sorry but you have open sores on your foot and leg Its unsanitary for both me and YOU to have me do thatMan Oh just wash your hands after itll be fineHow this man survived  or so years with logic like that will forever amaze me  DBB Absolutely not  Man I want the manger  Ill have your ass for discrimination and harrassmentDBB  I am the manager  If you want the store manager call back tomorrow  If you want corporates phone number Ill give it with my name gladly  The man continued to yell and scream about receiving the shoes at a discount and having me fired  Typical stuff for anyone who works in retail really  I essentially told him that I wasnt going to touch his feet and if he didnt like the service he could leave Wife is trying to keep the peace  Its not very effective  Husband used Rage  Its inneffective against DBB  Besides my DEF is to high  Anyways i wish there was some more to this  Eventually he stormed out as dramatically as one can when you can barely walk under your own weight and your wife is frail and moves about as fast a christian school girl with a chastity belt  I did hear from corporate the next day though  Naturally some of the details were changed when he called in but once I explained about the sores I receieve a Yea that happens all the time Dont worry about it  Sorry if its not very exciting  Im sure Ill have some good ones coming up  Hope you all are surviving the holidaysTLDR  I never understood foot fetishes,NEW Tales from a Former LP Boy Are My Feet Sore,67,talesFromRetail

adelajoy,15,17,1rg29x,69,I spent two years working at a big warehousestyle grocery store I worked mostly as a cashier but I also ran the customer service desk a few times a weekMost of the crappy moments have all blurred together but there are a few particular moments that stick outThis grocery store is the only one in the area that doesnt bag your groceries for you Each till has two long conveyor belts to hold your groceries while you bag them Both the customer and the cashier have buttons to move the groceries down away from the till This speeds orders up requires less staff saves money and drops prices People occasionally complain about it but if they want to pay more for their groceries and have someone else bag them theyre welcome to  The store isnt exactly famous for customer service but I think the prices make up for thisI was one of the fastest cashiers on staff at the time This meant that my belts would often get full I had ways to deal with this I knew how fast people packed I knew how soon a belt would clear I was really good at my job One day the lines were insanely long I was working really fast everyone was buying a lot I got to a point that there were groceries on both of my belts so I squeezed the smaller order down a little watched for a moment and knew that he would be down before the next order crowded him I started scanning the next order and smiled at the customers  a man and his very pregnant wifeThe wife snapped at me Can you just waitExcuse meCan you wait I dont want you to crowd out that other guyI looked and he was literally loading his last bag with groceries I stopped scanning anyways and maybe glared at the lady I dont really like it when other people tell me how to do my jobEventually he was packed and gone so I started scanning again While I had been waiting I had lined all of their canned goods up I can scan cans super fast if theyre all really close I started scanning the canned goods grabbing a can tossing it to my other hand and setting it on the other belt Except that this woman had walked around The belt she got was behind me and was standing behind me trying to bag the cans as I scanned them Im sorry but Im not actually looking where the cans go I know the space and I need to watch the computer screen not my hands Well she kept trying to grab the one Id just set down which meant that I kept hitting her hand with the next can I wasnt by any means throwing the cans but I was moving quickly and she was in my space so she was getting hit I didnt actually realize that I was hitting her until she complained to her husband So I slowed down apologized and moved on to her other groceriesShe then had a bag of apples She had grabbed one of our bags and put three different apples in it and tied it shut I have to weigh each type of fruit separately so I opened the bag weighed the first apple set it aside I noticed her husband grabbed the apple right away I weighed the second apple and set it aside He grabbed that one too When I weighed the third my plan had been to put all three back in the bag and tie it shut but the other two apples were gone I tied the bag around the last one and set it on the belt If the husband wanted to pack the apples separately he was welcome toThe couple also bought about half a dozen little bags of frozen perogies One of the bags had been ripped all the open right down the middle and frozen perogies were laying all over the belt I considered not telling them because I was mad but I took a deep breath rounded up all of the stray perogies put them in a plastic bag and informed the lady I asked her if she would like me to send for a new bag She snippily replied Yes as if I should have just known Some people dont bother to get a new bag because it can hold up the line so I always ask Our runner quickly returned with an identical bag and I kept goingWhen I finally finished They bought a lot of stuff the husband paid while the wife stormed over to customer service I watched as she talked to my supervisor and eventually a store manager I was getting pretty nervous Oh also I should mention this woman was rude and snapped every time I asked her a question I was pretty angry by the time they leftAfter they were completely done my supervisor closed my till and asked to speak to me at customer serviceShe said the lady had filed a formal complaint against me Apparently the conversation went something like thisPregnant Lady I want to complain about the cashier on till Nice Supervisor Till  Do you mean till  I was on   one of my quicktoanger coworkers was on PL No I mean NS Like the girl with brown hair not the blondePL getting frustrated YesNS So what did adelajoy doPL She was rude and short with meNS Adelajoy Are you surePL Yes She also threw canned goods at me ripped open a bag of perogies scattered them everywhere and scattered all of my apples too She also bruised all of my fruit because she was throwing them aroundA store manager was brought down to take a formal complaint which means it probably went in my employee file The lady was calmed down and left and that was the end of it Typically the store managers will meet with you to discuss complaints and make sure they wont happen again The fact that I didnt means either the manager simply didnt believe the woman or wasnt concerned because it was my first and only The supervisor who helped her said she closed my till because I looked upset and she thought I needed a break The only reason she told me was to find out what really happened I told her my side and she just laughed it off I admitted to being short and snippy but the rest was just ludicrous I still cannot beleive she blamed me for the bag of perogies being ripped open considering I told her about them got a new bag and spent a minute or two picking up all of the perogies Also why would I take the time to do that when I was clearly rushed with everything elseI get that pregnant women have a lot of hormones and tend to be angry shorttempered whatnot but I think theres a line Also the fact that her husband didnt stop her stand up for me or admit to grabbing all the apples kind of pissed me offTldr Crazyhormones pregnant lady complained about me but the supervisor didnt believe her,In my spare time I like to rip open your groceries and scatter them,86,talesFromRetail
BraveSouls,10,11,1rfyes,34,Some background I work for a privately owned consignment shop For those that dont know its a secondhand shop though we also sell new items but not like pawn shops where the owners can get a loan for an item or get paid the least amount the shop workers can get away with for the items before they resell them We take the items in and once they sell we get a commission off the sale and the original owners get a check in the mail once a month We sell both in store and on eBay  spacer  spacer  This little old lady walks into the shop one afternoon looking for furniture for her daughter She had just moved into a new apartment and she has nothing to put in it I smile thinking thats very nice of the lady to come in with the intention of getting things for her daughter The greater majority of our big furniture is right in the middle of the store when she walks in so she looks around while I go back to my laptop to continue working on an eBay listing  spacer      spacer  She asked me random questions here and there about the different items then finds her way to the back where we have a large screen TV for sale She calls my attention and the conversation went something like thisOld Lady How much for the TVMe OL Okay Ill probably take it Does it come with a remote  spacer  spacerMy boss who was processing item drop offs overheard and said there wasnt one with the TV but we had a separate remote next to it It was one of those big button universal remotes that likes to think bigger is better Note I know why theyre really that size At this point she told me she planed on getting the TV and the remote but she had no idea how it worked and asked me about it I anticipated this question when my boss mentioned the remote so rather than try to explain to her how to use the remote on the TV I told her Id be right back and to feel free to look around more  spacer  spacer  I noted the brand of the TV cant remember what it was and went to my laptop with the remote I look up the instructions for that specific remote since it didnt have any with it and also looked up the codes for the TV I wrote everything down on a piece of paper and then went over exactly what she had to do with the remote to get the TV working with it I figured showing her rather than just telling would be better The whole process took about  minutes including the other questions she had about stuff in the store She was very grateful and purchased the TV remote and a wall plaque  spacer  spacer  The next trick was getting the TV into her car This wasnt a flat screen It was one of those TVs that liked big butts and it cannot lie It was also very heavy So while she was pulling her car up front my boss and I were trying to figure out how we were getting the behemoth from the back of the store to the front and into her car Silly him doesnt have a dolly so Im looking for something with wheels on it while he takes measurements I look outside and see this tiny station wagon right up front and my heart drops just a little Im worried it wont fit but he is unfazed He works with the lady to pull down seats and clear space Turns out it was going to be a tight fit but my boss was just fine with holding it for her in the store since she had paid for it for a week or two until she could get someone with a bigger car to help her with the TV He sends me out with a sticky note to get her name and number since she didnt want to come back inside  spacer  spacer  OL So now whatMe Ill just get your name and number and well put a SOLD sticker on the TV until you can come pick it upOL Okay but what about my moneyMe Huh Thinking uh ohOL Can I get my money back I dont know if Ill have someone who can take it out of my car for me when I get homeMe Well we certainly will hold the TV for you until youre ready to pick it up since youve already paid for it We wont be able to hold it for your otherwise Its worth noting here that she originally asked if she could put a deposit down to hold the TV But as it was only  and my boss had been burned by this more than once before on higher ticket items he doesnt allow deposits for items anymoreOL I know but Im worried about getting it out of my car Can I just get my money backMe Oh boy Im sorry but youll have to come back in and talk with my boss about this  spacer  spacer  The shop has a no returns policy My boss sometimes makes exceptions for some electronics when a customer worries if itll work or not but hes otherwise firm against returns This is due to the nature of the business Someone pays for a consigned item we send a sale check out to the consignor then that person decides to try to return it afterward isnt exactly good for business Either way I couldnt give it to her so she came back inside and gave him the same story He said almost the exact same things as I did but she was adamant yet still nice about it so he gave her the return for the TV and the remote She didnt ask for a return on the plaque and he later told me he wouldnt have anyway She thanks us and leaves   spacer  spacer  We were both more than slightly frustrated and irritated at the whole situation At the very least we didnt have to move the TV Its still sitting in the shop looking for a home Poor thingspacer  spacerTLDR Self conscious TV develops disorder after not fitting in an old ladys car All it plays is the Food Network nowThanks for reading,I know I spent a lot of your time but can I get a return Tales from a Consignment Shop,45,talesFromRetail

MysticSpiral,3,8,1rfdiq,44,Greetings fellow retail workers happy Thanksgiving While we all wait for ThursdayFriday this week I think it would be good for us all to focus on the positive We have all had them the customers that make us laugh smile or say the inappropriate thing that we ourselves were thinking but couldnt say out loud One of my favorite stories takes place on a Sunday Im not sure what it is but Sundays are awful No matter where I have worked Sunday has brought out the mean demanding and crazy customersThis Sunday was no different I was working open to close and everyone was as pissy and demanding as possible I was exhausted and flying on autopilot when a middle aged woman approached my counter to pay for a few items The items she had chosen were final sale pieces Even though these items say final say in red on the tag I will always remind customers that these pieces can not be returned or exchanged which of course people try to do at least once a week  So I greet this fabulous lady and begin to ring up her selection I launch into my usual spielNow these are final sale pieces which means they cant come back or be exchangedCue the customer throwing her arms up towards the heavens and proclaiming in a loud voice WHAT DO YOU MEAN I CANT BRING BACK THIS FIVE DOLLER SHIRT WHATEVER WILL I DO OH NO I DONT KNOW HOW I WILL LIVE WITH KNOWING I CAN NOT RETURN THISIll admit at first I thought she was serious and was bracing myself for the onslaught because that had been my whole day up til that point Then a beautiful thing happened She put her arms down smiled at me winked and said I think I will survive paying five dollars for a shirt and not being able to return itI blinked as I processed what had just happened and then I just lost it I laughed so hard I rang her up and while still giggling informed her that she had just made my day and won my coveted favorite customer if the day award She laughed I laughed My Sunday got a little betterSo before Black Friday lets take a second and remember our favorite awesome customers and share the encounters that made us laugh and made our work days worth it,Remembering the Good Times,52,talesFromRetail
LossPreventionSucks,24,22,1rfcsa,84,This is my first time posting here but Ill just warn you this can get a bit winded  Ive yet to be able to REALLY rant about this guy as my manager mentioned I should keep quiet about the whole ordealNow I work for a popular gaming store chain  Im sure you can guess which one  Ive heard the horror stories however Ive had an amazing experience working there up until I met our Loss Prevention ManagerTo start the day off I had to open  I went in about  minutes earlier than usual because we had a heavy load from the night before thanks to the XBox One launch  I wanted to clean everything up before customers started piling in  I already told my manager I was just going to leave earlier in the day so we didnt go over hours and he was totally fine with that  Anyway  minutes after walking through the door a group of people start banging on the door relentlessly yelling IM HERE LET ME IN  I ignore them for the first  minutes I mean gates are down and they are banging on the door exactly where our hours are posted and its almost  hours before open  I walk up to them and inform them we open at   The man quickly snaps Bullshit We were told by StoreManager that you opened early today for the system release  So I texted my manager and sure enough he said Absolutely not  If theyre picking a system up let them in though  I asked if they were picking a system up and he responded with No I want to return this stuff holding up at least  worth of XBox games and a system  I told him he would have to wait as my computers are still down  He finally agreed and left only to call every  minutes or so and ask if we were open yet For the next hour and a half  Now because this guy was so persistent I decided to leave the safe cracked open so we didnt have to wait for the  minute timer to go up  I figured hed come back right away  That was my first mistake  He never did come back and due to us being so busy and me being the only one there I forgot that the safe was cracked just a tiny bitOn to the second half I was there alone all morning  I had several people asking for systems which require me to go through a locked door through a hallway and into another locked door to get to  I have to do this for each system whether or not  people in line are waiting for a system  This gives  minutes of time each time I have to get a system where there is absolutely no employees covering the store  So what did I do  I propped the first door open  Mistake number twoAfter a bit my parttimer came in   minutes after opening I repeat we were open for  whole minutes at this point  of which I had spent alone with nearly  customers in the store picking up systems In walks our Loss Prevention guy  I didnt know he was Loss Prevention though No He instantly walks in starts yelling at my parttimer about the door and she directs him to me as she had just gotten there  Still no introduction the following commencedFatLossPreventionMan  Why the hell is the back door openMe  Can I help youFatLP  IS YOUR SAFE OPEN  WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU THINKING remember theres multiple people in the store at this point several in lineMe oh fuck   stutter stutterYeah there was an incident this morning where I had a return but he never showed up  I also needed to add change to the registerFatLP You cant do this  Are you the managerMe No may I ask who you areFatLP beaming Im Dave  Im here to audit and help with customersMe  Okay  Yeah I messed up  Its been a hectic morningAfter this exchange he continued to point out every thing that was wrong in our store  Mind you Im not the manager  Im not even assistant manager  Im a store worker who gets paid  cents more than minimum wage with manager duties  He continued to attack my coworker and I about controllers being live on the floor hanging on pegs  feet in the air saying someone could jump up and knock them off to steal them I wanted so badly to ask him to show me how  He then answered phones with just Hi this is Dave  No greeting nothing Just Dave  Then he proceeded to hang up on the people when he didnt know the answer These people then called back so they could complain to meAt this point he had yelled at my coworker and I loomed over us and degraded us so badly that I was near tears  He walked around the store talking to our DM about how pathetic this was and how incompetent the work is that he is seeing  Several customers had come up expressing their concern for my coworker and I  The best part was when I was actually shedding tears and helping a customer while Dave looked on giving no personal space  The customer asks Are you okay and Dave butts in Shes fine Do you want the GPG  I said nothing I was beaten and I couldnt do anything  The entire two hour period this man was there he told me about  different things that I had done that was a terminable offense  I was afraid if I said anything more that I would be done And I need this job  Anyway Theres a lot more about working at this game retailer that I could share mostly from corporate but this is by far the worst experience Ive ever hadTLDR  Shitty customers banging on the door  I screw up Loss prevention guy comes in to tell me how much of an incompetent human being I am pushing me to tears,Nothing like being degraded in front of the whole store to end the week This is long I apologize ahead of

prickelypear,23,28,1rf2t9,186,Ive lurked for a while and decided to share one of my experiences that I can rememberI used to work in a big name retail store in a college town we usually got a lot of college kids due to this obviously and they were generally pretty laid back customers But of course we got older customers as wellOne night I had a woman with her college aged son come through my line It was close to the beginning of a new semester and she was clearly buying him items to put in his dorm or apartment so he would be set for the school semester to come One of items was a basket it looked like wicker but I dont remember what it was exactly Either way when I rang it up it came up full price  and the woman stopped meWoman Thats supposed to be on sale why is it ringing up full priceMe Im not sure Ill get one of the girls from that department to come up and shell know whats going onWhile I ring the operator to get me one of the hard lines girls on the phone or to my till I can hear the woman going on about a Clearance aisle which this store doesnt have we would put little tags buy the price tag on the shelf that stated it was on sale and for how much and how this is so aggravating Finally one of the girls walks up and the woman explains to her that the basket was on the Clearance aisle and its ringing up full price and she knows it wasnt placed there by another customer because there were many of them there The girl from hard lines informs the woman we dont have a Clearance Aisle but she knows where the baskets are and she will go lookWhile we are waiting for the other girl to come back the lanes are backing up Other employees from the floor are coming up to open new tills and help with the load and everyone is displacing from my lane to others The other girl comes back and explains to the woman that the item is not on sale the sale tag was for the baskets next to this one its full price and walks off Woman to me Well he needs the basket for his clothesMe Okay and I start to place it in the bagging areaWoman No Im not paying that price for it I want it for the Clearance price You had it on the Clearance Aisle I want it for Clearance price I dont remember what she was saying the Clearance price was but it was far below the actual price Usually if its less than  we were told just give it to them and even sometimes if its  on something worth at least  But I believe she was saying it was supposed to be Me Maam we dont have a Clearance aisle the basket is full price and I dont have a way to lower it in my systemWoman Thats bullshit if you have it on the Clearance Aisle I should get the Clearance price and you can adjust the priceMe This store doesnt have a Clearance Aisle We have items on sale and they are marked to reflect that but this basket isnt one of themWoman No That basket was on the Clearance Aisle Everything on the shelf around that basket was on sale That one is too Im getting that basket but I am not buying  for it Where are the managers This is bullshit Im not dealing with you anymoreSo with the womans son looking more and more embarrassed by his mother as this goes I call up my manager explain the situation and she comes right up I know what you are thinking because it happens all the time manager comes to front to deal with ridiculous customer customer behaves like a child explaining the issue themselves and threatens all sorts of things manager gives them what they want and customer leaves smug Not this manager she always was my favorite She gets to my till listens to the of course now calm and smiling woman explain why she wanted the manager Woman So see the basket was on the Clearance Aisle but it rings up full price If its not on Clearance then it shouldnt have been place in that aisle and since that is where I got it with many of the same placed there and I need it I expect to get it for the Clearance priceManager Smiling at her We dont have a Clearance Aisle That basket is in the home section with the other baskets We have baskets on sale in that aisle they have tags marking them But this one isnt on sale If you would like to go pick out one of the ones on sale we can put off the transaction and you can go get oneWoman smile now gone and voice getting louder as she goes NO I will NOT go pick out another basket because of your mistakes I got this basket from the Clearance Aisle and I want it for the Clearance priceManager still calm and smiling Well seeing as we still dont have a Clearance Aisle the basket is full price We arent lowering it If you want the basket its  Otherwise we will remove the basket from the purchase you can pay for your other items and leaveWoman screaming at this point Im never coming back here again but Im not done with this yet This is ridiculous Im writing corporate about both of you and how you are trying to swindle your customers I will make sure you both lose your jobs You can keep this shit Im not buying ANY of itAnd with that she stormed off and out the door leaving her son to mutter Im so sorry and chase out the door after her and my manager yelling to have a nice day Before she left my manager grabbed the basket and said she would put it back and not to worry about the woman Nothing was going to happen And nothing did So much for not being done with it yet we didnt hear a thing about about her after that Her son did frequent the store thoughEDIT words and things ,Im not DONE YET,214,talesFromRetail

MrDoctorSmartyPants,24,20,1rep4z,143,A little backstory I worked for a large and generic yet popular apparel retail store for a a little while right when I was getting out of high school I was rarely on the floor as a sales rep because I generally spent my day in the stock room going through endless stacks of shipment boxes however my managers loved the idea of me being on the floor because I am so outgoing and generally enjoy peopleto be quite honest I really enjoyed my time at this storeAll my managers were great it was in a very upscale shopping center so generally the customers were great and everyone I worked with was very cool I literally never had ANY problems with anyone that I worked withI guess it was kind of a utopian retail job  Now a little more background about my particular job responsibilitiesI was the stock room manager I was the person that met the truck at the back door at am every tuesday thursday and saturday  I was the one that printed off the delivery summary from the computer every night before the shipmentI knew how many boxes were coming I was the one responsible for counting each one of the boxes to make sure I got no more or no less than what was on the shipment invoice and I was the one responsible for processing all the shipment  In a nutshell I knew the stock room backwards and forwards knew what we had back there and what we didnt have because I unpacked it organized it and set up carts for employees on the floor to distribute in between helping customers There were rare occasions when  I would emerge victorious from the depths of the stock room having everything processed and put away and I would help out on the register or I would go find things in the stock room for associates on the floor and on occasion I would just help customers with whatever they neededThis particular day I was working the cash registers and a woman comes in who I had seen many times  She was a really nice lady and she even knew me by name because she had enjoyed our interaction on a previous trip to the store and had asked my name to brag to managers about me  A little about our return policyWith a receipt and tags on the clothes there was no time frame for returns  You can buy something put it in a closet for ten years decide you dont want it and bring it back  No problem  If you dont have a receipt and the tags are still on the clothes you can always return themthings stay in the system basically indefinitelybut if you dont have the receipt we scan the bar code and whatever comes up is what you get  If it says  bucks on the tag but comes up  cents you get  cents back  who knows what reduction stickers youve peeled off the tag  So all this being said here is my actual storyand I only remember this because in almost a year this is literally the only negative experience I ever had at this jobNice lady NL comes up to my register with a pair of bright red skinny jeans and drops them down on the counterNL Hi MrDoctorSmartyPants  How are you  I havent seen you the last few times Ive been in hereMe  It has been a while Im doing pretty gooddo you want to return these pants  Do you have your receiptNL I sure dont but Ive never taken the tags off of these as you can see so I can still return them rightMe Yep you sure can but unfortunately if you dont have your receipt I can only give you back what they ring up as and Im sure you bought these a while back because Ive never seen these in this store It should be noted the tag said  bucks for these particular pantsNL  Ok that is fine Ive dealt with that beforebut the tag says  dollars and just because I dont have my receipt doesnt mean I should be penalized and lose money on my purchaseMe I know you come here all the time but without a receipt we have no way to prove that you actually paid this amount for these pants we place stickers to denote sale prices over the original prices all the time and they are easily removed to look like they were never thereand to be honest with you in the time that Ive worked here since the store opened I have never seen these pants did you purchase them at another locationNL  Yes but that doesnt matter because I paid  for them like a year and a half ago and Ive never worn thembut lets just return them and see what I can get back for themMe ok lets seeat this point I scan the item and it comes up no shit at  Ok it says NL WHAT Thats robbery That CANT be rightMe Im afraid thats the best I can do for you I explained our policy and you said you understood  Ive returned things without a receipt for you beforeif I could give you more I wouldbut I cant and I dont have any of these pants in the store to verify a current price other than what the computer reads  NL Well this is absolutely unacceptable  You probably have some in the back that you can check for price so you can see how much these cost meI know the policy but this is a little differenti paid a lot for these pantsthis should be an exception  I want to see a managerMe Maam I am the stock manager I know everything in this entire store and I have never seen these pants beforeIm sure there are none in the back and I wish there was something I could do for you but I cant  Honestly this return policy is rooted in loss prevention and instances like this are the exact reason this policy existsNL Cant you just go look to make sure  Me Sure Ill do that for you  at this point i go in the back and out the back door for  minutes and smoke a cigarette and come back  Nope  We dont have any  what the computer shows is the best I can doNL NO I WANT TO SEE THE STORE MANAGER LESLIE WHERE IS SHEMe She isnt here today maamIm the only manager in the storeNL  Well call herMe I dont have her home number and Im not going to disturb her on a sunday over a cut and dry return policy issue  Im not making you return the pants Im not forcing you to take this moneyyou can keep the pantsNL  This is so stupidI cant believe youre treating me like this I come in here all the time You should make exceptions  Just give me my money and Ill be on my wayI dont want these stupid pantsMe Ok Maamhere you go   Im really sorry for your inconvenience have a nice dayNL  Yeah you ruined this nice day Wait until I talk to your managerI actually saw this lady a couple days later and my store manager and I were chatting in the middle of the store about somethingthe lady walked up and said hello was cordial and never so much as mentioned the incident from a few days prior  Sorry if this is so long it wasnt even that badit just stuck out in my mindTLDR Woman accepted return policy except for when it was going to lose her money and in that instance thought she deserved special treatment EVEN THOUGH she previously said whatever was fine,Woman understands store return policy refuses to believe it should apply to her in this one particular instance,163,talesFromRetail

arsci,56,36,1ren2b,216,All of the talk of black Friday brought up some good memories one of which involves two kids and a rather large gun safe Its kind of a long one but hopefully you all enjoy itA little background I work for a large national farm and ranch supply chain that sells a large variety of items including gun safes This particular story takes place the day after black friday of last year We have several models of these gun safes on the sales floor for customers to see with the largest at the time being an Canon Armory gun safe This thing was MASSIVE compared to the rest of our stock Our store only ever had  of them they never had an official SKUwe had to ring them under the generic merchandise SKU we had them for over a year and after we sold out we never saw them again Now all the safes are electronic keypad and locked by default from the manufacturer but they all ship with the same combination  Most people know this from either asking us to see inside the safes or by just guessing It was no secret and we encourage people to take a good lookIt was the evening and we were working on getting the store cleaned up after a very hectic day Not very many customers were left in the store and things were winding down I was working on restocking the feed when I saw the assistant manager walk by and he looked PISSED And not just end of black friday pissed but someone done fucked up pissed so I went to casually investigate only to find him talking to this giant safe Literally ear to the door asking if it was doing alright Maybe not to the safe but to the person stuck INSIDE the safe Uh Oh Things start running through my headwhy didnt he just unlock it HOW did a person get locked in it Then he pulls me asideAssistant Manager We have a situationMe A situationAM Yes a kid just locked his brother in the gunMe Soo why dont we unlock itAM It wont unlock I think the battery died but I replaced it and its still not workingMe How did he end up locked in itAM His brother apparently Hes over hiding in the feed racks last I saw Not sure where the parents are they havent made an appearance yetI went over and tried it myself and sure as crapits locked And this kid is FREAKING out for obvious reasons We tried a couple other batteries with no luck and even tried swapping the keypad out with the one from the other gun with no luck The parents FINALLY realized their kids were MIA and started asking around and very quickly we determined the kid in the safe was theirs We had taken out the power access port from the pack and passed the kid a flashlight so he could calm down a little and after swapping the keypads out and a fourth set of batteries we called in for backup Assistant Manager called the police while another employee called the safe company to see if there was another way into the safeAfter about half an hour had gone by and the fire department was about ready to cut the back off of it to get the kid out we find out from the safe manufacturer that there is a  minute lockout on the keypadif the battery dies or is removed you cant touch it for  minutes after putting the battery back in So after  long agonizing minutes of listening to this hag of a woman yell at us for not taking enough precautions the safe OPENED And this  year old kid I repeat FIFTEEN YEAR OLD KID comes bolting out of this safe straight into his mothers arms and both of them are sitting of the floor breaking down in tears The police and fire department left pretty quick after that but after the woman and her kid calmed down she UNLOADED on us Complaining about precautions safety how we need to be more responsible and how corporate needs to handle things differently Eventually we stopped herAM Maam your kid walked up to the safe entered in the combination himself that he got FROM YOU and opened the safe Your other child WILLINGLY stepped into the safe and at the exact moment he did the battery died At this point the brother closed and locked the door And its our fault for not taking enough precautionsEventually the woman and her kids left No policies changed except when we give out the combination we use her children as an example of what not to do Gives us all a good chuckle Every couple months she calls and identifies her self as the person whose kid got locked in the safe Usually shes prying to know if weve changed our policies we havent then asks for a discount on whatever she seems to be in need of which she doesnt get Oddly enough its been another year and weve had no incidents of kids locking their siblings in safes Heres to surviving another Black Friday,Two kids and the gun safe,252,talesFromRetail

meguriau,19,13,1refgz,35,Hi TFR Todays Tales from a Hat Boutique httpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailsearchqmeguriauamprestrictsronampsortnewamptall story is brought to you directly from where the magic happens I was really happy with myself but dont have any coworkers to share the moment with Here goes   BackgroundTwo years ago I was employed by an Australian designer brand to sell hats at its flagship store Worn by various celebrities ranging from Hillary Clinton to Sandra Bullock the store attracts a large number of tourists as well as affluent locals The majority of the customers Ive had have been pleasant however there have been interesting characters and even a few nasty pieces of work discontent customers that have come by This collection of tales will be a mixture of my interactions with the most wonderful and absolutely nasty people I have met within this timeStoryThe weather this morning had been rather unremarkable for a spring day overcast with intermittant bouts of sun or rain As a store specialising in hats this does have an detrimental impact on the frequency of local customers On quiet days like these I typically wind up gardening this term is not a euphemism for indulging in cannabinoids behind the desk but rather a routine that consists of spraying the hats with water to reshape them and trimming any stray fibres poking out of the weave It can be mindless and therapeutic at first but only at first Every time you think that hairy hat is as smooth as it will ever be flipping it over reveals another fibre reaching out like that kids in class who knows everything that everyone likes to dislike As a completionist the process invokes feelings of frustration rage and selfpity After this ordeal I often hide behind the counter to take an extended tea break This place is fantastic for a sneaky snack because it faces the entrance is quite elevated so that people cant peer over easily and I can emerge from behind as gracefully as a meerkat when the sensor goes off if need beOne bite into a delicious banana muffin baked by my mother the sensor by the door went off I forcefully swallowed the mouthful with a swig of water emerged from behind the counter to be greeted by an elderly couple poking their heads into the store from the entrance and examining our wares Lets call the man DHS for designer hat snob DHS and wife it so seemed had decided that actually entering the store was too mainstream and clearly blocking the entrance was a great option Pet peeve  Maybe a minute or two had passed when DHS had a revelation He decided to bellow from the entrance to convey his disappointmentHB EXCUSE ME YOU ONLY HAVE LADIES HATSThe brand does stock mens hats In fact there is a display window showcasing the more popular mens styles which he had clearly missed In some ways it is understandable as fedoras are worn by a lot of women lately Unfortunately this question gets asked of me a few times every shift even though there are pictures from photoshoots of manly male models wearing similar hats in the backdrop some of them topless for good measure Pet peeve M We do stock mens hats Theyre just up the back near the counter and to your rightThis appeared to pique his interest Without so much a thank you DHS and wife scuttled over to the mens section Pet peeve  I aimed a friendly smile in their direction to counter the feeling of frustration growing insideDHS rams the nearest ivorywhite  panama hat on his headDHS Its too smallM The mens panamas are sized and do also with internal adjustment so if yoDHS gruntI continued to give him the best smile I could muster Pet peeve DHS flips the swing tickets over to look at the price and flips outDHS Ridiculous This is more expensive than a Borsalino For those of you that are unaware Borsalino is a Italianmade designer hat brandHe stared at me expectantly as though the distasteful look on his face could conjure a discount To be completely honest I know nothing about Borsalino apart from a few basic shapes they carry but of course I wasnt going to let my ignorance be known Knowing I wouldnt get a sale from him anyway I decided to not dignify him with a response and froze my face in a customer service smile Without anything to argue against the pair let out indignant huffs and made their way back to the entrance I sat back down and took a huge bite out of my muffin it tasted like victory I felt like a Magicarp that had finally recognised its shortcomings and slash those that have been laughing at me in the face Later during the day I decided to google the Borsalino online boutique to look at similar hats My findings were interesting For his statement to be true there were two possiblities Yes the hat was more expensive than some similar shaped Borsalino hats However the hat he was referring to was a papier hat  or about AUD  basically a pseudo panama hat made of rice paper and not toquilla palm The panama hats Borsalino sold were in the  range AUD  Currency conversion means nothing to him and therefore   AUD Extra information for anyone interestedHandy tips for finding a suitable hat

believeinsherlock,5,4,1re3dl,26,So I guess I just need to get a bit off my chest and also because I thought Id share what I have to deal almost every week Sorry if this is worded weird Im not the best story teller I work in a printing store Its also a small store so we dont have many staff members There are two people who come in who always create a ruckus take up a bunch of space while ordering their prints and generally become an annoyance When they pick up their prints they will show us old emails or old print outs of promotions and expect us to give it to them for that price They have done this to ever single employee in the store as well Today they came in to order some products There was one that was on sale a week ago but the sale ended After ordering it actually submitting the order through so it makes it a hassle to cancel they came up to me and said that the total was too expensive Not to ask about the price or anything just to tell me it was too expensive and it was cheaper last month and to give them the price from last month When I told them that was not possible since the sale was over they insisted on showing me the email saying it was discounted When I pointed out the ends on date they insisted that the manager said that they could have the price I have a really great manager who doesnt mind us calling them if we need help on the weekends So I do and I explain the situation They said no and also that they had to pick up their order today that they had previously ordered Im not sure where else to add it but Ill tell the story of the nicknamed promotion order now We had a promotion going on for a certain size of product They ordered a bunch of the wrong size and then said that they made a mistake When they ordered it I had gone up to them a couple times to tell them what the promotion was for and how to change the sizes to the right one They dismissed me rudely might I add every single time telling me they knew what size they were getting So when it comes time to pick up they tell me that they picked the wrong size and it was my fault because I should have told them Then they demanded they get the prioducts for that price because it was smaller than what the promotion was for Sorry bud doesnt work that way So back to today I tell them that they need to pick up all their products today Its been a few weeks So I ring it through and again I get a giant hissy fit in my face Theyre screaming when theres a bunch of other customers in the store that its not fair and basically insinuating that its our fault they cant afford everything Then they also started yelling at us because they had forgotten something of theirs in the store we could not find it so we should reimburse them Its not our fault you forgot something two weeks ago and now its gone missing After my coworker calmed them down they went back to ordering more products That they would probably not pay for ,The reoccurring nightmare customers,30,talesFromRetail

Tufty,32,58,1rdse5,292,This is a story from long long ago that I am copying from another website that I posted it to before discovering Reddit I thought you all might enjoy itThis happened a while ago but it just popped into my head so Im gonna do my best to remember itI used to work nights on the checkout of a  hour supermarket Now in this particular store there were certain things that you couldnt do on the checkout without a managers key and a code generally anything that would change the total by more than  including voiding items would require you to call a managerSince we worked nights they gave the key and the code to  women who worked on the cigarette kiosk because they had worked there for a long time there was always at least one of them working and they didnt want us bothering the on duty night manager every time there was any mistake All worked fine normallyUntil the day that neither of these women were in Did the management organise anyone else who had a code to be in the area Did they buggeryThere were  of us working that night and the other  were quite new on the department We did our best but I was the first to go down A customer had read the price on a baby stroller wrong and wanted it voided I put a call out for the on duty manager then apologised to the people in my line and explained that it might take a couple of minutes The line wasnt very long because it was getting quite late There was a little grumbling but everyone seemed fairly understanding minutes pass I put out another call for the manager to come down URGENTLY I advise everyone to start going through the other  tills I am starting to get worried but we still have  tills running so its not the end of the world The lines get longerThen one of the other girls accidentally scans something through twice It happens the scanners sometimes just glitch The item cost more than  and bam  checkouts are locked down I direct people through the lone surviving till The poor girl on there was clearly struggling but there was nothing else to be done I get hold of a store phone and call the manager directly No answer I call again Nothing I put another call out over the speakers Apologise to all customersThen it happens The last till goes down Another double scan The line is  people deep And this is at midnight when its odd to have more than  customer at a time I try to call the manager again Nada I call a team leader explain the problem and beg him to find me a manager any manager I turn to the ever increasing group of customers and do my best to explain whats going on I am practically on my knees begging them for forgiveness Some fo them have been waiting for  minutes I break from the script and try to explain as a human being that there isnt anything I could do I wish there was something anything I could do We cant open any other tills They are all shut down and even if I had the key to turn them on all of our log ins are locked into these tillsFinally someone saunters to the tills They arent a manager They had been sent down by the on duty manager because he had heard that we had too many customers and needed another checkout operator Im getting frantic I send her back to find the managerTime passes People have been waiting for over half an hour now and you can imagine what that looks like Thankfully none of the customers are directing their anger at us but they are all very very angryEventually the manager turns up All good right NopeHe takes one look at the scene And walks away The customers see my face Now they know what the manager looks likeThere is more of the same Frantic phone calls announcements over the speakers Ten minutes that feel like an eternity later the manager calmy walks back into sight and immediately gets collared by the crowd The only good thing that came out of this moment was when several customers took time out of their ranting to defend me it seems my pleas for forgiveness workedThe manager is barely listening to the poor people He keeps interrupting them trying to push blame off of himself This was the first he had heard of the situation Luckily all of the customers had seen me doing everything possible to get hold of him The manager eventually rolls his eyes and wanders off to the office to pick up the keysA full  minutes after the last till went down we finally got the code and unlocked the tills Did the manager apologise to the customers Nope Did he offer them anything to make up for the wait Nope Did he apologise to us working on the checkouts for putting us through all that Take a guessAs I rang through the customers I did everything in my meager power to make it up to them It wasnt much but I would accept any coupon they had even if they werent for our store I would accidentally mistype the reduction codes to give them more money off If something wouldnt scan Id just pretend I hadnt noticed and give it to them I knew it would mess up the inventory and probably get me in trouble but I just didnt care at this point When we cleared the line I sent the other  girls off for a break and told them to take an extra few minutes while they were at it When they were gone and I was sure I was alone I spent a minute or two hiding under the till whimpering ,Cashiers Nightmare,350,talesFromRetail
NotACEO,180,224,1rdpxf,901,Heres a relatively short tale today folksIve posted here a few times before and it should bear mentioning that Im a bank teller and have been for  years  My story takes me back to when I first started working as a TellerI had gone through the mandatory day supervised portion of my training and apparently passed with flying colors and was shortly given my own drawer and station within the bank  I was technically under the  day Probationary stage but for all intents and purposes I was a fullfledged employee  Two weeks go by and Im steadily getting more and more comfortable  Any mistakes I made were small and easy fixes until I made a rather large mistake and very nearly shat my pantsA customer walks in hands me his  payroll check and says hed like to deposit it into his account  All right no problem heres your receipt have a nice day  He leaves and thats that  Or so I thought  About  minutes later my supervisor walks up with a piece of paper and says Hey NotACEO did you help this guy a few minutes agoWhen I acknowledge that I did in fact help him with this deposit my supervisor calmly tells me to access this guys account and to tell him if I noticed anything off  So I didand immediately noticed something wrong  Theres a small portion of our teller screens that tells us if there is any activity in that account for the current dayI can see if hes been to the grocery store a gas station or if hes made any deposits  Sitting in the Deposit section iswait for ita deposit made  minutes ago for the nice little sum of   With my teller signature on itRead that sentence above again for me would youI deposited one hundred million dollars into this guys account when it only should have been  dollarsNoticing what I did makes my heart rate skyrocket and the words Ohshitohshitohshit start to fly about in my mind  Im currently trying to think of various ways that I can commit suicide when my dear old teller supervisor starts laughing at me  He affectionately calls me an idiot and carefully walks me through in deleting the transaction and replacing it with the correct amount which I had been completely unaware that we could do up until that pointTurns out I had entered the customers ACCOUNT number in the DOLLAR section which it automatically assumed was the amount deposited  Management thought it was hilarious and had initially meant to make me sweat bullets for a while before telling me how easy it was to fix but apparently I looked like I was legitimately about to have a heart attack so they took pity on meOops,Oh manIm gonna get fired arent I An Amusing Screwup on My Part,1125,talesFromRetail

BreakfastWithReddit,13,17,1rcwf1,14,This is my first post here and as you can read my flair I work fast food parttime and Ive been working here for the past  months While this story may not be about my boss or any customers I just want to share with you how my coworker well call here Sarah to protect her identity has irritated me so much since I started working hereSo here I am an  yearold male working at a restaurant tonight and for this month I have to work the drivethru by using the headset to take orders making drinks and making desserts sometimes all at the same time My hands can get pretty tied up easily once there is a reasonable line of cars lined up Sometimes my manager swings by to help make desserts when he sees that I am making drinks and taking orders at the same timeMeanwhile Sarah is working the window only transacting the money credit cards etc and handing our customers their food Quite obviously I have a bigger job than her and as a human I can make mistakes or be slow at times but its only to provide the same excellent service to each customer I talk to on the headset For example I might miss the chance to make the earlier customers drinks while I am taking the previous customers order For a few seconds of making the drinks delivering them and apologizing for the wait customers are usually very understanding since I expressed excellent customer service when I talked to them via headset they sometimes compliment me on my customer service and I am very grateful that they compliment me and understand when they see I am busy with another customer on the headsetNow insert Sarah into the equation and she stresses me out when I try to do my job If the food was already delivered to the customer at the window and theyre waiting on me to make their drinks I would most likely have another customer giving their order to me on the headset While I am talking to the customer on the headset and I am trying to switch glances from the drink that could overflow and back at the POS where I record the customers order It can be hard at times for me because I really dont want to screw up the drink by letting the soda tea or lemonade overflow or make the liquid too high and when I would punch in the buttons the liquid would spill out of the top This kind of stuff happens frequently and apparently Sarah hates when I make mistakes like thisShe will tell me through a strained voice that I needed to make the drinks much faster and she has been doing this to me all the time but I really want to tell her that maybe I dont want the drink to overflow or maybe that I dont want to make the wrong drink and waste the cup or maybe that I dont want to keep asking the customer what they last said because I couldnt hear what they said when she pretty much shouts at me It makes the customer and I irritated when I have to ask himher again what they recently ordered and I really had enough of her annoyed toneThere were times when I would be taking an order and she would stress on me and I would make a mistake on the customer Im taking an order from When this happens the customers would complain that their order is wrong when it was read back to them for confirmation Sarah would have to ask for a managers card to change the order at the window and then she would deathstare me as if I stepped on her iPhone I really cant say what I feel against her because Im working on the headset which is on  of the time and the customers at the window can hear everything I say and I really wouldnt want to say anything I could regret It just makes me mad because Im doing all of these jobs where one mistake can happen here and there while she only stands there doing her window job and yelling at me when I cant finish a drink for a few seconds She doesnt even help me finish my drinks which would be nice but she only stands there with her claw of a right hand waiting for a cup to snatch She always takes the cup right out of my hand even when its not done so fast that it seems she is more pissed than I am at her It makes me so mad that she doesnt even lend a hand and she just stands there being so ignorant of me while I work  jobs and her job only takes  secondsIm really trying to do my job here and I really try to do everything I can to treat all of our customers with the same quality respect everyone else deserves Before she started bitching at me I tried to interact with her while were on breaks but she mindlessly stares at her phone while wolfing down a chicken sandwich while I try to talk to her She only gave a few quick and blunt words to me and she was obviously disinterested in the interactions so I stopped seeing that I cant break the wall that is her selfishnessThis post is probably very long for you guys and this is more of a rant about Sarah but here is the part that youve probably been waiting for I just wanted to give more background information and context to my situationIt was  pm tonight and my shift was going to end at  pm and there were quite a few customers waiting in line to have their orders taken I had to make a quick largesize Diet Dr Pepper for a customer waiting at the window and one person was telling me to put American cheese bacon lettuce tomato wheat bun and extra pickles on a regular chicken sandwich which had me pressing a lot of buttons At this point it seemed that Sarah had enough of my dawdling and she finally decided to help me finish the drink which was still fizzing at the top I wanted to make sure the customer didnt get cheated for an underfilled large drink and I didnt want it to spill at the same time but after she took my hand to hold it under the Diet Dr Pepper nozzle and tried to shove a lid on the sucker she pulled her hand back too fast and the soda spilled all over my uniform She quickly looked away and went back to her post acting as if it never happened and she left my sticky self in a state of complete rage I wanted to shout profanities kick and scream at her but I quickly suppressed my extreme anger because the customer was still sitting in her car in complete shock of what happened My manager quickly came over and he immediately assumed it was my accident and he told me to clean up in the restroom I was shaking in rage and the cold wet feeling of soda when I cleaned myself up My shift ended when I exited the restroom I immediately clocked out in anger and embarrassment and drove home still smelling of Dr Pepper and my hands stuck to my wheelTLDR Sarah my coworker has some kind of a bad grudge against me

prettehkitteh,24,30,1rcsdq,140,Wall of Text coming tis the season and Im feeling inspired by all these insane posts about people losing their shit over things they dont need I worked in retail for five years off and on as a grocery store cashier so I never really experienced Black Friday  except one year when I got a temp job at a major toy store on the side I started my new job two days before this day of reckoning For some reason the managers thought it prudent to stick the new girl on the front line when the store opened at am I had barely gotten a chance to get familiar with the store layout and we had special areas where the really populardiscounted toys were set up the day before so I pretty much had no idea where anything wasWe didnt get the typical zombies clawing at the windows phenomenon but people were lined up and a few even knocked on the doors because it was snowing outside and they really wanted to get in early I watched with a giant knot in my stomach as my manager unlocked the doors and people nabbed carts and ran inside I was immediately flooded with shouted questionsWHERE ARE THE TICKLE ME ELMOSWHERE IS THE HOMOSAPIEN ROBOT I NEED IT FOR MY SONI NEED A VIDEOGAME WHERE IS YOUR ELECTRONICS SECTIONI did my best to stutter answers out as people didnt even stop moving for me to answer I quickly picked up on where Tickle Me Elmos TMEs from now on were because everyone wanted one I could not believe how many people wanted one I stayed up toward the entrance because I knew if I went into the main sales floor I would get eaten alive and after the initial rush for the first two hours people started being a little more polite though there was still a lot of running and shouting going on That was when crazy beard came inCB was a grungy exconfederatelooking older man with a bandana tied around his head and a big scruffy grey beard all over his face He marched straight up to me and levelly demanded I need a TME Me Of course sir if you follow this aisle to the back and make a right they are in a special display in the middle of the aisle you cant miss themCB Are you sure there are any leftMe I havent been back there in a little while so unfortunately I dont know Im sorryHe waved a hand at me and scurried off I thought that was the end of it A minute later he scurried back visibly a lot more agitatedCB There were no TMEsMe Im sorry sir we did have some this morCB How could you not have any TMEs You must have more in the back I need oneI knew we had put out almost everything we had the night before  there was no backstock I tried to explain this to CB as he started shakingCB I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU COULDNT POSSIBLY HAVE ANY MORE TMEsMe fishing for anything to get this guy off my back IIm sorry sir theres not much I can do If you had gotten here earlier big mistakeCB IT DOESNT MATTER WHEN I GET HERE YOURE A FUCKING TOY STORE HOW CAN YOU NOT HAVE TMES I DEMAND TO SPEAK TO A MANAGERThose magic words I was shaking now I dont handle anger very well and was relieved to get some help I ran to a phone a few feet away and called for help over the intercom CB followed me and lowered his voice to keep grumbling to me about his worldending problem but he seemed to calm down a little now that he knew he had gotten up a rung on the ladder We waited I knew a manager might be a little longer because they were also amidst the throng of shoppers so I tried not to panic and made some small talk with CBFive minutes passed I saw CB getting more impatient so I called again over the intercom trying a joke about how the managers were probably up to their necks with customers CB wasnt amused so I just kept standing there shuffling my feet I couldnt leave the guy so I did my best to answer the couple questions that came my way while I was doing nothing Another five minutes passedCB What the fuck is taking him so longMe I dont know Im so sorry I can go look for a manager if you wantCB Youre staying RIGHT HERE until he shows up I know a cop out when I hear oneMe Im not trying to abandon you sir I want to helpCB You need to get your manager here RIGHT NOW DO YOU HEAR MEI was on the verge of crying at this point I picked up the phone for a third time trembling trying to take a breath so I didnt start crying over the intercom  when the lead manager Tim finally showed up out of breath from hurrying up front so quickly CB immediately looked a lot less threatening compared to Tim who was  built like a linebacker with tattoos on his arms and a long braided black beard Tim who had a heart of gold and cared about his employees asked ME what the problem was which pissed off CB but he looked scared shitlessMe Were out of TMEs and he really would like oneCB Thats RIGHT I have a problem with the fact thatTim Just a moment sir Prettehkitteh thank you you can go back to the frontI scampered away as quickly as possible as Tim started to explain that if we didnt have TMEs we didnt have TMEs I watched as CBs anger overcame his cowardice and he raised his voice a little to be rebutted or cut off each time with Tims best gentle giant voice Within two minutes Tim smiled and pointed out the door CB yelled one last unintelligible word and stormed out Tim came over to me gave me a big hug and told me to go take a breather in the back room The rest of that shift was a piece of cake comparatively and when I left that day I knew the store layout like the back of my hand TLDR Fuck Tickle Me Elmos,My first Black Friday and first TFR post  Tickle Me Elmos,170,talesFromRetail

diinomunster,71,107,1rcku1,391,Hello my lovelies I had a wonderful pa shift Friday into Saturday at my lovely gas stationCStore Im a softy who just cant say no This offense happened around am Now my gas station is in a really dumb place Were in the main Highway of our city which is why were a  store but were in an upper middle class neighborhood right by the middle and high school I dont see much traffic between midnight and four am That is until some shitty little dive bar called Shotz opened up somewhere behind us Somewhere because theres a huge parking lot behind us that situates a Kmart a pizza Hut a burger restaurant a funeral home yeah idk either and then the bar is somewhere in that mess So anyway between  amp  I get a nice hour of drunks Our local police force is always really nice They know that its either me  lbs female or J scrawny but seriously awesome little white guy working alone I work the weekends so I get the worst drunk traffic The officer who has our district has taken to sitting in the high school parking lot across the street during this hour with their headlights trained on our store I seriously give these guys so much free coffee The usual weekend officer stopped in and introduced his ride along that he had fresh out of the Academy Super nice guy Gave them coffee and a bag of donuts I was about to toss we get them fresh every day so they arent dried out if they were bagged and thanked them when they said theyd be keeping an eye out for me Around ish they had nabbed a drunk driver yay team and I was watching them do the field check stuff from across the street Now a quick inside to give you an idea of our store layout Im on my phone but will make a crappy picture in paint later and post it in an edit The cashier area is right smack in the middle of the store When you walk in theres the newspaper stand and the back counter area to your right coffee to your left and if you go waaaay left our bathrooms are down a little hall You have to walk around to your right following the counters to leave through the exit door This is so you cant sneak out behind us and steal something Queue am I have a college guy vomiting in the bathroom and a super nice guy whos browsing our snack food quietly In comes this super drunk middle aged black male He starts hanging on the newspaper stand and trying to climb over the back counter wall its about  feet high He will be Drunk Guy DG DG Hey How much for a cab to Menomininity I assumed menominee which is a city maybe twenty minutes from us Me Im not sure We can call a cab and ask Do you have a certain cab company you like to use DG just look some numbers up for me on the Internet Me I dont have the Internet here I have a phone book though you can borrow Please note this was NOT the answer he was looking for DG NIGGA FUCK YOUR PHONE BOOK Yeah Okay He proceeded to grab my newspaper stand and throw it behind him into the coffee counter and started storming off towards the bathrooms On his way he took out the fruit stand the magazine rack and the little employee break table in the hallway Drunk college kid comes tearing out of the bathroom That black guy grabbed me by the jacket pulled me out of the stall then ripped your toilet paper dispenser off the wall and threw it at me Uhh What The nice guy has been quietly picking up all the scattered fruit despite me telling him he didnt have to because I have to throw it all away anyway insists hell stay until this guy leaves Me Yeah I dont have the time for this Im just calling the police I get on the phone with none emergency explain my situation and ask if officer X can send his ride along over just to help keep this guy in control until another officer can come in Not even a minute later RideAlong is jogging across the street as officer X is piling the drunk driver in his back seat and I guess radioing the location for another officer DG comes out of the bathroom all sheepish and apologetic And then he sees the officer DG AW THE FUCK YOU YOU DIRTY ASS SKANK WHORE BITCHthe officer calmly cuffs DG who surprisingly didnt fight I sell nice guy some candy and put his coffee on my nightly expense College kid dipped out at some point I think he was underaged A second officer shows up and runs the drunk guys info as Im talking to RideAlong for my statement Turns out DG has a warrant out on him in North Carolina for skipping out on parole His friends apparently got tired of his drunk ass and left him at the bar Apparently Shotz has been doing last call at  like normal but then locking their restrooms so drunks cant hang out in there and they can clean them and leave faster They also havent been letting the drunk patrons use their phone For both things they explain that there is a gas station open about a block away with bathrooms and a phone Yeah Screw them DG got hauled off I burned a copy of the security footage for the officer and clean everything up The DM lives down the road so he stopped in for his deer hunting coffee and snacks and was pretty livid when I explained the situation I guess he knows the owner of the bar and gave him a call about his bartenders I thankfully had last night and tonight off so Ill see next weekend if our drunk flow is any better Well its bed time Sorry for the sleepy rambling Good night TFREDIT Heres that layout I promised look at my awesome gas

Legionofclowns,54,72,1rcc3t,252,First time posting on TFR but I felt like my story needed to join all the great ones Ive been reading on here Its long so be forewarned So its  and I am working at an electronics store with my pretty blue shirt and khakis I started here right before holiday season and had a couple months under my belt working in the DVDCDVideo Games area and had become one of the goto guys The manager and I had a game plan for black Friday we had a map drawn with how we were gonna move customers through the store and everythinghopefully The only hitch in this plan came from Nintendo for this was the year of the Wii Now before this i had worked with the public Had worked at the movie theater fast food etc but this was my first real retail job I had almost no experience with Black Friday and had only heard stories from friends and things I had watched on the newsDay comes and of course Im there at open I pull into the neighboring parking lot where we had to park on this day and what do I see A line that stretches from the door goes around the store comes back to the front doors and proceeds to stretch across the parking lot to the local office supply store I think no big deal we got this We start handing out the tickets before opening for the big items like cheap TVs and of course the  Wiis we managed to have And within  minutes everything is handed out and of course there is some yelling about who didnt get what and the standard bickering Not worried we have a cop outside keeping order So doors open and everybody comes in orderly but hurriedly and our plan is actually working customers are actually moving the way we want so I start to think maybe this whole black Friday thing is overblown NOPE Towards our car install bay where we had put the ticketed items I hear shouts of THEY HAVE EM and I HAD IT FIRST BITCH  Going into oh shit mode I briskly jog flat out run to the bay and witness about  soccer moms in track suits and jackets piling through the doorway pushing the LP guarding the stash out of the way and snatching Wiis like they were made of gold and endangered diamond kittens while throwing haymakers at anything else that was in the way I mean seriously how many times do you get to see a middleclass housewife uppercut another like something from Street Fighter  Apparently one of them had see the Wiis through the window and started informing others that we had Wiis but we were hoarding them for employees At this point I have to make a decisiondo I A Stand back and watch and possibly take photos or B  Stop a possible murder I go with B and start using my outside voice and arms to try and break up the mob and get the door closed behind them with the help of my helpless LP I get into the bay and WHOOMP Im out Dont remember anything about what happened but after viewing the tape and listening to the LP I apparently was knocked on the head with a Wii by a Martha Stewart looking woman who proceeded to dissappear behind the others and back out to the floor Yep I was knocked out by a mediocre gaming system At this point in the tape you start seeing people dropping and crying When I first saw it I thought they were all upset at what had happened to me but then you see the police officer break through the lines spraying his OC at anything not wearing a uniform The LP and him managed to clear the bay and pull the door closed and locked and then check to make sure Im alright SPOILER I didnt die More cops show up and procede to lock down the store as the LP and first officer manage to get me awake and up and walk me to the break room and give me some water and make sure I know what day it was and if I knew my name Im humorous most of the time so I said Garfield thats how they knew I was ok I end up going to the hospital in the police car to get checked out and other than a nasty gash still have the scar Im good in fact Im ready to go back to work Turns out my manager felt really really bad about what had happened and so he gave me the rest of the day off with sick leave and even came by my houseguest afterwards to check on me and show me the tape from the cameras  The only thing that chaps my ass about the whole thing was that the woman who decided I needed to die so her kids could fake bowl got away Ive never had another Black Friday like this and this upcoming one will be my th although Im with a different company now since the electronics retailer decided that Amazoncom wasnt a competitor damn restructuringtldr A housewife knocks me out with a future doorstop and I hallucinate that Im Edward James Olmos on a jetski Edit just wanted to add that this was the only year things got bad Every other time has been a cake walk a huge cakewalk with too many people ,The Tale Of The Housewife Beatdown Brawl,324,talesFromRetail

LIVESINCANADA,108,76,1rbn62,239,So I used to work for a large department store in the frontend cash and customer service mainly At our location we had  cash registers  of which were express  items or less and the other  were regular belts We also had  selfcheckout machines that were watched over by  cashier at a time This particular day I was the one who got to watch over them Now I dont remember what time of year it was or even what time of day it was but I do remember that it was very busy We had every single register open and we still had lines of  people at each register When Im watching the selfcheckouts Im watching a screen that shows me what each customer has entered in order to make sure that the pack of toilet paper they placed under their cart actually gets scanned I also have to help people out when they have coupons as  of the time the machine doesnt recognize them as well as any and all questions about their purchasespricespayment methods So basically Im busy running around the whole timeSo this day while Im watching the selfcheckouts two women who were next in the seemingly neverending line come to one of the machines nearest to me One of the women is pregnant and the other looks like an older women I found out it was the pregnant womens mother Nothing note worthy happens with them until theyre at their last item It was a heavier item at the bottom of their cart The older women waves at me and asks if I could lift the heavy item for them as the daughter is pregnant and she has some illness I think she said cancer Now they choose to come to a selfcheckout machine A machine where you are supposed to check yourself out They didnt think to wait in one of the  other lines where youd have a dedicated cashier whod be happy to lift and scan all your large and heavy items for you No they decided to come to the self checkouts and get the cashier who had to watchhelp  customers simultaneously to lift and scan their items So all that went through my head but what came out of my mouth was Sure no problem and I started walking towards them they were  feet away from me I take not more than  steps before the daughter says Oh its alright mom Ive got this and then she bends down and picks up the heavy item herself The mom notices that I didnt match Usain Bolts world record speeds while walking towards them and says to me What awful service you have forcing a pregnant woman to lift ltitem namegt by herselfI just shrug it off and inform them that in the future if theyd like more hands on service that going to one of the nonselfcheckout registers would probably be better The two women finish paying and as they walk by me on their way out the mom drops this doozy on meI guess some peoples mothers just didnt raise them rightWhat I dont know what she expected me to do maybe scream at her daughter and push her out of the way as she attempted to lift the large item I knew with that statement she was just trying to provoke me so I ignored her Its been years since thats occurred and its still the experience from retail that I remember best,Self checkouts are more trouble than theyre worth,315,talesFromRetail

MysticSpiral,23,30,1rb12d,96,This is a story of a horrible client a weak manager and a poor associate me caught amidst it all It was a dark night in late spring The shorts are being unpacked and the air is fresh and new hope blooms I love my job and my customers at this store this is before I was promoted and moved to a different location are generally exceptionally awesome Even the bad ones arent really THAT bad and only minor annoyances Now this night we were slow and it was just about closing time so the MOD manager on duty and I were cleaning up around the store Our bliss is soon interrupted by a dark haired demon disguised as a human being   For whatever reason Demon Bitch bypasses the MOD and heads straight for me and I feel a chill roll down my spine I know somehow that this is going to be bad DB I bought this dress the other day whips out cotton dress and I went to put it on a button is missing from the back Can I exchange itMe Hoping this is easier than I first thought Of course lets see if we still have another in the same sizeExtra small petiteWe did not Me Im sorry it doesnt look like we have another in the same color and size We can exchange it for a different color or I can refund you back your money for it no problemDB No I want to wear THIS oneMe I can look it up and see if another store has it if you want We can put it on hold for however long you want and you are welcome to exchange it there We can try to place an order for it as well through the computer but if there is a low inventory theres no guarantee you will get t unfortunately The inventory is about  hours behind and often the numbers are lower than what is shownDB No That is unacceptable I want this one Cant you just sew a new button on itMe Unfortunately we dont have spare buttons but I can sew the button loop to the other side so it doesnt look off balance if you like Mind you the button is TINY About half the size of a dime Its really not that big of an issueNow this where things start to go downhill DB What will you do with the dress if I return it  Honesty to me  is the best policy but had I known how this was going to go down I probably would have just lied to this personMe Most likely we will write a damage tag for it and it will get removed from the inventory and shipped outDB Then rip a button off another dress and sew it to this oneI am VERY taken aback by this  She wants meto destroy No way Just No Me Maam Im sorry I cannot destroy company propertyDB WHAT You just SAID that this one would get sent out if I returned it what is the difference between this one and that one getting sent outMe Well that dress is now YOURS since you bought it You can do with it what you will and if you return it then it becomes the property of the company again  meaning that we will adhere to company policy and not put a damaged item on the floor The other dress on the rack is still company property and I will not willfully destroy company propertyDB I RAN A BUSINESS FOR TEN YEARS YOU DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO MAKE THE CUSTOMER HAPPY RIP A BUTTON OFF THAT DRESS AND SEW IT ONTO MINE THIS INSTANTMe I am not going to destroy company property You can return the dress or I can find one at another store Those are your options I am not risking my job by destroying company propertyDB THAT IS BULL SHIT YOU WILL NOT LOSE YOUR JOB OVER MAKING THE CUSTOMER HAPPY I RAN A BUSINESS I KNOW I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGERMe Alright MOD who has been listening the whole time this client would like to speak with youThe MOD comes over and I walk away continue to tidy up the store and do my job Then I see the MOD take the clients dress And the dress on the floor Im thinking that she CANT POSSIBLY be doing what I thinkYes the MOD ripped a button off a dress from the floor and sewed it back on to DBs dress Something or other had brought me to the desk a few moments later while the MOD was wrapping up sewing the new button on During the entire time DB wont stop going on and on about how she ran a business and knows that you do whatever it takes to make a customer happy etc etc etc  She then turns to me again and tells me Losing your job over making a customer happy That is SUCH bullshit I dont know of ANY company that would fire you for making a customer HAPPYI dont give her a response because at this point I am infuriated that the MOD would give into this horrible excuse for a human being and if I do respond it will be nasty DB eventually leaves and the MOD comes overMOD MysticSpiral Im sorry that I went over your head and did that I just could tell that it would escalate further and I didnt want a scene I REALLY loved that MOD she was like another mom to me but I absolutely could not respond to her I dont think I said a word for the rest of the evening The whole thing boils my blood even now So the lesson here is that if you scream and cry and rant and rave you can get someone to destroy company property just so you dont have to

ExcerptMusic,18,17,1rahbf,85, I work for a major cell phone retailer and frequently deal with technical issues Most of the time I love to help people figure out their phone so that they can get the most out of it However there are always certain individuals that blame their devices for their own faults Feel free to comment with similar issues as an employee or customer including silly things that were accidentally done that messed up a phoneKeep in mind the following text is currently in my head unless in quotes I am being as nice as possible on the outsideI had a customer come into the store that had a few problems with his phone I knew it wasnt going to be fun to figure out because he had on the fuck you face and looked to be in the ignorant with technology age range He presented me with  problems My alarm doesnt alert me in the morning and I need it for work The outside keys dont lock so the phone turns the speaker on The battery runs out when I unplug it at nightHe then followed by I bought this phone  days ago and want to return it and Ive been with this company for  years Advice to anyone that plans on throwing the Ive been shopping here for X amount of years This company doesnt care about you personally they just dont This isnt some mom amp pop shop that is hanging on simply by your individual business This is a multiBILLION dollar company They care even less if you were an asshole to them for those  years because I guarantee this isnt your first time complaining  So you bought the phone  days ago Sorry you cant return it There is a  day return policy on phones company wide This does not change unless there was an issue with ordering or computer date errors which doesnt happen We could also get the manufacturer to replace it if there is actually a problem with it There was no problem with the phone so there is  nothing I can do to get this guy a new phone So I check it out and explain to him what is going on The alarm First off his alarm was off He said it is because he turns it off on the weekends and on Monday it doesnt work I told him you need to turn it on or only set it for weekdaysI did this for him He kept saying that the phone was broken and the alarm would go off  minutes after it was supposed to I tested the alarm feature about  times No issues If it happened every time like he said I would have seen it at least once Even after telling him that the alarm was off he kept telling me it was the phone that had the problem and it was doing it automatically No It wasnt Next issue The outside keys wouldnt lock Ok This is a flip phone so there are volume keys and speaker phone keys He also has a horizontal belt carrier He tells me when he pushes the phone up in its holster while someone is calling him he pushes the buttons and that his old phone didnt do that I tell him that there is no way to turn off the buttons while someone is calling You can turn them off while no one is calling but not during a call After talking more with him I figured out why his old phone didnt have that issue He used to have a vertical belt clip and never pressed the buttons when he took out his phone Next issue The battery runs out at night This one is just stupid He told me that when he fully charges his phone at night he unplugs it and leaves it open The phone also has the screen timeout disabled So at night he unplugs the phone at  leaves it open fully lit and goes to bed Then in the morning he is mad that it is almost dead He must sleep with the lights on or something I dont know I set a screen timeout and told him to just leave it plugged in even though that slowly discharges battery over months and years A problem with battery capacity in  years isnt going to be his most pressing issue and it will prevent a lot of manufacturer return claims because the phone dies at night Now that ive fixed his issues he says that he will try it out but he doesnt expect it to work because it was the phone  Sorry guy it wasnt the phone It was user error through and through Dont blame technology for your mishaps Technology isnt some black magic  of operating a phone is common sense and an ability to read If the alarm says OFF then the alarm is off Its that simple  As much as I hate these people I like to see their reactions even when I fix their issues Its almost always negative with no thanks while stomping out the door I just have to roll my eyes and wait for that awesome customer that listens to experienced advice and recognizes their errors while laughing about it Seriously those are the best customers everTLDR User error accounts for most errors,Dont blame technology if you dont know how to use it,102,talesFromRetail

KDR,9,12,1ra3wz,53,Im reasonably new to this subreddit and reddit in general but because I have spent the bulk of my working life in retail and can relate to most of these stories I find myself drawn here I felt it was only fair to share one of my stories This one in particular is inspired by uunmined most recent storyQuick back story I moved to the city earlier in the year after finishing high school After a string of lousy or temporary jobs I get hired as an electronics associate at an overwhelmingly large retail chainOur story begins on my first day of work Which happened to coincide with my birthday    I step on to the floor following way too close to my manager because I have absolutely no idea what to do or where to go At this point Ive just resigned that this day is gonna be terrible no matter what happens After all spending your birthday at your first day as a retail slave isnt exactly a dream come true He sets me up changing all the tags for the new DVD releases with another coworker lets call him Bas to make sure I dont screw it up At the time the department wasnt terribly large at least not as big as it is now so to make up for that fact the shelves were quite tall As far as I was concerned the department didnt exist past the DVD racks and B and myself were the only employees in the department As soon as Im starting to get comfortable and feel like I know what Im doing I hear a female voice behind me So this is the new guy huhI turn to see where the words are coming from and Im completely blindsided by what stands before me She is the girl Ive been searching my entire life for and I didnt even know it She stands eye level with me about  if it matters with long blonde hair that comes down to her shoulder blades Her eyes are a deep green color that I could lose myself in to the point that I cant look in to them for too long in fear Ill never find my way back out I can smell a faint sweetness when shes near almost like vanilla which I find out later is from her body wash In short she is every thing I have ever wanted and all I will ever wantB finally breaks the silence which seems to go on for an eternity but was probably only  seconds Yea his names    whats your name againIn that instant I suddenly forget what people have been calling me my entire life to the point where I have to sneak a look at my name tag to remember Its    umm    KDRShe cracks a smile and almost starts to giggle Thats an interesting name where you named after Insert ActorAround the time she stops speaking I finally remember how words work Honestly Im not sure I never thought enough to askHeh well I guess Ill see you around thenI wave bye to her as she disappears around the corner I can still smell vanilla and shes all I can think about for the rest of my shiftWe continued to work together but never really had any extended conversation except for having to ask her where things were for customers or what set of keys opened what cases Based on what I had heard from my coworkers she wasnt a very pleasant person to be around and the word bitch was used a few times It wasnt until a full month after our initial encounter that we finally got to spend some time togetherOur manager had given her the task of reorganizing the wall of printer ink It was essentially a  foot tall  foot wide section of madness She was to pick one person to help her with this and it was expected to take a few days I find out the day she starts working on it that Im the one that gets to help from our manager As we were walking over he leans over to me as half whispers I know this isnt gonna be a fun project and she isnt always the most friendly person but at least she isnt bad to look at I force a laugh and crack a smile but something tells me Im gonna enjoy the hell out of this projectDuring this time we talk    a lot About everything from interests and hobbies to our coworkers where we grew up and everything in between As it would happen most of our interests coincide She reads comics as well shes into computers albeit not quite to the extent I am but this is hardly a deal breaker and we actually grew up only  miles from each other but in different school districtsAfter that week of work I had decided she was going to be the woman I would spend the rest of my life with It would seem she had decided the same because she started inviting me over after work to hang out with her and a few friends Eventually she stopped inviting the friends And from there things ran their course This story took place over  years ago Im very happy to say that I havent changed my mind about spending the rest of my days with her and she hasnt either I guess what Im trying to say is yes retail is awful The customers are almost always unbelievably rude or amazingly stupid and the pay is never enough to make up for it Were on the cusp of one of the worst times to be a retail employee but sometimes things work out in ways you would never expect and change your life foreverTLDR  I met the girl of my dreams on my first day as a retail slave,Retail isnt always terrible,65,talesFromRetail
HeloRising,16,16,1ra3ti,66,Since the last one did so well and people enjoyed it I got in touch with one of the girls I worked with at the pottery store trolling for more stories and she mentioned one Id forgottenThis was about a month after I signed on and I had just come back from lunch on an otherwise quiet day Alas the day was not to remain so A woman walked in and started browsing the shelves She smiled and I greeted her asked her if she was looking for anything in particular she said no she was just browsing so I left it at that About ten minutes later she comes up to me with about four smaller pieces in her hands and she looks a little worried Note the punctuation in her statement is very very deliberateUmmIm trying to decide on one of these Its for my daughter shes graduating college next week and I wanted to get her a little something that was nice but not big so she wouldnt have to worry about carting it around and I thought oh maybe some figurines would be good but then I dont know because she likes faeries and horses but maybe thats a little too childish for her and I saw these and I love them and maybe theyd go well in her new place but I dont know for sure what it looks like because its all the way out past the freeway andThis goes on for quite some time Im overclocking my mental CPU hardcore just to be able to process everything shes saying because its coming out like fire from a rocket and she doesnt seem to want to slow down I try to slow her down but her automatic verbal machine gun has got me pinned After about five minutes of this it becomes very clear that she doesnt intend to stop Like ever At this point I started entertaining the idea of calling security This was a fairly high end shopping area so getting stayathome moms who have a doctor friend with a loose prescription pad wasnt unheard of and it was starting to look like shed either taken too much or too little of something strongBy now shed begun almost a fullblown panic attack and I had stopped being able to decode what she was saying it was coming out so fast Her eyes were getting red and puffy and she was gesticulating wildly Also shed stopped focusing on me she was no longer looking directly at me anymore She had this kind of thousand yard stare going on Her volume had also gone up and unreasonably hot coworker came out to see what the commotion was only to be greeted by the sight of a grown woman frothing at the mouth waiving pottery faeries around going about a million miles a minute about her daughter and somebody named Howie and looked like she was on the verge of spontaneously combusting Unreasonably hot coworker tried to calm the situation down but the woman was a volcano in full eruption at this point spewing molten crazy on everything around herJust before the ten minute mark she had apparently ran out of energy because she kind of half sat half collapsed onto the floor bawling her eyes out We were watching a grown human being have a fullblown psychological meltdown on the floor of the shopand we hadnt the slightest fucking idea how to deal with it Shed gotten so loud she attracted the attention of security who came in and asked what was going on and in a quavering tone of voice unreasonably hot coworker told the security guardA customer is having a nervous breakdown whats the policy on that It was apparently a first for the guard too because he had that same sort of expression youd expect on peoples faces if someone started stripping and pouring syrup on their genitals in the middle of breakfast at IHOP profound confusion mixed with a little bit of morbid fascinationEventually I guess she just completely ran out of gas and resorted to juststaring off into space with her mouth slightly open We got her cellphone and called the ICE contact who I assume was her husband He showed up about ten minutes after we called and somehow got her up and out of the store He didnt explain what was going on just thanked us for calling him and left with her I never did see her again after thatPart of me is amazed Id forgotten about this story but it wraps up with a lot of other things that happened later that are a little triggering so I guess I kinda just buried it Not as funny as the other two but still entertaining in its own way,A customer is having a nervous breakdown whats the policy on that,82,talesFromRetail

malnormalish,19,6,1r9oo9,42,So I work at an art craft store and we sell these crazily popular rubber band bracelet looms  along with rubber band refill packs They come in a multitude of colors but we usually only have  colors at a time Every day I have people coming up asking if we have any other colors which is a valid question I tell them that no what we have out is all that there is and then half of the time they ask Are you sure  No Im not sure Im just pulling that out of my assWhen I tell them yes Im definitely sure Ive seen more people than I would have guessed throw tantrums Ive gotten people asking if I could just double check in the back No nothing in the back and even had a couple people offer me extra cash on the side if I could give them a certain color trying to bribe me I dont understand what they want me to do its not like I can magically summon the rubber bands out of thin airIts absolutely crazy how these people act trying to get these looms Seriously we have sold  of them in one night That same night for the last loom available I taped a note on it saying Im the LAST one and about ten minutes later saw two ladies walk up to it at the same time It was like a showdown in a movie They glared at each other before one lady just quickly grabbed it and walked away The other lady then complained to me about how we should have had more of them to check when theyll be in we dont know yadda yaddaA couple annoying things to note about this product is that we have moved the display for it from about the middle of the store to quite literally the frontmost center of the store standing there right as the customers walk in These customers have to walk past the display directly to my counter where they ask me where the product is I usually just point and they follow my deadeyed stare to the display behind them Then the customer will walk over pluck one from the shelf ignoring the neoncolored bolded signs printed on x pieces of foamboard stating that no coupons are to be accepted on the looms The customer then promptly whips out a coupon When I then tell them I cannot use said coupon most of them are annoyed but okay while others tell me its bullshit and storm out threatening to never come back to the store again  saying that The coupon is the only reason I came Of course all of you know that people do not read and refuse to even attempt to observe their surroundings blaming poor cashiers for problems out of their control so my tale should not come as a surprise So to end this rant I just wanted to ask what products sold at your place of work give you the most frustration This loom kit has been probably the worst to deal with for me I see people get insanely angry about these things its sort of funny but also very horribly frustrating,The Loom of Doom No coupons arent accepted,48,talesFromRetail

thompsontoonsart,16,18,1r9l9k,95,Customer walks up to me just as Im about to go on my late afternoon lunch break She says shes there to pick up an order for X person name Well call her Fuddle Duddle and it should be a couple of bedskirts She received a call that the order was in Seems clear cut like any other order we have shipped to the store from our warehouse I go to our holds area to find the ordertheres no bedskirts on hold and no orders under the name the customer gave me I walk back onto the selling floor to speak with the customer Maam you said your name is Fuddle Duddle I dont see any orders out back with that name attachedWell no My name is Sue Fuddle is my friend Im in the area so she asked me to pick up her order for herThe next half hour spirals into this confusing mess of misinformation that five other associates attempted to clear up Sue came to the store with Fuddle a couple weeks ago and made a few largeish purchases Sue said Fuddle was pretty sure shed paid for the order being shipped to the store and it just needed to be picked up I look through our log book listing paid for pickup orders and there was no listing of Fuddles name in the book I inform Sue that the order may have only been transferred into the store but not paid for if this was the case our policy is that unpaid hold items are put onto the selling floor after hrs Sue said Fuddle had paid for the bedskirts I tried looking up Ms Duddles customer information in our register and through our catalog system and I found no purchase records at all Well that cant be right Sue said We were here in the store We bought several hundred dollars worth of stuff We were here for hours You must have a record I informed her that their purchases would be in our records but they wouldnt be logged under their names unless we created customer profiles for them Since their names didnt come up in our profile search I figured theyd opted out of having a profile created Sue decides to call Fuddle and confirm the information Sue hands me the phone after a few minutes so I can speak directly with Fuddle I inquire what style bedskirt it was that shed ordered for pick up and she said she couldnt really describe it She could tell me where she found the bedskirt in the store but the one she ordered was the correct size she needed that wasnt available in store at the time Supposedly it was a plain tailored style and she had a receipt for the item at home but she wasnt at home that very moment so she couldnt give me the information on the receipt She insisted she paid for the bedskirt because she had a receipt but her friend had also received a call to pick up her order which she said is a queen sized dust ruffle in white or maybe it was two twins She couldnt even remember what she ordered I described a couple of the styles to her and she suggested our diamond quilted style seemed most likely I asked if her order could have been logged under anyone elses name and she said no but her neighbor Pierce was supposed to pick it up So we had a third person involved in this order I took down Fuddles phone number and the number for her neighbor Pierce who was originally called and notified about the order and I told her wed give her a call once we sort the issue outSue is getting somewhat impatient now because she was there solely to pick up Fuddles order Fuddle lives out of state but owns a second house here in Maine which is where the bedskirt is supposed to go Sue looks at me saying So if you eventually find this bedskirt youll have to mail it to us for free right I dont want to drive another  miles to come pick it up and you already called Pierce to say it was here and somehow its not I told her that we would figure out some way to get the items to the customer if she did indeed already pay for them Sue and her patiently waiting husband decide to leaveMeanwhile my coworker pieces all the mashed up information together and tracks down the receipt for Fuddles original purchase which has a queen sized bedskirt on it She bought the bedskirt and one matching sham in store and they left with her What could she have possibly ordered We went back to the holds area There was a white queen coverlet and one matching sham on hold in the same style as the bedskirt she already purchased under Fuddles neighbor Pierces name and contact phone number and it was unpaid for I run out the door hoping Sue and her husband hadnt pulled out of the parking lot yet They were gone My coworker gets on the phone and calls the neighbor asking if they can contact Sue before she gets too far away from the store Were just hoping things will work out so we dont have to ship this to the customer because the customer clearly gave us all the wrong information The neighbor does get a hold of Sue she comes back and purchases the coverlet and sham for her friendTL Woman comes in to pick up supposedly paid for bedskirt for her friend Lady picking up the order gets annoyed with us because we cant track down the order thats supposed to be in store The actual order wasnt a bedskirt it wasnt paid for and the contact person listed on the order was neither the friend nor the original customer ,Customer doesnt remember what she ordered,113,talesFromRetail

Sapphires,19,18,1r8o2i,100,I work the jewelry counter at a department store  Were a standalone store and more low end than some of the other department stores at the mall across town  We dont actually sell that much fine jewelry  I spend most of my shift straightening clothes and helping in layaway   We wear radios and the jewelry counter is near the service desk so they just call me up when I have a customerOkay so the other night Im closing  I hadnt actually been there more than  minutes when I get my first jerky jewelry customer  An old lady is standing at the counter holding a ziplock bag with an old looking watch in it  The watch has a leather band that looks like its just disintegrated and fallen off of the watchMy first thought is that she wants to pick out a new watch band to math the old one as closely as possible  I can do that  I am prepared to start showing them to herNope  She asks if I can put a band on the watchWe cant  We dont do any jewelry repairs in the store  We dont have the tools or the training or the coverage   Were low end and our jewelry counter is almost an afterthought and definitely not one of our most oftshopped areasI personally would be down to try doing it technically I know how but were not allowed  Its a liability issue  And I can see why  If an employee were to try and then fuck up and break the item the company would have to really kiss the customers ass in order to dissuade any legal actionSo I explain to the woman that we sell bands but cant install them  She is not actually very jerky and goes on her wayNEXT  Id say this was about  minutes later  I get called to the jewelry counter again  This time there are two customers waiting  An older woman and a middle aged man  Theyre not together so I kind of look from one to the other to try to figure out who was first  The man indicates for me to help the woman firstMe  Hi what can I do for you   Woman  I need my watch battery changed   Me  Oh Im sorry  We cant do that here   Woman  sour face You cant do that   Me  We dont have any tools to take the watch apart and we dont install watch batteries or repair jewelry at this store   Woman  Since when  You used to   Ah the dreaded you used to  My particular store asbestos and all no seriously we have a notice in our back room about how the floor tiles are made of asbestos so dont go snorting them or anything is forty years old  The company has had its ups and downs and changed in all kinds of ways over the years  You cant expect a store to stay the same forever  I dont know when my store stopped changing watch batteries but I know that it was some time before I started working there Me  We havent done it since Ive been working here   Woman  Well where am I supposed to go   Me  Youd probably have to go to a jewelry store  I dont know if big box superstore that we all love to hate does it anymore either    Woman  You cant change my battery and you cant even tell me where I can get it done other than a jewelry store    Me  Im so sorry   Woman  You spend  on a watch and it runs down after a year  What am I supposed to do just buy a new one every yearI attempt to repeat that a jewelry store would be more than happy to fix her watch  Woman is not listening she mutters that this is ridiculous and leaves  I turn to help the man  He has our weekly sales ad and is looking for a particular ring shown in it  I start looking through the diamond ring case which is particularly full right now and cannot spot it anywhere  Hmm  I start to explain that sometimes not every store getssells every item shown in the ad since the same ad is released across the whole country but I keep looking for the ringAnd then I see my daytime jewelry coworker who has already ended her shift and is on her way out the door  I flag her down and ask if we have that ringwhere it is  Bad news  They only sent us one and she already sold it earlier that day  AND its not even orderable because it was discontinued hence why it was on sale  Man is not amused and turns to leaveThe rest of my night goes fairly uneventfully  Until almost the end  I happen to be going by the counter when I spotted a couple around my age late s looking at the clearance jewelry case  So I stop and ask if theyd like to look at somethingMan  Actually I need to get a battery put in my watch  he holds up a small tin presumably containing his watch    Me  Oh we cant actually install watch batteries here  We dont have any tools to do so    Man  But do you sell batteries   Me  Yes they have some at the electronics counter  But we cant install them for you    Man  Okay thanks  And then they went off toward electronics and I went back to what I was doing  About ten minutes later the guy running electronics gets on the radio and asks if we have a screwdriver or something at the jewelry counter to get the back off of a watchI felt like screaming  I just told that guy that we couldnt do it  Fortunately my manager gets on the radio and says No we dont  And we cant install watch batteries hereBut apparently this guy was adamant about not leaving the store until he got his watch battery installed  I sat and quietly fumed while my manager and the electronics guy went back and forth talking about screwdrivers for a good  minutes  My manager asked the woman at the service desk if there are any small screwdrivers up there  There werent  And finally everybody relented and electronics guy basically told the guy the only way he was going to get a screwdriver out of us if he went to the hardware section and bought oneTLDR  No we DO NOT install watch batteries here  And when I tell you that we do not have the tools to do so dont go ask the guy at electronics,Do you have a screwdriver  Tales from the jewelry

phantommusic,4,29,1r8l8x,123,So Ive posted on this sub before about when I worked at a cajun restaurant  but this fine tale hails from my days at an accessory shop at my local mallAt this store  there are TONS of tiny little items earrings bracelets ect That tend to go missing pretty often but its to be expected as the store is so small and under staffed there is no way to keep it from happening You know those mirrors of the ceiling that some people idiots think are hat mirrors Nope Shoplifting mirrors And on this day I may have seen the funniest attempt at shoplifting ever This pair of kids walk in one looks  the other maybe  and they browse for a bit while the older one eats an ice cream cone Well manager and I are standing at the register and I happen to look up into one of the mirrors and see this girl hiding earrings in her ICE CREAM I poke my manager and we can barely hold in our laughter as we call mall security Of course when she gets caught she pretends to not speak english and begins to SCARF down that ice cream  He stops her calls her mom who comes in SCREAMING at her in perfect english and makes her spit out those earrings We only got  out of  back She can keep the last oneTL DR girl hides jewelry in ice cream becomes human earring dispenser a week later,That looks like some yummy ice cream,152,talesFromRetail

hyperventilate My mind resolves to thinking its all going to lead to disappointmentMy name is called over the PA in an obvious attempt to get me back to work So I head to the front of the store and bag awayIt takes me two days to buildup the courage to call her She agrees to dinner and a movie on Friday I get someone at work to cover my shift Im feeling moreandmore like this is going to happenThat Friday may have been the slowest day to arrive in my life But the evening rolls around and I get ready for the date Im so nervous that I sneak a half of Xanax from my moms stash dont do drugs kids It takes the edge off so I head out to pick up my dateWhen she answers the door shes just a pretty as I remember herOur conversations over the course of these evening are a blur Yet they were unforced and natural Very few awkward silences Not at all what I expectedIn the dark of the movie theater I reached out and held her hand She gladly took it and leaned into my shoulder Thankfully the movie still had an hour to go because I would not have been able to stand at that momentWhen I pulled up to her house at the end of the evening she said Im bummed This went by took quicklyIt has I saidMy heart was hammering I could barely hear over the racket it was making in my chest The rest of my body felt like I was being propelled into herOn instinct I reached out and stroked her hair I

or two Even the first friend I saw drive off to college in another stateElizabeth is now long gone I think back on her with equal parts of affection and sadness But I will never regret the time we had togetherSo TFR  next week is Thanksgiving here in America I thought Id give the day an homage by noting that even shit jobs can sometimes bring a small measure of joy even if its indirect Bagging

Foliagus,31,32,1r761t,142,Hey guys long time reader first time poster etcI work for a lovely little retail store north of the border we sell drugs makeup and of course the fun things electronicsI just had a customer today that made me walk away for the first time and I thought that maybe youd appreciate what I did and maybe you could learn how to deal with this kindve thing  So Angry Lady comes in AL about five pm asking if we pricematch  From the way she was asking she obviously knew we did indeed pricematch other competitors and Id definitely seen her in the store before  Me Absolutely miss did you want me to see if I have something in stock for youAL Yes your Samsung  smart tv Its on for  at Lamewad other store on the other side of townMe Ok well Ill just pull it up on our website here and print off the price for you one secondNow our computers are running a windows so old well I guess Im not funny enough for some comparive humour  Our computers are old and clunky and take long periods of time inbetween inputs just to decide if they like the way you clicked somethingAs were loading through the Lamewad website they list no television fitting the criteria  This is after five minutes of Oh my god I went through this last time you guys are terrible I show her the other Samsung  the nonsmart version going for  on their website and she angrily just says no before insisting I open Lamewads flyerI gladly open the flyer finding indeed the same television without smart advertised for   I point this out again I get a No before AL points above the tv at a different model An LG and says THAT tv  That ones smartWell I point out that the television is listed at  and that we dont actually carry LGThis puts her into a silent anger and she just turns and walks away  I as mandated by my company say Have a nice evening before forgetting about the whole thingCUE many hours later about  pm when we get called to go outside  Now when this happens its because our LP Loss Prevention Security Officer has pursued somebody out of the store and were to go outside and just stand there for visual support  Getting outside after everybody I find LP on top of a girl screaming and yelling to her friend telling her friend to take her stuff while LP yells not to let her take it and sure enough one of our staff goes and grabs the little pink box from the girls purse and holds onto it for LP  Now after some minutes weve got a large van coming  LP is in the middle of our little road but he cant move this girl shes flailing and screaming not letting him cuff her Anyway Large Van drives right up to about  feet away from about  employees all standing in full white shirt and tie and honks her horn repeatedly  Our manager proceeds to hold up her hand asking the van to wait or to just turn left and go around  Who gets out of the van but AL  GET YOUR HANDS OFF HER YOU ASSHOLE ARE YOU TRYING TO RAPE HER  SOMEBODY STOP HER YOU employeesAt this our manager tells everybody else but her and LP to go inside the police are now audible coming in a very fast way  We all do and sure enough coming in  seconds after myself is ALI found the ad now you HAVE to price matchShe indeed whips out a printed ad from a competitor and I start processing the paperwork  During this I notice our inventory is out one so I dont actually have a boxed unit for sale I let her know this and she does that LOVELY derisive chuckle Man you guys really have no idea what youre doing the last time you couldnt find my tv eitherTo this I apologize let her know thats unfortunate but that Id be happy to get a tv in within a few days after purchase So at this point as Im walking away grabbing more paperwork I ask Awesome Coworker AC if shes able to intercede  Im starting to get hot under the collar and I want to distance myselfAC replies that shed be happy to so as we both walk back to AL I hear AL talking to another customer in our store Oh god you shouldve seen it he had his hands all over her it was brutal  God I dont know if Ill shop her again their security seems so violent etc etcI shrug it off but it stings a bit  Our LP is a contracted service theyre not a part of our company and theyre some of the nicest guys Ive ever met  The one in particular is a little  guy hes new and hes got a lisp  Now because they dont work for our company this means weve never had to worry about them reporting us to managers or such so any strictly noncorporate actions go over easy  Nice guys I play video games with quite a few of themAnyway so at the till just as Im clearing everything for AC miss AL turns to me and stares me down as she says I hope you feel safe here and I hope the police watch the video on your cameras your LP was completely outve line and violentI was done now  I didnt respond  AC saw and she immediately said Oh Foliagus would you like to go speak with COMPUTERS EMPLOYEE he said he wanted to see youI nod say Enjoy your evening miss and walk awayI hid until she was gone and I was commended for the calm manner I showed in the face of what I found out is a disreputable repeating customer  Thank god for my coworkers she was just poking me over and over againAnyway so I find out later the girl outside  Crack dealer  The little pink box  Full of crack and needles  She was so crazy because she was desperately trying to get her friend to pick up the evidence before the cops arrivedThanks for listening TFR you guys keep me saneTLDR  I singlehandidly rescued a hostage victim from a man strung out on compressed air before selling  dollars of merchandise at  margin

ToniCipriani,11,6,1r6mbw,30,This isnt so much a tale as it is something Ive been curious to hear some other opinions on the advantages and disadvantages of chain vs independent I work for a small independent cornerliquor store but the owner and his brothers have a few other small grocery stores and liquor shops in the areaI have worked for retail chains too namely a major electronic retailer in the US and a major drug store chain  Some pros Ive been noticing are that working for an independent storeMuch more laid back on certain things have to look presentable but otherwise I can wear what I please Certain customers who the owner has known for awhile have tabs when they are short on moneySmaller obviously so alot less customers in the store at once which makes it alot less stressful I tend to find the atmosphere more pleasant I try my best to go above and beyond but its more of a social and friendly vibe with workers and customers Dont have to worry about things like returns etcI  get to know customers on a more personal basis since alot of the same people frequent the shop I get paid in cash weekly instead of a check every two weeksA few cons Ive picked up onThe owner is a bit cheap when it comes to certain things like a leak in the back cooler which his solution for is a bucket  which needs to be emptied every  days pretty muchNo benefits like health coverage or anythingNo holidays off only  people work in the store other than the manager and owner so the hours are pretty set in stoneRealistically speaking I probably have alot less job security  I have a  really positive relationship with both the manager and owner and feel Im well liked but I ever made a huge mistake that made them really upset or even if they decided they wanted to cut down on people working for them I very well could get let go instantly My work doesnt have things like write ups its what the owner wants at the end of the day This is hypothetical since I get along well with everyone at the shop but if I was having a problem with someone else working there especially those who have been working there longer than I have Id probably have to either ignore it or leave people close to the owner are essentially untouchable Id imagine Most retail chains if they are under good management would likely try to take some sort of action for conflict mediation I would hope ,Pros and cons for working in a small local business over a retail chain,36,talesFromRetail

ixiduffixi,4,3,1r5xvj,25,So I was reading through another users lot stories today and was reminded of one of my own In my teenage years my first job was working for the blue vest mafia My job description was something along the lines of Customer Service Specialist which amounted to cart pusher cashier stockman and basic maintenance Eventually I also took up duties as an overnight unloader This tale involves one of those nights When I worked on unloading my shift started at  pm We would unloaded trucks piece by piece and any pallets of merchandise was left on the truck to be unloaded later and moved to an attached warehouse The typical protocol was to have one unloader use a pallet lift to move the merch to the outside dock where it would be taken by the Forktruck driver and driven around the building to the warehouse There another employee would be waiting with another pallet lift to move them inside The reason for this is the warehouse entrance was also on the store entrances sidewalk This meant that during these times one or two parking spots would be blocked off using upturned shopping carts so that the forktruck could reach the warehouse door This most commonly took place during store hours Not all of them are hrs Any way on to the storyOne day I had the responsibility of moving the pallets off of the truck and on to the back dock This had been going smoothly for the better part of an hour Then the forktruck didnt return I stood waiting at the back dock for almost half an hour and eventually decided to go see if there was any help needed in the warehouse When I got around I found the forktruck parked in the middle of the lot with no driver in sight I went to the warehouse entrance and found a crushed shopping cart lying on its side in one of the unused parking spots we had marked off The warehouse was locked and no one was around so I went back inside to find where everyone had gone I found my direct manager and my coworker standing at the front desk with the store manager and a very angry customer They had apparently been talking for quite some time because by the time I got there the conversation was already ending and the manager escorted the customer to the back office When I asked what happened my coworker got very very upset To the point of cursing in the middle of the checkout area What had happened was that the customer had intentionally ran through the shopping cart blockade while my coworker was there trying to wave him down The customer had driven into the cart so hard it had actually thrown it up over the sidewalk and through the warehouse entrance Then he started claiming that it was our faults and the company was going to pay for it I found out later that they had and we had to change the unloading policies to only operate the forktruck after store hoursBONUS STORYAnother tale of the blue vest mafia One night I entered the restroom and saw a young man slowly washing his hands in the sink giggling while his friend was in the stall also giggling I took my time using the restroom waiting them out which eventually worked While I waited I heard packages being ripped open and plastic being shoved into something After they left I entered the stall and found open packages for cold remedies sinus medication and dvds I called the store manager and he looked on the security cameras The kids took off in a dead sprint as soon as they left the bathroom and didnt stop until they were well outside We called the police and the officer stated that he actually knew one of the kids ,A Lot Of Stories Today,28,talesFromRetail

meguriau,19,27,1r5sy8,166,Hi TFR Im back My thesis has been officially submitted defended had an existential crisis and have recovered from all the irregulat sleeping patterns and physiological symptoms associated with caffeine excess Its been a long time but here is another instalment of Tales from a Hat Boutique httpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailsearchqmeguriauamprestrictsronampsortnewamptall This one has been in the works for a little while for a number of reasons  Im afraid of long walls of text and procrastinate and  I wasnt sure if it was clear enough  I should probably mention that I simplified the title of this series for simplicity but the brand also releases a line of bags for its springsummer SS and autumnwinter AW collections As such I will refer to the store as HB for hat and bag storeBackgroundTwo years ago I was employed by an Australian designer brand to sell hats at its flagship store Worn by various celebrities ranging from Hillary Clinton to Sandra Bullock the store attracts a large number of tourists as well as affluent locals The majority of the customers Ive had have been pleasant however there have been interesting characters and even a few nasty pieces of work discontent customers that have come by This collection of tales will be a mixture of my interactions with the most wonderful and absolutely nasty people I have met within this timeStoryTodays story describes the customer who left her mark on our generous reservation guideline and jaded my view of customers in retail Most large designer stores have a limit to the number of days you can keep an item on hold As a small store catering towards a large overseas market we were much more flexible and allowed customers to reserve an item for several months before their arrival in Australia sometimes up to a year without regular contact from the store The length of time was purely due to the fact that not all of the collection is available overseas and the slightly lower prices after taking the tax refund system into account which made shopping at our store more appealingThe extended reservation period was also available to locals Yes they could keep an item on hold for months as long as they let us know in advance eg I am on holiday and wont be back for a month or I live interstate but will be visiting in two months time For others we typically allowed them a reserve period of up to a month without any calls however the time period was dependent on the popularity of an item This guide worked simply because  the exact details of the reservation system are unknown to customers which gives us a lot of leeway on how to implement it and   locals for the past  years in addition to having common sense never left an item for longer than one week at most and answeredreturned their calls when we tried to confirm the reserve status As I alluded to but didnt really explain explicitly in previous stories summer at a hat boutique is the busiest season of the year To give you the scale of how frantic it can be sometimes the three months of summer alone can generate up to a third of the revenue for the year Now the head office of this brand is not known for making clever decisions with regard to production Even though we as staff members of the flagship store put more consideration in what wider range of items would be popular next season and request stock accordingly the preferences of the larger department stores skew what management puts into production Due to managements lack of foresight many of our popular products run out of stock before the season ends which tends to lead to much customer dramaThis story comes to you from the calm after the storm of one summer afternoon The end of the season was nigh and we had hit a record number of sales The boss had gone home and the only sound to disrupt the peace was the persistent ring of the phone behind the desk Slouching in the chair bracing myself for another demanding customer I was surprised to be greeted by a friendly voice We will dub the lady behind this voice DF for deceptively friendlyM Good afternoon HB store Meguriau speakingDF Oh hello Im looking to keep something reserved for a friend Would you have it in stock Its called B in the Natural colour from your SS collection M We do have one of those in stock When were you next able to come byDF Ill be in on the weekendM That sounds perfect If I could just take down your name and contact details well see you thenThis particular backpack was a  masterpiece Its craftsmanship gave off a casual yet stylish vibe and it caught the attention of every woman who came by the store The product only remained on shelves for three days at most before it found its way to a new home It was fantastic that it sold well however my manager had not been able to gauge the level of interest people would have in the item and nor did department stores As a result there were only three more B bags left over in the world at this point in time Despite the high demand for the item the weekend was only two days away so we didnt give it much more thought before reserving two other bags remaining at the warehouse The following weekend had come and gone with no sign of DF My manger figured we could hold it out for another week before deciding what to do Perhaps she was sick busy with work lost her phone In any case I left her a message offering to hold it for an extra weekAnother weekend another message and again no DF This time we let her know in no uncertain terms that this item was going back on display and to give us a call if she was still interested in this item We figured that if she called we could put the item back on hold and if not we could still have a new one brought in on the next delivery date A few days later the bag found its way into the possession of a lovely Japanese lady and DF was still not to be found It couldnt have been minutes after the transaction when the sensor sounded marking the arrival of a smartly dressed middle age woman Bright smile spreading from ear to ear it soon became apparent this customer was DFM Hi there Is there anything I can help you withDF I called in to reserve B bag for a friend Could I take a lookM Im sorry unfortunately we have taken this item off hold The warehouse shows up as having two more left in stock so we will be sure to have this item available for you by next week at the latest DF Thats preposterous It was on hold I wanted to see the dimensionsI proceeded to exhaust all possible ways of explaining to her that we did not have any others in store at the moment apart from telling her that I was not Hogwarts trained and could not simply conjure a replica bag for her to examineM Im afraid thats the most I can do for you at this point in time Well again give you a call when the bag arrives and if you could phone us before coming in that would be fantasticAll in all she appeared to back down and with an expression visibly forced DF mumbled something under her breath and sauntered out of the storeFrom that point on it felt as though DF was engaging in some form of petty revenge The same nonresponsive pattern ensued even after the bag had arrived and on hold This time the manager was determined to keep the bag until DF arrived Days extended into weeks and almost months until the manager had had enough She was by no means an impatient person however in this time the other B bag had already made its way into the hands of another customer so this bag was the last one available in the world and was spending its days hiding away in a cupboard The manager had reached breaking pointManager I CANT BELIEVE THE NERVE OF THIS WOMAN I RUN A BUSINESS NOT A STORAGE CENTRE IF YOU CANT GET A  DEPOSIT FROM HER PUT IT BACK ON DISPLAY SHE DOESNT DESERVE THE BAGAfter she calmed down she asked me to phone DF and let her know that we would keep the bag up until the weekend at the latest and if she would like an extension to please contact usOf course we had no such luck It was now Monday and had been no sign of DF Almost an hour after opening a customer phoned in from Japan for the B bag and it had now been packaged and ready to be posted Shortly after the sensor sounded It  was DF and mildly frustrated does not even begin to describe the response when I told her we were completely out of stock She was absolutely belligerentDF THE BAG IS SOLD OUT SOLD OUT HOW DARE YOU M Im terribly sorry but we had informed you that we would only extend the reservation period if youd left us a messaDF MY HUSBAND WAS HOSPITALISED YESTERDAY SO I COULDNT CALL M Im sorry to hear of your husbands illDF YOU WERE NEVER SUPPOSED TO SELL IT I ALREADY BLOODY OWN IT Unable to refer her elsewhere the rest of the morning was spent attempting to placate DF as she drove away potential customers and attracted a small gawking crowd Lets just say that animal taming was not a skill set I invested many points into On my own with no manager to back me up I soon realised that nothing I could do would calm her down and ultimately gave up letting her rage and rant Once she left she left for good and I have never crossed paths with her sinceFollowing this incident a new policy was set in place immediately Overseas customers are still be able to place extended holds on items regardless of their popularity however now it is not automatically true for locals Customers that dont need to cross a state line to get to the store can only keep an item on hold for a week however they were required to check in with us if they are unable to come by Of course there are a few exceptions to the rule but I guess thats retail Extra information for

dogfacegremlin,6,13,1r5qvo,98,BackgroundAnother post on here about shoplifting brought a flood of memories from when I used to work at a big box retail store I worked my way through college and have some very fond memories but some very crazy ones as well This is one of my favoritesI never worked Loss Prevention but was always called up during times of potential thefts The reason being is that contact had to be made with the perp from the time of the incident to the time they left the store  of the time Story timeIt was a few months after being hired I was called on a code blue potential theft I loved these so I rush up front and assume the position around the LP area with the camera I see a gentleman standing by the CD rack looking over the merchandise He looks shifty looks around puts his back to the camera and in a very swift moment turns right to the camera lifts up his shirt and deposits a CD into his pants In full view of the camera He does the same action another  times and proceeds to the exitAs expected we stop him and ask him to come into the LP office He doesnt argue or put up a fight just goes directly to the room with his head held low We ask him to remove the CDs and he does no problems From the beginning of the process I noticed that I knew him We went to HS together not a bright guy and we didnt hang in the same circles but we each saw each other in the halls He finally looks at me closely and it hits him that he knows me He verifies that I am that I am Dogfacegremlin and I say yes Then he asks very candidly if we got him good I smile say yes and show him the video Hes dumbfounded that hes basically showing the camera his theft and remarks that he shouldve done it the other way I laugh it offA few years later same numb nuts went to jail for robbing a bank Asked a buddy for ride to the bank came back to the car crazy asking him to drive Driver noped that idea and just sat there till the cops cameSmarty pants got busted for several other bank robberies because he left the bank bags from previous robberies in his roomTLDR  Caught a guy from my HS stealing asked me if we got him good showed him his theft video Year later same dude busted robbing a bank,Dumbest Thief Ever,111,talesFromRetail

AdriValkyrie,41,21,1r5ewi,77,I work in a restaurant in a fairly rich town in the suburbs of a large city and for some reason people feel entitled to make that comment to me all the time Im a rather short  and slim girl so I definitely do not give off a strong vibe I am much more so than most people think though that type of job definitely can keep you in shape Most of the time its older customers who seem almost worried for me as in a are you sure thats not too heavy for you when Im clearing off a table Yes I can otherwise I would not be carrying all of this that would be silly I appreciate the concern but no need to make commentsBut every once in a while its very condescending An example of this is when there were a couple of guys sitting at the bar when I went up to make a drink There was no more ice in the sink so I lifted up one of the ice buckets that are rather big that we keep nearby and poured them into the sink to then make said drinkOne of the two guys sitting at the bar looks at me while Im lifting it and says You shouldnt do that Youre a girl Youre not nearly strong enough to do that I just stared at him then proceeded to dump the ice in the sink and walked away while he looked stunned His friend on the other hand started shaking his head embarrassed by his friendI just want to know how people think this is ok Seriously making comments about whether or not I can do my job is not cool and please dont throw in sexist remarks eitherJust as commenting about my weight is not acceptable either Would you comment about the fact that someone was overweight No you would not So please dont comment on me eitherI just needed to rant a little because this happens way more often than it should and Im getting sick of it Does this happen to any of you as well,Youre not strong enough for that,98,talesFromRetail

delivery finance and computer geekdom Where will we go today  Today is groceries Shall we begin props to uFrenchington for sharing his lot story earlier todayThe parking lot My coworkers hated getting cart duty I enjoyed it Id much rather be outside and moving around than inside and lashed to a checkstandBut the parking lot is perilous I learned this from three different perspectives As a bag boy I could clearly see the damage caused by errant carts Later in life at the financial company I would hear clients tell stories of epic accidents in lots and see the resulting figures for the damage average damage in the lot used to be  with the most frequent cause being backing Lastly as a driver my first accident happened when a driver backed right into my car as I was driving along minding my own business But it happens Thats why we have insuranceHere are a few stories from the lotHIT AND RUN Nice warm San Diego night A smattering of carts on the lot Not many customers insideEnter a large Cadillac its a land yacht Its being driven by a senior citizen and she falls squarely into the QTip category Small white and sporting a moderate seniorfrizz of puffy white hairShe should not be driving anything The Caddy might protect her but its a lethal weapon to anyone elseThe driver rolls past me and anglesin to a good spot near the entrance to the store But she fails to hit the breaks and manages to smash into another car She backsup slightly and rips the number off of a relatively new HondaShe pauses looks around and stars backing again Damn shes going to run I have noting to write with so I try and memorize the plate Sadly I dont get a very good look She bolts out of the lot and disappears forever It was not captured by the security cameras And I never see her or the Caddy again BummerTELEPATHIC CART DESTRUCTIONA universal truth to retail is that the less you are paid the more likely it is that you will be blamed for things that had absolutely nothing to do with youIn this case I was in the back of the lot gathering carts Unseen to me a customer leaves a cart between spaces and nowhere near a corral A few minutes later this cart succumbs to gravity and starts rollingIt rolls right into the door of a customer who just happened to arrive at her car at that specific moment A nice dent is delivered and a couple scratches tops it off FantasticHey you She yells I had not seen the accident and was nowhere near her So I dont register that shes talking to meHey cart guy She yells This time I see her So I walk over to her carDo you ned help unloading I askNo I want to know why you dented my carIm sorryYou dented my car You left a cart out and it hit my car What are you going to do about itI was working on the other side of the lot I havent been in this area for a whileShe grabs the cart and pushes it toward me You left this out and it rolled into my car Who is going to pay for the damageUgh Ill take you to our manager He can probably help you outI escort the injured part into the store and introduce her to the manager Then I go back out and finish the job The woman emerged after a while and drove offBack inside the store I get called to the officeYou have to be more careful when doing carts You just cost the store moneyI wasnt anywhere near the car and I was not the person who left the cart thereShe says you didHow Im not telepathic I could not have caused the damage and I could not have prevented it The only thing I did wrong was doing my job I happened to be out there but It was not meLook Be careful I dont want this happening againI left without saying anything else I was both angry and a bit sad Angry at the false accusation and fallout and sad that people behave like this and it could affect my livelihoodYUPPIE PORSCHE COUPLE AND RELATED BIMBO ASSULTThis was the most upsetting of the lot chaosI was pushing a line of about seven carts back to the storefront Carts do not have brakes and Isaac Newton is not kind to rolling objects with a lot of massAs I was moving down the lane a white Porshe  Turbo overtook me began a right turn then stopped cold Inertia made me its bitch There was absolutely nothing I could do to prevent a collisionThe lead cart smacked into the read quarterpanel of the car It was a pretty good hit nice and loud and merciless to the PorscheYuppieBleachedBimbo shot out of the passenger door and pointed her finger at meYou just totaled a  carNow I did not handle this wellYOU just pulled in front of a moving like of carts and got hit Not my faultSecond rule of retail Its your fault It should not be but it isI want to talk to a manager right nowYuppieHusband parks his totaled car in front of the store right on the concrete ramp leading to the sidewalk  I marched YuppieBleachedBimbo into the store and dumped her off on the supervisor She muttered about how this was going to cost me my jobTo the supervisor This kid just totaled my husbands Porshe What are you going to do about itSide note Totaled is short for total loss This term means that it would cost more to repair the car than what the car is actually worthLets discuss it in my office Meanwhile I was instructed to wait in the break room until it was my turnIt was a long night I had to diagram the accident white up a summary and fill out some paperwork I was fairly sure I was going to get fired Part of me WANTED to get fired just so I dont have to put up with this kind of crap anymore The other part of me knew I needed the job and money and was terrified I was going to lose itEventually YuppieBleachedBimbo left with her KenDoll husband Once again I was berated for causing and accident I was not fired but I was told I would be the next time it happenedThe only comfort was that I did manage to tell

dimintia,7,11,1r4axm,68,A lady entered our department desiring a replacement power cable for her cell phone  Upon presenting her with what she required mind you that it was a cheaper alternative and not the cable from the original manufacturer she asks if the cable is made in China  Even though I know the answer to this question I look anyway on the cables packaging and when I inform her that her assumption is correct she erupts in a preaching rant to myself and a coworker that according to the news people have been dying from exploding cables that come from China  We stare at her blankly and offer no response giving her the opportunity she so desperately needed to vent it was quite apparent that she lacks rational people in her life  When she finishes I ask her if she would instead prefer to take the cable although more expensive made by her phones manufacturer  She happily agrees and as I hand her the cable I inform her that the cable and her phone are both made in China ,Beware of power cables made in China,79,talesFromRetail

ArQuesta,27,20,1r3xmk,48,Hello again fellow retail slaves Ive posted a few times before but mostly about my time before college when I worked at a Stop for Gamers Not today I meant to go get some reading done this evening but the sky is absolutely pissing rain right now and Im carless at the moment so I decided to tell you about a recent storyI just got done with my Bachelors this summer I know I should have escaped the abyss that is retail but Im stuck at home saving up money to move to the DC area at the moment while also filling out grad school applications as well as working on big job applications Im in a stupid spot and I need money so I started working at a big name coffee shop which is a threeminute walk from home ScoreFor the most part the job is fine no real horrible people to be found The ones that are entitled dicks who deign not to make eye contact usually end up tipping so its fine with me if they like being pricks They just spent  on a fcking drink Anywho Last week I encountered something absolutely amazing in its oddness I was working the drivethru window which at night meant I was taking orders and money and passing drinks and whatnot During a rush theres two of us as peoples drinks go from normal to downright stupidcomplicated But alas theres always a button for itA nice shiney k car pulls up my last customer in a long line rush She seems nice and as her drink is still being made we chitchat Now for some background I have the worst baby face I mean its great that I look young but depending on the person my  years looks like  I dont wear makeup drink or smoke so I am lacking any prewrinkles and Im chubby so I have the dumbest looking baby cheeks Its fine though as I get to surprise people with my age and that amuses me greatly For this conversation Ill use BAC for the lady and Me as meBAC Oh are you still in school right nowMe Actually I just finished Im working here to help pay for grad school applications and get on my feetBAC Oh what did you major inMe EastAsian studies chuckles Its kind of useless around hereBAC Would you say that you could talk about your major confidentlyMe at this point wondering if she works for the nearby college or needs a strangely specific tutor Oh yeah I can talk for days about culture history politics language etc for daysBAC Have you ever read the bibleMe shitshitshitshit here it comes Well a bit when I was youngerBAC with smug confidence and a gleam in her eyes When I was in college my psychology professor told us about the world in two boxes one where God existed and one where he doesnt Sure if youre in the box where he isnt there fine but what if youre in the other one Is it really that harmful to believeNow at this point my supervisor was standing behind me counting drawers and had tuned out the conversation as she told me afterwards I kept hoping my body language and the amount of time we were at the window would get her to help me but alas I was trappedMe remembering hearing that analogy used to argue the other point of view but deciding not to argue at work Well as a kid my dad let me try out every religion and Ive built myself up with the best morals and ideas from all of them If I had to subscribe to anythingBAC Some people are really fake you know They pretend to be deep but they lack in the most important area suddenly angry I know a lot of fake people and they arent people you should call friendsMe the fukThis was the most annoying partBAC suddenly remembering that she in the middle of preaching What are you going to do after youre done with schoolMe I dunno work for the governmentBAC And thenMe Take care of my parents and familyBAC And thenMe Travel or work abroadBAC And thenMe Ive thought about adoptingBAC And thenMe Live my life happilyBAC What about after lifeMe Theres nothingBAC legitimately surprised And youre okay with thatMe Well yeah were not immortal You live to the best of your ability until you dieBAC changing tactics When I used to work in retail I was a great salesperson really friendly but it was fake People are fake Then I read the bible Theres something there if you read it youll understandMe Maybe one day Ill read it but its notBAC Well you know everyone has problems rightMe Of courseBAC surprised for some reason that Ive agreed with her Well how do you deal with problemsMe Sometimes slowly sometimes not at all I try to sit down and think about things and to talk to people You can either sit down and let them destroy you or try to get up again Some people cant cope and need medications but I know a lot of people who deal with things on their ownBAC My husband used to be addicted to money sex and drugsThis is about where my patience absolutely ended my face started to crack a grin Im not an arrogant person but I write I read I study constantly Im an intelligent person and I wasnt going to allow her to outwit or speak me but I was also trying to be unfailingly politeMe corners of my mouth twitching Oh yeahBAC conspiratorially He used to be the biggest drug dealer in my home townMe holding in my amusement badly ReallyBAC Now hes the best husband utterly faithful and he read the bible Hes spiritual now thats proof You have toAnd then like God himself saying Jesus lady shut up the drivethru dinged and my supervisor started our spiel I said goodbye to the dear Born Again Christian and turned away from the window As I walked away my face flushed bright red and my eyes teared up from all my held back emotions My coworkers started laughing and asking what had happened I was a little mortified I mean here was this lady with a car worth more than my fouryear education lecturing a girl lol who she thought was in the middle of college  working minimum wage at a coffee place after dropping thousands on a what she thought excellent education If she only worked retail than dear drugdealing hubby must have paid for that right At what point did she have the right to say that I wasnt spiritual Im very spiritual and I have my own views of spirituality At what point did she have the right to say that to not read the bible was to be a fake human being who was obsessed with drugs money and sex Not only that did she really initiate a conversation geared towards the nonreligious simply because I told her I was educated Plus she didnt tip that poor drivethru girl who had to listen to her for fifteen minutes What a tool SeriouslyTLDR Educated women are obviously atheists Srsly,The DriveThru Window Assault,68,talesFromRetail

xVarekai,86,31,1r3e2x,169,This story is a little different as its not about a particular customer but instead about one of the most uncomfortable working experiences Ive had with a manager  Ive worked on and off for a certain body carehome fragrance store shilling overpriced lotion to the masses and as such Ive been in several stores depending on where I lived at the time and the financial state I was in  My first and only other post can be found hereThats called stealing httpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsjfthatscalledstealingand while I probably have other stories its been a while since I had to deal with that environment but Ill post any juicy ones I recallSo about this store manager  I lived in a small town in the bible belt for some time and while I hope this doesnt offend anyone I will say that I am an atheist but wasnt exactly out about it as Id experienced some nasty behavior in the past for simply saying I dont go to church  My store manager on the other hand was very active in her church and wasnt shy about talking about her faith  She seemed to assume that we were all christians of one form or another but I dont think that this is something that should be talked about in a place of business  Ive worked with people of all faiths and if youre a decent person I really dont care one way or the other  In fact Id prefer it not come up at all as this can lead to problemslike it did in this situationSo it was really more a culmination of comments and assertions than an actual confrontation for a while with me quietly holding my tongue and going about my job as best I could  I was in a difficult spot at the time stressed in private life and pretty depressed about my lack of direction even though I was actually able to save money for the first time  I had taken on a minor management role that turned out to be quite a bit more than I had expected  Some of you can probably relateAnyway Im struggling to master the many tasks and expectations of my position I was promoted into lower management and actually moved an hour and a half to take it so the disappointment was a bit stronger than if it had been within my previous home store and I can tell that my manager who we shall call Cindy from here on out is wanting badly to get me to church  Little things like Well have you made any friends at church and You should find a nice church to go to youll meet more people and feel better when I confided that my personal life was a bit difficult  I know Cindy meant well but there was no way I could really open up to her  Plus she wasnt exactly the model person she seemed to think she was pitting employees against each other and having her church friends spy on the store when she took a rare day off  Im not sure why she delighted so much in the little gossipy things she did but the store was small and her influence made some pretty big waves at timesOne day I was about to close up the store stooped to pick up some trash off the floor and came up wrong under the sink overhang giving myself a pretty solid concussion  My SO took me to the hospital after I called HR to report the incident where we stayed for  hours to be seen  I got a note that said I needed to be off for a few days until my symptoms cleared up and Cindy didnt like that  She sent an email to a comanager that I was pretty good friends with about how she didnt want me taking advantage of the situation  Lady I had a concussion and I didnt do it on purpose  That was pretty much the beginning of the endCindy started laying it on thick such as at management meetings where we talked about personal experiences looking pointedly at me when she said that faith is the most important thing in her life and she doesnt know where shed be without it  She even did this little stunt where she gradually filled a glass with objects of varying size saying If you dont leave room for faith then your bottle is never full  Fullon evangelical which again I dont care what you do in your own time but this is not appropriate for workFinally I was able to quit and started making plans with my SO to move back to my home state for a fresh start  She and I sat down in the food court for a coaching session and she started talking about how this job wasnt really for me and I agreed with her saying that I was going to be turning in my two weeks  She seemed annoyed that I was already making plans  I thought that was it and then before we went back to the store she looks at me intensely and asks xVarekai do you have a bibleAlright  Ive had enoughI said No I dont  And I dont think thats an appropriate question for a place of businessShe looked as if Id slapped her and maybe she felt that way too  I dont like to be confrontational or make people feel bad but enough was enough  I never once said anything to her when she was preaching at work I took it quietly and let her looks of disdain and irritation wash over me  And its not just religionanything that could be controversial like politics or views about abortion should not be discussed at work in my opinion  Its distracting causes problems and can make good people make poor choices in their desire to defend themselvesAnyway she was stonecold frosty to me for the duration of the two weeks and I was glad to be gone  Some of you may say well you should have gone to HR with that  And yes I probably should have  I suppose it was the general environment and knowing that it probably would have only gotten worse if I had said anything that kept me quiet and she has a lot of influence in that community  So I took it until I had a way out and didnt look backI dont know if everyone will understand the impact of that one question to someone who is firmly without faith but it was jarring and inappropriate  I only hope she learned something from the experience and hasnt done that to anyone else,The bible story,200,talesFromRetail

it on to a return belt near my feet if it was small enough If it was too large or if the belt near my feel got backed up the box had to go to one of six guys in my area This pissed them off when it happened because they had to touch something that did not belong to them technical note this company is absolutely insane with logistics they preach the art of touching something a few times as possibleI did my best to distribute the load as fairly as possible So as the crap came in I rotated the victim Everyone except BadassPonytail was understandingBadassPonytail started yelling insults after each misrouted box reached him Over the course of the first two hours I got called asshole faggot fucker mother fucker pussy pansy goddamn piece of shit mongoloid surprised at this one since it required knowing what it meant blind inbred etc LoudlyThe environment was pretty permissive of this type of banter It was a dirty shitty environment and there was absolutely no decorum This may have changed over the years but in this era there was zero censorshipPermissive or not personal or not I had enough It wasnt my fault and there was zero I could do about it So I gave everyone else a break and started sending  of the misrouted load to BadassPonytail I mean if Im going to get abused I might as well give him a reasonBox after box went to him He very quickly got backed up since he couldnt handle is regular workload on top of the crap His anger started boil He was getting truly and sincerely angry The verbal assault gained volume and he started calling out for a supervisor A supervisor did arrive and wrongly assumed I was still evenly distributing the crap So he told BadassPonytail to stop being a babyAt the hour three mark he exploded He began throwing boxes at me from about  feet away I shut my belt down turned around and played wide receiver He threw I caught then stuck the box back on his belt After a couple minutes of this I was grinning like an idiot and started flipping his off after each catchYoure gonna die motherfuckerBadassPonytail jumped up to his own conveyor belt and began to rush me He is both larger and stronger than I am and I knew that if there was any actual violence I would likely get thrashed So I grabbed the heaviest box I could find and held it up like a shieldHe charged into me and I thrust the box into his chest causing him to lose balance Instead if hitting me he had to right himself or hed fall about three feet onto a steel grateAfter stumbling his mind cleared One more fucking misroute and Im going to kill you after workFuck you you retarded piece of shit Youre gonna get everything for the rest of the day unless you close your fucking mouth As for after work just try Ill fucking flatten you and strangle you with your ponytailNow I said a lot of stuff working here It was very typical of me to speak of my physical abilities in terms that far exceeded reality I mean if I saw him waiting for me Id run to my car like a frightened gazelle and never look back I hate fighting and had managed to avoid it since middle schoolBut it worked and he backed down Look hand the stuff out fairly and well be cool But you keep fucking with me and well have a problemI punctuated the encounter with another middle finger salute but went back to being fair again No asses were kicked that dayI sincerely hope the culture has improved at San Diego Sunrise Looking back I laugh and cringe at how awful the environment was Everywhere else Ive working in life both of us would have been fired on the spot And we would deserve itThanks for

shadowmanwkp,12,17,1r1q8g,62,Preface I work at a Dutch chain store where we sell a variety of things food furniture curtains cutlery and a lot more Were most wellknown for selling stuff from abroad and selling it at a reasonable price Payout may be a bit above minimum wage but my colleagues are awesome and my manager is a really great guyBeing in the Netherlands theres one thing that is even bigger than Christmas Sinterklaas If youre not in the know Sinterklaas is about the same as Christmas but with the bishop of Myra st Nicholas coming all the way from Spain to the Netherlands supported by his personal army of black petes Last saturday it was the great inception because old saint Nick would come into my town with his steam boat This being one of the biggest events in town of the year and us being in front of the square where saint Nick will be coming you can imagine that it is very busy at our store when it happensOnto the story at hand Our manager warned us before we got started that the amount of thefts is increasing these days There were about a dozen of armbands stolen from our store the other day leaving only the cartons Because we have no detection gates stealing is easy but we barely if ever have any thefts unless it is holiday season This warning stuck with me the whole day and it was a good thing it didOut of our three registers we had two open near the end of the morning we were still anticipating saint Nicks arrival in town but that would turn out to be the end of the day Just to be sure that we had enough registers open I was near the registers so I could keep an eye on the amount of customers in queue and man the third register if needed In comes the group of five tenyearolds racing past our registers and jumping onto the candy which is just before me already making me suspicious because usually people will ask us whether or not it is ok to come in through the wrong side I keep an eye on them as they enthusiastically discuss what they will buy Nearly instantly a customer waiting in line says that they probably are stealing now Im on high alert As one of them goes past the registers I see him with his hand in his pocket Immediately as he brushes past me I ask him Me Do you have anything in your pocketHe immediately removes his hand from his pocket and begins sticking them up in the airPocket kid No I dont Search me all you want I dont have anythingWell thats a response that shows a lot of guilt and makes you suspicious all the more However we dont search customers so I let him off the hook Just when I finished with pocket kid from the corner of my eye one of the kiddos has a pack of chewing gum in his hand Just as I turn fully around it is vanishedI get angry really angry even if youre young that doesnt mean that shoplifting isnt a crime so I raise my voice a little and say You there I know youve got chewing gum in your pocket so dont forget to pay for itThe kid is flabbergasted and I am on my way for my lunch break we are very strict with them on busy days I see my boss on the way and I quickly inform him about the situation He tells me he will keep an eye on the situationDuring lunch break I review my own actions towards those kids maybe theyre going to step up to their parents Maybe my boss didnt like the way I handled the situation Anyways I wanted to talk to my boss because I was doubting myself I got my grub and the lunch break end At this point there are more people in the store so we open up all the registers to be able to service all customers Along the way I inform my boss that I want to talk to him It wasnt very busy but its better to be safe than sorry so I keep working at the register I help some customers and generally have a blast workingSuddenly two girls come up to my register just barely tall enough for me to see them over the counter They are being very sweet and ask me if they could ask how much a key chain costs With a genuine smile I tell them that it will set them back around  Its a bit steep for them so they tell me they want to ask their father to pay for them I offer them to let me hang on to it so they can simply walk up to the register and pay for it when they get back they happily obligeI get on with my work and it gets a bit busier so I didnt see the girls nor their dad It takes an hour or two before one of the girls comes back with their motherMe Hello how may I help youMom Hello my daughter had interest in a key chainMe Ah yes she was here earlier and asked about the price I believe its this oneI show the key chain and the girl confirms its the oneJust when the mother wants to pull out the money she suddenly stopsMother Whats that in your pocketGirl NothingMother Come on show me whats itThe girl pulls out an I lt beer key chainMother Where did you get this fromGirl From somebodyI am a bit doubtful so I ask the mother if I could check it I dont recognize it because we sell dozens of the bloody things so I flip it over to see if I recognize the markings Lo and behold they were identical to the key chain I held onto for the girlMe Madam the markings are the same as the key chain from our storeMy boss passes by and he says in a very polite way I would never be able to pull offBoss Madam it is from our storeUsually parents do not keep their cool if they catch their kid stealing after all you taught them not to do it and they still do This woman however kept her cool and pulled it off in styleMom Now be honest with me where did you get this from  Girl From somebody in the store  Mom No thats not true we know that you got it from the store Did you take it without permissionThe girl keeps totally silent obviously embarrassed by the whole ordeal The mom waits a little bit to see if her daughter will form a response but nothing She respectfully asks her daughterMom Would you like to apologize to the mister in front of you  Girl   Mom Come on apologize  Girl Im sorry  Me Apology acceptedI feel like a moron asking this but still its an honest questionMe Madam do you still want to buy they key chain despite all this  Mother No it was a present for her because she was behaving well However because she did this I wont buy it for her  Me Thats ok I wish you a nice day anyways  Mother A good day to you as wellThe day turned out to be mediocre saint Nick came and went and we didnt have as many customers as we hoped But I didnt forget to make a talk with my boss so when we only needed two registers open I asked a colleague to man the register in my place and I asked my boss if I could talk with him in the back I make him some coffee and we begin to talkMe Well I hope you know why I wanted to talk  Boss Yeah I do  Me Well I wasnt really certain if I responded the right way towards those kids this morning Im a bit afraid that their parents might come back because I didnt really follow protocol  Boss No not at all You did the right thing Although what youve said might have been a bit direct you did overhear from the customers that those kids might have stolen something And that thing with the girl was also handled well you did great todayWell that was a load off my chestTLDR Even little kids can turn out

metamaxwell,386,382,1r14xk,1116,So I may cry I was  minutes into typing this post up when a power surge hit and every thing at work went down including the computer and now I have to type this again That in itself may become another postDisclaimer Standard stuff First time post Massive wall of text etcBackground I work at a small privately owned retro game store You name it I have something for itNow this tale takes place a few days after GTA  came out You see on this slow day at work I was killing time doing what I usually do playing SNES games on one of our displays On the rare occasion when a customer would come in Id pause my game greet them and offer whatever help I could provide then make my way to sit in front of the computer that doubles as our register and browse the internet while people wander around the store Now it had been an hour or so since I had last had anyone in the store so I was itching to sell something when Mom and Kid came in I jumped up and gave them my spiel and they assured me they were fine and were just looking Well a few minutes go by when Kid and Mom come up to me with you guessed it GTA  in hand Kid has that look of pure bliss on his face The one where you just know he is envisioning the future just minutes away from him where he has popped that brand new game into his  and is merrily running over civillians and blowing them apart with every weapon under the sun Except there is one thing between him and that future A fell and powerful guardian That would be meI should take this time to mention that for the most part I dont like telling people they cant buy something It is sad not only because Im missing out on a sale but Im also a gamer and it sucks when you get that happy feeling of having a new game or system and its ripped away from you Your card was declined You have to be  or older to buy this etc are phrases I dislike Except in some cases when they are the sweetest things in the world For you the entitled the bratty the liars the assholes the pricks the scammers the schemers etc To you I find those words delicious and oh so damn good you just know its fatteningBack to the story So whenever a minor or someone that looks like a minor tries to buy a M rated game I am required by law to ask for an ID or get verbal guardian approval before the sale can happen Now most parents fall into one of two general categories The I dont care I just pay for the damn thing and assume every thing is okay now take my money type and the Im actually have an idea about what is going on here and Im totally cool with it now take my money type Those are the ones that just say yes and having done my duty and covering my ass legally I move on and make the sale Not Mom No when I tell her about the M rating she actually stops and ASKS ME WHY ITS M RATED My heart stopped I heard choirs and bells and that little tone we all know and love when Mario picks up a coin This honestly never happens Ive worked at this job for nearly four years and it is safe to say less than twenty to thirty people have actually asked to be informed Kids heart drops at this But you can still see hope in his eyes hiding right there behind the fear as he turns to me and every part of his body language is just screaming Dudebe cool NOPEI like my job and I like to think I do it well Im paid to play and talk about games from the Atari on up to the PS and Xbox One afterall So when someone asks me about a game Im going to tell you EVERY THING about it And thats just what Mom gets First blow Language Moms approval doesnt take any visible damage Kid is optimisitc and reassures Mom he is mature enough to handle itQuick second punch Drugs and alcohol I think I saw a grimacebut Mom recovers quickly Kid again whispering assurances and praise in her ear like Wormtongue in LoTRIm getting serious now Violence Finally a crack in the armor Mom starts to show some concern and wants to make sure Kid REALLLY wants this game and can handle it Kid puts on his most mature look I swear if he had a tux monocle and top hat he would have magically donned them at this point to complete the illusion He does he can he could pay the damn mortgage right now hes that matureYoure doing well in keeping the situation favorable Kid but I have a secret weapon Nudity Yep as some of you know GTA  didnt get the partial nudity rating that could qualify as anything from some exposed ankle to side boob Nope Now this is what Kid feared was coming and hoped I either didnt know or wasnt going to share it but I did Critical hit TKO Mom was out She refused to get it and told Kid he wasnt going anywhere near that game until he was old enough I thought that was the end of it but damn Kid was quick on his feet He played the Friends already have it card followed quickly by dad will be okay with it call himSo she stepped out of the store for a moment to call dad and tell him meanwhile Im left in the store getting the most venomhatespiterage filled look Ive seen Seriously I think if looks could kill this one would have done a number on me Not that quick and easy kill me on the spot stuff Oh no I mean slow and painful years of torture kind Well Mom comes back in and is on the fence again Apparently Dad wasnt against it but she still was Im given the phone and asked to tell him exactly what I told her and I do and Mom gets the phone back This time she stays in the store and I must have convinced Dad because this time she hangs up and tells Kid he is not getting the game Reddit let me tell you I have seen some tantrums explosions complete personality turn arounds etc in my time but DAMN Kid takes the cake All illusion of maturity flies out the window as he plays every cliche trick in the book He screams he threatens he cries he begs every thing I would love to go into detail about exactly what transpired here but it was a while back and he went on for nearly  minutes so Ill just give you my three favorite parts because I can remember those nearly verbatim Favorite  Kid is in that state where he transitions from rage to bawling seamlessly but is sniffling and snotting and generally grossing me out the entire rampage Why is this hilarious Because while doing all this he is telling Mom that he is mature enough to handle the game and that the nudity isnt even a main part of it and he wont look at it and he doesnt have to do it etc Except it actually is a main part for at least one story mission So yeah Also the tantrum technique Not exactly the best when trying to claim you are old enough for somethingFavorite  The xxx has it so screw you Ill just play it there Now kudos to Mom she handled this like a pro Her response You wont when I call every one of your friends parents and tell them you are not to be any where near that game Im also going to ask them if they know exactly what their kids are playingFavorite  This one was just stupid which made it all the more pathetic and hilarious Kid yells at Mom telling her he doesnt need her and hell just come back and buy the game in a few days himself Mom not fazed or even looking at me asks me if he could buy it without her To help her get her point across I ask if he is  she assures me he isnt and I tell them that without an ID proving he is  or older no one can legally sell him that gameThe night ends with her dragging his bawling snot dripping raging ass out of my store apologizing profusely for his antics and before they get out of earshot I can hear her list off the loooooooong list of punishments hes going to recieve after his behavior Reddit I love moments like that It had it all Drama laughter lies betrayal threats crying bargaining and a parent actually acting like a parent Oh and Kid was about  by the

verynotberry,14,8,1r0rm7,42,Ive been out of retail for several years but I still look back on those days with horror and nostalgia  I worked in a store in a smaller town where you arent always slammed and get to know your customers  There was one family Ill always remember with fondness  They would happily wait in a line several people deep just to go through my lane and I loved them for it I looked forward to their visits These were truly kind wonderful peopleHowever there were also the jerks  The guy Im going to tell you about is one of those  Now normally when someone would be a jerk to me I would tend to write it off  Its not personal Im not verynotberry Im the cashier  If it happened every time they came in to the store that was another story  This particular guy was always short and rude with me and my fellow cashiers  Talked down to us treated us like idiots the lot  But one day one glorious day I got my petty revengeHe came through my line and threw some bills and coins on the counter to pay for his purchases  While counting the change I noticed a Canadian penny  This store was in the US  So    not legal tender  I tell coin man CM for short that I cant accept his pennyCM  What  Why notMe  Well its not legal tender  CM  Why not Me  Well this is a Canadian penny and we are not in Canada so I cannot accept thisltbear in mind Im smiling and as friendly as I could possibly begtCM  What  Thats bull  Just take the dn penny   Truly he was a gifted debaterMe  Well sir I would but outside the boundaries of Canada this is not legal tender so I cannot accept thisCM  I PROBABLY GOT THIS PENNY FROM THIS STORE  ltBecause I know I always remember where I get each and every one of my coins dont yougtMe  Sir if that is true I am terribly sorry to hear that we are giving out the wrong coins and I will surely tell a manager about it so that we can keep a better eye out for them but as it stands I will need an American pennyIts important to note that throughout this entire process he had his hands in his pockets jangling what must have been several dollars worth of coinsCM  Oh Jesus  FineHe throws a penny on the counter  I hand him the Canadian penny back with the biggest kindest most customerfriendly smileMe  Thank you so much sir  Please have a nice dayNow if this had been any of our other customers I would have taken the penny no questions asked because hey the American and Canadian pennies are practically identical when you look at them quickly so its easy to miss  I truly believe the gods of karma were smiling down on me that day by not only getting me to notice the penny but also to allow me to have this moment to make a small stand for my fellow cashiers and get back at a man who always tried to make us feel smallIt felt amazingTLDR  Blame CanadaEDIT  formatting,Penny for your thoughts,50,talesFromRetail

Gimick,8,11,1r0n8k,31,I work at an officewarehouse where I deal mostly in shipping and receiving We are technically a distributor so usually we only deal with wholesale purchases but because we offer a warranty on a brand that is actually a product we manufacture we also answer calls about defective merchandise In the industry I work in almost no one on the retail level does returns on the type of merchandise we makedistribute We get a couple of calls a day about problem merchandise where they always explain to us the retailer will not honor a refund Fine Its no big deal we usually just replace it I get a call from a woman who is having trouble with our product I go through the motions to make sure its not just some kind of user error and try to figure out the best and fastest way to solve the problem She told me what was wrong with her item and I determined she needed to be sent a new oneI ask her for her information and notice I just took a call from the exact same address Well naturally I have to ask about it It turns out her daughter had just called about a different problem with a different item and had to be sent a replacement as well It is odd but not unheard of so I let it goAfter I get the information I need to process the replacement order I double check to make sure I am going to send the right product At this point the woman chimes in that I need to send two HmmI assume she meant her daughters order and try to explain to her that I had already packaged that order and that both would arrive on the same day She corrected me telling me that is not what she meantShe then goes on to explain to me that I need to send her two of the same item to replace the item that she had trouble with I try to figure out why which results in her giving me an immensely long story that in no way related to why she should receive two of an item to replace the one that she boughtI repeatedly try to get her back on track as I would rather not dally on the phone all day Eventually I get to the reason why she feels she deserves twoApparently instead of calling when her item broke she opted to purchase a second item to temporarily replace her broken item It is also possible that it was meant to be a permanent replacement but after seeing how easy a time her daughter had with our replacement policy she might of opted to go through the process for her own item That is speculation of courseEither way she felt since she bought a second item which works perfectly according to her I should send her two of the more expensive original item since she had to spend more money obtaining the new less expensive one I am not sure how those two situations add up for some people but to me the math is off Besides the fact that we did not receive any kind of direct payment from her as she purchased the item through a retailer we also are not in any way responsible for how you chose to handle a situationAm I alone in thinking that her expectations were way off base Is this sort of compensation common in other industries Honestly it made the entire replacement order suspicious Your thoughts,I Should Get Two,42,talesFromRetail

Cleverness,8,11,1r00wc,21,So I started working retail in July at a big box store as a cashier in NYC  I actually am enjoying myself here the customers at this store are mostly great and there has been no major problems  The management is great with scheduling me around class sick days etc and there are few things that I take notice of  Still alot of people pointed out to me that retail is evil and that I will eventually became insane myself from doing so  So I figure Ill post some things here that I encounterI have other things besides this as someone who is in his s and new to retail to see if anyone enjoys or relates to it  Long intro but yea lets carry onSo in my store its not uncommon for people to bring things up to the register say they changed their minds and hand it to me  I do not mind this at all  Infact I encourage it seeing merchandise placed in random places of the store where they dont belong annoys me more than anything  We can neatly sort it and send the items to their proper departments if they hand it to us cashiers  What I do not like are those who bring up a cart full of stuff and after ringing everything up the card is declined  Alot of times it will be because they are from out of state and the companies do it for their protection a quick call and its resolved I recall the transaction if I needed to suspend it and we finish upalot of the out of towners btw are great they are very friendly  Had a long chat with a guy from LA that I cant be too descriptive about to reveal where I work  Sometimes though someone will come up with a cart full of items their cards will get declined and they either A remove alot of the merchandise but once a card is declined I cant back out to the scanning menu for this transaction and have to start all over again  A minor pet peeve  Or of course B they say Ill get my other card from home and never return  So we have a cart full of items that now need to go backIt just boggles me how people dont keep track of what they can spend  Do they just grab whatever without looking at the price I can understand being a few dollars offI have some leeway I can do with discounts if I see someone is short and they arent a douche but off by  dollars Really  Especially this time of year where its busy,Sure we have nothing better to do than return merchandise you cant afford but put in your cart anyway,32,talesFromRetail
kingtigerii,20,13,1r00fh,95,Or How we just got skimmed by an EF tornado and you want your picturesSunday we had some bad weather roll through the area and the cell moving our way was a tornado spawner When the inevitable tornado sirens sounded I called a manager and let them know The following is a round about as to what happened nextpm Sirens sound for the county manager calledpm Store Director makes announcement that warning is in place Tells customers to wait for second announcement in  minutespm Announcement is made again that the Store Director suggests we take coverpm Manager suggests we unplug the photo kiosks to prevent electrical damagepm In the middle of the phone call with the manager she yells OH GOD THE DOORS and hangs up At this time I hear a loud explosion type noise and rumbling Instinct kicks in and I start screaming at people to get in the back cram as many people in the bathrooms as possiblepm People are trying to calm the screaming cashiers and employees The customers were super calm  go figure and I get paged over the intercom Its the manager and she sounds like shes shaken up badly Wants me to watch my cell phone and radarpm Try calling employee who is in at pm Hes like a brother so Im worried he was driving in Texting mom and other coworker Not sure of damage to storepm Getting sick of waiting in a hot and crowded bathroom with screaming cashiers panic filled environment isnt helping my coworker so i take her out too Radar says storm is passed No contact with coworker who is due in at pm Time line stopsSo I wander up to the front of the store to find that the roof is leaking in various spots but no major damage is done like many were saying Cashiers made it sound like the front of the store had collapsed when in reality it had simply taken roof damage and the glass awnings on the front of the store were gone later we found they had rolled atop the roof causing the damageNo sooner do I reach the front entrance when my buddy shows up laughing and soaking wet We joked around about it I explained what happened and we got to work roping off the middle of the store which was leaking badly Burst pipe and holes in the roof over the clothing departmentAs we are roping everything off and making sure nobody plays in the water my phone rings Now mind you we have emergency only power there are no registers open and the employees are thinking the management closed the store down until we can make sure nothing collapses or hurts anyone Around the store there are red phones that call an employee in the the department in which the phone is locatedIts a customer C for short Turns out were still opengo figureC  Hi there is nobody back here and we want our picturesMe  Maam there is nobody to help you back there because all available employees are assisting in cleanup and funneling customers out of the store Im sorry about the inconvenience I woul The customer then hung up on me and the phone rings againC  Hi can somebody come back here and give me my picturesMe attempting to do  things at once and make sure the dumb kid at my feet isnt playing in the possibly electrified water Maam the roof is leaking Nobody can help you photo is closed Please come back another day Sorry have a great night I hung up Few minutes later a couple teens walked by and were griping about shitty serviceSo my buddy and I get the department and most of the leaks roped off Manager calls and wants us to caution tape the front of the store outside where the glass awnings are missing in case anything falls I get cracking on that and avoid the reporter outside asking question on what happenedNext crisis we are still apparently open and need to close so we need to get customers checked out and out of the store I hop on lane and start with a transaction when the register looses power midway through There goes part of the emergency power CrapMy buddy is still open on the lane he jumped on so I help him with a couponer seriously she had a book Could have smacked her but we both kept smiling and got the store cleared out Signs get posted and we shut the doors Clean up timeEmployees start grabbing shopvacs off the shelves squeegees and anything else that can help like mops and buckets Others are pulling damaged product from the shelves and putting fallen things back up where they goIts about pm when we get another announcement from another Store Director The store is reopening at Midnight It comes as a demoralizing blow because instead of working towards cleanup we realize we are all simply here to reopen quick as possible and make the company more money Most of the people on overtime started to leave because they just stopped caring I decided to stay until my buddy left couldnt leave him alone with the messNormal cleanup until around pm when the Store Director from the previous announcement announces that we are now open for business My buddy and I look at each other and the still massive pool of water on the ground and decide weve had enough We pick up our mess and tell the nearest manager were leaving Ive got two hours of overtime and my buddy has an am class She tells us to put some stuff back really quick and get out By the time this was completed it was pm We were tired wet and hungryApparently the EF skipped over the store causing only minor damage compared to the industrial complex it wrecked prior to the store and the houses and drivein movie theater that were leveled after the store Thankfully it also missed the two hospitals that are next to the storeTLDR Met a man made of tin scarecrow and a talking lion and we skipped down a brick road to meet a wizard,Maam the roof is leaking And other Tornado stories,108,talesFromRetail

zobe,8,11,1qynfk,0,Okay so a former coworker and friend of mine posted this on her bloghttpcurlycrankycollegegirltumblrcom and I just wanted to share it with you all since some of us fast food workers can definitely relate And the rest of you can learn from thisEdited from OP for content chainproduct names I personally edited and added to the list below as wellI think it is important for everyone in America to hold a job in food service That way the human race will start to evolve from total jerks thinking they are entitled to order a six piece chicken strip basket at the window after spending three and a half minutes just to order a large oreo treat to normal human beings Fast food is still FOOD Granted the job is not as glamorous as being the editor in chief for a magazine or head chef at a high class restaurant in Socal  but end the end it is still a job I think it is high time that society gets rid of the stereotype that only losers work in the food industry I honestly enjoyed my time working at ice creamfast food restaurant minus the rough moments Ask anyone I would go back in a heartbeat My coworkers became my friends minus the stupid ones And I will always look back at the memories I created I got the job when the neighborhoods popular playcenter closed for the first time in over  years Playcenter had been apart of my life since I was  years old and my mom started working there I was well versed in how the business was run At age  I was running the front of the center greeting customers and stamping play cards as well as working the snack counter in the back At age  I started helping my mom work birthday parties By age  I was in the store by myself from open to close Playcenter wasnt a job it was a life style Playcenter had changed hands many times Luckily for my mom and I the previous owners always put in a good word for us and we kept our jobs That was until  Due to some underhanded nonsense I was not apart of my mother and I did not make the transfer over to the new owners For the first time in my lifeI had to FIND a job Luckily my bff came through for me yet again and put in a good word for me at  Then my future in ice cream began When I was first starting out it was rough My coworkers and I didnt know each other I couldnt memorize how many scoops of candy went into cookie dough treat and customers were mean I hope if there is one thing you take from this particular post you take away a new awareness for the workers at fast food establishments Anyone who is employed deserves respect no matter what the job is Minus people at the DMV They hate their lives I have learned many life lessons at  Most of them from my coworkers Most of them from my manager he has common sense Most of them involving the negative aspects of prostitution But thats besides the pointThe most important thing I learned from working at  was how to order in drive through And now I am going to share this great knowledge with youI give you the  commandments for ordering fast food Welcome to  How can I take your orderSpeak loudly and clearly DO NOT HAVE THE PASSENGER ORDER we usually cant hear them Feel free to say hi to who ever is taking your order DO NOT ask how their day was DO NOT repeat their name to them Its weird Just order  Make sure your kids arent screaming and your dog isnt barking It kills our ears over the headset we cant hear you the driver and its just rude DO NOT ask what our favorite item is  We usually dont have a preference  If you dont know what you want GO INSIDE OR JUST GO HOME  If you need more time to decide politely tell the order person that you are still deciding or need a moment The number one thing to remember is to notify the worker when you are done deciding Communication is key  When ordering ITEMCOMBO SIZE FLAVOR If you are getting a combo know what you want to drink  Notify us early if you have coupons Its easier to apply the discount when we are initially ringing you up versus making changes at the window Dont bitch about the prices We dont make them If you know the biggest US fast food chain right across the street sells the same ice cream cone for like a dollar go there then Well happily cancel your order for you Our ice cream tastes much better anyways Please try to make sure you have your cashcard readily available when you get to the window ESPECIALLY if you are waiting in a line of cars in front of you You have no excuse to not be ready when you pull up to the window Plus you are wasting everyones time by digging through your purse for a full minute AND NEVER PAY IN ALL COINS By the time were done counting that shit out your ice cream has already melted  Get off your phone If we try to ask you a question and you dont hear us thats your problem Now you are definitely not getting any ketchup with your fries Dont add on food at the window It adds to our drive time and time is money Plus everyone else now has to wait another  minutes or more for your piece chicken strip basket to cook  Mistakes happen Feel free to preferably come inside or roll back through the drive through and very quickly explain the situation We will be happy to fix something for you as long as you dont bitch about it In that case we will spitefully fix something for you  And pretty please dont come through the drive through high off your ass I learned what weed smells like at my job This is not what I had in mind when I was told Id gain life experience by workingcurlygirl and zobeTLDR Know what you want when you come through the drive through have your money ready and dont be rude Fast

DoomedPetunias,5,11,1qyioh,36,Nine months out of the year I work as a manager on duty to a gift shop which contributes to a large theater company and is almost entirely volunteer operated As you can imagine we carry everything from books to bardic bobbleheadsIn my time spent there Ive seen my share of sticky fingers  usually belonging to the younger crowd and going no further than a gourmet caramel or two which is why this lady was particularly memorable She was easily in her late sixties short and rotund and entirely inconspicuous until I saw the wigglePart of my job is to make the rounds on the floor to make sure everything is running smoothly I spot the lady in question with a miniature Monet calendar in hand Its slightly larger than a piece of toast I make a mental note and move further down my route when I see her dart furtively into a corner of the store At this point Ive gone partly up our short staircase and have an aerial view of her moving strangely in front of the wall When she turns around again the calendar is goneWe hold a strict policy of not apprehending shoplifters in our store which has always been so frustrating but I usually find little ways around it I approached the woman who now had a visible rectangle protruding from the front of her trousers With the most negligent glance in that area I smiled brightly and asked Would you like a basket for thatShe blanched and stammering out a negative brushed by me like the calendar had caught fire I had done what I could I maintained my distance but kept a keen eye on her while she pretended to browse for a few minutes before hurrying out the door I wasnt too concerned because before she left I had seen another wiggle and there Sitting on top of our tower of fruit preserves was the MonetTLDR On where NOT to hang a Monet and thank god for shrink wrap,Would you like a basket for that,47,talesFromRetail

SleepKittySleep,4,7,1qyf6u,21,Long time lurker first time poster Im a hostess that works only mornings and double shifts on weekends I am a  year old girl who is nice to everyoneBackground I work at a TexMex restaurant thats known for its patio People mostly come to eat outside on the patio not for the food in particular It can seat up to  people and takes up a city block Its been open over  years and is family run There are at least over  people employed About  waiterswaitresses work inside and about  outside during the weekends There are  busboys per section  hostesses in total  work insiderest outside there are  kitchens and  managers all related It can get VERY busy on the weekends Theres a hostess to each section and I usually work the line Most of the times there is an hour to  hour wait to be seated It takes a person with a lot of patience to be able to work the line We have to be able to walk through every time while having people complain and yell about the wait There are a lot selfentitled people who throw around a managers name Doesnt look hard but it is People do get mean when theyre hungryFirst manager L is head manager Hes real laid back and awesome Second is J cool but tough and scary He basically runs everything Third Z is sort ofbipolar I guess She is awesome one second but mean the next Tends to mess things up She works mostly inside Third is B a lazy ass who only works  hours at the end of everyday She only knows how to complain She HATES me Everyone hates her too though I see her  days out of the weekStory This took place on the patio Sunday night around pm There were only  hours till closing Besides me there were  other hostesses outside Our line had just ended and I was ready to finally start walking around When we work line were not suppose to move from the front unless necessary since we have a clipboard on who is next to be seatedAs soon as B arrives we all groan She always has some thing to complain about ALWAYS At least Z guides us but L literally does nothing Most of us have no clue to what she contributes to this restaurantAnyways people are coming and going Were giving our usual Hey how are you Enjoy Have a good night Were all in a good mood Every one of us are taking turns seating tables Were all doing are part This was going on for about  minutes until it finally died down Our head hostess was was taking care of the busboys and their stations  hostesses were helping put tablecloths while me and Awere watching the frontI had just came from a section in the back after seating table I was literally at the front for two minutes before B comes up to A and IB then asks Do you know a Mexican man with red shirt is sitting He was with his girlfriend or somethingWe both reply no This was not acceptableReally You dont know He was just here Her smile falteringA is really sweet nice and doesnt like to get in trouble so I reply for her The other hostesses might have sat themWho else is hereI answer with the same fake smile she has and name the other  hostessesShes getting a bit mad now And none of you know where you sat him She looks at both of us in disbelief then looks at A and asks What section are you atAfter A answers she asks who is doing lineup I reply that I am At this point I know this conversation isnt going to be pleasant They never are For some reason the moment we met we did not get along I guess its cause I hate that shes selfcentered and spoiled for her age Also because with her I tend to be a smart assYou really dont remember him He was wearing a red shirt She snortsIt took me all I had to not reply back with a smart ass comment There was literally a man with a red shirt in front of me So I say After a while everyone looks the same to meShe laughs Are you serious Cant you remember anybody You dont remember himI didnt seat him I just took a table to OU It wasnt meShe then calls me out Youre lying Ten minutes ago you were standing up here when he was here I was talking to the copI knew she was lying I was being honest I saw hundreds of people this morning I do line I can guarantee that if youre sitting in the patio I saw your face at least once Eventually youre only a number to me Not a face I worked a double that day with a non stop rush I was tiredWell then I dont remember They all look the same to me I smileStill smiling she looks at me I can tell shes expecting an apology Hell no I smile just as bigAfter  seconds of awkward smiling she turns to A and says Unbelievable Do you remember everyone you seatA is stuttering unable to answer I can tell she wants to stick up for me but she doesnt want to get in troubleLuckily a waitress D also her cousin also works as assistant manager some times comes and begins to talk to her She leaves as

acelam,8,16,1qyego,48,Im fairly new to retail and used to think that some retail employees exaggerated how ignorant andor rude their customers could be However these last two months have proven me wrong on every single level The public is full of rude and downright strange people Cue my storyAbout a week ago I was working on the sales floor A lady walks in with her son who appears to be in his twenties Immediately the son asks where our restroom is located which I didnt think was strange because its very rare for men to be happy about being in the store I workOnce I sent him on his way his mother and I began talking about some dining room furniture She tells me about how she found the same couch Oprah has on the side of the road and had it reupholstered so she was looking for complimentary chairs I internally rolled my eyes about the same couch as Oprah comment but whatever She seemed very eager to buy furniture and I dont give a damn what you tell me as long as youre ready to buy from meSo after showing her some selections of dining chairs I left her to peruse her options and went to help another customer whod walked in while Id been talking to her On my way to the other customer however her son finds me and stops me pointing to a rip in his shirt and saying Hey theres a nail sticking out in the mens restroom and I ripped my shirt on it You need to have it removedI apologized for the fact that hed ripped his shirt and told him that Id remove the nail as soon as possible He left and I finished helping the second customer before returning back to him and his motherInstantly before I could ask her how she liked our selection she says My son ripped his shirt on a nail in the mens restroom Did he tell you about thisAgain I apologized and told her that I planned on removing the nail as soon as I was able The store wasnt swamped but there were only two associates on the sales floor and our manager was having to handle paperwork in the back So neither of us could really disappear in case things did get busy or we had a customer ready to check outThe lady replied Well is that all youre planning to do I wasnt sure what more she wanted me to do so I told her that I would make my manager aware of the problem and that I would immediately take the nail out of the wall instead of waitingI went to my managers office and sort of hovered around briefly explaining the issue at hand My manager rolled her eyes and asked Is she expecting us to pay for the shirt or what All you can do is just get rid of the nail if there even is oneSo I grabbed the hammer and went to the mens restroom  sure enough there was no nail at least not one in a place where a persons shirt would get snagged Our restrooms display clearance paintingswall art that are hung up high and behind toilets so unless the son was doing some climbing there was no way he couldve gotten his shirt hung upI sighed and returned back to the motherson duo and asked the son where the nail was specifically as I could not find a nail anywhere that hed hang his shirt onHe then backtracks and says Well uh it wasnt exactly a nail It was those silver hook things on the doorThe silver hook things are the very blunt very wide hooks used to hang pursesbags while a person uses the restroom Given what the rip on his shirt looked like there was absolutely no way the purse hanger wouldve caused that ripHis mother again looks at me and says So what are you going to do about his shirt Its ripped because of your storeI apologized and told her that I couldnt take down the purse hangers She looks like Ive slapped her and says Well I dont care if you take them down or not Thats a Ralph Lauren shirt Its a hundred and fifty dollars I want to know what your store plans to do to pay for the shirt that you damaged If I broke a candle Id have to pay for thatI wanted to tell her that maybe her son probably shouldnt wear expensive clothes while he was out shopping I also wanted to tell her that our store actually doesnt have a you break it you buy it policy because if we did all of us employees would never make a dime lol But I just calmly said again that there was nothing I could do and I was very sorry Her face twisted up and she immediately turned around and stomped out her son right behind herAfterward my manager told me she figures it was probably a scam As I didnt get a look at the shirt when the son came in I had no idea if it was ripped before hand or not though I highly suspect it was Either way my manager supposed that in another store if this woman had continued to raise a stink an overtired associatemanager may throw her a  discount to just shut her upSo guys beware of potential scammers as the holidays get here Maybe this guy really did rip his shirt in our bathroom but how in the world is that anyones fault but his Ridiculous no matter how you cut it,Its my fault that you ripped your own shirt,64,talesFromRetail

worksinapetstore,62,65,1qybg3,333,ANTICLIMATIC UPDATEWell I got an email back this morning from our customer service rep telling me that the woman had called  However she is no longer in charge of customer service calls and redirected the call to a brand new office  I have not heard anything further about the situation  We hadnt heard about it yet because it literally was being announced that afternoon during a conference call  I asked my store manager to let me know if we got an email back from this new office but there was nothing in the email today  If I hear anything Ill be back here with an updateBACKGROUNDAs my username suggests I work in a pet store  A corporately owned pet store to give you a little more insight  Im a shift supervisor and so I tend to close by myself and it then becomes my job to handle the majority of customer service issues  Ill also preface this story by explaining that our store has a new no complaints policy  Corporate has been receiving too many customer calls that are complaints that corporate feels should have been handled at the store level  The manager staff has been told that we are to do whatever it takes to keep a customer from calling corporate    I could probably write a whole post about how I die a little bit inside each time I have to give a discount to somebody who in any other store would be told to hit the road Ill also mention right now if we werent under this new no complaints policy I would have asked her to shop elsewhere about  seconds into this whole ordeal  Then again I guess I wouldnt have this story if I hadTHE STORYSo I was doing my nightly rounds of the store making sure everything looked nice and neat when I ran into Eighteen Dollar Lady EDL for the rest of the story Me Hi there are you finding

FoodhttpswwwgooglecomsearchqwellnesscoreorignialamprlzCCHFXenUSUSampoqwellnesscoreorignialampaqschromeijljjampsourceidchromeampespvampessmampieUTFessmampespvampqwellnesscoreoriginalamptbmshop  This is a fairly high end food  In our store it runs for about  dollars for that size bag  The reason the price is so high is because they use high quality proteins in their food and they use several other ingredients with higher nutritional value instead of a filler like corn   I attempted to explain all of this to her but I didnt get a word outMe Well its a  EDL begins yelling out of nowhere YOU KNOW I NEVER COME HERE ANYWAY  I ALWAYS SHOP AT privately owned store  minutes from our location  THEY HAVE THIS FOOD FOR EIGHTEEN DOLLARS THEREthis is the where the broken record part of the story comes

through all that just to get the right price  ITS EIGHTEEN DOLLARS  WHY ARE YOU SO GREEDYwhat theMe  Again Id be happy to give you the food for that price but in order to ring an actual price match on the register I need some sort of verification that the same product is that price at the other storeand thats pushing it were not really supposed to go below cost to make a bitch like you happyEDL NO I WANT AN EXPLANATION  I WANT AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY YOUR FOOD IS  DOLLARS AND THEIR FOOD IS  DOLLARSWow  Fuck you lady  Im trying to help you hereMe  Well as I mentioned before this is fairly high end food  They use a lot of high quality ingredients so its more expensive to make  But you are getting a very good quality food for the moneyEDL  NO THIS FOOD ISNT THAT GOOD  ITS NOT HIGH END IF ITS EIGHTEEN DOLLARS AT THE OTHER STORE  DONT YOU LIE TO MESERIOUSLY  Dont call me a liar  If you want your damn food for  dollars go to the other damn store Please just swear at me so I can kick you outEDL  WHO DO I HAVE TO CALL TO GET THIS ANSWERED  WHOMe  Well Im a shift supervisor so if youd like the next point of contact is my manager who will be in tomorrowEDL NO  I WANT SOMEBODY HIGHER UPCrap  Were not supposed to let them call corporate until weve done everything at the store level to keep them happyMe Well Ill tell you what  I think I can scrape together a few store coupons to take about  dollars off your bag I died a little bit inside saying this by the wayMe  Would that be ok with youEDL  NO  I DONT CARE ABOUT A DISCOUNT  I JUST WANT A NUMBER TO CALL  YOU CORPORATE BIG BOX PET STORES ARE SO GREEDYside note I dont work for either of the two stores that probably come to mind when I say big box store  Its a corporate store yeah but weve only got about  stores total Were actually cheaper compared to the other two big pet stores that probably come to mindMe  Mam I dont set the prices  I can give you a number for our customer service representative and I can give you some coupons to bring the price down a lot more than I quite honestly should  EDL  NO  I WANT WHOEVER SETS THE PRICESFucking seriously  Nope  Shes not getting anything other than our CS repEDL Mam I dont have that information I can give you the number for our customer service rep and if shes not able to help you out then she will give you the number of somebody higher up  EDL Fine  We get up to the register  I find a few store coupon PLUs that we have to use in situations like this  Its meant to be a last resort that maybe just maybe if a customer sees the price come down that much they wont call corporate   Even though I know shes going to call corporate anyway  I still give her the coupons off  I think because all that will happen if I dont do it is corporate will fucking send her a  gift card for her troubles  Because to them shes one more customer that will spend money in our store so lets give her  bucks now to keep her coming backall about that bottom line for themShe finished her transaction and left the store Knowing that shes going to call corporate I now had to write an email to the customer service rep detailing the whole incident  And then I had an ideaI pulled out the yellow pagesI looked up that privately owned pet shop that was about  minutes away from usI called them from my cell phone pretending to be a customer Asked them if they had Wellness Core Original in the  lb bag and what the price was if they did The guy came back on the phone after checking They do not carry a  lb bag at all of that brand  They carry the largest size  lb  Its Our price on our  lb bag is   Were cheaper than them  WERE CHEAPER THAN THEM  I pretty much was dancing at that point I wont know how everything went down on the corporate end of things until tomorrow  Im praying and praying that they tell her to shove it  because I REAAAAAALLLY wanted to  And Im hoping that maybe this particular nutcase makes them rethink their no complaints policyTLDR  EIGHTEEN DOLLARS

RenM,61,20,1qwc0g,122,So I used to work as a pharmacy technician which means I both handled prescriptions and rang up everyday shopping items for customers It was a combo hell Here are some of the stories We had a regular that was HIV positive super nice but also a bit mentally disabled His mother often brought him to the store or just picked up his meds for him However one day he came in without her and we exchanged our normal pleasantries He said he needed a refill I said I needed a new prescription he pulls it out of his wallet and I see that his finger is bleeding it looked like a paper cut He take out his prescription with said bleeding finger and attempts to hand it to me Normally policy is to hold a customer until you are done running the script incase insurance feels like making the job extra awful Instead I say while typing Oh no name It looks like you cut yourself Just put the script on the counter and here take a bandage which I dont hand to him but instead place on the counter normally rude but Well call you when the script is ready He just smiles says thanks puts on the bandaid and walks away I smile until he disappears behind an aisle and then tell the pharmacist what just happened In the end we cleaned it up and my manager actually called his mom His mom apologized She was sick and he wanted to run errands on his own I guess she explained to him that he cant bleed on public things bc he apologized profusely the next time he came in with her  Our duties board is posted in a place that customers can see it This means if they feel like being creepy they can tell when you start work get off work or take a lunch break I had one older gentleman look at my name tag then at the board and then he said Ill be waiting for you at pm Then he winked and walked away The assistant manager walked me to my car that night Another older gentleman came to pick up his viagra That stuff is expensive so most men only get a few pills at a time and refill as necessary This man said My wife and I dont do it that often anymore Maybe one of these pills has your name on it Me No Im pretty sure they just say Pfizer on one side and VGR  on the other Sorry Then I walked away  I lady comes up to buy a behindthecounter cold medicine Me Can I see your drivers license please Lady No Me Kind of caught off guard UmI need it to sell you the medicine Lady Why Me State law Lady Why She was well into her s so Im not sure why she was mimicking a toddlerMe Because some of the ingredients can be used to make illegal drugsLady Like whatMe MethLady I dont make meth Can I have it now pleaseMe No I still need a drivers licenseThen she asked for the manager I got the pharmacist and she had nearly the exact same conversation with her The lady ended up just leaving To this day I still think she was screwing with us My favorite story There was a doctor in the area that had a couple of his prescription pads nicked All the pharmacies were on alert and he had already agreed to call in any prescriptions until he could get new pads made Well a couple comes in and not to judge but they were the rattiest dirtiest couple I had ever seen I mean they actually had dirt on them and smelled like they hadnt bathed in weeks and gives me a prescription for a Class  Controlled Substance I had never seen filled in my  years of working there We always had a bottle stocked but I never saw us actually fill a prescription for it This was my first red flag Then I get to the doctors name and its just a scribble not really uncommon so I go to the typewritten section and realize its for the doctor that had his prescription pads stolen I tell them Im sorry but I cant fill the prescription I dont give them a reason why I hadnt thought this through yet So they say okay and instead of leaving pull out a second prescription but for a simple Class  Controlled Drug This time I just take the prescription smile and say Ill call you when its ready Instead I called the cops  Finally my last story which shows that sometimes its not the customer that is the jerk Its a pharmacy We sell Plan B If you are over  you do not need a prescription So Im working prescription drop off the pharmacist is mixing up a compound and my least favorite coworker is working prescription pick up Its late so it is just the three of us and I had no customers so Im just filling the next days orders when a lady walks up to the pick up area She is a good  feet away and very quiet so I cant really hear what she says Apparently my coworker couldnt hear her either bc she goes What The customer speaks up and all I hear is Plan B I know my coworker hates all birth control but what she does next is mortifying Lady mumble mumble Plan B mumble mumbleCoworker Oh She looks at me and opens her mouth Me thinking Dont you dare do it Dont you dareCoworker yelling This lady wants some Plan B Will you take care of it I wont fill a baby killing drugThere is a loud clanging as the pharmacist drops her pestle the customer begins to cry and I am just standing there jaw open The pharmacist could not control herself She yells my coworkers name and brings her into the back room I take care of the crying customer and get her a gift card that more than pays for the Plan B I apologize profusely and she leaves no longer crying but obviously upset My coworker comes out upset and angry but she returns to her job About  minutes later Im off for the night so I clock out I walk from behind the counter to pick up look at my coworker and go I need to pick up a prescription pause Its my birth control Its not Plan B but she hates it too She turns red looks at the pharmacist who goes nope and then gets me my prescription That was her last week ,Pharmacy Stories,142,talesFromRetail

PWNDUINMK,47,24,1qw874,93,Wall of text incomingGOSo I work at a retail pharmacyconvenience store I dont work within the pharmacy but I work at the front end of the store where I am one of the managers Although its not entirely significant to this story Ill let you know that the front end is open ampm  days a week while the pharmacy is open ampm weekdays and ampm weekends On with the showSo the night before last I had two very drugged out  somethings come into my store They were both wearing jogging pants and jogging jackets with zippers His was grey dirty and far too baggy for him causing the pants to droop Hers was black and probably the right size but her jacket was zipped open to reveal a tshirt that was many sized too small leaving  inches of flabby midriff exposed Both of them were as pale as ghosts and have the telltale facial marks of meth addictionThey come straight up to the counter and ask if the pharmacy is open I assure them that as it is  pm on a sunday it is not open at this time The male asks if there is another pharmacy nearby that would be open I tell him that I dont know off hand but that I can check our system to see I go into the office and see that there is a  hour store just a few miles away form usI return to the male who is at the front counter and ask him if he is walking or driving He looks at me puzzled for a second as if to say Where am I  going His drugged out train of though reminds him that he asked about the pharmacy and he replies driving I tell him that there is a  hour store less than  miles from here I offer him the address and he loses concentration for a moment He then asks me if I know any of our nearby competitors pharmacy hours  I do notHis initial reason for needing a  hour pharmacy was that we are the only ones that take his insurance Now he is rambling that he will check the competitors to see if they take his insurance At this point he runs off into an aisle to meet his woman I tell my cashier to find them and watch them like hawks while I man the register He nods in agreement and makes his way over to themThe man and woman have a very loud expletive filled conversation with one another about what they should get The man comes to the front to get cigarettes Im worried that the drug use has artificially aged him so I ask for his ID He doesnt have it He yells down the aisle for the woman to bring her ID to the front She yells that she doesnt have hers with her He asks me if a passport will be okay and I oblige himHe tells me and this is important that his passport is in the truck So I set the cigarettes to the side and help other customer while he runs out to get it He comes back the passport shows him born in  which makes him old enough I ring up the cigarettes again and tell him the total He tells me that the woman has the money and runs off to bring her to the front She loudly exclaims that she obviously wants to buy everything once and that the cigarette purchase will have to waitI call my cashier back to the front as I have to leave the front to help a real customerFast forward a bit and they are at the front with Milk ice cream and cookies much less than the woman seemed to be carrying around They ask if we can check the balance of their food stamps card my cashier tells them we cannot and so they stand at the front counter and call the phone number on the back of the card to check their balanceI manage to ring out most of the line of customers forming behind them The whole time the guy is loudly complaining about how they cut stamps benefits for everyone using lots of colorful language He keeps telling my cashier that they were only supposed to cut it  but him and a buddy of his went down  Oddly enough none of our other multitude of foodstamp customers have mentioned thisFinally they find out that there is around  dollars on the card they swipe it to pay but obviously its not enough to cover the food in the transaction so it is declined I tell them any my cashier that if they dont have enough to cover the full amount on the card that he must enter the exact amount they wish to use and then the rest can be paid separately At this point they decide not to buy the food and to instead just buy the cigarettes with cashAll is well except that the womans fairly large canvas bag purse seems much fuller than when she walked in The walk through the doors and the shoplifting alarm goes off myself and my stocker immediately head over to stop themThe man immediately exclaims that the alarm went off because of him It didnt it obviously went off when the womans purse went through I tell the woman I need to see in her purse as it is what set off the alarm She holds it up and sticks her face in it She exclaims nothing is in it except for her stuffI grab the purse to look inside of it and she grabs it back and screams at me She exclaims that it is her personal purse and you go lookin in peoples personal bagsHer and the boy friend bolt out the door Myself and my stocker follow them out I tell them that I am calling the police and begin placing the call on my phone At this point I could grab her bag from her but I dont I have health insurance and Im not getting into a fight with two druggiesThis is the fun part the girl is screaming to the guy to get into the truck Its a black ford explorer that my stocker is writing down the license plate ofThe man starts saying We didnt bring the truck This isnt my truck We dont have a truckThe woman after a minute or so decides she has had enough and begins walking away in tears The man shrugs and gets in the truck finally and pulls out of the parking lotThe woman runs around the other side of the car and jumps in and they speed off into the nightThe police arrived a few minutes later and we file a report complete with the tag number of the truckTLDR Dont do drugs,Drugs are bad or How a drug addict denied the existence of his vehicle trying to beat a shoplifting

chesterfeildsofa,29,21,1qvy3h,105,I worked rd shift at a grocery store for around  months and I would start at pm get my lunch at am and get off at am For my am lunch the assistant managerAM would have to come up and run the register the  minutes i was gone as well as close out the register for that day It was probably worded different but at am the computers would freeze and not let you scan anything until you did the end of day stuff I can only remember one extreme coupon incident I think maybe twice a year the store would have triple coupon days where any coupon under  would automatically be tripled This lady came in around am and got to my register around am She had a TON of coupons and a lot of duplicate items I finished scanning all of her items and had started scanning the coupons around am So of course the computer would freeze right then The AM tried to fix it but it said nothing could continue without doing the end of day which would also void the entire transaction A line had started to form behind the lady so the AM said he would rescan all of her items on a different register while I took the other people behind heronly my computer wouldnt work until he did the end of day stuff So I am standing there looking like an idiot while he tries to get this lady out of the store Then HIS computer freezes I dont know what happened after that because he told me to go to lunch and he would take all the other customers on his register This whole situation was confusing as fuck because he was so frustrated and wouldnt explain anything he was doing to meI came back min later and he tells me he got her taken care of and she got  dollars worth of stuff free and he even had to give her money from the register when he was done I thought that was probably a huge mistake but whatever its on him not meThe next night I come in and the General Manager asked me what had happened so I told him the story of the previous night Turns out the triple coupon deal was only to be applied to the first  coupons for a certain item then just the regular coupon after that No one had told us this before they left the previous day so we didnt get in trouble for itOne good thing though that made all of it worth it is what the lady told me while I was ringing her up She said she worked for a church and everything she was buying was going to that churchs food pantry,Coupon Nightmare,126,talesFromRetail

HeloRising,41,73,1qvprn,406,This was another incident that happened at a pottery store where you color things that will soon belong to you The last one took off so I figured Id throw another one upI was working one very slow afternoon and three teenage guys come walking towards the door This wasnt strictly unusual sometimes guys would come to make something for their girlfriends These guys were decked out in full hip hop gear though and all whiter than bleached snow A little odd but this was in an incredibly white area of the city I used to live in and in a major upscale mall it wasnt unusual to spot five or ten Vanilla Ice clones on a given daySo Ice come walking through the door and start looking at the shelves full of unfired pottery pieces a lot of what we sold was figurines as well as plates and dishes I greeted them but they didnt take much notice so I went back to what I was doing until one of them comes up to me a few minutes laterYoYo manyou got like any frogs Frogs Yeah weve got a couple of different ones they should be up on that shelf Naw dawg I saw those ones But Im lookin for somethin special Somethin gangstaI stared at him for a full thirty seconds trying to process what the actual fuck a gangsta frog looked like I turned and looked at my unreasonably hot coworker thinking this was some kind of joke to play on the newish guy She had this look of complete bewilderment on her face and I knew she was a crappy actor so this had to be for reals yoI told him to hold on and Id check in the back I went back where another employee was finishing up glazingHeyI dont know our whole stock yet Do we have anything back here that we dont have out there A couple of things why whatd they ask forlong pause A gangsta frogthe fuck is a gangsta frogI have no idea Do we have anything that meets that criteriaWeve got one with a big chain give him thatWe did in fact have a frog with a big gold medal around its neck and I brought it out to himYeeeaaahhhh booooiiiiiii Thats what Im talkin bout Dats the shit right thereSo he sat down with a pallet full of suitably thuglicious paints and started pimping his pottery His cohorts also selected figurines Thug One went with a springing lion and Thug Two defied all expectations and selected a small rose From listening to their backandforth these were suitably gangsta choices for various reasonsAs they were painting my unreasonably hot coworker came up to me and in a quiet voice asked me if she was in fact tripping balls or were there three teenagers treating the experience of painting figurines as an experience worthy of song they had in fact begun busting mad rhymes about the various colors of paint they were working withThey took about an hour to finish their pieces I wouldnt have given them any awards for quality but they took their work seriously We could tell they were proud of their work because they went on at length though Im not positive how a springing lion can look straight outta ComptonOnce they finished they paid with credit cards not as gangsta as a wad of cash but way easier for me to deal with and left Last I heard they were turning the date I gave them to come back and pick up their pieces into a rap To their credit they werent half bad at itAntics aside they were actually very nice and never gave us any static Never even heard the n word out of them which was sadly very common with the hiphop kids especially the white kids,They want gangsta frogs,479,talesFromRetail

Personsen,445,654,1qvk5o,1641,lyranotsureIm not a huge fan of coupons in general There is usually some problem with them like they are either expired they dont scan or some issue in the fine print that will either make the customer go into a yelling fit or make the line pile up which is a pet peeve of mine If you want to use one or two coupons I am fine with that I completely understand wanting to save some moneyBut there is a trend that pisses me off to no end  Couponers  A lady came in a while back with a large amount of deodorant in her basket After I finished ringing her up she said  Oh and I have a few coupons  She then pulled a massive wad of coupons out of her purse  None of them having scannable bar codes meaning that they would all have to be keyed in manually I called up a second cashier and began to read the fine print as I am supposed to  She notices I am reading them and says Yeah Those should pay for the entire transaction  Im sorry it says limit one coupon per customer and that they arent to be used with any other coupons I reply  No I did the math I have enough here to cover the entire transaction In fact you guys should technically be giving me cash back she says with a chuckle  At this point the line was piling up again on my register so I called up a third cashier and the manager  The manager comes up and asks how he can help  She says Yeah this guy wont let me use my coupons  I point out to him that it clearly states that the coupons cant be used like this  The manager ignores me and lets her have the fifteen or so deodorants for freeBefore she left you could just feel the smugness radiating off of her She says You should be expecting more of us  We couponers are starting to get pretty big around here Next time just scan the damn coupons She then struts out the door with a smile  The manager was fired soon after  ,Fuck Couponers,2295,talesFromRetail

JizzBeef,9,11,1qrqn5,49,I work at a very popular gas stationconvenience store in the midwest that everybody loves including the people that work there Out of paranoia I ask for everyone to please respect the Anonymizing Rules So the location I work at can only be described as the worst location in the most entitled part of the state thats in the smackdabmiddle of the United States And when I say that its the worst I dont mean that its the most entitled location I mean the complete opposite of that ie I see prostitutes and drug deals as well as having to deal with drug addicts and homeless people on a regular basis Due to this I have absolutely no tolerance for rude people or for shoplifters or the sort and oftentimes I come off to many customers as being mean just because I can never let my guard downSo anyway I was working an evening shift earlier this week As I was walking to the back of the store towards our supply room an older man wearing a yellow sweater was kind of walking towards me as well as my new coworker Due to his yellow sweater well now call him YS He was kind of approaching us slowly and my coworker Ill call her S was a few steps ahead of me YS tries to stop her but I buttin automatically knowing that this man would be some sort of trouble She stops as I stop to deal with him but I shoot her a look of Illdealwithit so she keeps on doing what she was doing and walks off When YS gets close enough to me my encounter with him goes something like thisYS Hi um can I uhhhh ask you a questionMe obviously aggravated but trying to hide it Yes what can I do for youYS Well come over here with me Id like to show you somethingI dont normally follow male customers when they try to lead me somewhere just because the only thing that us gas station employees fear more than a robbery is a kidnapping Luckily though this was not the case Instead YS leads me over to our rollergrills and shows me the tongs attached to them I say attached like that because they are not actually attached as you can take them off of this little metal loop to use them and people drop them all the time Another thing about our tongs is that we clean them very vigorously every time they happen to fall and we also have another clean set in a cabinet at all times to replace the old ones with every three hours This is all relevant dont worryYS Why arent these chained to the grill Me I dont know would you like to discuss this question with a manager though YS Yes if you would please But uhm whats her name He says this as he looks up at our register noticing that my other coworker is on the main register so he assumes that its herMe HIS name is Justin and I can get him for you really quickYS Justin huh How long has she been working hereMe Uh wha uh well uh HE JUSTIN has been here for over  years YS Okay well yeah get him for me would you Oh and also he holds up some silverware in his hands two forks and a spoon where could I find a spoonI ignore that hes already holding a spoon and point out where he can find them but then he suddenly realizes that hes holding one and says Oh nevermind I already have oneGreat So now I have to go into the freezer where my boss is trying to get inventory done as fast as possible before our next shipment comes in in less than three hours and tell him that theres a senile old man that would like to speak to him About something completely idiotic Which is exactly what I tell him to which he replies Oh great this is exactly how Id like to spend my nightAfter Justin comes out with me we find YS guy and he talks to him and basically it just goes like thisYS Why arent the tongs chained to the grills What happens when they fall Ive seen other gas stations where the tongs are chained why arent yoursJustin Here in state its not a health regulation or requirement that the tongs be chained to the grills and this actually works out to our advantage as well as its much more sanitary than having attached tongs as this makes us able to clean them every three hours as well as any time they appear to be unsanitary or if theyve fallen onto the floorYS Yes but why isnt it a health regulation I mean germs exist in bordering state why dont they exist hereWhat The Actual FuckJustin just repeats himself then attempts to persuade YS to fill out a customer comment card to which YS agrees to do but then just keeps asking the same questions over and over again To which Justin just responds with the same exact responses This goes on for twenty Fucking Minutes YS has now become a fire hazard as well since hes standing directly in front of the front doors and refuses to move despite Justin taking a few steps back in an attempt to get him to move There are probably about  customers in the store at this point and were getting backed up on the register and Im afraid that something might go wrong with one of the newer employees that they may need Justins help with So I briskly grab a customer comment card and hand it to Justin just to try to make it clear that this guy is just a hopeless broken record and he needs to leave Eventually YS leaves and Justin looks so pissfully exhausted He then tells me I thought that was never going to endtldr what,The Perpetual Question,60,talesFromRetail
CaptainTomTom,48,30,1qrots,89,Have you seen those shirts with the above mentioned title name I love my church I see them all the time where I work Ah the joys of working in retail No Im joking Anyone with a few amount of brain cells would know there is little to no joy in retailNow about this shirt I work in an art store We cater to the creative crowds Usually our customers range from teachers to soccer moms to christian educators of the like They flock to our stores each Friday Saturday and especially Sunday when the new sale starts upThese customers are  more likely to wear this shirt I love my church Youd think theyd be our most understanding and nicest customers The model christian that everyone aspires to be Or believe they are Yeah I thought that too for a whileYou see these people are something different Outwardly they wear a smile that seems as if they are a friendly and kindhearted individual However if you were to look deep into their eyes I swear to you they are not human They are something else Something evilThis one customer changed my entire view on this shirt But its just a shirt Captain TomTom it cant be that bad Oh but it is Oh but it isI had the pleasure of cashiering a sunday afternoon right after the churches let their sheep out of their sermons I call them wolves in sheeps clothing Thats what they are Most of them wear this shirt I keep bring up So did this customer who Im finally starting to tell you aboutI knew she was trouble when she walked in Our store likes to play this song over and over on the PA system Even during chistmas time In tow she had  kids who immediately left her side and went running through the store I greeted her from the registers and she smiled and was mumbling about something to herself and continued on her way Not before I glimpsed at her shirt I love my church I was naive to the plight of retailers at the time I did not know what was in store for meRoughly about  minutes later she comes to the front of the store with a shopping cart full of random items Yarn popsicle sticks glue construction paper all kinds of stuff She still had that smile on her face The kids were following her and had candy and other crap that crafty kids like within their grubby little hands I cleared my throat and began Thank you for shopping at s I can check you out hereShe motions her  kids to come along The  kids immediately started to pile up things on the register making it hard to keep things organized The mother of the three dug into her purse and pulled out several coupons That was the second omen Our store has a strict coupon policy One coupon per customers per day We cant bend the rules at all for anyone no matter who they are what they do who they are affiliated with In bold print it clearly states our coupon policy on each and every coupon It also states it on the registers On the walls when you first enter the building In the bathrooms But these signs seem to get ignoredShe hands the coupons over to me They were all the same ones  off one regular priced item Im sorry maam You can only use one coupBefore I finished she smiled and said Ok I smiled back thinking she understood She kept mumbling and talking Then I realized she had a bluetooth earpiece in her ear Apparently holding a conversation with someone on the other end That was the third omen I was clearly a deer in headlights I proceeded with the transaction scanning and bagging each item When I was picking though some of the things piled up on the registers I touched something wet and slimy One of those nasty little kids opened a sucker and licked it and put it in the pile of items on the counter Immediately I recoiled and investigated what it was I touchedI gagged a bit as the drool trailed from my fingers to the sucker I quickly regained my composure and wiped my hands on my apron someone stole the napkins from my register along with the hand sanitizer that day I looked at her seeing if she was going to apologize as she was staring at me No she was carrying on her conversation in that earpiece The kids looked at me and just laughed Those little laughs haunt me till this day It was just innocent child laughter It was off it was like they plotted to do that I could be paranoid but those laughs tell me other wiseAfter bagging several items  I saw the light at the end of the tunnel She was going to pay and leave with her little monsters She dug in her purse again and pulled out the coupons I stared at her baffled for a moment seeing that she understood that she couldnt use those coupons You forgot my coupons She smiled againIm sorry Maam but our coupon policy only limits one coupon per cust She cut me off againYeah I know Can we just split the transactions or something and I can pay it several times She started to wag the coupons impatiently No maam I cant do that all It wouldnt be fair to the oth To my absolute horror her eyes narrowed as if I shot her in the heart Her face went from a fake smile to a completely menacing bitch from the th level of hell I dont see why you even have coupons all the time if you cant use them at all What kidn of place is this I thought this place

didnt know what happened Like I was in a  car accident and wasnt able to cope with the situation that had occurred The next customer walked up and smiled Im so sorry that woman was so irate with you

ChestyPetite,21,22,1qq95t,87,I am a young girl and  I work at a self serve frozen yogurt joint Its a new locally owned business that sells some pretty delicious yogurt I have worked here for two months and sometimes there would be this kid that would come in who would never buy anything beg for samples and hang out from open to close and often sleep on our couch Our boss is totally okay with this for some reason and he leaves us girls alone for the most part so nobody complains  He is obviously homeless but not starving because he is overweight Early twenties So back track to Halloween The kid comes in and likes to do this thing where he will walk up behind a big group of people who I am handing sample cups to to seem less awkward when he begs I feel sorry for him today and decide to give him my shift meal under the condition that he never asks me for samples again Big mistake So he gets his yogurt and sits down right next to me at the cash register to eat I wanted to be friendly because I felt bad for the guy so I asked him some questions about his life and recommended that the could go to the library and study interesting things or read or something because he had a lot of time on his hands I mean this kid literally just sits and watches our shop tv from  am to  pm For some reason he starts to ask me questions and gets aggressive about it He asks me if I want to see his resume and angrily repeats WHY NOT when I say I am busy and I have no reason to Then he asks me if I want babies some day I tell him that that is not an appropriate question and I dont want to answer it This is all met with JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION I eventually said no and at this point Im just playing with my phone trying to stop this conversation What are you doing on your phone Are you texting Who are you texting JUST TELL ME I just say Im browsing and Im using all of my body language to show him that I dont want to talk anymore For now he leaves me alone but just stares at me until my shift is over and walks away when the next employee shows up My next shift is a few days later and of course he is there again Of course he asks for sample cups and of course he plays dumb when I remind him of our agreement I brush him off and ring up some customers so he recedes to sit at the front on the couch like he always does Heres where the fun starts I go to the back after a few hours of being behind the register to refill some raspberries When I get to the toppings bar I see that our homeless friend has sample cups in hand and is stealing yogurt I tell him that he cant do that and that he is stealing  Im not doing anything wrong everybody gets sample cups And looks at customers who are uncomfortable at this point for support You are here every day and you buy nothing begging for sample cups every time a shift ends and a new employee comes in You cant do that and you need to throw those away He just smiles at me and acts dumb No Im not doing anything wrong I get frustrated and text my boss who says its my fault because I left sample cups on the counter This makes me petty angry because thats where he keeps them when he works and not a single employee keeps them anywhere else My boss tells me to leave the dude alone Whatever The next day rolls around and Im back at work At this point Ive talked to some of the girls who work there about homeless dude and every single one has a story of him doing something strange like that in the last couple of days While Im chatting with my coworker M about the problems Ive had the dude walks into the store He tries to wave and I just shake my head at him He smiles and gets closer and waves again I just shake my head He then sits down at the closest seat to the register and continues to stare at me M excuses herself to use the restroom leaving me all alone with this guy He tries to talk to me and I look at him mid sentence and just shake my head At this point HE STARTS TO CRY  I ignore him and play with my phone so he purposely tries to cry LOUDER  I ignore him and tolerate his ridiculously creepy staring until my second coworker arrives and I beg her  to let me work back      At this point I text my boyfriend who gets angry and comes in to sit with me for the rest of my shift All is well at this point Boyfriend stared him down until he left his spot and went back to the couch to watch tv He leaves us alone for the most part but occasionally gets up to watch us though the reflection of the store front windows Closing time has rolled around and all customers have left I come out of the back after a day of mopping and dish washing to watch the register while my coworker uses the restroom Boyfriend is still sitting and doing his homework This is when I see homeless dude stand up from laying on the couch He begins to walk incredibly slowly over towards where I am standing After getting about  feet away he stops and stares at me At this point I am shaking I have no idea what he wants and I am incredibly uncomfortable with him I do not feel supported by my boss because I have been told that he is allowed to stay for as long as he wants I muster up all of my strength and in a monotone voice ask can I help you with anything He shakes his head no at me Unfortunately we have to close the shop He turns around and very slowly walks towards the door only leaving after staring at us for a minute I lock the door and call my boss in tears who tries to convince me nothing is wrong and that I can only ask him to leave if he is bothering customers It takes  minutes for him to give me

supersporky,8,6,1qq65t,18,Ugh I just wanted to kick this older guy in the face just now It seems that he always has some sort of problem with me and how the owner runs the store He wanted to special order a set of scrubs and has the tags of what he wants which is awesome and easier for me too I get the order set up and he is rushing to get the check written before I ring up the items I tell him the total and ask to see a valid form of ID because not only is it store policy to check and make sure the DL number is on there but also to get a phone number if we need to call them because of insert whatever reason there is The policy has been like this and is clearly posted on the desk along with a sign that says if you write us a bad check not only do you have to pay that amount but you also owe an additional  to cover the cost of the bounced check other stores may vary I let him know that I know it can be inconvenient and annoying but that it is store policy so could you please go and get it He does but when he comes back inside he wont take it out of his wallet and COVERS the address Which is on the check he just wrote He proceeds to ask me sarcastically if there are anymore hoops that he needs to jump through to make a purchase I stare at him right in the eyes asserting my dominance and tell him no He did not get a smile or a have a good night He doesnt deserve oneAfter he left I wrote down in the customer accounts notes that this gentleman refuses to show any form of identification and to call the owner and see what they want to do with his money Hopefully his check does not bounce and I wont have to deal with him againWhat would you have done,Another short rant about IDs,24,talesFromRetail
Locclo,9,17,1qq0j6,67,This happened a few months ago but wow I never thought Id meet a guy who could be so frightening without saying a word Let me preface this by saying that I live in a Minnesotan suburb so about  of everyone I meet is extremely niceI know its a wall of text you guys can deal with it Why are you here if not to read anywayBackground I work in the bakery department of a big retailer My duties mainly include packaging bread and stocking the floor and occasionally taking a cake order or handing one over to a customerOur story begins during one of my long shifts right around noon Im happily bagging bread when a customer walks up and asks to pick up a cake Sure I can grab that no problem I stop what Im doing head into the cooler to grab itAnd its not there No cakes Not a one My heart starts to sink but Im thinking to myself Okay not a big deal maybe the decorator just stuck it in the freezer Its not as uncommon as you might think we only had the one decorator at the time so sometimes she would make orders a few days in advance when she had a day off immediately before the pickup dateNope no cakes there either Or rather not the one this guys looking for The one he wants is covered in red and pink hearts this is nowhere near Valentines Day but whatever Im not going to question his choice I consult with one of my coworkers and we dig around for the original order but for some reason we only find one of our two copies and its the wrong oneAs a quick side note there are always three copies of a cake order One goes into a sort of organizer so that the decorator knows what needs to be made for what days one gets attached to the kit or design so we dont accidentally run out before making it and the third goes to the customerAnyways so we find the design order form but the one that goes in the organizer is nowhere to be found I glance at it for a moment then turn to ask my coworker for advice Apparently she turned into the Sidler from Seinfeld because shes nowhere to be found If my life was a sitcom Id be looking around confused while a laugh track started playingSo I take a deep breath put on my brave face and go out to the customer who by the way is a big burly guy with a neutral patient expression on his face and I explain the situation to him Or at least I start to because I get more and more nervous as Im looking at him Why Because throughout my whole explanation he is saying nothing while giving me thishttpwwwvisualphotoscomphotoxmanglaringatcameraportraitFAAjpg look He has cranked the death glare up to  and Im getting the full blast He wasnt even blinkingIm floundering here Im wringing my hands together scratching my neck and wondering if the scary Russian man is going to put a price on my head After what seems like an hour he finally says You have got to be kidding meAnd dont get me wrong here I didnt tell him that we didnt have it and he was screwed I told him that we couldnt find the cake we had to ask our decorator about it and she would be back within  minutes she was on break at the time Thankfully my department manager came around and I was able to pass this guy over to him There isnt much else to the story  the manager talked to the guy the decorator came back and he agreed to come back in a few hours to pick up the cake which he was getting at no charge because of our mistake What was interesting though was the person who came to pick it up later because it wasnt him it was his wife Why was that interesting Because his wife was the complete polar opposite to him I mean maybe I just caught the guy on a bad day or something entirely likely really but he was big burly and scary and his wife was cheery friendly and completely okay with us screwing up the order I mean she actually said the words its no big deal as long as we got a cake out of it Complete reverse of how her husband actedSo yeah That was the first and so far only customer Ive had that actually made me fear for my life and he didnt even say a wordTLDR If the mafia isnt hiring maybe they should beAddendum Thinking back on it thishttpimagesamcnetworkscomamctvcomwpcontentuploadsBBSBHankjpg is almost exactly what this guy looked like minus the police badge ,The first customer that actually scared me,84,talesFromRetail

Kellynn,8,14,1qpkpt,55,Oops this got real long I work at an awesome makeup store I just started so my job so far has consisted of watching a lot of training videos soaking up a ton of knowledge and Im just now getting onto the floor I was on the floor for probably an hour last shift ringing up transactions but last night was my first shift where I was on the floor for all of it I was told when I came in that my job was going to be to ring up most of the transactions that night to get me comfortable on register and shadow my coworkers when there werent customers to ring up as well as learning all the proper closing procedures So Im happily trailing after my coworkers learning my way around products and greeting customers while making sure to not accidentally blow up a register Enter The Cougar She will be known at TC from this point on She is being followed by a much younger man and I could not figure out if it was her son or sugar daddy but after the fifth time she asked for the credit card I think I got it She has her hair tightly pulled back her makeup caked on she is one botox treatment away from her face locking up for good and a brightly colored knitted jacket designed to make her look rich but only made her look kinda crazy My coworker goes to greet her with me trailing after Immediately TC is in a tizzy TC I bought some skin products here and I just really need to get them again but I dont remember what they were and UGH why cant I rememberMy coworker explains to her that we have the ability to pull up her purchase history so we can tell her exactly what she bought from us Its a nifty feature we have for customers who are rewards members with us because a lot of times a customer will come through looking for a product in a certain shade but they cant remember it Its a lot easier to look it up real fast instead of having to keep guessing at it and hope you get it right But TC is still losing her shit I just bought so many products and I just cant remember them and I got this one from this other brand and do you carry that brand I want that brandMy coworker explains that we do not have that brand but asks TC what it was she liked about it so we can suggest a product we do carry I DONT KNOW I JUST LIKED IT OKAY Alrighty then Were doing good We show her some of the products in the antiaging area because they seem to have similar properties to what shes looking for to which she starts bitching Im not fifty why the hell would I need anything from antiaging As if fifty is some magical turning point to being able to use antiaging productsSo we manage to establish one product she liked before we can get her over to the cash wrap and get her product history up She keeps telling us loudly about a product she swears she bought from a brand we do carry that had honey in it I can tell in my coworkers face that she thinks this womans nuts and says she doesnt believe that brand carries any product like that but lets get up the product history and see what it was I scan her card pull up her product info and give her her card back We look at her product history going through every single item back until the beginning of the fucking universe There is not a single product here with honey in it The one product she bought that she claimed was the honey one Its a greek yogurt based product We show her this product and she keeps asking if were sure this is what she bought really totally positive Because she swears it was a honey based product She continues to ask at least ten more times if were TOTALLY SURE Lady I am looking at everything you have ever purchased ever Im sure So we pull up our stores website on the computer look at the brand and she continues looking for this legendary honey product This brand has literally never sold this mythical product shes claiming exists My coworker finds her a few other products that will work and we think weve finally pleased this crazy cougar Oh no That would be too simpleHer younger gentleman partner left a while ago because he was  done with being in a makeup store as if being anywhere near product was a threat to his masculinity We get to checkout finally and she calls him and starts screeching into the phone about how he needs to come back NOW because hes got the credit card and needs to pay She hangs up leans in and whispers to me lets just not tell him how much all this cost okay Itll be our little secret Um And how do you propose I hide the total when hes the one paying So we ring her up and Im still keying in items when hes already furiously swiping his card over and over again bitching about how it isnt working I nearly gave myself a headache trying to contain my eye roll We get her her samples and her rewards perks which she spends another five minutes agonizing over and asking if were SURE its not a honey product and are these REALLY the only rewards we have available Finally get her total Boyfriend decides the total is too high TC declares to me well SOMEONE thinks this costs too much money so I guess were gonna need to take a cleanser off to make SOMEONE happy I finish her transaction Her items are bagged My coworker says I can take my break I think Im freeWHAT ABOUT MY BIRTHDAY GIFT So when we hit total it pops up all the rewards info We tell this to the customer and it has a little checklist of things were supposed to offer to the customer If birthday gift is applicable we give it to them Birthday gift did not pop up for The Cougar I tell my coworker that it didnt prompt for it so I didnt offer She asks TC when her birthday is Its early October Now you can get your birthday gift during you BIRTHDAY MONTH My birthdays in June you dont see me walking into work demanding my birthday gift right now After demanding her gift TC wanders off to look at something else and my coworker just mutters Oh whatever Im just gonna give it to her anyway it is not worth the hassle to say no We get her birthday gift all done Her items are bagged Shes leaving I can still hear her screeching to her boyfriend about the honey product all the way out I run for the exit for my break before she comes back to look for it again ,No I swear were not lying to you about your product history,69,talesFromRetail

food chain location for the breakfast rush This is a popular time to check things because its a prime time for customers So I get started on my order this time Im doing a drivethru one I place the order and the girl is actuallyquite rude Doesnt offer a combo size upgrade this is HUGE for these guys doesnt ask what drink I want doesnt even tell me what my order total is She just immediately tells me to pull up to the next window Oh this is a lovely start Theres like three cars ahead of me so I sit back to wait and it takes a surprisingly long timeabout ten minutes For a breakfast rush this is bad  As a baseline youre supposed to have something like  seconds per car I get to the window and they just yanked my card out of my hand another ding theyre supposed to greet you and tell you your total again and tell me to pull up to the curb ahead and theyll bring my food out when its readyThis is a huge nono because it screws with the times recorded for their drivethru Theyre failing miserably and they know it so they start to do this to try and fake good timesMy order arrives another five minutes later bringing this all up toabout  minutes For a breakfast sandwich and Im not terribly surprised to find out its made completely wrongI park write down on the form what transpired record my times and head inside with them and my sandwich You see for this particular one I have to get manager signatures to confirm that I did in fact go there As I went inside I immediately just hear thispiercing laugh The dining rooms almost empty not surprised most hit the drivethrus so they can get to work asap and theres employees chasing each other around They spot me and one of them does a leaping slide across the counter and then grins at meI held up the forms and the grin justfellHe called the manager on over who was holed up in the back and she scowled and muttered as she read over the form Oh really OH REALLY REALLY Oh look at this Someone woke up this morning with a stick up her SAY WHATI inform her to sign the form now as I need to get back and she does then literally chucks my copy back in my face Forget the sandwich Im leavingI stalked out the door seriously angry at what happened and honestly annoyed at the fact that Im going to have to rake them over the coals for this Which I did I was straightforward on my report didnt embellish and I still got a call back from my rep asking if I was telling the truth I assured her it was all true She was shocked but admitted that this location tended to not have the greatest reports This one though took the cakeFast forward a month Im asked to shop the location again but this time dinner rushI get things started as normal did another drivethru this time was in a rush hehe and they did a bit better this time Still forgot to offer the combo upgrade but the drivethru girl was quite polite told me the total etc I drove up to pay and hooooly cow IT WAS THE BREAKFAST MANAGER Theyd apparently switched her shifts on me GAH She immediately recognized me and started squalling ITS HER Turning around she grabbed a poor teenage boy working the drink machine and yelled You handle her I cant do this right now Aaaaand then she up and left I could hear her freaking out as she walked all the way into the backThe poor boy was obviously super confused as to what was going on so I tried to be as nice as possible The shop went pretty well all in all so I went on ahead and filled out the report and headed inside to get the managers signature I was praying very very fervently that maybe Breakfast Manager was just working that night maybe she wasnt the manager on dutyNoooopeIt took them five minutes to convince her to come up front and then she started cursing at me and saying Id gotten them all in deep trouble Do you know that you got two people FIRED How do you sleep at night Lady Im sorry thats not really my fauOh sure SURE it isnt Stupid shoppers they always pick a itch to do them Well here you go hope youre freaking happy with yourself You got us all in trouble and now theyre crawling up our  because of youAt this point every single one of the employees turns and looks at me with huge eyes One guy pipes up Thatsthe shopper Thats why the DM came downYeaaaaah time to scramMade my second report and again rep called to see if I was making things up Nope it went well except for that psychopath of a manager My rep was floored and informed me apologetically that since Id been recognized so easily I could never secret shop that location again Honestly I was relieved at that Well its been a long time sinceand unfortunately psycho manager still works there I had a friend go in to check a few months ago and yep shes there Does she still hold a grudge Ha Said friends order was made wrong and he made a joke about Well at least Im not a secret shopper Apparently the manager JUMPED at that and proceeded to regale him with her version of events about the itch who tried to get the place shut

storyteller,8,15,1qou5x,34,Background The summer after I graduated from high school I took my first real job at a Christmas themed amusement park I was the fill in girl so I worked two days in Santas House he had to have a helper with him at all times to avoid any possible lawsuits two days as the face painter and then one day in the shops On days not in face painting I also dressed up as Snow White and did the character actor thing while I worked because it was so much fun Moving onI was working this particular summer day in the Girls shop there were several shops for various themes and my manager was a tremendous hag All of the managers were older women who never had real jobs and just derped around this park their whole lives feeling entitled because they had control over teenagers This woman well call her Etta complained constantly and while I was experienced in working the other shops each is different and she never really trained me for working this shopEventually Etta decided it was time to push off for lunch and leave me alone in the shop Of course this is the perfect time for awful tourists to come in This woman walks in with her little girl and starts looking around She soon finds some of the watches we have at the counter little plastic and rubber junk things meant for kids with all kinds of colors and crap on them and they are expensive like  a pop for this little junk watch BUT on the other side of the counter there is a tub which used to hold some kind of candy and now holds the overflow of the watches which dont fit on the display The tub they are in is labeled with a price sticker the says  So the lady turns to me and asks what the difference is between the expensive watches on the display and the seemingly identical but cheap watches in the tub I have no freaking clue and they do look the same because they are so she starts taking watches out choosing one for herself and apparently all the members of her family to give as souvenirs Shes got a handful of watches and the shit soon hit the fanEnter Etta She immediately sends me onto the floor of the tiny shop to stock and clean while she rings up our high rollin watch pimp Unfortunately the watches were  each and came to over  so the woman had a fit and starts screaming about mislabeling and how the watches shouldnt be that expensive but Etta tells her the watches in the tub were mislabeled and the real price is  Lady starts demanding that they be given to her for the cheaper price because thats false advertising and that I had told her the watches were  not true She wants the discount and blah blah blahLady eventually voids the whole transaction puts all of the merch back and storms out Nothing was ever said again and I swiftly moved the watches in the tub TLDR Lady wants lifetime supply of watches pissed off when they arent priced for a dollar store and demands discount for false advertising,Watches Ill take ten,49,talesFromRetail

auApex,22,28,1qnot0,129,This will be fairly long as it involves several incidents that happened over a few months  Quite a few years ago now I was working the night shift pmam at a  hour bakery to save money for an overseas trip  I had some of the most bizarre experience of my life while working in this place  Some of this might sound made up but I swear it is  trueThe first story involves a night shift manager  I worked with a crew of about five guys who were all really cool  The manager was a bit different from us but seemed OK  He was very Christian and constantly received praise from the owners for being responsible and a setting a good example  All was well until about five weeks into my stint  The manager started disappearing for short  minute breaks several times a shift  This didnt really phase us because it was generally quiet during the night shift and his absence allowed us to play up a bit by putting on good music and sampling a few of the delicacies on offer  However unbeknownst to us the owners were checking in from time to time on the video surveillance and noticed the managers absences  It turned out this guys sole destination during these breaks was the bathroom  The owners kept watching him and discovered that he was taking a certain kind of adult magazine with him every visit  So this guy was jacking off in the bathroom three to four times every shift  I didnt really have a problem with that but the owners did and he was firedThat was nothing compared to what happened next  A few weeks later the owners husband and wife team called us in during the day for a meeting  During this meeting they informed us that large amounts of money were going missing during the night shift and they suspected that one of us was stealing  Obviously this was a big concern and created a lot of distrust among our otherwise close team as no one knew who was taking the money  The real story behind the disappearing cash only came out because we all got together and called our union rep because we were threatened with dismissal and a police investigation   Did I mention the wife was a raging alcoholic and also a gambling addict  It turned out what was happening was the wife would get black out drunk at the bar across from the bakery come into the shop and collect the nights takings  She would then go to the local casino and gamble away everything  The husband claimed she was so drunk she didnt remember which is why she was so adamant one of us was stealing  This came out when the union rep told the owners he would initiate some sort of protective proceedings if they didnt give him footage from the security cameras so he could prove none of the staff was stealingThe final part is more tragic than funny  Obviously the situation with the drinking and gambling didnt do wonders for the owners marriage  Over the next couple of weeks we were witness to several latenight fights between the two at the bakery and got wind that the husband had left his wife and moved out of their house  Because we knew about the gambling incident and were witness to these fights the husband called us in for a meeting where he explained that his wife was mentally ill and going through a breakdownOne evening at the beginning of my shift the wife brought in her two young kids for a hot chocolate  It looked like they had been on an allday shopping spree as the kids had bags and bags full of new toys and clothes   Two evenings later the husband came in for yet another meeting  He was visibly shaken and very upset  He told us that his house had burnt down the night before and his wife was inside when it happened  She didnt survive  We didnt ever find out for sure but it was pretty clear she had taken her kids out for one last special day before taking her life and burning down her house  A very sad situation all around  At this point Id had enough and quit my job there  While looking for work a couple of weeks later I got a call from one of my former colleagues who told me to meet them for a drink as there was something they wanted to discuss  When I sat down the union rep we had talked to about the theft situation was also there  Apparently while looking into the place he discovered the enterprise agreement the owners made us sign so they could pay us normal wages during the night shift instead of overtime was invalid  As a result the business owed us standard wages as outlined in our relevant industry award  This ended up being thousands of dollars each because there was a clause that said we were entitled to  extra every hour worked past midnight and even more during Saturday and Sunday  We eventually settled with the owner for a payout of around half what was owed but it was still a large sum and gave me enough to immediately buy my plane ticket and go overseas  All up it was a crazy six months or so and not really worth the stress for a low paying retail job  It sounds stranger than fiction but everything Ive described above happened  This was the last retail job I ever worked as I took an office job when I got back from travelling  Thanks for reading  edit Shit just realised I missed one very important detail During this ordeal the husband was banging the day shift manager who was a long time family friend and the wife found out This was the main subject of several of the fights and us knowing about the affair was the reason he called us in for a special meeting after the fire Knew I left something out of my post It was seriously like living in the middle of a daytime telemovie

heaven where the party and the insanity climax at midnight on the th of July and New Years EveSTORY  In Florida we get our fair share of rain especially in the summer During light showers its business as usual but when the wind and the rain really pick up we batten down the hatches We lower the sides of the tent and use plastic to cover any shelving or product that may be getting dripped onOne afternoon we got the typical fast moving heavy thunderstorm with wind rain and lightning It really came up on us fast and we had a load of people in the tent shopping at the time I grabbed all of my help and we went crazy trying to get all of the sides down and boxes off of the floor before stuff was ruinedWe managed to get everything down and covered before we had gotten much damage We did however get totally soaked while all of this was going on my cashier was still ringing out customers and new customers were running through the rain and lightning to get INTO the tent No offense but in a lighting storm I dont even want to be in a tent in a parking lotOf course thats about the time we lost power It was early afternoon so we didnt really need lights inside of the tent and I actually have my registers on small uninterruptible power supplies UPS so they dont cut out every time the power fails My cashier is still churning and burning trying to get people out of the door About  minutes later the power still hasnt come back on its still pouring outside and the UPSs give up the ghost and run out of juiceNot a problem I was a boy scout and I have a backup plan for my backup plan My parents RV has a generator so I can switch over my critical power to that if I need to It does require us to reroute some power cords and stuff like that so I cant just flip a switch and make it happen but its doableMy dad and I brave the rain and wind to start getting stuff ready for the switch While Im out in the storm one of my employees comes out to tell me that they need me in the tentAt my counter screaming at my cashier is uber bitch UB Shes pissed off that my cashier has refused to ring up her purchase just because the registers are dead My cashier was nicely trying to explain to her that the power should be on shortly and they would ring her up as soon as possible but UB didnt want to hear about itThis particular cashier had worked for me for five years or so at this point and her father is one of my best friends Shed actually graduated high school and was home from college on summer break working for me I always joke with her that shes the boss and Im just there to do her biddingMy cashier is keeping her cool but I felt bad for her so I stepped in to try and defuse the situation UB demands to check out NOW because she has somewhere that she needs to be and I need to take care of itIm soaked to the bone and I just want to get this bitch out of my tent so I pull out my phone and ring up her purchase on that She actually had a pretty big purchase and when I told her the total she didnt believe it She wanted to see my phone to verify She then went down the list of stuff at least  items and questioned each price When she was doing this she actually found a mistake I had made I had entered in an item as  when it should have been  The only reason I knew this is that she was making me verify the price item by item as she called them out from my phoneYou should have seen the look on her face when it dawned on her that the only mistake she found was where I had UNDERCHARGED her I grabbed my phone back and happily told her I would fix the price for her and then gave her the new HIGHER total I should mention that the entire time theres a crowd of people around watching the scene and a couple of them started to openly laugh when this happenedWhen I told her the new total she lost her GD mind She started screaming at me that it was my fault and that she shouldnt have to pay for my mistake In fact she should get a discount for having to wait so long I let her yell for a good two or three minutes just standing there expressionlessIm tired Im soaked to the bone and my dad is outside in the rain trying to get the power switched over by himself because of this bitch I called to one of my employees and told him to put her stuff back on the shelf then I turned to uber bitch and told her Youre going to need to go somewhere else because youre not allowed to shop here anymoreI turned to my cashier in front of the customer and told her Dont sell that bitch anythingShe left screaming obscenities and threats the entire way out and into the rainONE YEAR LATERThe same cashier grabs me from the floor and points out a customer shopping in the tent Its the same uber Bitch lady that I had thrown out the year before and shes shopping with three or four other people To be honest even after seeing the lady I didnt place her face If my cashier wouldnt have recognized her Id have never noticed she was thereCASHIER What would you like me to doME Its up to you Youre the bossThe lady and her party finished shopping and got in line at the counter to checkout When UB got to the register my petite  year old female cashier stood her gound looked her dead in the eye and told her Im sorry you may have forgotten but youre not allowed to shop hereStone Cold BabyThe lady actually walked out of the tent without saying a word I think she was embarrassed because she was with a group In the end one of the people in the group paid for the stuff and they walked out confused as hell If youve seen any of my staff photos

applecrumble,52,15,1qk89v,58,For those of you who dont know mystery shopping or secret shopping is when a company hires an outsider to go to a particular branch of their store on a specific date to pretend to be a customer and scope out whether the correct stockpromotions are in place employees are upselling as required and that customer service is at the standard expectedUsually the shopper will get paid a set fee or if they need to make a purchase to evaluate customer service they will get reimbursed for the costs and get to keep the item or a combination of both Its pretty fun to do you get paid and sometimes you get to score awesome free stuff I have about  worth of free stuff from this gained over the past year from a doughnut to a pair of expensive sneakersSo one time I had accepted an assignment at a store that sold nothing but expensive but really cute Tshirts For this job there was no set fee but Id be reimbursed up to  So I did the job it was easy I got a cool Tshirt out of it I submitted my assignment with a scan of my receipt to prove that I spent  on that specific day at that specific storeI got an email back from the mystery shopping website saying that I had completed the assignment on the wrong day and thus wouldnt be getting paid After some back and forth emailing it turned out that they had the wrong date on the site which they corrected But they still maintained that I could not be paid for doing the assignment on a different day to the one they wanted Now I have enough money to pay upfront for this stuff and not starve while Im waiting for reimbursement  but Im not rich enough that it doesnt hurt to see  gone on a Tshirt I never would have bought unless it were free I rarely spend that much on a single TshirtMy only alternative would be to go back to the store on the correct day return my item and buy another item and evaluate customer service again But I somehow had to do this without the return showing up on the purchase receipt and I had to pay for it in cashcard not store creditSo the day rolled around and I made the mistake of coming to the counter and saying to the guy behind it I want to return this Tshirt it wasnt in the correct sizeGuy pleasantly Oh well Im sure we can find the correct size for you and then well exchange the itemsMe Uhoh No could you process the return for this one please And then Ill pick out another oneGuy still pleasant Itll actually be a lot easier to process it as an exchange and get you  store credit to spend on another TshirtMe think think But Im not sure if Ill buy anythingGuy endlessly patient Well how about you have a look around and if you dont see anything you like well process the return and if you do we can exchange the twoMe panicking now pretty sure I had a crazy look in my eyes by now No Id really prefer for you to process the return nowGuy smile gone OK lets see your receiptthen followed a LOOOOOONG process in which he entered the receipt number verified my purchase asked for ID got me to recite my address from the ID put that and my name and phone number into the system etc This lengthy process must have been to prevent employees from processing nonexistent returns and keeping the cash By the end I could see why he hadnt wanted to do it when there was a simpler alternativeAnd after I put the poor guy through this I then had to ask him inane questions about the Tshirt designs materials etc to assess his product knowledge So here I was having forced him to do a lengthy and unnecessary return because I wasnt sure if I wanted to buy anything only to turn around and ask him specific questions as if I was very interested in the brand and the productsThen of course I selected another  Tshirt and brought it up to the counter for him to ring upNow he was very professional but I could tell he was inwardly frustratedraging He smiled tightly and said See I told you it would have been easier to just exchange theseI apologised grabbed my receipt and ran out of there Im sure I will form one of his crazy unreasonable customer stories and I have been too embarrassed to set foot in that store againAny of you recognised that you had a mystery shopper in store Any funny storiesinteresting experiences And what if any were the repercussions ie if they gave you a bad report was there extra training getting written up or God forbid getting fired etc,Any of you come across mystery shoppers before OR The Time That I Was the Nightmare Customer,73,talesFromRetail
yessircapntightpants,69,104,1qk546,592,I used to work for a video store which is this thing that used to exist that was kinda like Netflix except a Netflix you could walk inside  I was a Shift Leader one step below assistant manager and was working with my coworker whom well call Dave on a very busy Friday night  Dave was the sweetest most mildmannered person I ever met  Chipper and mellow and genuinely happy to be doing his menial thankless job  Friday nights at the video store were always a chaotic mess from about pm to pm  Huge lines of people wanting movies for their weekend viewing pleasure and a very limited number of cash registers and employees to ring them up The store I worked at had a fantastic Store Manager and as a result incredibly low turnover Everyone there knew what they were doing and we moved the crowds out fast provided no customer insisted on being difficult and taking up a register for ten minutes while they tried to figure out what phone number or name they put their account under or something like that So one particularly crazy Friday Dave and I are working the registers up front doing our usual hustle to get through the hordes of movierenters when in walks The Horrible Bitch THB from here on out  She had the sort of tan that one can only achieve by laying around and barking orders at the pool boy all day every day  Her bleach blonde hair was teased to nearJersey Shore levels and her acidwash skinny capris screamed I regret becoming an adult and am actively attempting to revert to my teenage years despite clearly pushing   The dead yet somehow angry look in her eyes was both haunting and repulsive  She had three boys with her ranging in age from roughly four to nineyearsold and she gave the impression that motherhood was the worst decision she ever madeShe didnt bother us while picking out movies and while she was curt and generally shitty to Dave while he rang her up she wasnt an exceptionally bad customer Dave was his usual sweet self and managed to get her rentals in order while she alternated between rolling her eyes at him making heavy sighing noises before answering questions and screaming at her kids to PUTTHATCANDYBACKRIGHTNOW  If you work retail you know that these sorts of customers barely phase you  Sure theyre unpleasant but if theyre not actively yelling at you and causing a scene you just kinda assume they had a bad day and try not to make it any worse  Dave handed her the movies she rented and wished her a pleasant evening as she left and then went back to ring up the next customer in the incredibly huge line Less than thirty seconds later THB angrily storms back in clearly looking for something  Dave sees her and asks if she forgot something and she snaps that she left her keys on the counter  Dave checks the counter and also the space behind his register and around the cashwrap but doesnt see any keys While still ringing up other customers he asks me and the other people working that night if any of us have seen a set of keys  No one has  A couple of helpful generally nice people waiting in line even hear this and do us a solid by looking around the front area since we cant really come around when theres a huge line of customers  No one sees any keys Dave is trying to helpful but he has other less horrible customers who need his attention so THB winds up storming around the cashwrap area searching for her keys amongst the display cases that line the registers This wouldnt be a problem except that shes searching by pulling all the product down from its neatly organized POP space and just leaving it in piles on the floor or the counter Were busy and shes clearly ready to explode so we dont even try to stop her  We both know itll be easier to just clean up her mess than it would be to try and reason with her  After tearing our cashwrap displays apart she starts loudly accusing us of hiding her keys out of spite  Maybe shes seen Clerks and maybe shes fully aware that shes an unpleasant bitch to the Plebians that ring up her purchases but shes become absolutely certain that we threw her keys in the trash She demands that we dig through the trash RIGHTTHISSECOND and give her back her keys We explain that we havent seen her keys and we certainly didnt throw them away Dave even takes a moment away from his register to show her the small trash bin we keep up front which is almost empty and clearly doesnt contain any keys THB is not satisfied  She wants us to check the big outdoor trash can by the door  Despite the fact that her truck is parked right in front of the store and that no one could have thrown her keys away in that can without her seeing them she is insistent that we drop everything and go pick through the garbage Honestly if it were a slow time and there werent any other customers waiting one of us probably would have thrown on some gloves and just done it Years of retail make you highly likely to do something you know is stupid because its always easier than trying to convince a customer that their request is in fact stupid  Its Friday night though and theres no way were closing a register to placate her obvious personality disorder She storms out again and Dave looks out the window a minute later and informs me that she has dumped out our outside garbage right in the middle of the sidewalk and is forcing her children to dig through it  Nothing like adding a little childlabor to your harassment of innocent retail clerks to really take things up a notch  He mentions that shes probably going to leave that mess there and hes not wrong  THB gets a cab or a ride home from someone so the next time we look outside shes gone leaving only a pile of video store garbage and her shiny new truck in her wake Later that night after close were doing our standard restocking and straightening of the concessions out front when Dave yells for me  I look up and hes pulling a set of keys out one of the candy bins  The same candy bin that THBs child had been digging through before she started screaming at him like a volatile harpee Now I dont know if said child just happened to drop the keys and forget or if it was purposeful revenge for the screaming or if he realized that hed dropped them but was too terrified of his psychotic mother to speak up but either way her keys had been there the whole time  Without a word Dave took the keys and walked out to the parking lot where THBs shiny new red truck was still stranded  Because Dave was such a nice guy I assumed he was going to toss them in the back and maybe throw a note on the windshield or something  Instead I watched him hold the keys in his hand and slowly gouge a scratch from the back of the tailgate to the front headlight and then throw those keys in the same trashcan that THB has upended during her rage  He walked back in saw me staring and said Bitch made me pick up garbage Fuck her and her keys And with that he quietly resumed his closing dutiestldr You forgot your keys,The woman who pushed my mild mannered coworker to commit vandalism,696,talesFromRetail
NotOnFile,15,12,1qk1mr,48,Okay so Im about to explode Im just ranting sorry for this word vomit Shes just getting the best of me I have the worst partner everIm a manager at a grocery store and at nights we have two managers I normally do the paperwork and the otherX is supposed to work the floor I always do paperwork bc she never stays on top of it Basically she takes two hours after the store closes and it takes me only fifteen minutes For some reason beyond me I often feel bad about the way I feel towards her Like I cant stand her being a manager bc I didnt like her to begin with Then she does me this huge favor to remind me how much she sucksShe just became a manager in July and it took her two months to train Two Months Anyways my old partnerwho was a great worker got another job so that means I need a new nighttime partner This means I get X Mind you she has had two months to train so I expect her to know as much as I doI had one week to trainduring holidays Day  So Im doing my paperwork in the office and up comes X who just plops down next to me letting out this dull sigh Theres nothing to dooo Now she was a cashier on my shift before she became a manager and knows this is NOT what you tell me Plus I cannot stand when Im working and you want to sit there and watch me work No there is always something to do and if you disagree I will happily find you something to do which is exactly what I did for her She learned quick to stop saying theres nothing to doAfter a couple days So shes learned to not come in the office while Im working She has started avoiding me at this point This one night I was ahead on my paperwork so I decide to fill my time with productivity I go check to make sure the necessities are being stocked by our bagger Nothing has been done I am a huge douche bag to those who think they are above doing grunt work Dont want to do it Get off my shift GO AWAY So I find them Im pissed They notice Im pissed They take the hint and start working the hardest theyve ever workedAbout a week afteryou would think shed learned by now As a manager you do not get formal breaks here Its short shifts anyways hour shifts Everyone else gets a ten minute break every two hours When there are two of us we can take turns going to the back to eat once everyone else is back from their breaks So everyone comes back from their breaks and Im helping a customer so I just tell X to go ahead and go eat bc its the beginning of the month and were about to get slammed As predicted they all come rushing in at once and everyone including me is on a register Wheres X I cant worry about that right now I have a line of customers and there are two people at the courtesy boothmanagers only are allowed to go in the booth I call her up to deal with the booth and go about my customers By the time we finish the rushabout five minutes the customers at the booth still arent serviced so I go fix them up Ten minutes pass and still no X and we get another rush This goes on for about forty more minutes with me constantly calling her bc I have no time to go on a wild goose chase Finally we slow down and I am pissed Not once did she come up when she was called Im behind on paperwork customers are still coming in packs and packs and theres no  X I go all around the store looking for her giving her the benefit of the doubt that she is in the warehouse where she cant hear the intercom My last spot to look is the break room and there she is with her feet propped on the table her music blaring playing on her phone I give her one deadly stare as she takes her feet down and turns her phone off acting like she wasnt on itno phones allowed Me You done with your vacationX Yea girl what you gotShe follows me into the office and once we are alone I go off I have a short fuse and this girl knows how to light it Youre supposed to be setting an example for your fellow employees as a manager and you want to screw everyone over by getting paid to sit there and play on your phone while we are working our asses off Are you kidding me If I see you in the back one more time any day of the week where you are supposed to be elsewhere Im clocking you out and Im tearing your card up Im done with having a shit partner who wants to sit there and cry when she gets a raise but when it comes to physically showing them how thankful you are for everything they do for you its the end of the world Hell no If you dont want to work then g t f O This catches her off guard She runs off and doesnt stop working until I turn the lights off I found out the next day I had made her cryThe next day went okay Shes slow but she worked I told her I dont like being a bitch but I cant stand people who dont work There are plenty other people out there who will work their ass off if they were in her position She says its okay and we have a good dayBeginning of last week She takes another long breakminutes I warn her if she doesnt start doing something Im gonna pull her card She finally comes out and starts looking busy That doesnt fly with me but I just told her to hustle She needs to step up her game This doesnt do much help but I do not want to explode againAll of our bosses know whats going on so theres no one else to report it to Im so tired of babysitting this chick Holidays start next week and if she doesnt step it up Im going to Abomb her ass

herehttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentslmxvthecustomermetamorphosistheory herehttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsivmcanigetadiscount and herehttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsbcziwantitnow Today I thought Id share the story of why I stopped answering the phone at work warning very longNow its November at the bookstore and things are pretty much dead Weve sent all of our books back to the publishers and cleared out the store so theres not much to do except tell the lazy procrastinators no we dont have that book yes Im sure why did you wait until November to buy your book So when the phone rang I was eager to have something to do Boy was I wrong about that University bookstore this is Gneiss speaking how may I help youHi I was wondering if you could pull up receipts for my daughters purchases since  WHAT No I cant do that I explain that for us to find it she would need the exact date and time for each purchase Not that we would even be able to pull up a transaction from three years ago anyway But then a thought occurs to meDid you maybe order them online I ask She says that yes she ordered everything online Ah thats a different story and doable But just because I can do it doesnt mean I should Why does she need receipts from  semestersI ask her why and she explains that her crazy exhusband refuses to pay for her daughters textbooks unless she can prove that she only spent money on books and not sweatshirts or other merchandiseOh Uh okay I guess that kinda makes sense in a way Ignoring the obvious questions like Why is your husband paying NOW  years later and He really wouldnt pay if your daughter did buy any logo merchandise I decide to send her the emailsI pull up her daughters book orders and tell her that they only go back to Fall  She asks why and I dont know but I guess that we either changed systems at that point or it just doesnt store the orders for more than a few years I mean how often would you need to pull up orders from that long ago Shes unhappy with that but we proceed She asks if I can cc her on the emails Nope I can only send them to her daughters email that the order was placed under and I tell her the email address to confirm that its correct Now that the orders have been fulfilled I cant change any of the information I do tell her that she can have her daughter forward her the emails though and she agrees to that As I start sending email after email I inform her that one of her purchases has the status of CancelledWhy she inquiresProbably because you cancelled the order I respond  emails and  minutes later were finally done She thanks me and thats thatOr is it Apparently not as it turns out A few hours pass and I hop on the front register as it gets somewhat busy Just as I get off the manager calls me over Gneiss phone for youPhone for ME Thats weird I pick it up Its Her Hey Gneiss you helped me out earlier I just had a couple of questions One my daughter didnt get all of the emails Whats going on I pull up her orders again and I immediately see the problem Your daughter changed her email the first few orders went to her old email I did say that the emails were going to that email Oh Cant you change the emailSigh No maam as I explained earlier we cannot change the email address You should have your daughter check her old email and see if its thereOk Well can you send them again SIGH Sure why not Its not like I have anything better to doOh and my other question Are you SURE that you cant pull up anything earlier than  I explain to her that yes Im sure Here come the dreaded words Can you check with your manager to make sure Ugh I put her on hold and go over to the assistant manager who usually deals with web orders I explain the situation and he thinks the entire thing is absurd but he agrees to check the womans order He asks for name and I tell herHis eyes widen HER and suddenly memories come flooding back to me The woman that kept me on the phone for an hour last semester asking me to go over the price of every book her daughter had rented The woman who calls once every couple of weeks with some kind of crisis

SeaBones,9,16,1qh76g,28,Ive done my time slaving in the mall most of us have Its times like this during that calm before the explosion of the postThanksgiving holidays that we sit back and reflect on the mall as an entity that serves human kind with tons of bullshit to waste money on Its there to wander around as we examine the contrived realities that corporate stores have created A chance to walk in and out of separate sustained little environments offering up soaps and teas and shoes and sausage logs Keurigs and linen sets Handbags and jewelry We employees walk bleary eyed to our daily grind practically hovering in slow motion through rivers of human flesh slurping pumpkin fraps and dragging built bears by the leg like prisoners taken in warAll of this is set up and carefully placed in window displays and store designs to offer you the chance to finally start living your life to the fullest it possibly can be Teas to awaken your spirit clothing to flatter candles to enliven your senses gifts to open up on Christmas morning and gawk at in awe as your family shares a moment to revel in your apparent moneyspending brilliance So I ask myself what more can this contrived corporate fantasyland possibly do to bring people in Ive witnessed the evolution of the mall from indoor wasteland of records and grungy teenagers to outdoor meccashttplbpostcomimagesbusinessthepikeoutletjpg that successfully lead a family through a day of parades and outdoor shopping glee to nighttime restaurants and movies A full experience where the most money can possibly be spent These outdoor malls have concerts childrens games and events at day and bustling restaurants become clubs and popular bars at night Its a complete package Its not just something to show up at and leave its something to stay at To live inCould a person live in the mall Could a person become a fixture in this dystopia Could a person open their window to advertisements of new body washes for the holidays and listen to drunken nights out at night Can a person do this in the comfort of suburbia The answer is apparently yes and its already happeninghttpwwwbelmarcoloradocom As I searched for apartments I came across a new trend thats now being incorporated with outdoor shopping and theater centers Cut and paste luxury middle class condos and moderately priced apartments right there in the comfort of a mall environment and conveniently located right in your suburban area They pop up seemingly overnight It isnt the result of apartments and Chinese restaurants coming and going over time its a premade specifically designed shopping and living dystopiaSo theyve done it the bastards A completely pluggedin hip new standard of living that provides a mass goods store entrance mere feet from your front door and a corporate candle store visible from your morning breakfast table Not only will residents never escape this mall lifestyle theyre permanently incorporated in it so that customers are literally forced to walk by stores on a daily basis Is this happening in your area Are you yourself now a mallelement How far will we go to give in to corporate stores forcing their way into our lifestyles  ,Let the Malls Take Over an Observation,44,talesFromRetail

FredFltStn,120,228,1qgzk5,781,BACKGROUND I own and operate my own retail store Its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before Its  square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax at midnight on the th of July and New Years EveSTORY  Im very picky about the fireworks I carry and I make sure I choose only the best and most reliable products for my tent To back it up I also offer a NoDud Guarantee Basically if it doesnt work bring it back and Ill refund your money or give you something better What I really need is a Its not a dud youre just an idiot guarantee Mortars are one of my favorite types of fireworks Basically you place the provided tube on a flat level surface you load the ball or canister shell into the tube you light the fuse you run like hell The fuse lights an ignition charge which sends the shell up into the air The fuse then lights the shell charge which explodes with different effects or colors Mortar shells have to be loaded into the tube with the lift charge on the bottom Most of the mortar shells I sell have TOP and BOTTOM stickers on the shell The mortar shells themselves are manufactured so that if they are put into the tube upside down the fuse wont be long enough to stick out of the tube The instructions on how to load and light the mortars are included with every box of mortars I sell Its often printed on the box AND on paper instructions inside the box   Sounds pretty simple rightHere are a few of my favorite Its a Dud returns for mortars so far Its defective   The guy lit the mortars first and then dropped them into the tube  He missed the tube and the mortar exploded on the ground That made it defectiveThey didnt fly up into the air before they exploded    It turns out he was lighting the shells in the middle of the street with no tubeIm too drunk to light these    Now heres a guy you can be proud of He actually realizes that hes too loaded to light these safely so he wants to exchange them for something else I happily exchanged the mortars for some finale cakes which are much easier to use My pride was short lived after I watched him climb into his car to drive away after we made the exchangeIm afraid that Im going to hit a plane   We asked Hes nowhere near an airport He just thought that they flew so high they might accidentally hit a plane if one flew byTheyre blowing up in the tube    Ok this rarely happens but it can His pack had come with two tubes and both were destroyed when he tried to fire off a mortar I assumed the shells had gotten wet While I was swapping out his package of mortars for a new one he also complained that the fuses werent long enough and that hed had to stick his lighter into the tube to light the damn fuse When I showed him how that could only happen if he put the shell in upside down he got mad at me and told me off Sadly the upside down shell thing happens so often that we now keep a collection of exploded tubes on the counterThey blew my tube apart   The guy decided he wanted a better show so he had actually loaded three shells into the tube at once and lit themThese things are dangerous It scares me every time I light one   Once again a guy was lighting the mortars first and then dropping the lit mortar into the tube He fired off a few and then returned the rest because he thought it was too dangerous When I showed him the instructions printed on the box he yelled at me because How the hell am I supposed to read that in the darkMaybe they should watch fireworks on TV next yearIf youre interested Ive posted a few other stories herehttpwwwredditcomuserFredFltStnsubmitted,Please feel free to ignore the safety instructions Tales From a Fireworks Tent,1009,talesFromRetail

Gotten,4,17,1qg8c6,87,I dont really have a Big story to tell so Ill just post a few of the smaller ones here and try to make it look half way readableTo start out I work in a convenience store gas station Its small and basically built to be easy to get in and out with what you want For those of you who havent had the pleasure Ill give a small synopsis of my job My official title is Customer Service Representative CSR for short which basically means I do everything There is no one person for different jobs We are the cashiers cleaners stock personnel and as the title suggests we assist customers as best we can Another thing of note is that managers arent in day round My assistant leaves around pm every day where as the manager is in from am  pm When the manager isnt present I am in charge of the store and its my responsibility to handle all situations short of emergencies by myself All of this information plays a key role in my stories The Drunken LadyIts not too uncommon for someone who is inebriated to stumble through my door Most of the time its to hit the head or grab some sort of food item to help them absorb that last bit of alcohol lingering in their stomach before they black out But this lady was a bit different She came in followed closely by the stench of alcohol Obviously extremely intoxicated waited in line until she got to the front and asked for a pack of cigarettes I ring them up and place them on top of our printer seated neatly beside the register behind the counter and ask her how she was going to pay She said debit which I knew was going to be a problem as it usually was with people who are intoxicated and I pressed the corresponding button and asked her to wait for the strip to light up before swiping her cardIntoxicated LadyIL Swipes card way too early Why is it asking me to swipe my card I already didMe You have to wait for the blue lights before you swipeILshoots me a dirty look and swipes her card again continues to enter her pin and then stares blankly at meMe I notice that my side is still asking for her PIN a common occurrence when you put in the wrong PIN Maam you need to reenter your PIN numberIL enters her PIN still not taking it continues to enter it  more timesOur machines are built that if you enter your PIN incorrectly  times it cuts you off and puts a stop on your card as a theft deterrent So it gives me that messageMe Maam youve entered your PIN incorrectly too many times my machine wont take itIL Ok where are my cigarettesMe Your card was denied it didnt go throughIL Stares daggers at me Ill send my friend in you need to learn not to be so rude to customers The Impatient AssholeThis one literally happened  days ago as most people who work in my line of work Ive pretty much developed a tough skin towards any berating or asshole inclined customers Instead of getting upset I have learned the boundaries Im allowed to work within when dealing with them As I said before CSRs are the jack of all trades when it comes to the job As I was cleaning up working a solo shift I emptied the trashcans next to the soda fountain unbeknownst to me someone had taken the liberty of tossing a half full drink into the trash and it lead to the area behind the register being covered in sticky goop I mopped as best I could between customers If youve ever mopped then you know that once a mop has been used to clean up such a big mess the mop head is completely useless In stead of cleaning it will just spread the mess and dirt all over So I tossed it cleared out my customers and went into the back store room Literally  feet from the register area to make a new mop bucket I had just poured the detergent in and started the water when I hear a customer calling out Not abnormal even though its  feet away when the water is running its impossible to hear anything else So I turn the water off and walk back out It should be noted the time I walked in to the back room and the time I walked out wasnt even a  second time span So the customer had only been waiting maybe  seconds at mostImpatient AssholeIA Finally I could have walked out of here with these beers by the time you came back out hereMe OkIA So it would have been Ok if I had walked out with them thenMe Well thats called shopliftingIA Well I should have just left instead of waiting for your fucking ass to come out hereMe places beer behind the register Out the doorIA WhoMe You You can walk out the door right nowIA Well fine then Ill just take my business to the next store thenMe Ok DipshitI would come up with a better title for this one but in all honesty its the only way to really describe someone of this caliber In the  years Ive been working retail Ive yet to have this story topped by anyone Ive encountered Selling age restricted items comes with the routine of checking IDs We even have a stupid bright yellow button that says We ID Under  that we have to wear on our uniforms Working early morning my manager had come in and was waiting for the safe to open so he could count the deposit for the bank Dipshit walks in I had seen him before maybe once or twice but not enough to remember if I had carded him for cigarettes as he was easily under  Dipshit Dipshit I need a pack of Me grabs them and rings them up placing the pack on top of the receipt machine as always And I just need to see your IDDipshit Seriously Youve seen me beforeMe I need an ID to make a saleDipshit Seriously If you dont sell me the cigarettes Im going to call the copsMe Uhh go aheadDipshit AlrightSo he leaves the store and my manager had overheard everything He calls the cops and just to make sure you know the cops love me I give them free coffee and fountain drinks and on top of that they all know Im cleaner than HoneyBooBoos moms plate and when Officer McAwesome shows up he just looks at me My manager tells him what happened and even pulls up the video for him He used the anonymous tip line and told the cops I was selling pills and snorting them on the counter He currently has an arrest warrant out for misuse of civil help lines and diverting police forces because he was stupid enough to come back and give my boss his IDThats all I got for now have a few more stored up if there is an interest for it Hope you guys enjoyed the read,Collection Of Small Stories,104,talesFromRetail

breezy,11,28,1qfs9m,117,Remembered another story from my patriotic teen clothing store days This was during the summer when everyone was out shopping and enjoying the nice weather My store was part of an outdoor mall which in the midwest is the dumbest idea ever but clearly nobody asks me my opinion on real estate Now we had  fitting rooms and one room that was handicap accessible at the end of a long narrow hallway which was a stupid design for anyone with a stroller or wheelchair trying to navigate that way On a normal day we wouldnt use the big room unless someone was handicapped or had small children with them because it was further away and people tended to make a bigger mess there for some reason On busy days though we would put people in the big room as soon as it emptied never saving it specifically I was working fitting rooms during one of these busy days and all of our fitting rooms were full when a woman came up to me pushing her childaged daughter with a clear disability Im thinking cerebral palsy but Im not an expert in a wheelchair Woman shall henceforth be known as Ridiculously Entitled or RE RE Im so sorry to bother but my daughter has had an accident and I need to change her really quick Could we use a dressing roomNow normally you can only use a dressing room to try clothes on but in this particular outdoor mall the bathrooms are quite a ways away and the woman looked desperate So I told her she could use the next open fitting room and she settled in to wait About two minutes later someone came out of a regular room and after I cleared the clothes out I gestured to the woman that she could change her daughter in there It would be a tight fit but these rooms were still large enough to bring in a stroller and fit a bench and try clothes on Me Here maam you can use this one RE Thats too small I need the handicapped room Me If youd like to wait for the handicapped room thats fine but a mom and daughter went in there right before you came up so theyll probably be a while It might be faster just to walk down to the restrooms RE Thats ridiculous I need that room you need to ask them to move to the smaller room Me Im not going to try and move them and all their items to a different room if you would like to use the larger room youll have to wait for it RE I cant believe youre discriminating against my family like this this is illegal and I can sue this company for you refusing to serve us Me Maam Im doing you a favor The fitting rooms are for shoppers only so if youre not willing to use the open room or wait for the big one Im going to have to ask you to leave She threatened to call and have my job and sue and etc etc I told my manager what happened at end of shift but never had any followup so I can only assume the lady realized that refusing to kick actual customers out of the fitting rooms wasnt infringing upon her civil rights ,Maam Im doing you a favor,145,talesFromRetail

Betelgeuse,69,113,1qekfj,558,So I used to work at a Retail store that for the purposes of this story we shall call Paper Clips  This story will take some minor setup just to describe how the store is set up  We have one main desk that is at the front of the store and works like a customer servicecheckoutTech Support combo pack  To the right of the Front Desk is a oneway enter door that only opens to people entering the store  To the left side of the desk is the actual door that allows you to exit the store  Right in front of the service desk is our selection of tablets which as you can imagine is quite popular with they young kids and sort of allows the adults to shop in peace as their kids play gamesOn this particular day a Mom comes in with her  kidswell say the oldest was about  and the youngest  and starts shopping  The oldest of course immediately goes to the tablets and starts playing games oblivious to the rest of the world  The mother starts to finish her shopping and warns the kids to stop playing games and get ready to leave  The  year old boy of course ignores her completely absorbed in a game of Angry Birds or whatever he was playing  As I am checking this lady out her two youngest get ready to leave with their mom and abandon their games like good kids  She gives the oldest two more warnings by the time I finish up her order but he keeps playing and shrugs her offThis is where her Epic Parenting kicks in  She looks at me says thank you for ringing me up takes one last direct look at her oldest kid still playing the game frowns and and then leaves the store  I look at the oldest kid for a minute and watch her load up her bags and kids into the car  At this point I get worried cause I really dont want her to leave the kid behind too much paperwork  So I turn to the kid and say Hey kid  Your mom is leaving you behindNow then at the same time he turns around looks for his Mom she is actually slowly driving away in her car essentially looking like she is leaving him behind but not really  Kid goes into FULL PANIC mode and runs the wrong way to our door that only opens for incoming customers and realizing it isnt opening starts trying to pry it open with his bare hands like he is about to be killed by zombies or something  Kid also starts yelling for his mom and is almost in tears I am too but its because I am laughing so hard  Now our doors arent really heavy but for a  year old it would probably be like trying to pry open a steel trap  The mom meanwhile is slowly driving away along the front of our store  Im in tears laughing so hard and was about to help the kid but my Manager got there first and managed to flip the reset switch at the top of the door which made it open for the kid  The mother sees this happen and stops the car to let her kid catch up and jump in  I catch her gigantic smile as she drives off probably knowing he will never do something like that again  My manager looks at me confused as hell wondering what was going on and I tell him she was going old school parenting on him which gets a nod and smile from him as he goes back to the officeTldr Kid plays games and doesnt listen to mother and gets fake left behind to teach him a lesson  laughs were hadedit this is my first post ever,Epic Parenting,671,talesFromRetail

IronyJudge,30,25,1qe3i9,84,This is going to be very long Sorry but damn was it an interesting dayI cant really speak for all of retail but theres a very certain way corporate animal based stores work We have very separate realms for animals were taking care of in the store and products we sell Weve got the fixtures and setup for the animals we have in back and then the tanks which we have the animals up for sale in Nowhere in this process is things we have on the floor for sale to customers Separate SKUs separate ordering even separate managers who take care of themIt was a relatively normal Saturday Saturdays are easily our busiest day and were well staffed We had recently brought on three new people who were on the floor mostly in the Ill help you find it capacity All three were working this day and had taken a liking to me since I was roughly their age and in their eyes know what Im talking about Beyond them it was the manager who has a functional but not specialized knowledge of animal care and the cashier who refuses to be anything but a cashierI go on lunch Eat my sandwich Play around on my phone Delightful I go to the coffee shop across the street and talk to the people at the Farmers Market for a while Everything was great No grumpy customers so far during the day No technical glitches All peachyAs Im walking up to punch back in from lunch one of the new girls comes up to me and goes Weve got an issueIm expecting a dead mouse or something which is a very low key affair After I punch in the manager tells me to talk to another one of the new people who saw the events transpire I find her and she wordlessly brings me over to the main desk in the animal part of the store Theres a cart with an opened bag of cat food in it Inside the bag of cat food which had a different food inside it than the bag actually was strangely were two extremely large turtles Somebody had decided the best way to get rid of the turtles was to abandon them in the store without telling anybodyI feel Ive gained a reputation on this page for stories about turtles This reputation has to include the fact that turtles are very cost intensive animals They need massive tanks massive heaters massive filters massive places to sit and bask under their massive basking lamp A pet turtle is not a cheap endeavor and will easily set you back  to  dollars Do not get a pet turtle unless youre into really cool animals you cant snuggle I love feeding the ones we have in the store but beyond that you cant really pet them and play games Keep in mind we cant exactly pull all of the necessary equipment off the shelf We easily possess this equipment but considering Im apparently in charge of this operation Id get my ass reamed for doing so No matter how necessary you cant take  off the shelves then do it twiceTwo full grown turtles sitting in a small bucket situated in a bag of cat food which has been opened and replaced with a different brand of cat food By this point I wasnt even trying to hide the fact Im a foul mouthed cynic With customers perfectly within earshot I was giving my true thoughts on the situation After I was done swearing I sat in the office spinning around in the chair trying to come up with a planWe cant put them in with the turtles we have on the floor because theyre nearly three times the size and come from god knows where with god knows what pathogens We have to set them up independently  Get all of the biggest tanks we have for our overstock animals and repurpose them to house turtles This required taking the largest tanks we had currently in use setting up new smaller tanks for the overstock hamsters hamsters are assholes and are onepertank eating a lot of room and then cleaning out the big tanks to within an inch of their life  Set up these tanks half the size of a real setup for turtles This went by with many problems as one tank full of water  pounds of water per gallon times  gallons wound up on the floor Requiring extensive cleanup to get all the shards of glass off the ground as well as  gallons of water Down one large tank we had to get another one and evict the poor hamster from it  Place turtles in tank This meant we had to get a tank set up for them the best we could We had the lights ready to go in storeuse but had to grab filters off the shelf Taking things off the shelf and putting them to store use is one of the most annoying redtape filled things you can do The MOD at the time had to call up the GM at home to get approval for it It was fun listening to the Yosemite Sam cursing on the other end of the line We got approval for two twenty gallon filters  Have one of the new people sift through the bag and find a third full grown turtle buried in the cat foodWait  Mother FuckerWere out of tanks at this point We cant just take a  item off the shelf to repurpose for store use As much as it pained me to do it I took the two smaller of the turtles and housed them together We then took some of the hideyholes for the guinea pigs and converted them into basking spots inside the tank weighed down by bags of aquarium gravel One of the turtles decided to shred one of the bags and pour gravel all over the place but that is relatively unimportant to the saga Then we encountered the astoundingly foreseeable problem that we didnt have enough outlets in our back room We needed  outlets for this operation and there were  This required me to leave the store drive to the nearest hardware store and purchase a power strip for as cheaply as possible Im still a little afraid that the  power strip I got will at some point burn down the entire strip mall Why we didnt have a power strip available for the task Ive yet to get a good answer onWe finally got the turtles set up in back With  people working on the job it took us  hours when all was said and done Then somebody asked the question on everybodys minds What nowTurtles are the slowest selling animal in the store Theyre not too expensive themselves but the  birds go faster Three full grown turtles each requiring a  setup are absolutely impossible to move no matter how you look at it We called around the specialty stores in the area which all flatly refused to take them most likely for space reasons themselves and I bear no hostility towards them So were left with three very large very resource intensive turtles in our back room which have no hope of going out the doorOne further problem we ran into was the filter cartridges I wound up coming in every other day despite working or not and replacing the carbon in the filters with carbon I extracted from the spare filters for our aquariums and then rinsing out the cartridge itself Id head into the store on the way home from school It was a pretty routine thing for a whileThis went on for a month and a half Meanwhile the MOD the day the turtles came in was also working to get rid of them for the time span This went far up the chain of command to the VP in charge of the  state region After hearing how big our turtles were a commercial breeder  miles away agreed to take them in We didnt care at this point if we got any money out of them We just wanted them gone The three turtles are now living out their days at a nice farm in bayou countryIf you go into a store that sells these turtles theres a small but real chance that they may be descendants of these three,Another Turtle Story,109,talesFromRetail

flyingcupclub,16,10,1qcs41,37,I worked on this big clothing retail store they have stores all over the world and I recall how obsessed the assistant manager and sales associates were about shoplifting They were always suspicious of customers It was very contradicting their actions they either were brown nosing customers asking if they needed any help etc or they would be watching certain customers very closelySince we did not have security the SAs were in charge of rushing to the door whenever the sensors beeped Even when people just got inside the store if it beeped they would be requested to show their bagsOnce there was a customer wearing one of our tops which was from a recent collection This SA went crazy on the store following the poor woman and announcing on the radio that she stole a top I told her I SAW the woman entering the store wearing that very top yet she kept following herThis same SA would drop all of her go backs on tables when the sensors beeped It was so embarrassing for all the involved  the SA and the customers being harassed by her The other customers just watched amused at her dropping everything on every beepingThey also would sell clothes that were ripped stained with missing buttons or broken zippers during the sale season Actually they would sell clothes like this even when they were full priceI recall a customer calling and complaining that she just noticed when she got home the same day she made the purchase that the top she bought had I hole I no doubt it might be true I have seen so mane garments with small holes that if you dont inspect very well it might pass unnoticeable When I went to ask the assistant mgr if it was ok to let the customer make the exchange she said Oh how convenient Mind you this manager was a complete bitch who would tell you to cater and brown nose the hell out of customers but when was time for the post purchase  a very important step to retain customers shes dismissive and arrogant towards them I also recall many times when the cashiers forgot to take the sensors off the clothes after and then it would beep on the door The customer were forced to go back to the register and have their bags checked and show their receipt so the cashier can make sure that whatever has the sensor on  which was HSHER responsibility to make sure to take off wasnt in fact somehow stolen and thrown in along with the legit purchases I noticed that most customers dont have the guts to actually complain about itThe mentality in this retail store it is that customers are actually trying to deceive and trick them at all times and that you have to always watch them Does anyone have similar experienceAfter this terrible experience with retail along with other issues I would never work in retail againI just want to make clear that retail does have some very difficult customers and that there are some shoplifting happening but I believe he approach by this specific company is plain wrong,Clothing store obsessed with shoplifting Does it happen where you work too,47,talesFromRetail

MysticSpiral,78,69,1qchcl,310,Excuse any typos Im on my phoneAs Ive stated before I work in a fairly well known and popular womens clothing storeSurprisingly I actually DO love my job and one of the reasons I do is because I get to help women feel pretty and put a smile on their faces This can take work As women we each have our hang ups big arms big calves a belly roll a chunky butt etc I get a chance to show women how to dress to flatter themselves and show them that no matter what we are each beautiful in our own ways I actually take that really seriouslyI grew up with eating disorders and low self esteem due to being chubby I starved myself and made myself throw up more than I like to admit to I also survived an incredibly emotionally and a couple time physically abusive relationship To make a long story short my appearance was something that he got on me a lot about Ive finally come to love myself my body and who I am  Flaws and allBut I actually lost my cool on a customer once Back before I was promoted and transferred to a new store my primary job was selling I have the gift of gab if you will and I can sell anything to anybody So I was left to my own devices with customers quite often Enter Skinny and her mom Skinny needs shorts but as a woman over forty she wants boyfriend shorts think Bermuda shorts We have a few in that style soi pick her out some colors and tops and accessories because yeah Im a salesperson Heres where the trouble starts Skinny went up a size She was a size  and is now a size  Remember she is over forty She looks great and is not unattractive I assure her that she is not fat that lots of women would kill to be that size and her mom jumps in on the positive bandwagon as wellSkinnny keeps complaining Of course I wonder if she may have an eating disorder I do my best to comfort and assure her I style her put together outfits and compliment her Not just to sell either I genuinely want people to have the confidence that I worked so hard for It doesnt work All skinny sees is that  instead of a She says she is too fat about once a minute Now I start to get annoyed Ladies and gentleman I am not a small girl Im attractive proportionate and dress well but Im NOT tiny So on my  trip with her to the sales floor to puck out more shorts she starts complaining again She calls herself fat and how she cant believe she put on so much weightI lost my cool I looked Skinny dead in the eye and said If you think a size ZERO is fat then what must I look like to you at a size sixteenShe went very quiet You are gorgeous and you look great do you want some shorts or notShe didnt speak much the rest of the time but she bought the shorts and more and she stopped complaining about being fat I was probably too harsh I felt bad that I lost my cool but in the end I think she may have realized that her complaining about being fat to someone who IS in the overweight spectrum was Not in good tasteEdit please dont take this and turn it into a skinny v fat debate in the comments That is not at all what this is about I firmly believe that there is something beautiful about each person and that you can be beautiful at any size      If you carry yourself with confidence and self respect nothing can stop you and no one can bring you down ,If a Size Zero is Fat  ,379,talesFromRetail

FredFltStn,226,333,1q9jql,740,BACKGROUND I own and operate my own retail store Its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before Its  square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax at midnight on the th of July and New Years EveSTORY  Most of my employees are teenagers and have real jobs during the rest of the year just like me Even so they jump at the chance to work for me since I pay better feed them give them free fireworks and always try to make my store funLast th of July I had a couple of new guys helping out during setup One of the news guys dropped a beam while setting up some rack shelving and it almost hit his foot He turned to one of the teenagers Colby and joked that he would need workers compColby has worked for me for several years now Without looking up or stopping his work Colby perfectly explained our workers comp policy just as it had been explained to him years beforeCraig doesnt have workers comp If you get seriously hurt we have to kill you and hide the bodyThis location has gone  DAYS since our last accidentTLDR  Workers compensation is a form of insurance providing wage replacement and medical benefits to employees injured in the course of employment in exchange for mandatory relinquishment of the employees right to sue his or her employer for the tort of negligence The tradeoff between assured limited coverage and lack of recourse outside the worker compensation system is known as the compensation bargainWhile plans differ among jurisdictions provision can be made for weekly payments in place of wages functioning in this case as a form of disability insurance compensation for economic loss past and future reimbursement or payment of medical and like expenses functioning in this case as a form of health insurance and benefits payable to the dependents of workers killed during employment functioning in this case as a form of life insuranceGeneral damages for pain and suffering and punitive damages for employer negligence are generally not available in workers compensation plans and negligence is generally not an issue in the case These laws were first enacted in Europe and Oceania with the United States following shortly thereafterStatutory compensation law provides advantages to employees and employers A schedule is drawn out to state the amount and forms of compensation to which an employee is entitled if heshe has sustained the stipulated kinds of injuries Employers can buy insurance against such occurrences However the specific form of the statutory compensation scheme may provide detriments Statutes often award a set amount based on the types of injury These payments are based on the ability of the worker to find employment in a partial capacity a worker who has lost an arm can still find work as a proportion of a fully able person This does not account for the difficulty in finding work suiting disability When employers are required to put injured staff on lightduties the employer may simply state that no light duty work exists and sack the worker as unable to fulfill specified duties When new forms of workplace injury are discovered for instance stress repetitive strain injury silicosis the law often lags behind actual injury and offers no suitable compensation forcing the employer and employee back to the courts although in commonlaw jurisdictions these are usually oneoff instances Finally caps on the value of disabilities may not reflect the total cost of providing for a disabled worker The government may legislate the value of total spinal incapacity at far below the amount required to keep a worker in reasonable living conditions for the remainder of his lifeA related issue is that the same physical loss can have a markedly different impact on the earning capacity of individuals in different professions For instance the loss of a finger could modestly reduce a bankers professional facilities but ruin a pianistIn  Georgia and Alabama passed Employer Liability Acts  other states passed similar acts between  and  These acts simply permitted injured employees to sue the employer and then prove a negligent act or omission A similar scheme was set forth in Britains  ActAfter Germanys  Act workers compensation laws began to be reformed to reduce the need for litigation and to mitigate the requirement that injured workers prove their injuries were their employers fault For example The  British Act replaced the  ActIn the United States the first statewide workers compensation law was passed in Maryland in  and the first law covering federal employees was passed in  By  all states had enacted some kind of workers compensation regime Such schemes were originally known as workmans compensation but today most jurisdictions have adopted the term workers compensation as a genderneutral alternativeAt the turn of the th century workers compensation laws were voluntary for a couple of reasons Specifically an elective law made passage easier and many felt that compulsory workers compensation laws would violate the th amendment due process clause of the US Constitution Since workers compensation mandated benefits without regard to fault or negligence many felt that compulsory participation would deprive the employer of property without due process The issue of due process was resolved by the United States Supreme Court in  when in New York Central Railway Co v White it was held that an employers constitutional rights werent affected After the ruling most states enacted new compulsory workers compensation lawsIn the United States most employees who are injured on the job have an absolute right to medical care for any injury and in many cases monetary payments to compensate for resulting temporary or permanent disabilities Most employers are required to subscribe to insurance for workers compensation and an employer who does not may have financial penalties imposed If youve actually been crazy enough to read through all of this text you should seriously consider seeking some type of professional help The entire TLDR was meant as a joke and the short

follow my instructions Please add a comment to this story that starts with Candygram for Mongo Feel free to say whatever else youd like in the comment since you seen to have some free time Of course the first five have long come and gone if youre reading this now but what the hellTexas employers have the unique ability to opt out of a the Workers Compensation system under the original state law written in  However those employers known as nonsubscribers are exposed to potential liability in the event of an employee injury Though the employee must prove that the employer was negligent in causing his or her injuries the employer loses its common law defenses of contributory negligence assumption of the risk and the fellow employee doctrine If successful the employee can recover his or her full common law damages which are far more generous than workers compensation benefits Yeah this story is about that Thanks WikipediaIf youre interested Ive posted a few other stories

NotableNobody,70,55,1q6n77,278,I worked for two years at a chain videorental and entertainment store It was my first real retail job and offered a lot of customer service experience that I was lacking For the first year or so my manager was a fun loud woman named Rose While she was unpopular with some customers for her unapologetic forward nature in dealing with service issues she remains one of my favorite bosses to this very dayOn this day I witnessed a play in three parts Here is the story of the Job ApplicantIn our relatively small city our store was very attractive to highschool kids looking for a job Every day Rose received between five and twenty phone calls from students checking up on job applications or asking to see if we were hiring It was kind of annoying but usually wed just tell them theyd get a call back if we wanted an interview These were often kids whod been drilled by their parents to call over and over again to show incentive speak to the manager etc and they were very persistentOne morning coming in to work I stopped by the coffee shop to grab a little pickmeup As the barista was making my coffee the phone rang and she answered That early in the morning we were instructed by Rose to give applicant calls the usual spiel rather than forward the phone call to her The barista is right in the middle of saying Rose will give you a call back if we accept your application in the meantime it is active within our system for the next  days and when suddenly the other line erupts with screaming The girl on the other end actually shrieked so loud that for a moment I thought one of the espresso machines had broken  the line cut out and then picked up again on the caller demanding to be forwarded to the manager The barista made a face held the phone a foot away from her ear and said I WILL FORWARD YOU TO ROSE PLEASE HOLD before holding the call and dropping the receiverOh my god she muttered What a crazy asshole She finished making my coffee before paging the office As I left I heard her say Hey Rose The caller on line one is asking for you About a job Yeah yeah I know just wait Youre in for a treatI made my way back to the employee room to change When I got in to the office to check my schedule I caught the very end of Rosie slamming the phone back onto the hook She was wildeyed when she looked back at me and said Who the FUCK did she think she wasWhat she told me Ill relay here After the barista told her how shed been threatened and screamed at by the girl on the other end of the phone Rose took the call When she began talking to her the girl was very sweetI just wanted you to know I love your store and it would be an honor to be a part of your team she oozed Rose asked what her name was and offered to review her application right away The girl offered her name and sounded excitedOkay said Rose I just deleted your application To the sound of sputtering festering rage she scolded You do not get to treat my employees the way you just did and expect special treatment from me Were a team here and you just demonstrated to me that youre incapable of treating another human being with respect Im marking your application and blacklisting your name and as long as Im manager here you will never be employed with meThe girl screamed Wordlessly Rose told me that the line cut out again and when I walked in she hung up without another wordI took my till out to the register and as I prepared for another busy day of cashiering the phone rang Without even thinking about what had just happened I answered with the customary company greeting A girl with a sulky voice respondedHello Uh Id like to speak to your managerNow realized who I was probably speaking to Okay I said Ill forward you to Rose right away I waited a beat and sure enough she saidUh No Id like to speak to Roses managerRose is the store manager I told her There is no person currently present with more power in the company If you have a customer service issue we have two counter managers present todayNo uh Look how about you just send my call to your corporate managerI almost laughed out loud Our CEO is down in Texas and more often than not hes traveling abroad fishing The District Manager while more accessible isnt just a phonetransfer away I had no idea if he was even working that day I explained this to the girl I also at this point had absolutely no incentive to provide her with that information  shed harassed two employees within the store within five minutes of our openingYeah except see I just had a Uh A really emotional experience with Rose And Id rather not talk to her So you should probably just send me to your corporate managerI just told you thats physically impossible I said The highestup person I can send you to is Rose herselfI think youre lying said the girl In fact Im pretty sure you are So uh whats your name Because Im going to get you fired tooBrilliant My names Kendra SPOILERS My name isnt KendraWell Kendra when I get a hold of your managerWhich one I said This was too good an opportunity to pass up Your CORPORATE managerOh well good luck with that I saidHey the girl yelled I DONT HAVE TO PUT UP WI hung up We never heard back from her or any evidence that she ever called our headquarters More likely than not if she ever did someone with a lot more power and gumption than I had made a few more minutes of fun out of hertldr Dont scream at the people you want to hire you It probably wont pan out in your favor and youll probably wind up a story on Reddit,Scream Louder Get

slandeh,21,30,1q5w5v,122,As stated before Ive done a lot of returns and had a lot of arguments with customers and some still take the cake as the dumbest things Ive had to do in my career Ive become seasoned enough to enjoy arguing with customers I had a particularly upset guy try to tell me point blank he didnt care how much fraud he could be committing he just wanted cash for his purchaseA man comes in with a tool kit well call him Tool he purchased from us the name brand is store specific so its not possible to buy from somewhere else and tells me that it didnt work for the job he was trying to accomplish So I ask for a receipt to begin with policy is first that a receipt must be available or can be looked up in order to issue a proper refund if no receipt is available a manager can approve of a return but it would be issued on gift card and only for lowest amount the item sold for within the last  days of purchase depending on item The man states he mustve thrown it away and didnt have it No problem we start to look it up int he systemI first ask him for his phone number since its the easiest to look up type it in and look for the item not found No problem lets try another phone number still no luck Im starting to believe he may have bought it long after the return policy but ask how he paid for it He says by cash which eliminates being able to look it up by his credit card I tell the guy that because I cant find his receipt I cant issue a refund He complains that he knows he bought it from here since the brand isnt anywhere else I explain that its not necessarily where he bought it but when he bought it The return period is pretty specific He wants to talk to someone else so I get him my ASMMy ASM is a little too busy to come deal with a return and agrees to just do the refund without a receipt Alright fair enough I turn to the guy after hanging up with my ASM and tell him that my manager approved for me to go ahead and do a return without receipt As I start processing it I inform him that per policy I can do it but I would have to issue him a gift card and it would be at the lowest selling point the item has been at since within the return period This is the breaking point for ToolTool Are you fucking stupid I said I wanted my cash back for that item I wont take a gift card You know why Because I cant use the gift card anywhere else and I have to go somewhere else to get the fucking set I need to do my job I wont take a gift cardMe Well I cant override the system since we are already doing an override and giving you a return without a receipt anyway At least I can give you  back for the itemTool Youre joking me right I paid  for that and I want  back and in cash I want to talk to someone elseSo I pick up the phone and call back my ASM who says hell be right down When ASM shows up I begin helping a different customer but overhear the whole conversation which started with my ASM going through the same routine I just finished looking up the receipt While he is going through that I notice that Tool is trying to pretend like I didnt look up his wifes number which I did and while he is explaining that I must be stupid for not asking it I interrupt and point out that I looked up two numbers which neither were explained who they belonged to so I had no idea I was looking up his wifes number Tool gives me a dirty look and tries to explain that I wasnt saying what I was doing during the whole transaction so how was he supposed to know what I was getting phone numbers for even though I ASKED for them and stated I needed them to find the receiptAfter my ASM finally clarifies that Ive already attempted to look up the item he tells the guy that he cant do anything more than return the item for a gift card at the value Ive already given him So Tool asks if he can show my ASM something and walks him down the aisle where the item is located I assumed it was because he didnt want me interjecting more comments to make him look bad When he comes back it seems my ASM has convinced him to somehow accept the gift card So he runs the transaction and finally gets his gift card On his way out Tool crumples the receipt and throws it on the floor All my manager had to say was Thats how he lost his first receipt for me to be unable to move for a whole two minutes because I was laughing so hardOnce I got over myself I finished the transaction with my next customer and they told me I cant believe how much of a jackass that guy is Im sorry you had to deal with that,The Return Policy is pretty clear,152,talesFromRetail

Kellynn,12,8,1q5igw,75,I worked in your friendly neighborhood fabric and crafts store and gave my notice last week Last night I was working my second overnight in a row The first was supposed to be  PM   AM and then my manager proceeded to keep us until  and try and keep us later because guys theres still stuff to do come onnnnn as she disappeared the entire night and left us to do all the work Last night was my second overnight We asked to leave at one which resulted in my manager pouting death glaring us down and refusing to speak to us the rest of the night But that is not the purpose of this storyFuck overstock Fuck it so hard My best friend and I both worked at the store and both planned to leave After last night we both decided it was our last shift there no exceptions Imagine this Somewhat medium sized store but its very crowded Lots of narrow aisles overstock is on top of the shelves as well as on special shelves along the walls But these shelves are all very shallow so theres a questionable amount of room Sounds crowded already right Now fill the aisles with boxes stacked as tall as you physically can Welcome to my hellSo the first night we were stocking seasonal Glitter everywhere I took my shirt off when I got home and an honest to god cloud of glitter exploded out There are stacks of huge boxes for all the overstock and we add to these as we stock and find that things dont fit There are probably five hundred overstocked candles giant boxes on both sides of the aisles filled with crafts boxes and cards and gifts Every aisle has maybe a third of it available to travel through if that When we left at  AM my manager whined that shed get someone else to help her move the overstock When my best friend and I came in at  PM the next night none of the overstock had been movedStep one Clear enough of the stock room to actually be able to move in the overstock because our stock room is shockingly also piled up to the ceiling with no room to move My manager explains what we hah I mean you two will be doing We load a flatbed of foam and fiber take it from the stock roomand we cant get the cart down the aisles We literally cannot move it more than a foot from the stock room because the overstock boxes are filling the aisles It takes us nearly fifteen minutes to get from one end of the store to the other because were shoving giant boxes out of the way as we goFinally get to the foam which has two rooms of overstock of its own We stock the three or four things we actually can then have probably four huge boxes of overstock that needs to go in the foam overstock We throw open the first doorFloor to ceiling full of overstockOpen the second door Take a guess what that one looked likeMy blood pressure is quickly rising By the end of the night of desperately trying to get through shelves while being berated by my manager about how were not doing enough despite the fact that shes been sitting on her ass the entire night while were working like crazy we were both out of patience I started just shoving overstock out of the way with as much force as I could to avoid screaming in frustration Everything I try and stock is overstock There is no room for the overstock My life has become an overstock nightmare The funny part My manager continues to yell about how we need to have clearance down every single aisle because WHAT IF A CUSTOMER WITH A WHEELCHAIR COMES THROUGH My best friend responds by stopping down an aisle that you have to literally turn sideways to get down to get past the boxes stops looks at my manager and just gestures to the lack of space before walking off We had no words for the stupid anymore,There is a special place in hell for overstocked overstock,83,talesFromRetail

IronyJudge,61,135,1q54dq,565,Back before I was the stores knowitall guy I was a lowly cashier I took pretty quickly to dealing with our archaic system and found out many of the systems rather unfortunate quirks The system will block you out if youre at a certain screen If you hit the wrong button at a particular time itll discard data and make angry noises One of the more unfortunate problems is how there is a screen of no return Once you reach it it is impossible to go back no matter how much you tryI was still pretty new so I was in the panicked Theyre going to fire me for doing something wrong state Any time a customer made a complaint Id shit myself in fear until one fateful night Ive previously stated my store occasionally serves people who inhabit the most notorious snob

food ask her for her rewards card information announce the price total She swipes her credit card willingly then I hit the button that brings you to the screen of no return Its the screen to sign for

system better than me apparentlyMe Once the receipt prints out Ill be able to tell you If you could just sign really quick and if its wrong well be able to fix it  PRL NO  Heres where I make the fatal mistake I reach over to the credit pad and hit the cancel button This has the effect of immediately timeouting the machine and popping out both the receipt and a little paper slip for the customer to

unsure if the sale price ran  PRL There was a coupon on the front of the bag he didnt ring it up I refused to sign for the purchase then he signed my name This is fraud This is legally fraudI had no

cancel out the transaction and I will personally ring it up and make sure the coupon gets inThe customer behind PRL pipes up and says to me You did nothing wrong This lady is just crazy That made me happy and PRL just kept on with any possible insult towards me she could AGM finally finishes the transaction with the coupon applied PRL signs then walks out the doorI go back to ringing the nice lady who called PRL crazy The customer behind her also gave words of consolation The other cashier now a manager told me that was one of the worst shes seenThen AGM comes up behind me gets on the PA

apology PRL You high school punk I want you to apologize for committing fraudI will admit I look about  years younger than I am Its reasonable for her to think Im in high school by appearances but at that time I was cracking open LSAT study books I also decided to whip out my bigboy vocabularyMe I do most solemnly apologize for any transgressions If you could kindly enumerate every one of them so I may appropriately respond to my failureshttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvmmIyrloampnoredirect  PRL rants on for two minutes without realizing just how much my apology was dripping with sarcasm I tune her out

deltora,56,37,1q3vxg,110,EDIT wow sorry this is so long i didnt realize until i saw it posted   okay until a few months ago i worked at one of the two large retail pet supply storesi dont know if i should say which one id worked there about  months at the time of the incidentscene it was late i was one of three people closing that night i was the cashier my coworker was in aquatics small animals and my manager was counting the days money its about an hour till we close i can seriously feel my heart beating in my chest while i type this just thinking about it   also i need to preface this tale with something to truly appreciate this story you need to read it how she said it so not to offend anyone but everything this woman said is in a heavy angry ghetto accent anything you said to her was a personal attack to plainly describe her she was a short round and evil black woman  the writer of this story does in no way mean to imply that all short round or black women are evil or that all evil women are any of those other things this woman just happened to be all of them   now read on true believers   act  the beginning of the end   she enters my register is right by the door and its my job to greet people as they come in so i say hi welcome to  do you have any questions she says a short no and wonders off no big deal thats my usual then a little but later she comes back and says yes well maybe you can try to help me i need a cat dripper mine broke and i need a new one now i dont know if any of you work in a pet supply store but a cat dripper is not a thing so i say hmm a cat dripper do you mean a refilling water bowl or a water fountain type water bowl sign no a CAT DRIPPER you know what it is it drips out water when they lick it oh like a rodent water bottle show me those then so i walk over a little ways to small animalslooking back i really should have just paged the animal guy and then killed myself so id never have to talk to her again and showed her the bottles well these are too small and they have pictures of rats on the package i wanted one for a CAT CAT CAT well they dont make these for cats are you sure you bought yours here i havent bought it anywhere yet you cant seem to find it no i said i mean the one you have at home the one that broke i never said that a friend told me about these and she said you might have them at this point some other customers were making their way to my checkout so i excused myself with well ill leave you the think about your options or something like that and checked them outact  part  the transaction  after i finished with those customers she got in my line with just a small fish net for an aquarium kind of strange and hopefully not a cat dipper but whatever then i made the slight mistake of asking on retail reflex did you find everything you were looking for i could just beat myself over the head sometimes i swear and she said no YOU couldnt find what i was looking for ill come back another day and maybe then youll learn where things are by then are you new now i didnt intend to make her any angrier so i just said yeah im one of the newer ones here which is kind of true theyd only hired  new people after me oh i thought so was her delightful reply  act  the transaction part  things go from bad to awful  the next thing in my list of automated retail questions is are you a  member she says she is and proceeds to get out her purse and start digging into it shes looking and looking and looking and right as im about to ask if she wants me to look it up by her phone number she says she found it its in a card slot that is built for maybe  cards and she has like  or  jammed in there so shes fighting with it and fighting with it and im not saying jack because i dont really want to interact with her anymore as she finally gets it out with an uhg i ruined my new nails she glares at me as if waiting for an apology an apology she was never going to getshe holds out the card and i scan it i bet this wasnt even on sale was it i check it looks like its not today nouh oh well why didnt you tell me that before she continues to glare doesnt the computer say if something is on sale and shes right it usually does but that day was our big takedowntheoldsalesandputupthenewones day and our computers sometimes take a bit to catch up so something thats sticker says its onsale might not really be or vice versa and i told her as such using as few words as possible i do not mean i was short with her through this whole story i was very polite to a point beyond reason or sanity because by this point a line had formed behind her so she huffs and pays of course with all small coins i ask if she would like it in a bag and shes just putting all her things back in her purse completely ignoring me and when shes finally done she says well put it in the bag already so i put it in a small bag because its small and hand it to her and she walks down toward the end of my line  and youd think that would be it right end of transaction she leaves and i must be over reacting wellact  she doesnt leave    so this lady she takes her item and walks away  feet she is now standing at the end of my register why i have no idea but there she is now to be honest this did happen some time ago so at this point ive also been trying to black it out things get fuzzy bare with me i believe  customers came though my line in the time she stayed and it was a slooow night so my best guess is she stayed for  minutes or so i think the first to come through was a boy and his mom they were pleasant and uneventful the kid asked me if he could get a treat for his dog and then they left after them another customer i will never forget came into the line  act  part  he returns  sorry this is going to need backstory so a few weeks before the incident there was the guy the guy is a fairly regular customer to the point that i recognize his face in a crowd but not much else i do know he has cats tho anyways heres his story he came in to just get literally a handful of catfood cans like  and he got to my register and he was friendly and kind and then he was  cents short he was going to run to his car to dig though the seats for the coinage but i told him id cover it now this was the first time i ever did that out of i think  or  time and his face was the greatest thing ive ever seen you would have thought i just pushed his cats out of the way of an oncoming truck i only expected a quick thank you and hed leave but he was like what is your name looks at my nametag Deltora im going to pay you back after he left i really never thought to much about it until he got in my line looked me straight in the eye and said i think i owe you a dollar i told him if anything he only owed me  cents but he put a dollar in my hand and said no i owe you a lot more than  cents thank you now this is where things get fuzzy because all while i was having customers she kept talking at me and the things she said were not compliments i dont remember what she said when but she must have said something as my new best friend stepped into line because he almost glared at her for saying whatever it was she had said at me but i cant remember anyway after he bought his things and left he gave me a look like i hope you have an okay night   i only wish that came true    act  par  hows the weather  after he left she leaned forward she is now sitting on the front window sill i dont know if shes ever leaving she could unpack a picnic basket for all i know she is in this for the long haul but she leaned forward and says what did he get for free i was caught off guard by this and looked around my counter for any clue of what she was talking about so i just said he didnt get anything for free and she said YES HE DID he asked you if those were free and you said yes then is clicked the dog treats oh you mean the boy those were dog treats i thought you meant that man that wa NO i meant the boy now give me some dog treats and i did and as i handed them to her i was trying to think of what i could say that meant GOODBYE by the by this story take place in the midwest and during the time of this story the weather was  shades of odd it would POUR for  minutes then BAM sunny day like nothing happened so what i had been telling people is be careful for the weather it a bit unpredictable nice right i came up with it myself no way on earth anyone human being could possibly be offended by it right yeah so i said to her still being the pinnacle of niceness be careful for the weather EXCUSE ME oh oh no um its a bit unpredictable more glaring what are you late teens early twenties i dont know whats happening anymore  yes now at this point a man gets into my line and he heard was lead up to this too and she doesnt stop either she goes right on talking at me while i try and ring him up I HAVE TWO KIDS THEY ARE BOTH GROWN NOW NOW OF THEM LIVES IN FLORIDA SHES A DOCTOR NOW I HAVE LIVED IN MINNESOTA FOR FORTY YEARS DONT YOU THINK I KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER IS LIKE IN MINNESOTA i want to die let me die WELL wow that wasnt meant to be rhetorical so i barely nod a yes while hoping a bus would come through the front window killing me and her i hope this other guy doesnt get hurt hes not so bad at this point he leans into to me and whispers do you want me to tell you my life story too HOLY SHIT this guy is great i give him the weakest of smiles and say thank you then he leaves and she actually leaves to but BUT  she stops half way to the door and turns GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR JOB HERE and with that she left   FECKINBTCHIWILLKILLYOUSDFIAGIHBASDFGBHLADSFGBHafter she was finally gone i just crouched in one of the isles and did some deep breathingdry heavingtearfree bawling if you believe in soul mates i believe in the opposite of that i think this womans aura or whatever you want to call it and mine must have been totally different sides of the spectrum because i honestly felt like she rubbed my soul raw with sand paper she was abrasive in every sense of the word and while i would take a bullet for a stranger she is now one of a handful of people on the planet i would shoot in the stomachanyway thats my story it took my  hours to get down because i needed breaks a lot of breaks but here it is for all of you if i remember anything else ill add itshe also came back twice one of those times to accuse me of theftTLDR she knows what the weather is like and needs her cat dipper but badedit also for the record i still have that guys dollar and i never intend to spend

almost always  especially without any loud clicking occuring Well luckily its probably a pretty simple fix  this issue is normally the flex cable going bad This fix is pretty cheap if that is the case but theres the chance its the hard drive thats bad Wed need to check it in for testing if thats okay Well contact you as soon as we know what the repair options aregtTF YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT I NEED IT BACK TODAY we close in an hour and a half UGH Okay When can I find out whats wrong with it gtMe Ill start testing on it immediately We should be able to contact you in two days by the latest but could

right now I can pack it up immediately but itll still be the  for diagnostics before we can release to you This caused more of the exact same argument and then she began yelling about me needing to be fired again and that he should be fired as well and that M should be fired Basically this girl wanted our whole department gonegtTF finally giving up FINE Ill just take it to Apple then Theyll do a better job After a bit more cussing at us she finally pays the  and goes to Apple B having worked at the Apple store notes that the girl just wasted well over  extra  the fix from us would have taken

VivaLaVodkaa,17,19,1q2txh,56,I apologize for the wall of text but Im really not sure how to TLDR this oneAlright this is my first time posting here This isnt a retail story so hopefully you guys are flexible about that and I hope you enjoyThis past summer I was an  year old that had just gotten my first job One of my best friends started his own small landscaping company and it was doing surprisingly well As his company was quite small and lacked heavy equipment we did relatively small stuff planting trees bushes mowing lawns trimming trees etc The jobs were a considerable drive away so I went down twice a week to help out As far as first jobs go the pay was much better than expected so I didnt mind the drive as much and this gave me a chance to hang out with my friend afterwards as wellThis was my first day with my friends company probably May  We had just finished two lawnmowing jobs and were moving onto the third and final for the day My friend said I could either sit it out and hit the local mall while he took this one on or I could help him out I was fairly exhausted but he insisted that it would be a small job as described by the owner of the property The owner was an old gentleman maybe  years old His social worker hired us to do the job and she did in fact describe it as smallSo I caved and said fine because a little extra money never hurts this job was paying  so it would be  a person for what was supposed to be an approximately  minute task We arrived at the property and the front lawn took  minutes I was really happy at this point because at this rate we would be done in no timeI opened the door to the backyard and holy fuck the grass was almost as tall as me  in some areas album included at the end Upon seeing this I shit an assortment of bricks We were WAY underequipped for this job as we only had one lawnmower and a whippersnapperWe decided to give it a go since we were here anyway Mostly because the owner was rather old couldnt mow it himself and probably couldnt afford to pay anybody more The lawnmower continuously jammed and I do not blame it What should have been a  minute job took us a grand total of  hours over those  hours the lawnmower probably jammed  times The strategy was that my friend would whippersnapper as much as he could to reduce the load on the lawnmower I would mow it down as best as I could and we would alternate as necessaryBy the time we had finished deforesting the lawn we were exhausted Instead of the original  we had been offered the social worker payed us  so  each  over  hours still decent Absolutely exhausting work thoughHere are pictures of the lawnhttpimgurcomaUjtjAESch,Just a typical landscaping job,75,talesFromRetail

and how you can be less wrong As you will see I tend to be very long windedAquatic turtles are really popular when people are asking about them and are the slowest selling animal in the store A proper

come in three women One of them quickly designates themselves as the primary customerTurtle Lady I want one of em turtles  Me Alright Do you have a tank  TL No  Me Well Youll have to get a tank first and set it up Normally I recommend a  Breeder  TL I want this one points at  gallon tank  Me These guys get pretty big Youll need to upgrade to a bigger tank in a matter of months Its cheaper to get

though I am more than willing to politely tell a customer to shove it Me You can not put that turtle in a  gallon tank  TL Well its only to get to Chicago Then Ill get everything Actually just get me everything I need and Ill buy the tank when I get thereThis is where things start to get weird I head off and grab a shopping cart and start to piece everything one would need for a proper turtle setup Out of spite I threw together the most expensive possible setup Top of the line heater top of the line lamps biggest possible resting spot fanciest filter  bag of pelleted food I finally bring the cart over to her and she flips her shit Unbeknownst to me while I was filling the cart she paid for the turtle and the  gallon tank The turtle was legally hers and I couldnt do anything to stop it You cant really force a customer to return something against their will TL WHAT THE FUCK IS ALL THIS  Me You asked me to get everything youd need for the turtle  TL The fuck is this for holds up lamp

gallon tank weighs around  pounds  For a turtle you only fill it halfway but I just felt like fucking with her at this pointTL Yeah Ill lift it in  Me Sure Ill put it on a cart and fill it for you  TL You think Im fucking weak Im going to carry it  Me Well itd be easier  TL Im fucking carrying itI just resign myself to facilitating her insanity at this point Nothing I can do just get her the fuck out of the store as fast as possible I fill up the tank let her carry it all the way out including when she forgot her keys inside the store and walked all the way back in holding the  pound sloshing tank When she finally got back outside she opened the door to the  car set it on her back seat and buckled it inThe other two ladies make their way to the car having not witnessed the rest of the interaction and start screaming at Turtle Lady about how insane it was she would have an open aquarium sitting in the back of her car I sort of slink away back into the store and start telling my coworkers about what had transpiredThen she comes in holding the tank turtle in it and comes up to me TL So weve decided we need a smaller tank  Me Well the one you had was probably the cheapest one  TL I dont care about the price  Me Well uh I mean we have a  gallon fish bowl but you would need to get a new tank for him the instant you get to Chicago Its one of our larger markets so youll have no problem finding a store  TL Yeah yeah whatever She returns the  gallon leaving me to deal with a half full aquarium and purchases the fish bowl and some food for the turtle Its about then Im sent to get dinner for everybody working in the store which Im usually more than glad to do As Im getting in my car I see her walk back into the store with the fish bowl Not my fucking problem at this pointWhen I get back in I find that she wanted a bigger thing for the turtle She also spent a fair amount of time bugging the cashier about what ethnicity she is mixed  black  white apparently black

hellomini,62,43,1q076f,125,So I work at a retail location in Canada that provides services such as domesticinternational money transferring and money order purchases Today I had one gentleman come in requesting to purchase a money order for x amount in American currency payable to his American health insurance companyAs store policy goes I explained that all money order purchases had a specific fee and that a customer could only pay for it using cash or debit card He then proceeded to tell me that he had an American debit card and asked me if it would be okay I asked to see what kind of card it was Ie From what financial institution and saw that it was a  debit card with the MasterCard insignia  a newish type of card that allows account holders the versatility of a chequing and savings account as well as the ability to make online purchases in the same way that many use their credit cards among other things While this card is relatively new in Canada it has been introduced much earlier in other countries including the USUnfortunately this type of card is not seen as an acceptable form of payment for money orders in my store because a debit card with MasterCard or Visa functionality would register as either of the two in my registers system despite being a chequingsavings card To put it in simpler terms the only debit cards acceptable for this kind of transaction would be Interac debit cards nothing else To use a MCV debit card would confuse the register and have it show up as a credit payment rather than a debit payment  something that I would not be able to carry out to begin with as the credit payment function is completely inaccessible when undergoing this kind of transaction on my registerI explained all of this in the simplest terms I could to the customer snd apologized for the inconvenience Then I pointed to the nearby ATM machine and explained that an alternative would be withdrawing funds from his American chequing account and pay with those funds I then concluded that he could choose which option would be best for him and that there would be no pressure to purchase a money order from my store as there are many other providers with this service but that the same rule regarding MCV cards exists throughout Canadian stores offering this service What then happened was probably the most baffling thing everAs many of you on here Im sure you have at one point felt more therapist than retail worker At this moment I had the unfortunate chance of experiencing this at its full extent as he began to explain why exactly he needed this money order and that they whoever they is told him that he could do it here and that he didnt want to pay the fees to withdraw funds from his American account and that every other country has these cards and use them properly But then get this he wasnt done yet No no According to this fine gentleman he was an American citizen and didnt have to follow my rulesAt this point I was really confused Im not sure how his American citizenship had anything to do with the rules within Canada Secondly I never expected to encounter some kind of Murcia circlejerk in real life but lo and behold I did Moreover I had just explained all of this to the customer in front of him who was a Japanese citizen and had a Japanese MC debit card and required a money order as well Now I had several questionsDoes he think being American grants him immunity to the standard transaction protocolDoes he mean to insinuate that somehow being American is being better than being Canadian as evident in his overaccentuated Im an American citizenAfter hearing me speak to the Japanese citizen does he assume that somehow the rule would not apply to him because he was American and the Japanese person was notWhat does he mean he doesnt have to follow my rules Does he think I pulled a rule book out of my ass and that Im just fucking with peopleLastly does he really think I care about him being an AmericanAll of these questions ran through my head I could have shut him down real quick I could have reminded him that when you enter a country you are obligated to follow the rules of conduct within that country especially when it relates to any thing monetary I could have also mentioned that it was people like him that gave Americans that stereotype of selfabsorbed redneck an unfortunate stereotype to the many Americans who are anything but I could have done so many things But that is not the Canadian wayI simply responded sorry And that was thatEdit formatting,Im an American citizen and I dont have to follow your rules A tale from a little cashier working in Canada first post,168,talesFromRetail

MissInDeceased,16,25,1pzs5r,106,I had completely forgotten about this story until someone asked how it was to work at this place    This was about  years ago when I was freshfaced to the retail scene I had previously worked at a movie rental place but it was nothing like this When people wanted assistance they wanted you to essentially be their personal shopper Which was kind of okay when it wasnt busy because this place sold expensive bras panties and lingerie     I was stuck to the morning shifts because I was the only employee not in school at the time Morning shifts always equaled the shipment shift     So every weekday am to pm I would come in put out new bras and whatnot and help customers when they came in It was typically me and the opening manager then maybe another girl if we had the hours    One morning was especially eventful We had gotten about  boxes of nothing but bras and it was my duty to put them out After about  hours I managed to get them all out or backstocked if there were too many     This is when a customer comes in a bigger girl about a  DD looking for a certain pattern in a certain bra    I knew exactly what pattern she meant as I had the same one so I pulled one out to verify She confirmed and told me her size     At this store when I worked there the drawers had a clear front on them so all you needed to do was look through the little window in the size you wanted to see if that colorpattern was available     Thats exactly what I was doing I was leaning down looking into the windows to see if this pattern was available Also I had been there for the past  days putting out new bras so I already knew what we had out front and in the backstock so if we didnt have it I already knew       But while I was looking into the windows the girl who was looking for the bra asked me Do you even work here    I was surprised at the question so I said Of course I do thats why Im helping you    Well it doesnt look like it looks like youre just standing there    I was shocked I was  I had no idea what to say I told her I would go look in the back and she just said Whatever    By the time I came out she was already at the register bitching to my manager about how I did nothing to help her how lazy I was and so on I walked up behind the counter and busied myself while she kept bitching    Finally she left I was nearly in tears this was the first time someone had complained about me and KEPT complaining about me even while I was there     After she left my manager told me Dont worry about it I saw that you were actually helping her she was just being a bitch     Geez some people   ,Do you even work here,131,talesFromRetail

YeahJordy,189,221,1py1fk,782,Background I used to work at a discount store and since there was only a handful of workers we were jack of all trades I packed shelves helped customers worked the register everything including changing lights while they were on because my manager assured me it was perfectly safeStory Anyway the night in particular that this story unfolded my manager decided to buy myself and the other worker a thickshake while she went and changed some money So here I am with my thickshake packing those personalised number plates onto a rack when I see a customer at the register waiting to be served so I dash over and begin serving Now I feel its worth mentioning that this store is pretty close to a junky area and so we get our fair share of painful customers This night was no exceptionI went back to packing plates and after a while I realised my thickshake was missing My manager promptly points out that this tattooed man with a rats tail and filthy clothes sorry for judgemental imagery Im still slightly bitter was slurping on my shake I confronted him not quite sure what to say and he got immensely defensive eventually offering it back to me I just shook it off and kept workingHalf an hour or so later my manager yells out that someone is in our storeroom she was behind the counter and had seen it on the CCTV our storeroom is at the far corner of the store and clearly has an EMPLOYEES ONLY plaque on it I sprinted up towards the back and sure enough as I approached this woman the kind you can confidently assume to be an addict is walking out of the storeroom and I see her drop something into her bag I confront her and she avoids eye contact and tries to busy herself with the nearby shelfMe What were you doing in there What is in your bagWoman Theres nothing in my bag Im just lookingMe I saw you drop something in your bag show me what it wasWoman I aint done nothingWe went back and forth arguing for a while and I was getting frustrated so I left her and ran back to the storeroom saw my backpack had been unzipped and sure enough my iPod was missing I ran back to the woman who had met up with the shake thief from earlier and handed him my iPod subtly I saw it in his hands and practically yelled Thats not yours Why did you take this as I snatched it back and he yelled in return I didnt do nothingThe next part is a bit blurry from the adrenaline I was experiencing but essentially the two junkies refused to explain anything to me Next thing I knew a lady pulled me aside and was asking me all these questions and I noticed another  were talking to the pair of thieves This lady told me that she and her  friends were plainclothed policemenwomen who just happened to be walking by the shop as my manager screamed out about the woman in the storeroom since there had been reports of thieves in the shopping centre recently She asked me a bunch of questions and after half an hour or so I got back to work as they kept interrogating the thievesAs I was working a male policeman MP came up and this is the conversation that unfoldedMP Hey mate how old are youMe  I turn  in a few weeksMP laughs Hah I thought soMe Whats so funnyMP Well this woman finally admitted to stealing your iPod but she claims that she only did it to get back at you for hitting on her in the club the other night In Australia you have to be  to go clubbing I knew she was lyingBut you wouldnt go there would youMe thinking that he meant going clubbing No I wouldnt clubs definitely dont seem like somewhere Id like to be at all even when I am MP No I meant herWe both had a good laugh about that remark and it made me feel a bit better The police took down my details and then they escorted the junkies out and gave them a lifetime ban from the shopId like to say that was the end of it but  minutes later the junky woman returns and just says I know Im banned but when I was out the back I left my phone out there can I just go get it please Oh It looks just like that one she points to my managers phone sitting near the register We politely tell her to get lost and never come back The nerve of some peopleSince then Ive had to give an official police statement but havent heard much else past that although I know she got charged Also my brothers girlfriend works in a different discount store around the corner and she has had some stories with the same woman too but thats for another time,The night the customer stole from my backpack,1003,talesFromRetail

jinbaittai,9,20,1px3nf,79,I work as a dog groomer and have a pretty regular clientele  One of my customers C has two dogs that she keeps with long hair  Shes pretty fussy about their appearance which Im fine with but shes also kind of petty and passiveaggressive if you make a mistake  For example one time I accidentally trimmed the eyelashes on one eye too short  the dog blinked at the wrong second and they were a quarter of an inch shorter than the customer prefers forcing me to trim the other eyelashes just a bit shorter so they matched  Not a huge deal normally but ever since then shes made a big point of reminding me not to cut the eyelashes too short  But she brings her dogs back at least once a month each if not more often and I usually have no problem squeezing her in last minute  So she likes me for the most part  Anyhow for the past week Ive been pretty sick which has led to me losing my voice pretty much a whisper and a major sinus headache  Today I had three dogs booked for grooming sessions one of whom was Willie a major barker and Mika who was  pounds  The other was C bringing just one of her dogsWell C showed up twenty minutes late without bothering to call me  Mika had been dropped off early and I was in the middle of working on her  Willie was in a kennel and  barking his fool head off as per usual and there were two dryers running at the same time  it was very loud and chaotic  Always great for a headache rightAs I mentioned my voice is almost entirely gone  I went to go chat with C to confirm what she wanted done for the day  I told her in my pathetic whispervoice that I would have to finish what I was doing with Mika before I could start on her dog and that I would need extra time with her dog  My final question was  Can you come back for your dog at Out of nowhere she gets upset    I was confused so whispersaid Yes I know its longer than normal but Im slow thanks to being sick and I have to start him later  So I need him until   At this point she literally stamps her foot and says in a huffy voice Oh just CANCEL it then  And then storms away taking the dog with her  I stood there for a minute and then shrugged and got back to work  I was feeling like garbage and I didnt have the energy to chase her down and see what the hell was going on  A couple minutes later my manager came back to the grooming room  So whyd you ask C to come back at   I said To pick her dog up  Well apparently C thought I wanted her to take her dog home and bring it back at   And instead of making sure she didnt hear my pathetic whisper incorrectly in all the chaos she freaked out and left bitching out my manager on her way  She hadnt waited for my manager to come chat with me either shed stomped out of the door  My manager and I shared a head shake and carried on with our daysLater that day C called to complain again  Apparently once my manager explained that I had intended to keep the dog for longer than normal not that I wanted her to return the dog to me later she changed her tone and begged to bring the dog back that dayIn a fit of pettiness I said no  I was too tired actually wound up in the doctors office an hour later to get antibiotics  She rebooked for later this week and apologized profusely  I am trying really hard to keep my smugness in check  With great power and all that right,Jump to conclusions much,99,talesFromRetail

Ali,1,5,1pvk5b,14,WARNING long story ahead Long time reader first time poster Figured this story was worth sharing as this is the first time Ive lost my patience with a customerBackground I work as a customer service supervisor in one fo the largest grocery store chains in good ol Canada Im essentially the person in charge of all of customer service and the cashiers and am responsible for closing the store at the end of the night Part of my responsibilities include dealing with customers where my employees are unsure of a resolution or unable to resolve an issue without authorization from a supervisormanagerSo this particular story takes place just a mere  days ago One of my coworkers who was running the selfscan machines that most people love to hate A customer had requested  cashback in case anyone is unaware cashback is adding a specific amount to your total charged on your bank card that you get back in the form of cash at the end of her order at a usual register with a cashier it is the cashiers responsibility to hand over the cash to the customer However with the selfscan machines the money is automatically dispensed and it is solely the customers responsibility to collect the money the opted voluntarily to withdrawThe initial thing I was told over the phone by my coworker before I went to speak with the customer was that the customer asked for  cashback but she forgot to take her money This happens quite often customers are human after all I dont blame people who forget their money behind but at times we cant do much about it The usual procedure is that I take down the customers name and number along with any relevant information about the transaction time date amount which register was used etc then the cash office staff in the morning will check to see if the store still has it or if the next customer in line saw free money lying around and pocketed it themselves at which point we cant really do anythingSo I make my over and start talking to the customer well call her RAB for rude ass bitch Anyways CAB makes the claim that she took her cashback out but the machine never dispensed the cash and she said the machine was slow during her entire transaction No biggie I open up the machine to see if her cash was stuck somewhere in the middle no dice So I run diagnostics on the machine to see if the dispenser if working properly its working fine so now Im getting a bit skeptical the fact that she could have taken the  and is now trying to get another extra   At this point Ive done all I can my hands are tied So I had to explain her the situationMe Alright maam your money isnt in the machine and the dispenser is working fine so I cant confirm if the money is still in the machine or notRAB What No Im telling you the machine never spit out the money and it is your coworkers job to make sure I have my money and sign off on my receipt You people arent doing your jobs correctly Not the first time one of my employees has been blamed for attempting to steal the customers money at this point I knew resolving this wouldnt be easyMe I understand maam Im not saying I dont believe you  but at this point theres nothing I can really do We dont sign off on your receipts at selfscan stations there is no cashier handing you the money the money you take out is  in your control so it is solely the customers responsibility I can take your information down and they can check things over tomorrow morning and if your money is here you will be getting it for sureRAB NO I NEED THIS MONEY NOW FOR MY DAUGHTERS BIRTHDAY she was holding her  year old in her arms the entire time JUST GIVE IT TO ME BOTH YOU OF YOU GUYS ARE LYING AND TRYING TO TAKE MY MONEY YOURE SUPPOSED TO MAKE SURE I GET MY MONEY AND SIGN MY RECEIPT THIS IS JUST UNACCEPTABLEAt this point her child starts crying because her mother is yelling at me shes pretty much making a scene and all eyes are on usMe Maam I understand your frustration and I really wish there was an immediate solution That way youd have your money and we could continue on with our other tasks I guarantee you neither of us are trying to steal from you we wouldnt want to as the risks of getting fired are way too high to even think about attempting something like thatRAB LISTEN I DONT CARE I KNOW YOU HAVE MY MONEY JUST GIVE IT TO ME YOU TERRORISTS AND CHINKS Im South Asian and my coworker is Oriental Asian ARE NOTHING BUT BAD NEWS TRYING TO RUIN CANADAS IMAGE YOURE TOO CHEAP TO MAKE AN HONEST LIVING SO YOURE LYING TO MY FACE TO TAKE MY MONEY IM A REGULAR HERE SO I KNOW IM TELLING THE TRUTH Ive been working in the store for  years this is my first time seeing herAt this point Ive had enough shes louder than ever her husband doesnt seem interested in calming her down so I lose my patience as wellMe Maam youre going to have to calm down youre causing a scene I cant help you if youre going to be yelling the entire time and I definitely do not appreciate the remarks and allegations towards my coworker and myself being a regular does not give you the authority to make racist remarks and accuse us of theft Youll have to be a bit more rational if you want a resolutionRAB EXCUSE ME I AM THE CUSTOMER YOU ARE THE EMPLOYEE DONT TELL ME TO CALM DOWN I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT YOURE WORTHLESS AND I DONT LIKE YOUR ATTITUDEMe With this attitude youre not getting any help either Im contacting my manager she can deal with you from here on out like I said my hands are tied if I could do anything I wouldAt this point I page the manager on duty to my location and walk away in complete frustration and just pure rage that Ive never felt before The manager dealt with the customer took down her info so the morning staff could check to see if we had her money and check the cameras to see if she actually took her money and tried to harass us for another extra  I dont know what ended up happening in the end but I really hope she didnt get her moneyTLDR customer claims selfscan machine did not give her the  she asked for I tell her nothing can be done until tomorrow She doesnt like what she hears so she makes a scene makes racist comments and harasses me and

Smallwater,15,25,1ptl46,97,I apologize beforehand for the massive wall of text I started typing some smaller stories but they kinda grewI currently work at a small grocery store Its part of a big German chain and I have to wear blue polo shirts as per uniform People may already know what chain I mean I work there on Saturdays only and Im still in college for the rest of the week That means Im basically the bottom bitch but since I actually try to be as productive as possible the rest of the team and management trust me enough to let me do things I shouldnt be allowed to like using the electric palletjack going into the office on my own changing prices  This chain is quite strict about their employees You are absolutely forbidden to post stuff online there have been terminations due to facebook pictures However I think that TFR is less public than FB and Im quitting there in three weeks anyway Firing me is no longer a concern for me  I will start of my long chain of stories believe me in the two years I worked there I lived through plenty with a couple of short stories of one of my former coworkers  Well not directly my coworker See we have what we call a Flying team It basically means that they get sent out to different stores and usually we only see them when we have a shortage of people due to vacations or when we need a quick replacement due to illness  One of those guys names started with T So thats what Im going to call him from here on T was in all aspects a Tremendous Idiot He was daft slow witted and the only reason he was able to keep his job was because of his uncle who worked higher up in the chain of command Some of his best escapades    Every time he had to come to work T would call and apologize He would be late for work a little bit he got stuck in a traffic jam This happened at every store Now would he be late a couple of minutes or only be late once every  weeks no biggie We get payed by the minute its your money youre losing pal But no T would come OVER AN HOUR late every single day Because of traffic jams Without change He would get in a traffic jam for over an hour every single day he had to work We started to put him on the roster an hour early as to compensate for his tardiness    When he eventually did make it to work he was different to work with than other colleagues Not that he was bad at his job on the contrary He was a fairly decent worker he knew what he was doing and he worked reasonably fast IF he was working Note T is about  years old So not only does it signify his competence being a something stuck in a retail job as a simple clerk seriously you can get promotions at the snap of your fingers A simple math test and youre already part of management but it also means a lot in what Im about to tell you now  T would occasionally read all the frikkin time flirt with girls Coworkers customers management whatever Ive seen him abandon his post AT THE REGISTER to run out in chase of a couple of teenage girls to give them his number Yes thats a  year old dude running out on his job to give his number to girls almost half his age Creepy Just a little bit  The kicker of this bit would be the scolding he got from my manager one day I was working with T and a female coworker F  F isnt unpleasant to look at but not what youd call smokin hot The manager on duty is also female and she was a bitch Not the kind of bitch you hate at least not until you got on her bad side Ive seen her stare down huge bulking angry costumers who were easily twice her size But she was awesome to work with as she was fast intelligent funny and generally pleasant if only towards us Ill call her M  Now Im stocking shelves with T and F while M was back in the office The shelves we were stacking were quite low so it involved a lot of ducking and bending over Im minding my own business swearing at some boxes who wouldnt line up right when I hear a load SLAP and a startled scream Turning around I see F standing shocked with her hands on her bottom and T with a bigass grin on his face Guess what happened yet Cause I didnt at that time I continued cursing the evil boxes who remained just half a centimeter to big and thought nothing of it Nothing of my business anyway  Suddenly M comes over to me fuming Smallwater have you seen T I see the foam coming from her mouth and F at the verge of tears behind her I tell her where T is and she storms off T T GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE I really cannot emphasize how loud and angry she was shouting Its like a Drill Sergeant met a train whistle and they had a loudass baby T comes over not really understanding how much trouble he is in with M nearly reaching boiling point Before he can even start his first sentence M completely explodes YOU KEEP YOUR GODDAMN HANDS OFF MY EMPLOYEES YOU UNDERSTAND In my mind it suddenly clicked and I realized why F was so upset about the loud slapping noise Apparently T thought it was funny to slap F as hard as he could on her butt but F really didnt like that Again I should note the creepiness of this F was barely older than  so again that is a man in his thirties slapping a girl almost  years younger that he barely knows on her butt while on duty The best part His defense  Ah I didnt mean anything by it She isnt even pretty enough for me to really mean it It was like watching a tiny rabbit unknowingly jump in front of an angry tiger F breaks down in tears she had some minor selfesteem issues and M completely explodes so loudly that he people at the register were turning heads We were at the back of the store   As far as I know he only got a berating for that incident to the surprise of us all We were sure he was going to get fired for that    T also drove a car He would have to since he has to go to different stores One of the more glorious days I remember was when T came to our store but after  hours got the message Where the fuck are you from another store The moron went to the wrong store No biggie he could have misread his roster I thought Apparently it was not the first time he showed up at the wrong store It was so bad that the manager of the store he should have gone to was already prepared for this and called our manager to ask it T could bring along a couple of boxes of grapes since the Other Store ran out earlier than expected Sure we had plenty of boxes left so we told T to bring his car around to the loading bay so we could load in the boxes There were  boxes about cm by  cm big Not that huge we though that we could easily fit them in the back of Ts old Golf Wrong  He pulls up and we immediately notice the big subwoofers hanging in his trunk Now I must say for a guy as daft as T I was impressed by the neatness of the customization It was clear the Golf had been modified but it didnt look grotesque or ugly  We started to carry the boxes to his car when he stops us and tells us he will load it in himself He just had his interior reupholstered and didnt want it damaged Fair enough so I tell him to pop the trunk and Ill put in a couple in there He opens the trunk I put in a couple of boxes and I notice the trunk wont close anymore There were too many boxes as the subwoofers were in the way of closing the trunk I start pulling out boxes to see how many we could fit in there   We could put in  boxes xcmxcm big in the back of his car because of his subwoofers  Not exactly relevant to his capability as a employee but I still giggle every time I think of the story    The reason T was eventually fired was theft Now dont get your hopes up on a big Oceans Eleven type of heist it didnt even involve money T drank a lot of energy drinks Redbull the store brand piss we sold at  cents a can whatever However paying them wasnt high on his priority list He was sneaky about this as he would pull out a can from the shelves tell the manager on duty he took one and tell he would pay for it later Now this happens fairly regularly with employees taking something from the shelves or from the stock and paying for it later Its not a big deal as we have a system of trust and memory Basically it means you either take action yourself and quickly pay for it or if you havent paid for it yet someone will remember you of it and you quickly went and payed Of course this rule was only valid when T wasnt around T would grab something say hed pay for it and continue working When someone saw him drinking he or she asked him if hed payed for it yet Hed simply say yes For a while we all thought that T was indeed paying for them Remember we work on trust so we trusted him hed pay for them  Ohhh boy Hed pay for one alright But he drank  We continually saw him drinking from a can of Red Bull and wed all think it was the same can he paid for Meanwhile it was his d or th can At the end of the day we would find a single empty can in the trash bin and we didnt suspect a thing T got a can tell the manager he took one paid for it drank it and threw it away at the end of the day No problem right None of us wondered why he went so long with a single can  One day one of the managers looked behind the press we use for cardboard boxes we collect empty boxes and press them into a big bale that would be shipped out to a recycling company There were a shitload of empty cans there The guy who found those didnt think much of it and just reasoned it was someone who was too lazy to take the extra three steps to the trash bin Until he spotted T looking guilty and quickly turning around when he spotted the manager The manager started to berate T for not cleaning up his trash when Ts idiocy landed him his termination When asked if those cans were his note the manager still thought he had paid for them he just threw them there he quickly said hed pay for them he just hadnt come to it yet So what you havent paid for those No not yet but I forgot my wallet today Ill pay for them the next time Im here The manager couldnt really believe his ears T actually confessed to stealing those cans and was trying to get away with it by trying to pay for them afterwards Now bad luck for T a person way higher up in the ranking was present in the store He overheard the story and immediately took over He asked the same questions confirmed that T indeed took those cans without paying for them and fired him on the spot Even Ts uncle couldnt help him theft is an immediate termination of contract    The best part of this His direct boss the manager of the Flying team was glad to hear T was gone He said he received too many complaints about him to keep him working but his uncle kept his head dry Finally they got him good and we didnt have anymore of his problems    Bonus story he once asked me what I studied I study IT and he immediately jumped on the occasion to ask me some questions about his new iPhone  T So how about internet Do I have to pay for that  Me Yeah G costs money Based on your provider how much you pay changes  T Well what about WiFi  Me WiFi is free as long as you have a connection point you can use WiFi  T So I dont have to pay for it  Me Nope as long as you have WiFi  T Where do I get WiFi Like at my phone dealer  Me Possibly Usually you get WiFi with your ISP its standard on the modern modems it is where I live there are  major ISPs and both have free wifi access points built in their modems  T No no I mean on my phone  Wait what  Me WiFi is standard on your phone You dont have to pay for it At all  T Ok thanks  I have a faint feeling he still hasnt used his WiFiTLDR Its a wall of text containing  smaller

CurvedStraightLine,82,84,1ptjvr,331,This is from my days at a craft supply store  I was a roving Acting Manager  Meaning if the actual store manager was out for a while I got to travel in and run the store for a bitI was called in for a brief stay only four days at a location during inventory while the manager was out  The store manager is showing me around the layout and comments that she has some issues with the backroom staff being on their cell phones during shifts so they are required to turn in their phones prior to clocking in and get them back afterwards  No problemMy first full day starts the backroom staff comes in  They were horribly understaffed for the backroom at this location only two people Mike and Angie  Angie was a sullen middle aged woman  Mike was young probably fresh out of high school and didnt seem like he had two brain cells to rub together  He showed up that shift out of uniform  I mean completely out of uniform  I tell him that there would be a write up  He stares at me then comments that the store manager was out he figured they werent really going to work that dayI explain to him that no were going to be running the same as ever I have the same authority as his manager and I wont take bullshit  Mike sort of slouches out of the office and I call for him to leave his cell phone behind  He drops it down onto the deskThe next day Mike is in uniform theres two cell phones on my desk and I figure were in business  I walk back to check on how the backroom inventory is coming along early in the shift and find that Mike is sitting on a box texting away on a cell phoneI immediately call him into the office and he is sitting there looking positively baffled at why he was in trouble  He left a cell phone on my desk just like I asked the fact that it was an old nonworking one shouldnt matter he was listening to my rulesAfter a moment or two I started to doubt if he was playing dumb or really that stupid  Either way it was another write up which he seemed beyond upset over  I spelled out for him that during the time he was clocked in there were to be no cell phones in his hands period  Day three we had computer issues and we couldnt get any inventory done  Computers came up later but by that point I didnt have the staffing to get everything done  I asked every single employee if they could either come in or stay longer to polish off inventory  Mike was one of the ones who agreed and asked if he could have his cell phone to let his ride know when to pick him up  As soon as he finished I took his phone back and locked it in my officeWere busy but I look around and realize Mikes no where to be found  I sort of let everyone know to look out for him and got a call that he was found in a closetI come back and hes still sitting in the closet  On his cell phone  He just sort of looks up at me confused when I open the door and says that his XBox Live account is messed up and hes working on fixing itI march him into the managers office  Turns out he had broken into the locked managers office to get his cell phone an action he thought was fine because I had given him permission to call his ride earlierIm sort of staring at him  Now I COULD fire someone insomuch as I had all the same abilities as a regular manager  But its sort of bad form to fire someone elses employees  So I tell him that I was having someone else fetch his belongings and I was going to see him out the door  I would relate this whole story to the actual store manager in the morning and it would be up to her what would happenSo I call to Angie to fetch Mikes things  Now I had never seen the two interact this whole time  I dont think I even heard Angie talk the whole time  She had just kept her head down and worked silentlyBut suddenly Angie was flying through the store crying and freaking out carrying Mikes thingsand her own  She starts ripping into me that I was picking on a boy and how I cant fire him  I say that Im not but shes in full hyperventilate mode and not listening  She says that if Im getting rid of him I was losing her too and she flings her namebadge at me and runs out of the store still weeping  Mike looked more confused than anything and followed her outThe next morning I handed over the keys to the store manager and had to explain that she basically didnt have a backroom staff anymore and I really wasnt sure why,Remember The Backroom Staff You Used to Have,415,talesFromRetail

NotTobeyMaguire,13,10,1psx7v,45,I was inspired to relate this after seeing the other similar post from earlier We always allow dogs into our NYC retail store because theyre typically either pursedogs or big friendly lugs who brighten our afternoon Unfortunately this time one of them had an accident but we only discovered it from the rank smell and the customer complaints coming from the second floor We investigate used loosely because it was instantly obvious upstairs to find that someones dog had left a soft wet stanky one on the hardwood floor and then proceeded to step in it and track it around the store It was a mess mostly concentrated around one side of the floorThankfully all of the other customers save one who was on the opposite side and said he didnt really care had left for greener pastures And let me tell you this this REEKED The only problem was there wasnt a dog in the shop all day only lots of humans Thats when it struck me it was probably a child who had the accident Whatever Its gross but it happens We figured the child left a stinker tracked it around without a care and when the parents realized what had transpired they scooped up their toddler and fled the scene of the crime fearing punishment or retaliation Not an awesome parenting method but the deed was done and there would be no way to stop someone so far after the fact considering that they were long gone from the storeSo a coworker and I closed off the floor cleaned up sanitized everything and left it at that After notifying the owner of the store we decided to request that they look at the security cameras just for a solid conclusion to the story even though nothing else could be done about it Tapes were reviewed and a couple days later we had our answerThere was never a child There was never a dog There was never an accident or a confused adult or a sick person or anything There was only a woman middleaged and rather normal looking for the neighborhood were in with a small bag full of excrement The poo bag leaves the hand bag the poop leaves the bag with a soft plop she walks it around a fair portion of the second floor with the aid of several unknowing and unsuspecting customer accomplices and then she flees the sceneIt was the perfect crimeTLDR Aint no party like a pootrail party cause a pootrail party just gets all over the place,The case of the poo of dubious origin,55,talesFromRetail

masajmarod,11,16,1pspag,29,I finally got a new job thanks for the months of entertainment that kept me sane while working my dead end retail job keeping my head up until I was able to land something better I have refrained from posting in the past mainly because I was relating to many other posts about retail jobs and work place hell This is one of my first reddit posts too  Work sucks Deal with it Everyone hates their job Be a man and appreciate the fact that you have a job in this economy and enjoy what you havedo outside of work be happy while being incredibly miserable inside  There is NSFW language mixed in here just a heads upI work at a Hobby Store in the USAHow in the hell did I MasajMarod end up working at a fucking Hobby store in a strip mall selling shit that doesnt matter That is a mystery I cannot wrap my head around I do no not like people strip malls or shit that doesnt matter  For more than three years have I taken the verbal punishment and abuse of my coworkers boss and customers I hate them all I am so glad I am getting out of this life depressing rut and a new chapter is beginning A bit of backstory since this is my first post  I did work as an automotive mechanic for two years during this timeframe so this was just a weekendseasonal job which made it much more tolerable  The shop I worked for moved locations and I left shortly after to focus on school  Sticking around at the hobby shop was purely for entertainment at this point I still help out at the shop when time allows  At first this was a place I enjoyed a unique atmosphere cool customers decent coworkers worked around my school schedule and the job was placed in my lap Having been unemployed for a few months I needed a summer job anyways  Just like any other specialty store think golfbowling proshop and the like we are experts in our field and knowledgeable in many products equipment but usually specialize in something specific  What attracted me to the job was my interest in electronics radio controlled equipment unmanned flight and the customizationfreedom the RC hobby has  Striving to be an engineer one day this job held a higher interest to me than just having owned an RC car since I was  years old  I have built an autonomous vehicle fiddled with first person view and programmed everything using a micro controller before it was cool I have since given up all RC related hobbies because this job has killed every ounce of enjoyment it once brought me Moving on  Here is my rant and warning for anyone in the lone star state wanting to fill my shoesI am the longest employed worker in my store right now I have been there for over  years and have outlasted  other employees and am on the th group of coworkers in my department I have trained most of the people in my department now and a handful of others I know the store better than most and understand how it operates very well  I have built up a reputation over the years from being associated with the previous employees and am known as a scapegoat and a black eye for the store and my department  The first three groups of coworkers sucked no one was motivated to work or show any responsibility for their actions called in frequently and smoked weed all the time Some of the guys were smart and left on their own We had an employee steal from the store and much of the blame was shifted onto me because I was still there when he quit The store owner went crazy and doubled the amount of security cameras he now has and he stripped me of my discount and store key to unlock the glass casesbathroom key I had to check the key inout with my manager until the owners investigation passed over and he realized I was not at fault During this time I had to put up with all the customers who were looking for the previous employee who also stole from them  and since I couldnt provide them with any contact info a lot of them started jumping my ass for some of the stuff that was going down I told most of those customers to piss off in a polite manner yet during this time the store received several corporate complaint phone calls etc I took most of the heat We were understaffed and no one from management would hop on the floor to help out People went as far as to write reviews online about it then come pissing and moaning to the manager about how incompetent his staff was I might of snapped once or twice due to the stress acted of of line or mouthed off to a customer because of the bad situation I was put in Even the cashiers would apologize for my rude behavior and that I must not of been on my crazy medicine WTF All the signs were there  quit and never look back Why did I put up with this for so long Subpar management customers hated me boring repetitive atmosphere I saw the importance of an education and knew this was just a part time job to get me through collegeThe reason I stayed this long was because it was an incredibly easy job and having to work around my school schedule was almost always impossible to other employers I had some new coworkers who shared my elitist mentality and witty mindset  Hell yeah I started to enjoy work again  I decided to stay The owner was planning on opening up a new store and sending me and another guy over to run it I was looking at a good raise and new job title Assistant Manager Finally my hard work was starting to pay off I thought The other guy who I was supposed to run the store with is a big stoner lives at home with his mom he is in his s and perfectly capable of being independent and he was also a jackass Smoke on the job frequently deal drugs while on the job etc Do what you want but dont shit in this shared nest of ours pal I reported it but the owner didnt bother to listen He rehired this asshat when he bailed on us last Christmas leaving me working the day after Christmas by myself That story is for another time We had a falling out and I was denied my position due to a conflict of interest with the stoner coworker Fine I would rather stay closer to home anyways I at least expected a raise or something since I was promised one I am still able to be an assistant manager here if the other douche bag is leaving Nope  Fast forward  months some quit some go to the new store and I am working roughly  hours less because of a heavier school schedule The owner gives one of the new guys a raise and promotes him to manager of my department along with another gentleman in another department WTF Okay  they are scheduled for more hours but they have been here for less than ½ the time Ive been employed so what gives At least one of the promotions was legitimate and justifiable he deserved it  the other guy doesnt lift a finger most of the day and wears slippershouse shoes to work  Time goes by  two new guys are hired Word gets out  they make considerably more than I do hmm So I go in and ask for a raise I have certainly turned around the previous bad rep I had previously and earned the raise I was asking for Not only was I denied but I was belittled about what little I bring to the company LOL right  Got it I was going to ride this out until the year was over but not anymore Thankfully I have been networking with others to seek employment dedicating more time to school and focusing on what is important The job is mindless and numb to me now  Ill be on autopilot and doing the bare minimum until my two weeks is upI have considering going out with a bang no call no showing or just straight up quitting midshift during a busy Saturday  Perhaps even halfbaked style if they push too many buttons I have enough work experience to not even write this one down on a resume while burning the bridge and flipping the bird Realistically speaking  theyll be screwed without me there this holiday season and that is plenty enough satisfaction for me Removing the slave tunic off my back bandaging my wounds and whip marks then waltzing out the front door is something I am looking forward too  TldrI have the most education experience knowledge and highest level of seniority at my retail job but none of that is worth jack shit to the owner  Learned some life lessons got a new higher paying job more related to my field of study ,I have put myself on auto pilot until my two weeks expire Lengthy rant,45,talesFromRetail

Scratchums,24,56,1pry8t,182,So I work at a clothing store pretty well known brand which has a unisex fitting room  I was on duty there unlocking doors taking unwanted items processing them etc  In one stall we had a mother and her young son maybe  and in the next one an older lady maybe mids  Its a Saturday so its pretty busy  There are maybe  other stalls occupied tooSuddenly I hear Oh god theres pee all overAnd all I could think to say was Wha  Because the restrooms are literally also in the fitting room  And these two stalls happen to be next to the restroom  This cry however was coming from a fitting room stallThe woman and son run out of the first stall and the kid is going bananas  I peek in and yep somehow there is pee on the floor seeping in from the next stall  People are staring at me  Ive only been working here for a few days  Ive plenty of customer service experience but Ive never had someone pee on another person So I knock on the second stallUmm maam  Are you all right in thereI glance under the stall and her feet are moving but shes saying nothing and the woman and especially the kid are going bananas so I use my walkie talkie to call for a manager and step outside for a sec  The first thing the manager asks is Well is she dead or something  What no shes moving  Things are getting awkward thoughAnd when I got back the door to stall two opened  The mother the loud son and several customers are watching her and she proclaims to all around her Yes  I admit it I had an accident  But that is no reason to scream and panic and treat me like less than a human being  Yall dont know me  My name is redacted and Im from other state Im not even from here  Sir I will clean my own mess if you would get me the supplies  I told her that wasnt necessary a manager was on his way and hed already volunteered to clean it  Unfortunately she insisted and stuck around  The mother and son decided it was a great time to yell at the woman kid first  She got pee on me  over and over and over again  After a very awkward Yall dont know me sort of confrontation she made her way to the front of the store near checkout and began flailing around  Eventually police were called and demands were made for the woman to be arrested but I dont believe anything really came of it except maybe some Maam Im gonna have to ask you to calm down because the lady was still with us at the time in the fitting roomI kept my cool  I have a respectable poker face and can remain neutral in retail horror but what escalated it was how the lady was totally unapologetic  Obviously she didnt mean to pee in a fitting room and certainly not on someone elses kid and maybe some people can forgive that because shes right they didnt know her or her problems but she went from embarrassed to indignant very quickly  The peak was definitely emerging from the stall with arms outstretched as if to say Yes my children  I am the piss messiah  Look upon me and know me,She got pee on me,238,talesFromRetail

reselling store that was connected to a movie rental place  It was one of and will probably be the best job I had  Started there on my th birthday had to be  and was basically and for a short time was managing it on and off Alright so at my store I had tons of regulars and got to know them pretty well  Some of them became a family away from my actual and my work family  Even today some  years later I still see them and we talk like we saw each other just yesterday  There was one customer named jason who came in often with his grandma  He never bought anything and was just happy looking  If he did ask to buy something his grandma said it would be too hard for him  He would talk to me from time to time and tell me about his sonic game and how he loved to play it but had beat it numerous time sonic  on genesis  I always thought if he could play that then surely anything he looked at on ps was going to be just fine  One day his grandma pulls me to the side Gma We come in here a lot and jason has decided to call you a friendMe Thats good  Hes a really good kid and I enjoy him coming inGma I notice you never asked why we never buy anything and I respect that  Jason has autism so the games are just to hard for him to learn the controlsMe Oh I see  Well I wont say anything to him about it and you know you guys are always welcome in here and we will help as much as we canFast forward a couple of weeks on a monday afternoon where  we are usually dead as all get out  Day before game releases were very calm  I only needed one other person and they were already on the clock when in comes jason and his grandma  They look around and jason sees a game that he wants more than anything Ive ever seen him look at  Legend of spyro for the PS  His grandma told him it would be way to hard  The look on his face when she said that pulled on every heart string I hadI pulled his grandma to the side while he looked at the game and asked how long they thought they would be in the store  She said until she got tired and then they would go grocery shopping at the store at the end of our strip  So I ask if I can put the game into the demo unit  She was hesitant at first but decided to go ahead and let him  About an half hour into the game he is starting to get upset and she starts to get tired I put my office chair near her to sit down and start talking to jason and kinda walking him through how to play  Another hour goes by and he is getting the hang of it but she decides to go shopping  I convince her to let him stay and pick him up whenever she is done which she agrees to do  He is loving the game and I can see it  He has a look on his face Ive seen all to many times  While he is playing I tell my coworker to leave him alone and Ill be right back  I walk over to the grocery store and find her  I ask her if she has any problems with him getting the game  She says she doesnt really want to buy the game if he cant play it  I ask again and she gives the same answer so I tell her not to worry about that Ill take care of it  She agrees although hesitantlyI go back to the store and look up the barcode for the memory card he is using and the one for his game and ring them up  Use my extra store credit from my old non employee account I never was bothered to put on a gift card and finalize everything  She comes in and he gets really sad that he has to end the game  I go to turn it off and when I do I eject the game take the memory card out and put them together in the case with the receipt  He doesnt understand at first and starts to put the game back on the case so I go out from around the counter and tell him to open the game case  In that second I see the happiest expression I have ever seen  He runs to his grandma who is now visibly choked up about it and shows her  She is speechless but manages to say Thats amazing jason  He walks over to me and says Thank you redring I will beat this game just like you showed me  He then gave me a hug which made his grandma and I break out into tears  She takes him out of the store and they left  Later that night I get a call from her saying he has been playing the game all night  hours if I recall and is loving it  I explain how happy I am and tell her if it gets to be too much to bring the game in and we can switch it out or I can show him how to progress through that part   About  weeks later he came in and bought the second game and apparently had been doing extra chores to be able to buy it  I see them every now and then  Jason has been doing a lot better in school lately and is still gaming  Gaming has allowed him to make connections and friendship with people  He always is happy to see me and always gives me a high five and sometimes still a hug  This kid is honestly the best thing to come out of retail for me so far and I am so happy to have worked that day with him  To watch him go from the  year old who couldnt really play any games to a kid who is now understanding just about any game you put in front of him  To see how that experience made something where he could relate learning with his autism and make it basically non existent now  Every year I get a Christmas card from his grandmother and him and every time I am told what game his is playing and its always got something about spyro on it even if its just the picture of spyro sitting on their fireplace  They go in my bank lock box so that nothing happens to themTLDR I hate to do this for this one because it means so much to me  I help a kid and he changes my life,One of the best days Ive ever had,1282,talesFromRetail

butwhyisititchy,49,91,1porcp,443,So not retail but a good customer story nonetheless I worked for a large national health insurance company for a few years doing customer service and in that time I spoke to a lot ofuh special people One day I got a call from a gentleman who was getting a bill from his doctor and wanted to know why we didnt pay it Well the doctor was not in our network so when that happens we give the customer the option of having payment sent directly to them instead of their doctor since they often have to pay up front for services I checked his claim and sure enough we had already paid him in full for this bill It was somewhere around  He said he had never received the check so I looked and it had been cashed a few months back I looked at the image of the cashed check and told him his signature was on it and it had been cashed I told him if he didnt cash it I could initiate a checkfraud investigation for him As usual though I was pretty certain he had cashed the check and just didnt remember This is the case  of time Finally he realized he did in fact cash that check He didnt know that it was intended to pay that bill though and had spent the money on other things Now I feel like I should mention that the checks are sent with a copy of the claim showing exactly what dates and services the check is for But surehe had no idea Thats fine Im thinking now that he realizes what happened this call is done and I can go home call came in  minutes before my shift was overlove that But no He then asked if I would be RESENDING a check for that amount to pay this bill What Um no sir we already paid for this You received the money Thats it for us Him well yes but I spent that money already and still have this bill to pay You need to pay this bill Youre my insurance company I was literally speechless for a moment Wtf kind of logic is this I was on the phone with him for an HOUR going back and forth trying to get through his head that this makes less than zero sense People boggle my mind sometimes Tldr dude thinks we should pay his claim twice because the first time we paid it he used the money on other shit,No we wont pay you twice because you spent the first check by accident,534,talesFromRetail

frankiethestreetlamp,10,12,1pocj4,39,Hi TFR All you lovely sullen and generally over it people have provided me with such entertaining stories its about time I contribute at least a little bit I work at a well known electronics retailer in a rural town Im talking farms rural but weve got a decent university and a famousish race track so the town itself is quite large and has all walks of life Which means all sorts of crazy too This story is from about two years ago but stands out as one of the douchiest customers Ive ever met On a late night shopping shift deep into the absolutely pointless to be still open period I was shuffling around the shop putting stock away while the manager on duty absolutely awesome guy henceforth known as AAG was fixing some window promo fittings near the front entrance At this point there was an internet kiosk out the front of the store maybe  metres awayWed also just gotten in a large and impressively flashy sound system that was playing a few metres into the store facing out to the shopping centre Now were always careful to keep these to a fairly low volume but understandably customers turn it up from time to time This was not one of those times Its also worth pointing out that on top of terrible hearing I get a lot of ear infections and am usually half deaf at any given point So this middle aged guy walks in he seemed calm enough and I asked him how I could help Well call him Douchenozzle or DNDN what he actually said I was at the internet kiosk and that bass is really disturbing What I heard that place is really disturbing So I chuckled thinking it was a joke Woops He immediately goes bright red and rips into me about how he was trying to do important things and kids like me will ruin our ears with music that loud and HOW DARE I LAUGH AT HIM etc etc I was trying to cut in to say I misheard AAG had overheard and came over to save my assThe guy is a bit calmer talking to a huge bald bearded man AAG generally looks like a bikie minus the tattoos and eventually leaves while AAG turns the volume down to minimum and gets back to what hes doing in the window I opened my mouth to explain what happened to AAG when he tells me to wait a moment pulls out his phone and turns the volume up over the network while DN stalks off He hears it Stops Looks around Nobody near the sound system Oh the joys of technology and awesome managersI have a few other stories some involving my lack of great hearing some involving outright crazy and a lot involving petty revenge but mostly just Im a farmer who didnt bother to research anything spend  hours walking me through it again and again and I know more than you because I have a penis And a lot of idiots excoworkers and customers alike,Im sorry you couldnt browse your porn in public in peace sir,51,talesFromRetail

Dis,27,14,1po3w4,47,The bookstore that I happen to work at is near an entrance in what is basically THE mall in the town I live in  It is the closest thing to culture that we have  and while it is normally hellish enough on the weekends its sometimes downright dead during the week The mall normally holds a Halloween Trick or Treat event that has the stores pass out a fair amount of candy to a fair amount of children  Usually a decent turnout and the mall hosts what is a nice event for somewhere just under  young kids in cute costumesWell tonight it stormed like a bitch and thus Halloween night is essentially cancelled for the night for all of the kiddies in the area   If only there were an enclosed space in which the brats could all beg in a mumbling manner for candyWell as it turns out EVERY parent  as well as for some reason a handful of ridiculous teenagers  got the same idea and turned out to the mall to badger the shops into giving their children candy   This had become so very huge that when I walked into work I was immediately told that I was in charge of handing out candy to the children   Going to the mall side entrance of the store I stood next to a co worker who had already been there and began handing out candy  I was under the impression that he would be joining me   Uh as it turns out that wasnt fucking happeningHe disappeared sometime after he got a refill on the candy and I was left alone a few times when I was out of candy and had to handle telling children and their parents that I had run out   Most people were pleasant about this rather reasonable set back but then there was the minority of smegma who rolled their eyes and had the nerve to expect something out of the charity that a business is giving to their children  Well you guys should have expected this turn out with it raining outsideThirty minutes in  my co worker who had been sent out for a candy run to the ridiculously over priced boutique in the mall was no where to be seen and in a surreal way that youd think that youd only see in a movie like Brazil the line of children who were waiting for a single piece of friggin candy stretched allllllll the long way down the hallway that separated the book store on one side to the coffee shop and the rotunda  Holy Christ you would have needed to see it to believe the amount of twoyear olds in cheap princess dresses and boys wearing offbrand Scream masks to know what a sheer childrenorientated panic feels like  I believe that this must be a good deal what it is like before and after Christmas Day for a BuildaBear employee  Christ are people who work with kids on a day to day basis much more patient than I will ever be   My coworker returned some time later with  worth of candy that came directly from out of my managers pocket   It was small fruitflavored tootsierolls that I was instructed to give no more than one to every kid   This later got supplemented with Halloweenthemed stickers and temporary tattoos   This unbelievably ran out an hour and fifteen minutes into what was supposed to be a two hour long event with all of the children in attendance doing nothing more than standing in the sort of line that would only be normal for a Harry Potter midnight release  Not for a single Piece Of Candy  or two stickerstemporary tattoos   Thankfully the unchangingly looooonnnggg line of people dissipated with little grumbling  although almost none actually went into the store to at least browse  They took their candy and left leaving the store a complete ghost town by the time I got back to my actual work for the nightWas it worth it  Well for a child hater like me I was overwhelmingly surprised at the good manners of most of the children in attendance  a lot of warm smiles Happy Halloweens and thankyous  and the most trouble that I got was from parents who thought that a good Halloween memory for their children is to have them stand in line for a single piece of candy handed out by a sweating nervous book store employee  I loved seeing the homemade costumes but I kept a mental count of Minecraft costumes that came with big cardboardbox heads at a magnificent four with children dressed in the trademark scraggly beard and camo cap of some cast member from the TV show Duck Dynasty at a strange ten The extra buckets that some adults thrusted at me as I tried to give each kid attention made me want to breath fire on the entire event  some of them at least had the grace to mutter something to me about a phantom sick child who was unable to attend the eventThe moral of the story  do not depend on a mall to give your child all of his Halloween candy  Its unfair to both your children and to the stores who have to waste time and money distributing it to them  If its storming bad on Halloween maybe just buy them a shit ton of candy and stay somewhere warm with themFun fact  later that night a group of adults and a twoyear old that had gone into the childrens section and later on the mother of the twoyear old rushed up to me holding her squalling child asking me where the nearest restroom was  As I was telling her about the stores restrooms I realized that the child was fucking bleeding from out of her lower lip in a steady stream  As she walked away I could hear the woman scolding the child about freaking out when she had hurt herself  Later on the night I saw the group leaving deep in conversation over the prerequisites for their insurance company on getting stitches at a hospitalTLDR Now why wouldnt you just read my Halloween story if youve bothered to click on it at all  Really   Well alright Sometimes parents look at the decision to skip Trick or Treating and the danger of pneumonia and decide that standing in a looping nightmarish line for a single piece of candy is the logical decision to make  BONUS  tonight a woman learned that a wounded child will squall  I dont see that kid getting any stitches any time soon even if she needs them,What Happens on a Rainy Halloween Night in my Workplace Apparently  WalloText Edition,61,talesFromRetail

kquatro,9,19,1pneit,74,Hello TFR This is my first time posing here Normally Im reading the stories all you people have to offer I think its about time I share what happened to me last Friday TLDR at the bottom Background  I work at local pharmacy in town Im  and been working here for  years Its your typical momamppop store We offer cards candy toys gifts along with various OTC products and our retail compounding and nursing home pharmacy So lets just say I get all walks of like coming into my store may it be local doctors to the local homeless guy that rides his bike around town It doesnt matter who you are or what drug youre taking Im going to treat you with respect while keeping a smile on my face Story So its around PM and both my other clerks went to lunch at the same time I dont know why normally we try and have  clerks together at all times because we get swamped with customers so its just me my tech and my pharmacist upstairs Everyone else is in the basement Whatever Im used to it I can run this pharmacy with a blindfolded if I had to But today wasnt my day weve all had off days I could feel it One of my clerks and I joke around saying whenever she goes to lunch I always get the bad apples The ones who want to get in my face because their insurance wont cover all the RX so they have to pay a  co pay Shit I even had a regular get mad at me for some stupid ass reason because her insurance actually PAID for her RX so instead of a  co pay it was like  or something ridiculous But this day was different My pharmacist is on the phone with a doctor and my tech is stuck on the phone with an insurance company trying to get a claim to go thru Ive got a line of  customers Im helping and  more coming in the door plus  others that are ready to be helped As most of you know after working a business for a while you start to get to know people by their first names and on a personal basis  of the customers in line know me and know how hard I work and were fine waiting Fast forward I have one of the RXs ready for a waiter I politely tell the people that just came to the counter I have to help this customer st because shes been waiting I ring her up and she asks for an insurance claim form OK I ring up my other waiter just picking up a special order quick and easy then run behind the counter to print out the paper work we dont have access to certain programs on our clerk computerI should point out all of this is being taken care of in less than  minutes All while this lady I havent helped yet in GLARING at me I could feel her eyes burning into my little soul and it was making me uncomfortable My pharmacist was FINALLY off the phone so I had her call someone up from the basement to help take care of customers My tech would help but he is STILL on the phone Whatever Im doing the best I can While shes doing that I get the claim printed and signed and handed it off to the customer who thanked me and told me I was doing a great job considering all the work I was doing As I was finishing  helping her my coworker comes up but its one of our new girls who hasnt learned how to use the cash register yet The lady who was staring me down like the Eye of Sauron just burning into my soul saw her come up and didnt help her she lost her shit ARE YOU SERIOUS ARE YOU SERIOUS THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE I CANT BELIEVE THIS Again its probably been  minutes total shes had to wait now I finished with my previous customer and went to take care of her and she kept spewing the diarrhea out of her mouth saying how terrible Im doing and IS THAT HOW LONG IT TAKES TO PRINT A CLAIM FORM st of all bitch there was an update on the system so things changed a little bit so Im sorry it took  whole minute for me to print it off  I try and defuse the situation by apologizing telling her Im the only clerk and Im doing the best I can considering there is only so much I can do when my other clerks are at lunch As she was yelling and I was bagging her shit up my coworker comes up to help the other customers Cool Shes still yelling and making a scene and Im still apologizing profusely while still telling her Im doing the best I can maam Im sorry I think I even said what more do you want from me but I cant be sure I was so overwhelmed Im a young female and Im working on standing my ground and not letting people disrespect me I suffer from anxietypanic attacks so when people get in my face like that in front of other people I get upset but I try not to show it By the end of the transaction I was shaking because my anxiety just shot thru the roof I couldnt even look my other customers in the eyes I was so embarrassed Thankfully they all understood and thought the lady was a total bitch and was out of line and I was doing a great job The icing on the cake though was when I handed her the bag of stuff she looked at me and said youre doing a good job What The Fuck I didnt even tell her to have a good day like I would any other customer that has a douche attitude  I had to go into the back of the pharmacy and catch my breath because I couldnt breathe then I started having a panic attack then came the water works so I went to the basement to cool off  Of course my coworker who clerks with me all time saw me all upset and asked kquatro whats wrong I explain the situation to her and she told me I should have called her up and she would have taken care of the puta but it was her lunch break shes pregnant and I wanted to her to relax I should have called her up though she doesnt take shit from no one Thankfully  I didnt get in trouble I was told I handled the situation the best I could considering After all was said and done I cleaned up went back to work and moved on I keep going over the situation in my head thinking of better ways I could have dealt with her and her stanky attitude but its a learning experience I guess Fuck people like that I understand some people have bad days or you have to wait in like a few minutes longer than you were hoping but that doesnt give you the right to be so fucking disrespectful In the end people will do what they want and you cant change them you can only kill them with kindness TLDR Older lady had to wait  minutes before being helped was a complete bitch to me and put me down in front of regular customers and coworkers FUCK people like that  edit grammar,Im doing the best I can maam Im sorry,93,talesFromRetail

imhometakemedrunk,95,106,1pncj4,341,Hello TFR I miss you guys greatly I apologize for the lack of stories lately I have been really busy with work and my personal life Since today is Halloween and Ive been getting a lot of PMs asking for this story I felt today would be the perfect day to share it I just need to emphasize a few things before I tell the storyFirst off this story involves death I will refrain from getting too graphic However I am going to be sharing some details that can only be best described as nsfw If reading about a topic like this makes you feel sick or uncomfortable please do NOT continue reading You have been warnedThe day started off like any other day It was about PM I had just finished lunch and had made myself my fourth cup of coffee for the day I get to my desk and see a call coming through from our monitoring station They are the company that dispatches the policefire department when there is an emergency as well as contact clients in an emergency I picked up the phone and the following is a  story of what happenedMe Thank you for calling xxxx this is imhometakemedrunk how can I help you todayMonitoring StationMS Hey imhometakeyoudrunk I have a client on the phone who had the police panic alarm go off They said it was an accident but they may need service Can you help him with thatMe Of course send them throughMS Okay the account number is xxxxxx his name is Mr Walker Here he comesMe Thank you for holding Mr WalkerMW My name is imhometakemedrunk what seems to be the issue todayMW Well umm Its not really an issue I guess Its just the system tried to send the police I cant have the police coming here The client had a very monotone voice It sounded as if all the life had been drained from him It was cold sharp and completely lifelessMe Okay Mr Walker Did anybody press the police button on the panelMW Yeah my wife I mean I must have leaned against it or somethinSHUTUP sorry damn dog Yeah so I guess I leaned on it The police arent coming out here rightMe No sir there is no dispatch being made So the system is working just fine then There are no issues todayMW Well the system isnt really working right I guess since it tried to have the police come outNow Im going to pause the story right here This is the point where things started gettingwell weird Please understand I did NOT know what was going on entirely until the next day I was suspicious but everyone in the office thought I was making things up Looking back it seems so obvious The next voice will be titled The Wife or TW I could barely make out what was being said It took at least three replays of the call to get everything entirely TW Help me PLEASE NO PLEASE HELP MEMW I need to make sure the system doesnt send out the police I cant have that happening Can you have somebody look at the system and CAN YOU CUT IT OUT IM ON THE PHONE  sorry about that This dog is driving me crazy Anyways I do need somebody to check the system When can you come outTW Oh god Please smack NO garggling soundsMe Is everything okay Mr Walker It sounds like somebody is hurtMW What Oh you mean my dog Yeah she bitches a lotMe Oh what kind of dog do you haveMW Just a mutt Shes pretty useless creepy laughMe Well I have two German Shepards They are the greatest pets everMW Riiiiight Sooo can somebody come outMe Absolutely We have a time slot available tomorrow from ampm Does that work alright for youMW Let me check my schedule for the morning Give me a secondMr Walker sets the phone down and walks away for a minute I heard some shuffling around then the phone pick up by a very soft and watery sounding voiceTW Pleasesend theIpleaseMe Hello Is somebody there Is everything okay HELLOMW Sorry about that My phone fell down and the dog got to itMe It sounded like somebody was talking to me That was strangeMW So Im available tomorrow around midday Can you do something a little laterMe Sure we can do pmpm Is that okayMW Sounds good Thatll give me plenty of time to take care of my stuff We will see you thenMe Okay Mr Walker We look forward to seeing you tomorrow Is there anything else I can help you with todayMW Nope Im all set Lets just make sure the cops dont come out here I cant afford that to happen No false alarms hereTW No no no no no no no no no no nochinkMW Ah jeez I have to go  clickMe Mr WalkerI immediately went to my manager to have him listen to the call I was really put off by the call and didnt know if I should call the police or just let it go The whole time speaking to him it just felt off My manager passed it off as a normal guy watching a movie in the background dealing with an annoying dog Anybody I told didnt believe me Then the next day happened The technician showed up to the home to find it swarmed with police an ambulance and the fire department The technician was able to get an idea of what happened from a police officer there Essentially Mr Walker and his wife had a serious fight and he snapped He beat her severely then killed her with an ax She tried to have the police sent out by pressing the emergency police button on her panel but because the husband answered the phone when the monitoring station called there was nothing we could do He tried to cut her up and dispose of her but a neighbor noticed him CARRYING AN ARM out back They called the police and found the husband trying to bury her in the back yard This was easily the worst moment in my entire career I know there was no chance to save this woman or prevent any of it from happening Thats not what bothers me Its the fact that I didnt even think that another human being could be capable of brutally beating and then killing his wife while on the phone with a stranger It really makes you think So please if you seehearfeel off about something say something You could be saving somebodys life I hope I was able to provide something to everyone that reads this story Whether its the realization of human capability knowing that saying something can help or youre just twisted and wanted a good story to read I do hope you take something from this story Thank you all for reading Take care and be safe Happy HalloweenTLDR Trust me guys youre going to want to read this oneEDIT It seems some people dont understand procedure for police dispatch in the alarm industry I will break it down for you Alarm sounds  Monitoring station calls the home  Husband answers says its a false alarm gives password  Monitoring station cancels dispatchI had nothing to do with the dispatch I was there to try and set service to for the guy As the conversation progressed more and more things started to raise little red flags It wasnt until the next day that I had realized what all those red flags were pointing too I could barely hear the woman on the phone It took multiple listens to the call and full volume to even begin to understand what was being said by the wife There is NOTHING that could have been done by ANYONE in my company or the monitoring station that could have changed the outcome Feel free to keep debating that though,NSFWishThe story youve been waiting for or I Listened To Her Die,447,talesFromRetail
NejKidd,27,36,1pn89g,123,I now work in a supermarket but for a season I worked in a chain hotel  Not strictly retail but we had a product to sell and customers and various different stories from it but first I want to introduce the people I worked withBackground I was a receptionist in an understaffed hotel reception which was attached to a large restaurant  Although the hotel made the most money by far the restaurant was the place that the managers focussed all their attention on and as a result the receptionists were often the only member of staff to cater to every whim of any guest in the hotel  which was a feat of endurance considering there were  rooms each of which could hold up to  adults  A tantrum from one could be disastrousThe management were too cheap to employ the correct number of staff  a hotel our size by company regulations needed an absolute minimum of  receptionists and  night porters to run smoothly  We had  receptionists and  night portersThe  receptionists were all female  Our head receptionist was a lady Ill call Dolly  Then we had Beth who was older than the earth and had been there since the first dawn  She liked to chatter to everyone and it wasnt unusual for her to not have time for half of her duties before her shift was over  Kim was new and very slow at everything she did  Where I picked up stuff nd or rd try average she would need prompting on her th or th go at a task  Then the worst colleague ever MeganMegan was a small town girl  I dont mean those sweet naive smalltown girl I mean one of those who saw every man as a meal ticket and every woman as competition  She was married at  divorced with  kids at  and when I left she was  she was pregnant with number  which she didnt know if it was her exhusbands her newest boyfriends or perhaps the guy shed also been sleeping with the week those two overlapped  I was a year younger with an acceptance to a good university the year after and been accepted into a job in another country which began at the end of the season  People told me her attitude toward me was because she was jealous  I have no idea but the facts do make a good case for itBut enough ranting  On to the storyWe had three shifts in the day am to pm pm to pm and pm to am night porter shift  We also had a pretty retarded system where even though we had  tills and paypoints we had only  till draw  We didnt often have people paying by cash so it was rare wed open it  But we still had to count it out and in every shiftAlso to sign out we had to take note of every single penny we took in cash on our paypoint in the day  As you tried to log out at the end of your shift youd have to enter in the exact amount of money youd taken  If you were out by even a penny it would refuse to let you log out  You then had to go across to the restaurant get the manager to look at their system to see how you went wrong then track back to the reception to log out properlyBecause of this system and the managers being idiots it wasnt unusual for me to leave work up to  hours late  This is why I loved being on morning shiftThis one particular day I had been my normal efficient self and done all the morning things and Megan who had bitched to managers about the weird hours and not being able to see her children so theyd altered the timetable just for her so she worked midday to pm  So for the last  hours of my shift I had to deal with her sitting and chatting to all the guests instead of doing the work shed been set telling me loudly and obnoxiously how to do stuff while I was already doing it and texting under the counter  At pm my relief came in Kim  I signed out an hour late because Megan kept being a bitch about me signing out  have I done this have I done that where is this piece of paper why have I done that  READ THE FUCKING HANDOVER SHEET NOTES I JUST PUT IN YOUR FUCKING HAND YOU TOTAL WASTE OF SPACE  Ahem  Where was I  So I signed out an hour late and as I was literally on my way out of the door I saw that both Megan and Kim were occupied with customers and Kim was floundering while the guest trying to check in was getting frustrated and Megan was ignoring them both  I stepped in and took over the check in making sure to show Kim everything I was doing again and in the transaction the guest gave a  note for which I gave both  notes in the till draw as change  No problem crisis averted I swiped out and left the premises  It should be noted here that I live an hour away so to get to the shift at am I had to wake at am and if I left at pm it was now pm and I was exhaustedThe moment I stepped in the door the phone rang and the conversation went like thisgt Me Hellogt Megan You took  from the till  Where have you put itgt Me Sorry I havent taken any money from the till  Whats happenedgt Megan Theres  missing from the drawer and weve looked everywhere do you know where its gonegt Me No I have no idea  I left more than an hour ago so I couldnt have done anything  Are you sure you looked everywheregt Megan practically screaming down the phone NO It had to be you  When I came in there was  in the till it was there the entire time until you left and now its missing  You have to know what happened to itgt The phone crackles and suddenly theres another voice on the line its the General Manager who I shall call Chiefgt Chief Hi NejKidd  Were a little bit rushed down here but Megan says there was  in the till before you left and were not accusing you of anything but perhaps it fell into your bag or something gt Me naively checking my bag and internally panicking  No theres nothing here I havent got a clue where it went the till balanced perfectly before I leftgt Chief Okay well keep looking here but if you do find it please just call usShe puts down the phone and immediately Im panicking  What if Megan took it and hid it to pin it on me and make sure that Id get fired this time  Shed recently tried to pin various other fuck ups of her own on me so this was just another in a long line of issues I had with her  Obviously its the one I remember the mostI went to bed and at pm Id still heard nothing so I rang up work to see if anything had come of it  By that time both Chief and Megan had left but Kim was still there  She was surprised I even rang backgt Kim Oh they found it  It was there all the timegt Me What Howgt Kim They counted the till  You know that  note you took for me  Well Megan had looked in the till before I came in and saw there were two  notes and when I went to count it after the handover she saw that the two  notes were gone and went to get Chief before taking the office apart and then eventually phoning you  Then they counted the till and found it was balanced just that Megan hadnt seen you give the  notes as changeSo basically Megan and Chief had accused me of stealing money from the till without even checking to see if the money was actually still in the till  To make matters worse they hadnt even bothered to phone me to apologisetell me everything was okayAfter that whenever I handed over to Megan I made sure I sat down with her and painstakingly went over everything I had done that morning even when she got bored I would explain everything I did just to make the pointTlDr Raging banshee likes to accuse me of stealing before finding out that nothing is missing,The worst coworker

shopping centre Its a pretty shitty shopping centre with a big supermarket a gym two cafes a cinema a crap pub some restaurants and a couple of other shops People mostly come in for the supermarket This shopping centre is in a really odd area that doesnt really have anything else going for it other than you can walk to a very posh area in about  minutesThe customers are without a doubt some of the most horrible people I have ever encountered with the exception of an older gentleman who comes in every day says hello to us all and sometimes falls asleep on the couch If he falls asleep he walks past us as he is leaving and says I just fell asleep to which we all chuckle merrilly and he goes on his wayHere is an example I once got told off for showing a customer to the book she was asking forShe said to me Where are the Elmer books and I said They will be in the picture book section under M for McKeeI may have been slightly terse as she didnt greet me in any other way just demanded to know where Elmer wasShe then stated Im in a hurry so I emerged from behind the till took her to the picture book section handed her some Elmer books said There you go and left her to it When she returned she said to me Everybody here is rude You just stomped away after I asked for help to which I replied I did not stomp I am sorry that you feel that way You told me you were in a hurry so I showed you what you asked for She bought the book and left in a huffBut she was not my nemesis My first encounter with the nemesis was as I was tidying a table in the front of the store She entred the shop and called over to meWheres Jack London The customers in this shop never seemed to say Hello or Please or Thank you I honestly believe there is something in the water thereI looked up at her and said Jack London I think we might have him in the childrens section This was not the correct answer Childrens section Why is he in the childrens section He doesnt write books for kids He wouldnt be happy about thatI almost said to her Will you be telling him but I didnt as she was terrifying I tried to explain that the publishers produce his books with covers for adults and also some of his books with covers for children She shook her head at me as if I was making this up and walked away as I was still talking to her pulling her little trolley along behind her Not so bad really She was very abrupt and had absolutely no manners but it didnt bother me that muchThen she came back It was a few weeks later she came in pulling her trolley along wearing a tshirt with the American flag on the front sunglasses on inside And again she approached me Wheres your American literature Im looking for writers like Jack LondonWe dont keep American authors separate theyre all in the fiction sectionIm looking for American authors like Steinbeck or Jack London What Jack London do you haveOh God I thought We went through it again I told her we only really have the childrens versions of White Fang and The Call of the Wild and that yes the publishers do this on purpose She shook her head dismissively She still didnt believe me I asked her which Jack London she was after She said she wanted The Iron Heel I looked it up and we didnt have it so I said We could order it in for you or I can check other shops and you could pick it upI am not going to other shopsOKI am looking for American Literature that is older I dont mind newer stuff but I prefer older like Steinbeck or SalingerSo I walked her over to the fiction section and said again We keep all the fiction together alphabetised by author How about Paul AusterNo Have you tried Don DeLilloI dont want thatJohn UpdikeI did that when I was a childAfter a few more sugeestions and a few more rejections I eventually said Well its really a matter of just looking through the section and seeing what we haveAnd she huffed and said  dismissively Yes yes Its really difficult it must be very difficult for you I knowSo I left her to it slightly exasperated and a bit fed upMy manager had come onto the shop floor in the meantime and I returned to the tills to have a little chat with him The woman approached again and I quietly said to him Oh no I dont want to speak with this ladyShe walked by the tills as if to leave and then stopped in front of usYou know she stated loudly Every time I come in here I am treated with disdain You speak to me as if I am stupid I know you are going to talk about me as soon as I leave DONT try to deny it You will I am sick of being spoken to in this way This is a bad shop and I wont be spoken to as if I am nothing She went on All the while we were both stood there me trying to say No we wont Or Im sorry you feel that way but being interrupted and my manager just looking on in shockFinally to finish me off she said You remember this I have written things I write things And you just work here You just work hereAnd off she went She got me this woman did I was very shaken My manager said he should have done something and he was sorry but he was so shocked that he couldnt react I had to go off the shop floor and take some deep breaths I did see her again a few weeks later but I scuttled upstairs and she left without speaking to anyone That is the story of the woman who I called my nemesis She managed to make me feel very small and I have no idea why  And yes If you are rude we will always talk about you after you leave We are human ,Its Difficult I know Or My Second Tale From Retail,81,talesFromRetail
mknow,9,15,1pm33a,46,Background I have worked retail in a variety of ways some more traditional than others I worked at a retail pharmacy over the summer but due to the short amount of time I dont have many stories However I also work in a less traditional setting selling memberships to a gym This particular gym also had a pool and I occasionally moonlighted teaching swim lessons to boost my hours a little bit This story is actual one of the more ridiculous because of the triviality This was while I was teaching a swim lesson but I also handled some of the retail portion since I knew how that worked as well THE STORY So this round of swim lessons I was teaching pretty advanced swimmers Our swimmers get colored bracelets denoting their swim ability so the guards know where they are allowed to go in the pool If you are a visitor ie just there for swim lessons you get a disposable one Members get a plastic one Ive got a girl who isnt a member but her mother keeps insisting she is I start to write her a slip to purchase a new bracelet but decide at the last minute to check her membership status If shes purchasing it doesnt lose us money but again I dont want to break rules and get in trouble I hand her the slip yes my mistake explain Im checking her status and then go to ask my boss While Im asking my boss Crazy Mom comes up to the retail counter gives them the slip that I havent signed yet mind you and purchases it behind my back She knew full well I was checking and making sure I could even sell it to her Its decided she is not allowed to purchase it Now Im stuck having to process a return for her I try to calmly explain to her that she shouldnt have purchased it already that it was decided she cant purchase it and that I have her money in cash she had paid with card for her in exchange for the bracelet back The following is what she said  there was not much for me to say because I never got the chance You know I have CULTURE I bring my daughter here because its nicer and because its a better quality All youve done is give me cash back for my card I could have gone to the bank for that You think I need you to give me cash back on my card Like Im some kind of poor person I dont need to do that here  I can use my card like a normal personYou know I have CULTURE Youre treating me like some redneck piece of crap You may be able to do that with some people around here but not me You cant treat me that way I mean what are YOU PEOPLE doing here Im high class You need to treat me like itAt this point Im fifteen minutes late for the start of my lesson Im tired of the BS and shes said she has culture like eight times I just referred her to my boss and started the lesson I eventually got to tell my boss what happened so if I got a weird complaint she would know what happened The fact that she snuck by me was the unbelievable part The whole thing was so trivial And the best which I found out after she was done ranting was that her daughter had a necklace from us the old way we used to do it and that we still used if members had them but mom didnt want her to have to feel different from the other kids ,I have CULTURE,61,talesFromRetail
FredFltStn,278,747,1pm32e,1674,BACKGROUND I own and operate my own retail store Its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before Its  square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax at midnight on the th of July and New Years EveSTORY  Welcome to the week of scam artists They rarely get away with it but that sure doesnt stop them from tryingEverything we sell is Buy  Get  Free BOGO We also send out mailers and have business cards that are good for Buy  Get  Free on any item up to  We also let you mix and match the items so you dont have to get three of the same things Im basically giving you an extra  in free fireworks just for showing up in the hopes that you purchase more than that and that you come back to see us every yearThe coupons have your typical legalese at the bottom Can only be used on one item cannot be reproduced one offer per day one offer per family our group only valid on items up to  etc I usually keep a stack of these coupons in my pocket and I hand them out pretty freely when the store is open I think its a great promotional tool and although it does impact my bottom line I wouldnt think of getting rid of itAs you can imagine we get our fair share of people trying to scam us with the couponSCAM   Theres a lady and her husband that show up at our tent at least four or five times each season with coupons Each time its the same routine Theyll spend an hour watching videos and carefully examining everything we sell When theyre ready to checkout the husband and wife will both approach the counter separately each carrying their three items and each with and a coupon They each pay for one item and get the other two for free If we ask them if there together which Ive done before for laughs they shake their heads and act like theyve never met even though they just spent the last hour shopping together The very next day theyll show up and do the exact same thing  Another hour of examining products pick out three walk to the counter separately use their coupon Even though they are technically scamming me I always let it go because frankly I think its funny as hellSCAM   Another regular customer Every season this guy comes in and picks out three of every item he intendeds to purchase When he gets to the counter he presents his coupon and we of course explained to him that he can only use it on one item Hell then spend  minutes arguing that I let him use it on everything he purchased the last time he was here In the end Ill let him use it on two items and he celebrates like hes won the lottery The thing is hes a regular and he buys a shitload of fireworks Id probably give him a better discount than the two uses of the card if we didnt have to go back and put up all the extra shit he picked out I seriously think he does it just to feel like hes gotten something over on us SCAM   A lady walks up to the counter with a fountain  and two massive assortments  in her cart I was standing behind the counter so I went to ring her up Before I could start she handed me a coupon and this conversation took placeLADY  Im just paying for the fountain Im going to use the coupon for the free itemsME  wondering WTF she is thinking Im sorry but the coupon is only good on items up to  and the free items have to be of equal or lesser valueLADY  It doesnt say that anywhere on the couponI look at the coupon and sure as hell shes rightbecause shes cut off the bottom third of the coupon that had all the legaleseME  Im sorry but this coupon has been altered It normally has all the details on the bottom handing her another coupon from my pocket so she can seeLADY  Thats not my problem My coupon doesnt say that so legally you have to honor my purchaseME  rudely because WTF really Yeah thats not going to happen I dont know what happened to your coupon sure I dont but its been altered and Im not obligated to take altered couponsThe lady is now full on yelling at me insisting that Im breaking the law and that she can sue me for not taking her coupon On this particular day thank god we actually had hired an off duty uniformed police officer to sit at the entrance to the tent acting as security We do that on our busier days because its a great deterrent for theft and it builds goodwill with the local police since they make great extra money for a really easy gig see herehttpredditnkw Besides they love my moms Cajun cookingThe lady stomps away from the counter and approaches the police officer to obviously raise hell about meBefore she can say anything the officer looks her in the eyes and says One moment maam the calls over to me loudly enough for everyone to hearOFFICER  Did you want me to arrest her or just throw her outME  Its up to you Youve got to fill out the paperworkShe left without another wordIf youre interested Ive posted a few other stories

quintz,8,15,1pleoj,60,Ive worked many haunted houses since  and one standing rule is No refunds No Exceptions which is usually written in large print behind the ticker seller So heres what happened last weekendIts about an half hour before opening and a lady arrives with a young girl maybe  yrs of age to go through the house At this time most of all of the actors are hanging out in front of the house in various stages of being in their costumes which is a little pet peeve of mine especially when there are customers there that can see them since this can take from the fear factor but all well since it can be a pain waiting in the house itself But this lady with the young girl waits patiently for the house to open obviously hesitant but excited to go through the houseIts the top of the hour the actors take their place and the house opens And I see the lady and the young girl go into the house the young girl again hesitant but willing to go through I joke to one of the other operators that the two girls wont make it through the house and we chuckle It didnt take  rooms and I see them being escorted out from one of the chicken exits by one of our floaters We all start to laugh a littleThis is when things get really interesting The lady immediately walks up to the ticket counter asking for a refund The ticket girl points to the no refund policy behind her and tells the lady that its not available The lady gets upset and continues to demand a refund At this point I step in and tell the lady we have a strict no refund policy which why its written in such large letters so everyone can see when they purchase their tickets The lady then argues that she deserves the refund since her and the young girl didnt even get through the first  rooms I tell her that she paid for us to scare her and apparently we did one hell of a great job at it and again we dont give refunds So then the lady argues that we shouldnt have sold a ticket to a young girl All I could say was Maam you purchased that ticket knowing how young your girl was you accepted any such risks in that purchaseFinally the lady and I came to an arrangement that I would give her two passes that she could use any time for the rest of the season which is this weekend She took the passes and left,One for the season,75,talesFromRetail

whatkindoffuckery,5,16,1pl8mo,46,So I was working at the Service Desk of a grocery store for awhile The store is right next to a not so nice neighborhood  We had a lot of crazies but one was just absolutely ridiculous  He had already been thrown out of the store on multiple occasions and wasnt actually supposed to be in the store but some managers just didnt give enough shits to throw him out So its absolutely packed in our store Im trying to manage the usual circus act of answering all the cashiers codes while simultaneously running the service desk Im in the office when I see a man come and place some items on the counter I finish up what Im doing and I go to help him but hes gone Yet all these items are still on the counter I ignore it and continue dealing with other customersAbout half an hour later he returns with the exact same items that are on the counter I ask him if hes doing a return and he says no He pulls a reciept out of his pocket and proclaims that our selfcheckout gave him this reciept today and he realized when he got home that his items werent on itI take a look at the reciept and its three days old and lists a cashier that isnt even at work that day Not to mention its tattered and torn and definitely not from an hour ago I explain this to him and he immediately starts going off Now I dont know what the fuck kind of machines youre running but it gave me this fucking reciept and I just want to pay for my shit I explain to him that if a reciept printed that he did indeed pay for it but this isnt the right reciept He continues on his tirade in front of the entire front end So I go to ring his items up just so hell leave and he then starts yelling because hes not paying for it twiceI am literally just standing in utter awe of this man as I soak in the smell of cheap beer and cigarettes  I call my manager over and explain to her whats going onShe attempts to please the man but to no avail because he doesnt want us to do a refund he doesnt want to pay for it he doesnt want the new product he just wants us to fix our effing machine He continued yelling incoherent things until she finally just got him to agree to a refundIm still amazed that she got him to leave the store without threatening to come back with his shotgun again TL DR Self checkout didnt print your three day old reciept lay off the booze,So what would you like me to do then,62,talesFromRetail
meowlife,8,11,1pl3x5,28,Hey TFR heres my storyI work for a small local privately owned boutique I worked in corporate retail for  years prior to landing this job and so far its been a cake walk with the exception of one thing My boss is a fucking nut case She seemed normal enough when I started Your typical the customer takes priority boss who stands over you while you clumsily ring up sales But now that Ive been here for well over  months it has come to my attention that this lady has some serious issues  She comes in on her days off and plants hides empty hangers in the racks then finds them and complains that we arent straightening the store often enough  In response to me telling her I wanted time off to go visit my grandfather and convince him to see a doctor because he had been showing signs of a stroke well if thats the case dont you think he deserves to have a stroke Im still not allowed to close the store because she still hasnt shown me how even though I have my store keys and my alarm code and shes actually shown me  different times as well as my other coworkers who dont understand why she still wont let me I can close out the register in my sleep  Because its a boutique there is only a small handful of girls working there One week several girls needed to go out of town and my boss was leaving to attend a fashion show and order more products This resulted in me  having to work  days straight which wasnt a big deal to me I need the money and it is a pretty chill job when she isnt around Then I got a cold There was no way I could stay home because of how shorthanded we were and one of my other coworkers was getting sick as well but we all managed to figure it out Then Boss Lady came back from her trip pissed because I came to work sick She accused me of being in denial of my illness and of getting my coworker sick When I told her that she was already sick because her kids had been sick the week before she rolled her eyes and said well thats the downside on deciding to have kids  She wants us to play our own music on days that she isnt in the store but only music that has been deemed appropriate for the demographic of women about mid thirties to ancient that shop in our store All the other stores I worked in before this were around the same demogaphic so I usually put on artists that I remember were on the CDs sent to us from Corporate at my old jobs   Today I came in and my coworker told me we had to make a list of appropriate music to be played in the store because she thinks we are playing rap and s stuff when shes not around because she stopped in once when we had Janelle Monae on  She does these weird impersonations of me Example One day I was late because the PGampE guy parked in our employee parking so I had to find another spot down the street I explained to her how he had not only taken my spot but ignored me and walked away when I told him he was in our employee parking Well whos going to take you seriously if you say it like and then she hunched over and stuck her neck out and used this weird gravely voice to say you took my spot Apparently she sees me as a hunchback with a smoker voice Her impression of me has become a common thing now when she comes in while Im working Ive made it pretty clear to her that I dont like it but she does it anywayPassive aggressively talks about me and my coworkers to customers as well as me and my coworkers Example One of my coworkers put in her  weeks because she was moving to LA For the next two weeks we all had to hear  unless another one of you decides to quit on me or  except now Im losing someone so who knows whats gonna happenThats all I can think of for now Aside from dealing with her weird shit the job itself is pretty laid back My coworkers are all nice and the customers are usually easy to help Weve got our share of quirky customer stories but nothing so far that tops my boss ,Fun amp Games in Boutiqueland aka my boss is crazy,39,talesFromRetail

crystall,112,90,1pk83x,446,I was reminded of this story of my time working at a certain international coffee shop chain by another post This was actually my comment to their post but I have been lurking here so long now commenting occasionally that I thought I would share this with you all Working the same shift in a downtown area of a city you see the same people at the same time every day You get to know what your regulars order this makes sense yes If we were slow and I saw a regular headed toward our doors I would start on their beverage so that by the time they paid it would be ready and waiting for them Most people appreciated this they had a limited amount of time on their breaks from their own jobs and this way they didnt have to stand around waitingwasting their break time Most people This one guy came in at pm EVERY DAY and ordered the same nonfat vanilla latte EVERY DAY I see him coming down the block there are no customers I have been cleaning up after the lunch rush I stop what I am doing and start making his drink so that just as my coworker handed him his change I came over and set the drink down on the counter in front of him saying heres your nonfat vanilla latte sir He looked at it like I had just scooted a turd across the counter at him gave me a death look and said what is this I repeated what I said maintaining eye contact When did you make this he asked incredulously Just now I stated I saw you coming down the block and started on it for you I smiled he was still giving me the death look He picks up the cup sniffs it glares at me and walks out Later on that day my manager comes downstairs and tells me that Mr nonfat vanilla latte had complained that I had his drink ready for him as soon as he finished paying he also contacted our corporate office to complain about my efficiency as well Nothing ever came of it But every afternoon after that at pm I would wait patiently until he ordered until he paid then I would painstakingly make his drink taking as much time as possible and hand it off to him with a smile Some people just dont appreciate it when people try to do nice things for them,Your Efficiency Offends my Delicate Sensibilities,536,talesFromRetail

vaime,63,38,1picxh,133,I work as a promotional model in a duty free store at an international airport Its our job to give out samples educate customers on our product and generally help the retail staff with sales Being an international airport in a main city we occasionally get some celebrities coming through The staff at our store are allowed to ask for photos andor autographs as long as they are polite and professional whilst doing so As all the staff I work with are amazing theres never been an issue with this so its common practiceWere a small country and most of the celebrities that come through are local TV celebs or sports heros  people who are more than happy to stop for a photo and an autograph Occasionally big shot international celebrities come through most dont bother stopping at duty free and are ushered on past by their security but the occasional few who stop to browse are usually happy to indulge a few staff in a photoMyself and another employee were watching one afternoon as a couple of staff got photos with a local sports star I mentioned how fun it was seeing these kind of people come through and it sparked a conversation on some of the international celebrities who have been through Most had stories of how nice soandso was etc Our floor manager had a very different story She was working with staff from a different shift one evening when a very VERY famous young male popstar entered the store The store was quiet as he was very early for his flight and there werent many other flights at that time Due to his fame a few of the younger staff were understandably quite excited He was looking around at the products and one of the younger staff asked if she could help When he informed her that he was just browsing she shyly asked if she would be able to have a photo with himHe immediately picked a bottle of vodka up off the shelf and held it up Do I get this for free if I take a picture with youThe poor girl was speechless and he kept asking things like I should at least be given a discount you know  seeing as Im helping you out here Its only fair that you give me  off in exchange for a photo Im doing you a service  you should do me one tooThe poor girl tried to explain that she wasnt able to give out discounts and even if she could due to alcohol laws she wasnt able to give out discounts on the alcohol even vouchers and coupons cant be used on liquor in our store The girl was near tears stuttering and trying to explain but the celeb just kept getting more and more heated raising his voice to a borderline yell telling her that she was stupid and asking her why someone like him should even consider doing anything for a shopgirl when she refused to even give him a small discount The floor manager overheard this and immediately took over the situation sending the employee to the back room to recover and explaining politely but firmly that the employee had no authority to give discounts on any product She apologised that he clearly didnt want to take a photo and politely let him know that he was well within his rights to decline  she bit her tounge and avoided telling him that he could have just said No despite badly wanting to He basically turned around to the manager puffed out his chest and told her she was damn right she was sorry informed her he was too important to be bothered by staff and should get a discount anyway because didnt she know who he wasThe manager a badass middleaged eastern european woman who had probably never listened to pop in her life looked him in the eye and let him know that no she had no idea who he was and she was sorry but they didnt give discounts on alcohol no matter WHO was asking for it but if there was something in particular that he was looking for she was more than happy to help him personallyThis clearly tipped the celeb over the edge who snorted swore at the manager and stormed off Throughout all of this his handlers were standing a few feet away  looking sheepish but not doing anything The manager said she felt most sorry for these guys who from the look on their faces saw this kind of behaviour all the time but didnt dare say a word Apparently the popstar sent one of them back to the store around half an hour later to pick up a list of stuff he wanted  the poor guy couldnt even look the manager in the face while she was ringing up the items particularly because the young employee had only just come out of the back room and was being consoled by some of the other staffThe whole experience really pissed off our manager shed never heard of this guy before and to hear her hate on him was kind of hilarious mainly because she couldnt believe a multimillionare would be so cheap and tacky enough to demand discounts  and worse still to bully a young employee to the point of tears This guy had been that employees hero and meeting him was practically a dream come true so she was incredibly torn up about the whole situation Our manager whilst being a terrifying woman is also staunchly loyal to the family who work there and hated seeing one of her girls so cut up by that doucheI really hope next time he comes here for a concert our badass floor manager is working  he certainly wont be getting any special treatment from her,Turns out bigshot celebrities are just as bad if not worse than averagejoe

Ayverie,78,24,1pi69x,70,Mini background Ive been working at a major grocerystore chain in Canada for the past  years Ive done various departments from the clothing dept to cash and to stocking fresh produce Onto Jesus LadyFirstly I apologize for the upcoming wall of text Jesus Lady requires some description and detail in order to get the image of this woman across So every month either at the beginning or end depending on when her welfaredisabilitypensionunemployment cheques come in this woman would come grocery shopping sometimes alone sometimes with her husband the poor man Now we get a lot of people at around these times due to the aforementioned cheques Normally she wouldnt really stand out but she didnt get the name Jesus Lady for nothing Jesus Lady was this slightly frail unkempt older woman who occasionally walked with a cane She would often berate cashiers and stay at the cash well after her order was purchased bagged and put into the car by her husbandchildren The reason she stayed behind was to try to convert the cashiers to Christianity Normally if it were a brief chat we would be able to push it aside but she would remain behind for at least an HOUR blocking up aisles for cashes and distracting cashiers from their work If they didnt respond well she would often become angry and aggressive in her tactics so more often than not the cash manager would kick her out after so much time So long story short we called her Jesus Lady because we didnt know her name and she spent an insane amount of time trying to convert us Onto my experience with Jesus LadyAt this time I was working in the bakery section It was Halloween so a lot of staff were dressed up One coworker Ill call him Duro was dressed up as a manager and I was wearing a Little Red Riding Hood costume these are a bit important In the middle of our night all of a sudden I and a few others notice that Duro had suddenly been captured by Jesus Lady She was in the middle of her usual spiel trying to convert him telling him to praise the lord and all that jazz sorry if that offended anyone So the others and I devised a plan to get Duro free from her clutches We called a manager to the back of the store and I hurried over pretending that we needed him for an emergency Worked like a charmUntil Jesus Lady commented on my costume Said it was cute I thanked her I go to move away but she kept talking about random little things Now I was raised not to leave midconversation and Ive always been a bit too nice At this point it didnt work out well for meEventually she began angrily talking about a Muslim cab driver she had had the horror of meeting She said that while he drove he attempted to convert her to Islam and he kept referring to the Qran Honestly at this point I dont care Until she asked me what my name meant Me Well its a Hebrew name but Im not JewishJL So youre ChristianMe Uhno Im actually far from Christian Its just really not for me I wont get angry if someone else is Christian its their choice and if I can respect their choices I expect them to respect mine Jesus Lady however decided that this wasnt right She began to perform her spiel attempting to convert me She ended her sentence with You ARE ChristianMe No Im notJL Yes you are You are Christian at heartMe Maam Im really not Christian at all At this point I was getting frustrated She kept trying to push me to convert to her beliefs and it was particularly annoying since she had been complaining about her Muslim cab driver Hypocritical muchEventually I manage to pry myself away from her and hide for a period of time in the back of the store Duro was back there laughing his ass off at me and I hit him jokingly We hid there for about an hour doing work and when we looked through the plastic windows on the doors separating the backstore from the front of store we noticed that Jesus Lady was patiently standing there by the door with her cart Apparently shed been standing there the entire time waiting for us to come out It was like some strange horror scene when the bad guy is an overly excited Christian missionary We hid there for even longer and eventually she seemed to get tired and just left This was the first time she had actually waited for someone to reappear for her From that point onward Duro and I were very cautious at the beginningend of the month and always had coworkers looking for Jesus Lady for us I would have gone into more detail of what Jesus Lady said but it was a few years ago and I didnt really listen to most of what she said after the first minute The You are Christian bit really stuck with me though because she was just making these assumptions without any fact Fortunately we havent seen Jesus Lady anytime soon Im not sure why maybe she switched supermarkets maybe they moved or maybe Im just never there when shes there But not seeing her has created this collective sigh of relief amongst all of the longtime employees Now I just want to point out that Im not against Christianity and I did not come up with the name for her Im very respectful of others beliefs and I expect others to respect my own Im very tolerant until someone tries to convert me or my friends without regard towards our personal beliefs And Jesus Lady really liked to push our buttons Anyway thats just one fantastic tale about Jesus Lady Let me know if you ever want me to collect some more and share them ,A Fantastic Tale about Jesus Lady,94,talesFromRetail

program to get them up to the standard of excellence expected from each technician During this time they are referred to as junior stylistscolorist The juniors are able to take appointments during this time but the prices are about half of what the least expensive full price haircutcolor would cost with a full priced technician The salon operates on a level system meaning the longer a tech has worked there generally the more expensive their prices to reflect their skill level The salon is also departmentalized so stylists only cut hair and colorist only colorSo seeing a junior for a service is a great deal You get high quality work done for half or more than half the price of full priced services most juniors have worked in other salons so they have experience and they are also supervised by a mentor who checks their work before the juniors guest leaves Also anytime a new guest comes in they receive a thank you packet of coupons for being new to the salon and to give them and incentive to come back These coupons do not apply to junior services as they are already heavily discounted although it does not expressly state that in the fine print on the coupons people frequently give us a hard time about this Story When I had just finished training and was working my first closing shift alone I get a phone call literally  mins before we close pm I pick up with my normal pleasant greeting get no greeting in return just a yeah I want to see a junior colorist I asked what kind of color service she needed to get done and told her the days the junior worked That was the first problem the days the junior worked werent good for her schedule or someone had already booked an appointment at the time she wanted Im doing everything I can to make this work somehow but she is getting more and more frustrated with me She then tells me she wants to book a time  mins before close not a time I offered as available I calmly try to explain that we do not book color appointments that close to closing time because it will take  mins to apply the color and another mins to an hour for it to process By the time she would be shampooed and blow dried that would be about an hour and half past close and we simply do not book color appointments that wayThis is when she lost her damn mind She starts yelling at me saying So you just kick people out the door as soon as you close This is ridiculous Im trying to come in and give you my money Ive been on the phone with you for  mins it had been  or mins max and you cant seem to work the computer I once again calmly tried to explain that no we do not kick people out as soon as we close but we do book color appointments in a way that allows for them to end before or right as we are closing She then proceeds to go on a huge rant about how shell have to miss her grandsons baseball game and hell be so upset and blah blah blah All Im thinking is I dont care please just give me your name so I can book this appointment and go homeShe finally gave me her name I put her down for an appointment that would allow her to leave halfway through her grandsons game and before getting off the phone she says oh wait I have one of those new guest coupons My heart sinks because I know exactly which coupon shes talking about and I was also fairly certain it would not apply to a junior service The coupon is for  off color which would make the  service she wanted  a service that at its cheapest full price is  I tell her that I am pretty sure the coupon would not apply as the junior services are already heavily discounted and she starts to read me the fine print on the coupon in a snarky voice saying it says nothing about junior technicians My voice starts to shake as I once again try to explain that I am almost positive the coupon will not apply and she loses it again this time attacking my personally saying I am the worst customer service person she has ever had to deal with she cant afford it she cant use the coupon she is gonna have to miss her grandsons baseball blah blah you suck blah blah When she finally stops I tell her I will have my manager contact her in the morning She tells me one more time how incompetent I am and hangs upI called my manager immediately on the verge of tears and still semi shocked at what just happened I had worked customer service before but never had someone treat me that poorly My manager is able to calm me down tells me I didnt do anything wrong and that I was absolutely right this crazy woman cannot use the coupon for a junior service I will never understand why people think it is ok to be so rude to customer service employees Edit Sorry Im such a noob at this Hopefully this formatting is better and I tried to cut some of the fat from the storyTLDR Woman wanted to use coupon on an already heavily discounted service and called me the worst customer service person she has ever had to deal with,What do you mean I cant double

jumpityjump,6,7,1ph4e2,49,Ive been addicted to reading TFR for a week now and can relate to so many of the stories here so I thought it was time to add my ownBackground I work on the cellar door at a very busy winery in a popular wine region Basically my job involves talking people through our wines pouring wines selling as much wine as possible and ensuring customers have the best possible experience We get all sorts of interesting customers and no shift is without its storyI had only been working there a couple of weeks when this first story occurred We had just swapped over vintages with our red wines from  to  and hadnt had a chance to update the tasting notes yet so the vintage on the notes was not what we were tasting We were all careful to make customers aware of this and make it clear what they were tasting and no one had a problem until the Grumpy Old Man GOM came along It was the end of a very busy day when GOM and his wife came up for a tasting I gave them my usual chirpy greeting and asked what they would like to taste I always try to make conversation with customers and build a rapport but all I got from this man was huffing and grunting and displeased looks In my distraction with the busy bar I forgot to tell him about the change in vintages though it was clearly marked on the bottle in front of him At the end GOM decided that he like the Shiraz and wanted to buy a bottle of the  at which point I had to explain that the one he tasted was actually  and did he still want to buy the now more expensive  or the one he tried Next thing I knew I had a tantrum on my hands He was screaming about false advertising how incompetent I was how he wanted to buy what he tried but he wanted it to have been the older vintage and he didnt want the younger one actually I dont think he knew what he wanted I had no idea how to deal with this  and his poor wife obviously took pity on me as I tried to come up with a solution to keep him happy and she tried to make conversation while her husband fumed She asked me So dear which wine is your favourite here To which her husband snapped SHE WOULDNT KNOW THAT and stormed off to the car Apparently being a young new cellar door assistant means I had no idea what I personally liked to drink His wife bought a bottle of something and hurried off after him apologising profusely ,How would she know what she likes tales from a winery,56,talesFromRetail

C,19,29,1pgqj8,116,Hi there TFR Im never really sure where to post my stories as I work in retail Box Office but I also work at the front desk So Ill post this here first and if people think that it would work in rtalesfromthefrontdesk as well I might pop it on there alsoAs you can see from my previous post here months ago I work in a busy multivenue theatre in the UK With three venues multiple shows on a night in each so it can get quite manic Especially when you have  sold out shows exiting at the same time and you still have customers trying to collect tickets for the later shows And they all have to go through the foyer Thats what was happening at this moment in time It was a Saturday night I was two thirds through a  hour shift We had two sold out venues exiting one from the basement and one from the main house  both around  people so nearly  in total And countless people trying to collect at the box office for out shows later that nightA family of four came up from downstairs as far as I could tell they were an elderly couple grandparents their middleaged daughter and her adult son They decided to stand right in front of me I could see there were people trying to get through to the Box Office but these ignorant oblivious people just stood there talking about how quaint the theatre was and how exciting it was to be offWest EndThe son was finishing off a glass of wine so I thought they would be going back into our bar When they didnt move I stood up and as nicely as I could muster asked them to either make their way outside or into the bar so that the foyer which is a fire exit can be kept clear and people can get to the box office The middleaged woman just looked at me with such contempt and venom that such a lowlevel servant had dared spoken to them She then spat out Were leaving in a secondI replied with a Thank you very muchThe son then finished off the last dreggs of his wine and placed the large glass right bang in front of meNow as I said I work at the box office Not the bar The bar is less than  feet from the box office Now it was busy as it was a Saturday night but there were tables right by the entrance that someone could leave down a glass if they so wanted to without going into the actual bar Another thing to note is that there is a small bar in our downstairs venue They are both run and staffed by the same company When he put the glass down I looked up at him and said Im sorry sir but you cannot leave that here if you could kindly bring into the bar I would really appreciate it as we cant deal with glass hereThe grandfather replied incredulously We were ushered out of downstairs and didnt have time to bring it to the bar down thereMEI apologise if you were moved out quickly but we do have another show down there in half an hour and we need the turn around time This glass can be brought into out main bar just behind youThe son then went to pick up the glass cue shocked gasps and I thanked him Thinking that that is one less THING I have to deal with tonightBUT Just as he picked it up his mother  this guys own mother  took the glass out of his hand and placed it defiantly back down all the while staring straight at me I tried to say something but words would not come I sat there speechless until they started to move out Both me and my colleague who had witnessed the whole thing started to actually shout after them Excuse me SIR Your glassBut he just turned around and gave the biggest shit eating grin I have ever seen It just said I am better than you and I know itI was angry the rest of the night that I had to go onto raww to calm myself downTLDR Selfentitled middleclass family decide that treating people like something they scraped off their shoe is a better example to their children then showing some respectgt,Excuse me SIR,145,talesFromRetail

RattsWoman,9,22,1pfxxn,86,Ah the age old argument of retail the argument of whether or not the cashier gave the customer their change Now folks Ive had my fair share of trying ordeals with customers from being a victim of racism to being indirectly blamed for moldy raspberries but last nights events takes the cake so far anywayIll put the tldr up here because this is probably the lengthiest recount of events Ive ever hadTiny old lady angrily and violently accuses me of stealing her change ends up being accused of stealing her own groceriesIm at my register putting through a customers order when I see a customer that I had just had maybe  minutes prior Shes tiny feeblelooking in her oversized parka and winter hat and looks to be no younger than  years old The items she placed on the belt were the exact same items she brought through earlier Im thinking Maybe she forgot that she bought these items already so when its her turn I smile and ask Didja forget something She immediately responds in anger with Yes You didnt give me my change I bought      items slams each item on the belt as she counts  and you asked me for a nickel her total was  and I gave it to you along with twenty dollars to pay for this and you never gave me the receipt OR my changeI calmly inform that I did indeed give her her  change and she must have misplaced it to which she angrily continues No you didnt Im not stupid I went to the bank and got twenties in my wallet and after I came through here I have one less twenty and no change This is when the next customer in line begins defending me coolly saying Maam youre not going to get what you want if you keep behaving this way and the old lady replies to her You shut your mouth and mind your own business I even ask the old lady if shes implying that Im stupid enough to not give her her change The defending customer keeps trying to calm the lady down and attempting to make her see reason which is when this tiny little old lady yells at her in her tiny old lady voice You dont shut up Ill punch you in the mouth You bitch Mind your own business She didnt give me my money and youre being a bitch thats what you are At this point I almost died because it was too hilarious but also kinda scary that I was even in this situationOld lady demands to speak to my manager about me so I told her to go ahead Ill call him for her if shed like meanwhile Im very shaky and upset by this whole ordeal She shuffles away to the service desk to complain some more and my lane is shut down after helping my last very helpful customer in order for my tray to be audited I was perfect My superiors printed out the receipt to show the lady and I resume working From this point on Im not  sure of what happened because I was working and not involved with the actions taken afterward I assume the old lady didnt believe the printout so they got the acting manager to review security camera footage This lead to a comedy of errors Acting Manager only reviewed the tape up to the most recent time the old lady was in my line This footage showed her placing her items on the belt then placing them back in her buggy and walking away after some time making it look like I let her get away with stealing so now I was in trouble and that no actual transaction had taken place As you can guess little old lady was now accused of attempting to steal her  worth of groceries I can only imagine how frustrated and infuriated she became and acting manager had had enough at that point told her Maam theres nothing more I can do You tried to steal these items and no transaction took place between you and the cashier If you want to call the police then by all means go ahead but there is nothing I can do now I didnt see when she left but when I went on my break I was told that she was caught stealing I became confused and then realized that they didnt look far enough back in the tape so I informed them of this Of course it showed me handing the lady her  change and her receipt all in one hand so alls well that ends well We all had a good laugh about this lady accusing me of stealing her money and ends up being accused of stealing her own groceries However I was so rattled by this whole thing that I clocked out half an hour early by accident only to be stopped by a supervisor asking me uhhh where do you think youre going I have you for another half an hour I laughcry and clock back in The relief I felt when it was actually the end of my shift was indescribable and Im glad Im not back in until end of this week,You dont shut up Ill punch you in the mouth   year old tiny lady,108,talesFromRetail

LameCake,6,4,1peha3,42,I work at a childrens entertainment facility that allows people to have birthday parties and a private room for a pretty low price My party for the day had shown up and according to the books they were expecting about  children The birthday boys were twins this is relevant The mom shows up with her twin boys and a few other guests I show them back to their room the biggest one and the mom exclaims that its a very big room I ask how many more people she is expecting and she tells me about  more So oh well not the  people we were expecting and I have a big room to clean afterwards no biggie I get the drinks out and Im conversing with the guests when the mom asks if its  guests that shes paying for and the two birthday boys and two parents that are free this is to participate in the games At our company the birthday children are included in the  guests for the base price and each person after that is   I explain this to her and she says the person who booked her party told her differently I tell her that it has always been the the birthday children are included in the  guests and it could have been a misunderstanding I say this all in my nice hostess voice and she says okay and I head to the front to great any more party guests The mom comes up after some time with a guy who I assume is the dad She asks for my coworker who happened to be in the party room stocking plates and cups when my conversation with the mom took place He goes out there and the dad tells him that they were told that the birthday boys would be free and that they werent told that they would have to pay for them too All the while the dad is exclaiming that this is bull shit but not a big dealwtf and that they just want to get back to enjoying their party If its not a big deal then why is he making a big deal I understand wanting to clear it up but he came on kind of aggressive in very hushed tones and a big ground standing this is what we were told attitude I knew I was doomed right then no tip for me My coworker directs them to our manager and he tells them the same thing but will call the person who booked the party whom is the ownerNow lately there have been some mistakes on cake orders made by him as well as names of parties but I dont think he would actually tell a person that the birthday kids are free as this has NEVER been policy He usually explains in great lengths what is to be expected in what they are paying forThe owner says no this is not what he told them and even explained that it would be the two boys and six guests for the base price and  each person after He caves a little and says instead of having to pay for two birthday children to just combine it to one Great now we are at  Since I am still confused as to how many people are showing up and the first game is about to go in with still only  guests I go back and ask the mom how many people in total again She say  Since this greatly affects how many pizzas I make I make four pizzas With  guests I should only make  Guess what no one else shows upThe manager tries to tell the mom whats going to happen now but she doesnt want to hear it and to just tell the dad I end up telling the dad after I serve everyone pizza that instead of having to pay for two children the well just combine it to one He shakes his head and says whatever a couple of times in a  dont want to hear it demeanor Okaaaayyyyy Im sorry that your expectations were miscommunicated but this is how it works In any case you HAVE to pay for a minimum  guests so even if the owner decided to say dont charge for the birthday boys they would have paid the same exact price because it would have been  guests The rest of the party goes without a hitch and the children were actually some of the best children Ive had Paying for the bill time comes and no tip TLDR Expecting to pay for  guests wants birthday children to be free only  guests show up,Dont Shoot the Messenger,46,talesFromRetail
BigMacisBP,46,15,1pegr1,74,TFR I need your input on something I may or may not have been that asshole customer this past weekend and I need some input on what happenedSaturday I was sent out with list of honeydos while my hubby was at work One of them was to pick up a few items corn syrup food coloring and some sparkling cider because srsly sparkling ciderfrom the store for a zombie crawl that we were going to that night I managed to find a lane that was not too terribly overwhelmed with people maybe three or four parties each group with less than  items a piece In my wait I noticed two managers standing a bit away from me in womens softlines Both of them were quite literally leaning on a rack of clothes shooting the breeze Now I happened to work for this particular company in the past and currently being a manager at my current company I found it annoying to see the two of them doing effectively nothing but wasting oxygen I put it out of my mind until I was second in line approximately three to five minutes later when the cashier says to the party in front of me that they would need to pay with a card as she did not have cash in her drawer to make change I asked her if she in fact had said that she had no cash in her drawer and that she was only able to accept cards to which she confirmed Now my first thought was I admit why the hell didnt she say anything sooner or have a sign up but I took stock of the lanes and realized that the store actually had more lanes open than was normal and all of them were at least  people deep so I backed off and gave the cashier credit for moving people along as fast as she could However as I turned my sights fell to the two managers who were still shooting the breeze And I kinda slipped off my rocker a little bit I walked up to the two of them and in my most pleasant voice simply saidExcuse me while the two of you are standing here holding this rack of clothes down and making sure it doesnt float away your cashier over on  has no cash in here drawer and the department you are standing in needs help with its zoningI turned on my heel and walked away To which they hollered after meThanks sir well take care of itI walked to the end of the store to find another register Another  minutes later I am walking out and low and behold the two of them are still standing there ensuring that the laws of gravity over that one rack of clothes didnt suddenly cease to exist So TFR was I out of line for calling the managers out like that And for those who would interject that I didnt know what they were talking about I know what shooting the breeze looks like and these two were armed with bazookastldr  attacked by giant glittersneezing pandas while at cancan practice for Macys Day Parade,TFR was I out of line,89,talesFromRetail

ChiefMishka,5,7,1pd8f9,25,A department store is the locale for the story Ive been working at this store for a year this coming black friday my second day was black friday last year but enough about me This is about a coworker whose name shall simply be UE for Useless EmployeeUE is the type of worker you see come through in all lines of work Tries really hard to make it look like he is contributing but really doesnt do that much and every night you close with them you consider yourself a person down This one however seems to exhibit not a single working brain cell So aside from the usual things this type of worker might do in any job to make it look like they are working hard I thought I might list some of the special cases that have arisen during the few months I have worked with this personUE takes a call from a person who is asking if we carry suits While we dont sell sets we do have all the individual items suit jackets suit pants dress shirts ties dress socks dress shoes etc UE however jumps to the conclusion that the customer is only interested in a package that contains everything the customer might need and proceeds to tell the customer no we dont have suitsUE is on a register Personally I would rather have UE there than on the floor because he is slow and always misses stacks of clothes that need to be folded so one of us usually has to come along after UE is done and double check everything UE got a customer one day who wanted to return a suitcase Customer had the receipt so there wasnt a big problem with that Our return policy is that we can return it to the method of payment made If the customer paid with a credit card we return it to that card gift card goes back to a gift card cash or check or debit card is given as cash The customer made the purchase with credit card and UE gave him cash for the return which was a hundred or so dollars Mistake number one Mistake number two came when the customer then comes back to UE with a new suitcase trying to get a new suitcase but the customer wanted to exchange the suitcase they just returned for the suitcase they picked out So UE is having difficulty completing an exchange for the suitcase because the system shows that the suitcase being exchanged was already returned  minutes earlier by UEWe have a store credit card that we are constantly told to ask customers if they would like to sign up for We require photo ID to enter the customers information into our system and verify they are who they say they are I have heard UE asking the customer for this information out loud and wondered why when he could just read it off the ID I only recently learned that he has been known to not get an ID and just ask for all the informationHeres the story that prompted me to write this post Im working at the register but with no one in line I am just folding and separating returns as we were closing in an hour or so Both UE and another coworker well call him Ryan were cleaning the floor and talking about  feet away from myself It was far enough that I couldnt hear exactly what they were discussing but as a customer and her child younger than  walked by I did hear thisRyan I apologize for UE MaamCustomer Oh dont worry I hear far worse from my kidsThe customer and her child walk casually towards the doors and I wish them a good evening UE goes off to do something unproductive and Ryan comes over and asks me if I heard what UE had said I hadnt and he was relieved because he wanted to know if anyone else outside of those  feet had heard it UE had in their discussion pointed to his show and said This fucking thing loud enough that the customer had heard This saint of a woman however simply shrugged it off and was not bothered by it one bit UE had gotten very lucky that is wasnt one of the other thousands of customers that would have immediately asked for UEs name and a manager or that it was a manager who walked past,A Useless Coworker,32,talesFromRetail

SpeedMetalPunker,24,35,1p9wvz,99,Hey you all might remember me from my ranting about my old gas station job Well Ive been gone from there for about a week or so now It feels amazing The company I worked for didnt care at all about its employees and I had decided enough is enough Here are my reasons as follows  Whenever I would close at night I was alone most nights which is really dodgy considering I could have been robbed so easily The only reason they didnt put  people on most nights was because its not a law here yet  They didnt want you to sit at all during work which is ridiculous  because if youre on your feet  hours a day considering it gets very tiring on your feet Now I wouldnt be saying this otherwise but as the next  things Im about to tell you would change your mind You didnt ever get a break from this job when you worked Which was illegal as all hell but the company didnt care and the final thing there were no ergonomic mats to stand on because they were a slipping hazard I wish I was making that up once again illegal Its a labor board law that if youre standing in  place for a period of time that has to be there I even offered to bring  in so work was more comfortable for everyone working there and my idea got shot down And the fuckers justify this by saying you wont be standing there for  hours straight If youre not serving customers you have a rag and youre cleaning the store this is seriously bullshit because youre on your feet still And those mats are antislip mats to begin withAll in all Ive quit that job and Im glad I did Im never working at another gas station again,I saw a I just quit my job post and would like to share my own story,134,talesFromRetail

Challymo,3,8,1p77zy,25,To set the scene I used to work in a department store in the uk that likes to count itself as upmarket the clothing generally was good quality but most of the foodstuffs was made in the same place and in the same way as the standard supermarkets  As I cant remember any long stories that I dealt with I will go over some shorter ones and some fun memories   The Awesome Store Manager  For most of my tenure at this store I worked in the operations department ie Stockroom this meant that I ended being a keyholder and would often lock up at night At the time we were very shortstaffed so the evenings where there was supposed to be  of us until close ended up being just  of us because of this we very often would end up behind during the day which meant alot of the tasks needed to be done before evening stocking would not get finished in time Now the scene setting is done on to the incident and resultAbout pm foods manager comes down in to the stockroom to request some extra stuff be pulled for the overstaffed team upstairs to get working on at the time I was rather stressed and had a list of things to get done as long as my arm so I politely told him to get lost at which point he started to berate me about not doing my job and that he was going to call the store manager being fed up I told him to go ahead and see what happensI carry on with my list of tasks for half an hour with nothing more said about the extra stock needed until all of a sudden one of the floor staff from upstairs comes into the stock room asking where to find a list of items the same one the manager wanted It was the next day I found out that when the manager had called the store manager she had told him that I was on my own and had enough to do without more being added on and to get one of his staff to do it or do it himself The bananas  Around christmas the store would be heaving all the time as most of you probably know as such you would end up with people wandering in to the other departments to purchase there food this was never a problem except for loose produce as the scales for weighing them and pricing them were only in the foods area Anyway arsehole customer AC comes up to homewares counter with a bunch of loose bananas and heads straight to pleasant cashiers PC tillAC    doesnt say a word just plonks bananas on counter  PC  Oh im sorry sir we dont have any scales in this department so im afraid you will need to take these through to the food hall  AC  This is fucking ridiculous picks bananas up and throws them at PC then just walks out the store The tongue  Before I worked in operations I worked on the shop floor in foods but would often pop in to the stock room to catch up with a friend of mine J or to grab stuff that needed restocking So one day customer asks me to see if we have more of something in the stockroom so I head off to see if we do and as I walk into the stockroom to see the operations team leader OTL holding the accident book and J stood talking to him as I walk in I start listening to the conversationOTL  So J can you explain to me how you got your tongue stuck to the racking in the freezer Just to not OTL is desperately trying to hide his laughter  J  sounding like he has his mouth full Im sorry I was concentrating on what I was doing and when I concentrate I stick my tongue out  OTL and other operations staff burst out laughing at this pointEdit  Readability,A few memories from my days in retail,33,talesFromRetail

gehjl,19,54,1p4szv,245,I saw the story about someone not believing they were the manager because theyre a girl  Well being a girl isnt the only thing thatll make them not believe youre a managerA bit of backstory Ive posted a story here before and it was from the same location  I worked in a cash advance booth inside a casino we dealt with getting people money off their debitcredit cards or cashed checks but we werent employed by the casino  We were a rd party company working inside  We had our own set of policies I worked there for a bit over a year till I was promoted to manager and was around  at the time  But I look a lot younger than my age probably We had  locations inside the casino the big main one and a small booth inside the High Roller section  Didnt need anything special to get in the high roller section just all the machines were a lot more expensive  That booth is manned by  or  people depending on the day amp time  So I get a call from the employee saying theres a guy there asking to talk to a manager  I start walking over there and when I get there the disbelieving customer DC comes up to me and goesDC Are you the managerMe Yes how can I help youDC Youre not the manager youre too young to be the manager  There must be someone else  Get me someone elseMe Well I am the manager and Im the only manager on shift right now  If you want you can wait for the general supervisor shell be in at am  It was around am at the momentDC This is unbelievable theres gotta be someone else that can help meI wasnt aware of it but there was another person normal customer NC that asked to see the manager while I was walking in between boothsNC interrupts DC Well you can help me if he doesnt want itMe Sure whats the problemTurns out he used the ATM and if you dont select the right choice or you go over your daily cash withdrawal limit itll process the transaction as a Point of Sale allowing you to go over your withdrawal limit with a higher fee  Of course theres notices that come up before it does that but I mean what kind of people actually read the ATMs notices right  Well if it does that it sends you to the cashiers us to get your money and well need your card and ID  Turns out his ID was expired by a few weeks and technically we arent allowed to process the transaction  He wasnt an asshole explained the situation was nice so I made the call to process the transaction for him  Us voiding the transaction would put his money in processing for  days so I try to help out nice people with minor issues  Had his ID been expired for monthsyears Ive seen those I wouldnt have processed it  Either way I told the cashier to put the expiration date as today and well process this one as a courtesy I tell him what happens if we void it and if he comes back again we wont be able to help him out  Ive had that happen as well processed one out of courtesy and they come back saying Well they did it for me an hour ago just do it again now  Its great seeing their faces when they ask for the manager and they see its me again  I void the transaction and send em on their wayI start walking back to the main booth when DC starts calling after meDC  Wait wait  Maybe you can help meHe explains the situation to me  He used the ATMs and had to see us to get his cash but he didnt have is ID on him  Again technically we wouldnt be able to process the transaction for people in this circumstance but I knew who he was came in here often and was a VIP for the casino  Ultimately I had the choice to help him out or not  I knew the casino has copies of VIP IDs in their system so I went over to them and asked if I can get a copy of his ID  They printed a copy of his ID for us I gave it to the cashier in our booth and told him to use this for tonight  I explained to DC that well use that for tonight but this is a courtesy and we wont do it again next time  He thanks me and heads off to throwing his money away in slot machinesGreat way to start my shift that dayOn a side note I truly hate entitled VIPs  Any slight inconvenience and theyd start making a scene getting their casino host and sometimes even the floor manager to come and try to solve their issue  Since we didnt work for the casino that meant diddly squat to us  No greater pleasure then telling someone no after all that ruckus and watching their host explain to them that we dont work for the casino and they have no controlWriting this story reminded me of another one where a guy swore Id be fired by the next morning  Ill post that one in a few days  There was good justice at the end of that one,Youre not the manager Youre too young,299,talesFromRetail

iwrotedabible,11,17,1p3vy4,77,Several years ago I was working at an upscale grocery store in the delifood service department  When I say upscale I mean it is a very expensive store in an extremely wealthy neighborhood  It was that special time late at night near closing when single guys and weirdos do their shopping and of course we had more customers than employees  Never underestimate the late night weirdosMy coworkers and I are all busy completing orders slicing meats and cheeses boxing entrees etc About  ft down the counter from where we are there was a steam tray with hoot foods ready to go self serve  All that should have been put away for the night by this point but its too busy to send anyone over there  I notice theres a guy down there staring at us  I shout need any helpTURKEYI replied All out until tomorrow Sorry  We had been out of roasted carving turkey for several hours and had turned away a few people alreadyI go back to slicing my customers order  While weighing one item I notice the hot food guy is standing right at the case and glaring  This is also when I notice that this guy is gigantic at least  and massive in gut shoulders and arms  Hes rocking a huge beard and a fanny pack too  This is right when Epic Beard Man was a thing so that was a fun coincidence  From here on out he will be huge beard fanny pack or HBFPNoticing he looks unhappy I offer him a piece of sliced cold cut turkey that I have on the machine  Samples usually soothe the savage consumer and this is standard operating procedure for us employees our wealthy customers love nothing more than free food and who knows we might make an extra sale  I make the slice put it on wax paper and offer it to the fuming hulk with my passable fake smile  This is when it gets nuts  The guy starts yelling at the top of his huge lungsHBFP I thought you said you were OUT of turkeyMe Well were out of the hot roasted turkey but we have plenty of sliceable deli turkey for sandwiches  We wont get more whole turkeys until tomorrows deliveryHBFP If youre not out of turkey then WHY did you tell me you dont have anyAt this point all eyes are on us  My coworkers and the customers are wondering what the commotion is about and as HBFPs volume rises the customers all take a step backHBFP NEVER ASSUMEMe WhatHBFP NEVER ASSUME And do you know WHY BECAUSE YOU COULD BE WRONGMe I thought you wanted the hot turkey because you were standing by the hot case  Did you want some sliced turkey insteadHBFP No I wanted the other turkey but you ASSUMED   NEVER ASSUME  And do you know why Because you could have been WRONGMe being a smart ass But you wanted the other turkey right  Not this cold cut stuffAt this point I realize he is crazy and I am off the hook consequence wise  No way is this guy going to be able to complain about me to my bosses without betraying the fact that he is insane  All of the other customers gave this dude a wide birth as he continued to rant for another minute or so  It was all gold but it was so long ago I dont want to write it out as I cant remember the specifics of the rest of the crazinessEventually the guy tires himself out and walks away though he lingers in the area shooting me dirty looks  I can see the wheels grinding away in his head trying to think up some fresh indignationThe icing on the cake was the short middle aged middle manager guy I had been helping during the debacle  He skulked away the second the big dude started yelling but as soon as the threat was gone my customer came back and said If I were you I would have kicked his ass  I didnt laugh in his face somehow but quietly noted how this middle aged guy was the first to flee the scene when a real life maniac started going off  Yeah bro you should have kicked the ass of the gigantic bearded man who wore a fanny pack and was really upset about how there are different kinds of turkey  Why am I working in a deli and youre in an office,Never assume NEVER ASSUME And do you know why BECAUSE YOU COULD BE WRONG,94,talesFromRetail
bekahbbydoll,3,7,1p3vjw,11,So Im not sure if its because Ive been in a lot of pain lately because of my recent surgery or if Im just starting to notice these things more But this is a two for one tonight FIRSTWhen I close I usually go on my  around  but tonight because we had an extra front lanes manager well call him Asian Persuasion AP from now on on the clock they wanted me to go at  thats fine no skin off my teeth Well I didnt end up clocking out till  because I had to wait for my front lanes team lead to get back from her  Now I believe it was a combination of the pain I was in and my meds or what but Im so use to just clocking back in at  so thats what I did Well before I even get back to the guest service desk Loud Mouth LM from now on had told me that I took a  minute lunch I was so shocked I didnt think it had been that long I immediately started apologizing She told me that I needed to go talk to Passive Agressive Manager PSM from now on  I found her  seconds latter and went straight for an apology Me PSM I am so sorry I didnt realize that I had taken so long at lunch PSM well I mean it just is a real inconvenience cause AP was suppose to leave  minutes ago Me I really am sorry PSM I guess I just lost track of time I also had to clean out my sockets PSM well this isnt the first time its happened Just try to be a little more conscious of when you clock out please Me yes maam I understand First of all I genuinely had no idea I had been gone for so long and I felt really bad because I know that AP wanted to go home Secondly if I did something wrong reprimand me for it Dont beat around the bush and constantly say well I mean or well Um grow a pair of balls and tell me I also had no idea that this wasnt the first time this had happened So how am I suppose to magically know if you dont tell me Id rather get yelled at and be a little butt hurt after words than it feel like you dont have the balls to confront someone when there is a problem SECONDSuper bitch woman SRW from now on comes in to do a return I tell her Ill be right with her because I was busy working on something else She was literally waiting no longer than  minutes and when I finally walk over there she sighs loudly like she has been waiting for longer than  minutes I chalk it up to it being late and she probably just wants to go home I can sympathise with that Me hi How are you doing this eveningSBW stares at meMe you just have a return to do tonight SBW scoffs Um yes thats why Im at the Guest Service Desk Me Alright Well what do you have tonight SBW points to the bag and then slides her receipt across the counter towards meMe Alright Lets see what we got here I take her items out of the bag even though technically its company policy that the guest takes items their returning out of the bag I scan her receipt and notice neither of the shirts shes returning have tags on them No big deal there are tiny tags on the inside that have the DPCI number on them I put the first number in and no problem Type in the second number and the register is prompting me that this item has already been returned Me well maam it looks like this item has already been returned SBW I have the item so its obviously not been returned yet Me Well maam my register is saying that its already been returned SBW Did you not just hear me Are you dense I have the item right here therefore it hasnt been returned yet I try to ignore her overly rude comment and try to fix the problem Sometimes cashiers will ring one of two items that are similar twice even though the DPCI numbers are different So i try typing in the number of the first item again to see if thats what had happened Nope Me Well maam Im not sure what the problem is but my system isnt letting me return this item because its saying that its already been returned Im just about to tell her that we can do a no receipt return but that she might just get a little less than what she paid for And she starts flying off the handleSBW HOW IN THE HELL COULD IT HAVE BEEN RETURNED IF I FUCKING HAVE IT Me Maam I totally understand where youre coming from and I get it but when the system shuts down like this and wont continue there isnt anything I can do to over ride it SBW Just give me my fuckin receipt my mom can come in and do this tomorrow Me Maam it doesnt matter if she comes back tomorrow or not the system is still going to say that its already been returned SBW stares at me like Im speaking a third would language Just give me my goddamn receipt this is fucking ridiculous I tried my hardest to hold my tongue and because of that I rolled my eyes Which she noticed She snatches the receipt out of my hand and her items off the counter I just walk away cause Im done dealing with her She muttered something under her breath and nearly rips the bag caddy off the counter trying to get a bag to put her items in and then storms out of the store HAVE A GREAT FUCKING NIGHT MAAM TLDR I have the worst passive aggressive front end manager ever I tried to help a woman with her return but the register said it had already been returned When told this news the woman flips her shit and nearly breaks store property during her hissy fitEdit just for a little clarity PSM is our Front Lanes Team Lead who was closing that night our extra front lanes manager who is AP was schedules from  until  They wanted me to go to lunch at  instead of  so that there would be coverage at the Guest Service Desk so that PSM wouldnt have to attempt to watch the front lanes and the guest service desk while I was on my meal,Passive Agressive Bosses and Bitchy Guests,18,talesFromRetail

darkenseyreth,8,5,1p39vv,28,I used to work in a camera store in one of the larger malls in the world where we offered a print service One of our services was a canvas print that you ordered off of one of our photo kiosks basically a touch screen computer with our ordering software on it Customers sometimes need a hand navigating the software so when a gentleman asked for a hand on how to order a canvas I was happy to help Usually they just need to be pointed in the right direction be shown where they need to go to find the right product and how to access their files etc so i did just that He asked for a little more help and I was happy to oblige I showed him where to find his files and he clicks on it next thing you know there are dozens of pictures of his wife popping up that look like they were part of a nude glamour shoot on a beach Nudity happens from time to time so i politely avert my eyes as if it were a mistake but no the guy starts asking my opinions on the photos We go through the entire gallery which I honestly didnt mind because his wife was pretty hot for a woman in her early s and finally settle on a picture of her lounging in the sand He then gets me to help me order a x canvas which he apparently intended to hang above his living room fireplace,Another Awkward Moment,33,talesFromRetail

kyp,15,12,1p2tmb,15,Hello I have started a bloghttpanthropologyandbookswordpresscom about bookselling Here is my first page It is longI have recently discovered that I cant keep doing the Masters degree in Medical Anthropology I just started about a month agoThis means I have to sell books full time instead of part timeThis means my anger levels will rise It is something that cannot be helped It happens I am sure to everyone who works in retailAt the moment its worse for me because I thought I had a way out Ive been a bookseller full time and part time for nearly seven years now I thought I was going to escape to discover new things and become enlightened and intelligent and loving and patient I was going to find a way to help people I was going to make the world a better place I mean I hadnt quite figured out how yet but I was going toOh yes I was going to be someoneBut that is not happening Not yet So I am back in the bookshop five days a week speaking to peoplePlease do not misunderstand me I mostly like people I mostly love books But sometimes it is difficultSo I am thinking that I need an outlet Some way of preventing me from taking out my frustration and anger and confusion on customers Some of them may deserve it but it would get me in trouble eventually and I would not want thatI came close yesterday I spoke to a few customers in a not so happy way I became frustrated and confused and unsure of how to cope But why you may askHere are a few examplesThe phone rings and I pick it upMe Bookshop Bookshop I say the name of the bookshop in real lifeCustomer And older man a bit difficult to understand Hello My name is Claude One of you put a book aside for me I have the flu and I can not collect it What I want you to do is keep the book I will send you a cheque When the cheque clears you will send me the bookMe We dont take cheques unfortunatley butClaude No no NO You are not listening to me I said I will send you a cheque When the cheque clears you will send me the bookMe we dont take cheques We cant take cheques Thats all I can say about cheques But there are some other things that we can do I can keep the book aside for longer orClaude How longMe getting a bit tired of being interrupted I can choose the date of when you would like to collect it on our system OR I could take payment over the phone now and get the book sent out for you tomorrow You would pay  for shippingC How would I pay nowM With your bank cardC I know how this works You will take my details and then other people will find them and use themM Your details go into the card reader and the payment goes through Noone else sees them It goes straight to the bankC And who will you tellM Knowing that somewhere in some way this is amusing I will not tell anyone else your bank details I promiseI took the details after reassuring him that I would not steal his identity After the payment was accepted I made the mistake of saying Ok Thats gone throughC NO We are not finished yetM I know this I still have to take your addressAnd so I did And then we were done At which point Claude said So have I paidOh wowBut I survived I did it Claude hung up and I went on with my dayShortly after as I was shelving travel guides a gentleman did that thing of looking at me trying to make eye contact but not saying anything So I looked back at him and smiledGentleman I have this book here It is the newer one because the one I own is from Me Its important to have the newest travel guidesG I go to Italy because Im a celiacM OhG You say celiaca to any of them and they immediately know what you meanM Thats goodG Has a widow read the new Bridget JonesM slightly taken aback by the sudden change of subject I dont think anyone who works here has read it yetG Because I know a woman whos husband has died and I think it might be a good present for herM OKG But I worked for people who looked at behaviours of widows Its amazing what books get wrong about widows You would laughM Well research is important in booksG Yes Men get into classical music Women become interested in football I am a widow he actually said widow there Just in case you were wondering if I didnt know about the word widower but I did not listen to classical music Not all widows doM I seeG I went to a footbal match once in Italy The crowd was full of older womenM G I think that they feel safer travelling with football fansM WellG It was a tour you seeM Yes That is saferG Im going to get this thenAnd then he left And I was left dazed looking around for support But nobody was thereFinally I was behind the tills being approached by a chap when a woman called out Wheres the new Bridget Jones bookI replied Its on that small table right next to you there The one with the sign that says Bridgets Back on itThe woman looked at the table and I turned to the chap to serve himWhich one the woman calledThe hardback on that table just in front of you calleWhat Mad About the BoyYes That book just there And again I turned to the man now standing directly in front of me as the woman picked the book up to look at itWhys it half priceMy customer man smiled at me in amusement as I looked over at the woman againBecause it is a popular bookAnd so I turned once again to the amused man and served him in a polite professional and curteous mannerI think if it had been a few years ago I would have been more jolly I might have said to the woman Well you can pay full price if you want or some such chummy amusing thing But not at the moment At the moment I am struggling to be jovial

rabblefish,39,47,1p2eoa,191,When I was slogging my way through my undergraduate degree I worked parttime in a computer store  It was a fun environment to be in  I got to play with the latest tech toys and my boss was an awesome stand up guy to work for still good friends with him to this day  Because of this I felt very loyal to this store and I always endeavoured to do my best to keep the business afloat  That included scaring away potential thievesOne of the problems with working in a computer store is that you sell a lot of expensive products which attracted a LOT of people who tried to scam us by purchasing products with fake credit cards Presumably theyd pay for the product with these fake credit cards and try to sell it for cash on sites like Craigs List or KijijiThese fraudsters were usually pretty easy to spot  Their body language was usually a dead giveaway shifty eyes fidgeting constantly eyeing the exit to the street etc but the most major red flag was when they would ask for the most expensive machine in the store without asking the sales staff any indepth questions  Most legitimate customers talked to us extensively before plunking down their hard earned money for a machine that cost upwards of   I usually spent at least  minutes answering questions when a computer sale was involved and sometimes customers would come back  or  times with followup questions before making their purchasesOn one particular day I had a woman come in to purchase a top of the line  laptop which retailed for   She smiled and tried to qualify this by telling me I need this because Im an interior designer   Now I generally try not to judge a book by its cover but internally I snorted and said to myself Yeah honey and Im the freakin Pope  God bless you my child  Interior designer my assFor starters she was wearing a hot pink leopard print tube top and a black ruffled micro skirt that barely covered her assets  The skirt could more accurately be described as a wide belt  A violently green gstring was poking out of the top of it and she teetered precariously on a pair of  lucite platform stilettos because nothing screams interior designer like lucite heels  Her skin was practically covered in crappy biker tattoos  They had that trademark DIY stick and poke look to themI smiled and played along with her ruse as I usually do in these cases  I asked her if she had any questions before I grabbed the computer from the stock room and she fidgeted and brusquely told me that it wasnt necessary because she had already done her research ahead of time  Once I got to the stock room I gave my manager the heads up and told him to keep our lossprevention officer on standby  I waited for a few minutes and returned to the sales floor with the computer she wantedI processed the transaction as I normally would and she handed over her credit card  I stifled a laugh  Suspicions confirmed the card was fake  I could tell by the dots that it was printed using an inkjet printer  It looked like it was printed at the lowest quality setting to save on the cost of ink  The holographic sticker one usually sees on a genuine credit card was also peeling off  With a straight face I asked her for a piece of governmentissued of photo ID to verify that she was the cardholder  Its standard procedure for purchases of this size  I had to try really really hard to stifle another laugh because what she presented was barely a step up from thishttpihredbubblenetimagemtdxnsTWNMbZpbiEDffffffjpgThen I feigned puzzlement and frowned at the screen on the register telling this interior designer that we were having technical difficulties  I called K the aforementioned lossprevention officer and told him Hi K  We have a code   Would you mind coming up and making sure that my register is in good working order  While we waited she fidgeted quite a bit eyed the exit about half a dozen times and texted nonstop on her BlackBerry  I smiled and told her we should have it sorted out in a few minutes  A pokerfaced K came up and I handed over the card to him  He went into the back office called merchant services and verified that it was indeed a fakeMs Interior Designer seemed to sense that the jig was up  She didnt even wait for K to come back with her fake credit card  Good thing too because if she had waited around he would have arrested her  She excused herself power walked as quickly as one could in  lucite heels and practically RAN towards a car parked outside the store  K dashed out after her heard her yell ALLEZ ALLEZ French for GO GO to the man in the drivers seat and managed to jot down the license plate of the car before it screeched away  K reported the incident to the police and a couple of weeks later he tells me that they were arrested  Apparently this wasnt an isolated incident for Ms Interior Designer and her gang of accomplices  They were doing this in computer stores all over the city and it finally caught up with them  TLDR Trashy biker chick dressed

terattt,30,12,1p2b6o,41,A woman came in today with both barrels blazing to make a complaint about how she had returned a coffee pot a few days ago and had just now noticed that on the receipt she didnt receive all the money she should have It had been on sale when she purchased it and she claimed that we refunded her as if the sale had been applied to the item price after taxes instead of before taxes turns out this makes no difference since multiplication is commutative so she was completely wrong But she came in so angry and was so condescending to me that I could barely even speak She intimidated me and started saying how I had no idea what I was doing when I took even a second to try to follow her logic and didnt understand all the confusing things she was throwing at me immediately Do you REALLY not understand what Im saying she said as she gave me a look of utter disdain I just apologized and tried to figure it out but luckily another more seasoned employee came over and handled it for meBut I want to know How do you handle people like this If I had been able to keep my composure I wouldve been fine but the way she had me against the ropes by insulting me insinuating I was dumb for not getting it immediately I got flustered and fell right into her trap And I felt horrible afterward I dont want this to happen again Please help me,New to retail How are you supposed to deal with angry condescending customers like this And how do you not get flustered,53,talesFromRetail
Antigon,37,43,1p2ajd,170,A lot of people seem to have what I call a reaction word or phrase  When something happens and it surprises you this word phrase seems to be the first thing you utter when the ability to talk is regained Mine is Really It usually sounds sarcastic but my little brother swears he can tell you my next course of action based entirely on how I say this one word Working in customer service I have used this word at least a million times I tend to at least make the attempt to seem polite however not always So at the time I am working at a small store in the mall which carries jewelry small toys and mostly pre teen based merchandise Its usually a pretty laid back job with one or two crazies and an occassional teeny bopper shoplifter that I make cry One day Ms Scuzzy comes in pushing a small child in a stroller about two years old Ms Scuzzy is about  something with matted hair and wearing a dress about  sizes too small I was working with a newer employee and demonstrating how to pierce a little girls ears I noticed that where ever I was in the store Ms Scuzz was on the other side Ms Scuzz also seemed to be staring at me a lot and every once in awhile would lean forward towards the stroller Scuzz was always behind a tower containing merchandise when she did this I began watching the tilted mirrors that were above the sales floor  The next time Scuzz leaned forward I watched her shoveling merchandise behind the child into the seat of the stroller  I point this out to the newer employee NE and ask her to call the mall security guard By now I have finished with the paying customer and ring her up NE apparently noticed that Scuzz is making a roll for it NE stops her in front of the store I dont hear exactly what took place however I see Scuzz KICK NE in the shin and try to run out of the store WITHOUT the child or stroller Scuzz then sees a manager from the neighboring store running towards her turns around and runs to the back of our store I follow her and I guess she thought we had a back exit but all we have is a storage closet  So now shes in the doorway of our storage closet NE is holding the sobbing two year old and I am standing between Scuzz and the exit holding the door to the storage closet Scuzz raises her arm over her head and makes a fist like she is going to hit me One word comes out of my mouth Really Not sarcastic not yelled just disbelief that I am going to have to fight a fifty year old lady over cheap jewelry She lowers her fist and spits in my face WHAM I slammed the door I was holding full into her Shes knocked back and blood just pours out of her nose Long story short Cops show up shes charged with assault and shoplifting  I get tested clean bill of health and I get fired for hitting a customer in the face with a door The charge against her for me was dropped because it was mutual combat Oh and she had about  worth of merchandise Apparently she had been doing this at multiple other locations and returning the merchandise later for cash  The  year old was her grandkid that she was not supposed to be left alone with so hopefully that got dealt with as well because child services showed upTLDR Dont spit on me  The door will hit you on the way out ,Really Or My Craziest Retail Story,213,talesFromRetail
DubiousKing,11,32,1p29gi,143,Ive been working for a small shop in my local mall for the better part of a year now Ive been told by multiple people higher up the chain than me that Im considered part of the stores core staff but Ive been passed up for promotion a few times Not necessarily the happiest of campers but I still work hard and get the job done Pretty recently we had what I would call the biggest scheduling CF to dateSee our employees in each location are mostly divided into  main positions in order of hierarchy team member team leader assistant manager general manager By the book team members are never allowed to man the store by themselves there always needs to be a team lead or manager there and no one is allowed to be there alone except for the one person who preps the store before openingOn most weekdays well have one of them open and one of them close with their hours overlapping to allow for breaks This day however the opening team leader had to leave early and the closing team leader couldnt arrive until much later which meant a third had to be scheduled to cover the time inbetweenI was on opening shift and we receive a call at about noon Its the team lead whos supposed to come in to cover for the afternoon and shes bedridden with some illness I didnt answer the call so I dont know the details Our general manager is out of town so we commence panic mode as we call other stores in the area to see if someone can lend us a team lead No ones available so Im given a crash course on managerial duties contact numbers PoS overrides how to process returns etc We manage to get the closing team member to come in early but Im stuck running the store with no formal training for  hoursOur store also has sales goals both for the store itself and for each of us individually Making these goals earns a commissionstyle bonus at the end of the month Usually these are pretty tough to hit especially since our stores products are what most would consider purely luxury goods By the time the closing team leader arrived I had gone well over my personal goal for the day and covered almost half of the stores goal singlehandedlyI think I did goodTLDR  Left for  hours without a manager Given a crash course on how to be a manager Did a damn good job,Sorry we dont have a manager here right now just me,175,talesFromRetail
jdpatric,74,89,1p293f,387,After reading Layaway httpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsptwdlayaway I thought of my time at the hardware store and rentalsI was going to post it there as a comment but its just really long I used to work at a small hardware store in a medlarge town We offered a few in store services and one of them was rentals We had two different types of carpet cleaners we rented along with pressure washers Each rental had a form we had to fill out on the computer We didnt require an email address but we did require an in state drivers license or some form of military ID two phone numbers and a credit card we charged the deposit to the credit card Note If youre reading this you probably know that a debit card can be run as credit provided it has a major logo on it I cant tell you how many people Ive had to explain this to Especially when cashiering Here are a few stories of people doing rentalsNumber oneAngry guy comes in AGAG  I need to patch a hoseMe  OK heres the aisle where we sell hose mendersAG  No Its for a pressure washerMe  What Like gas powered  PSI pressure washerAG  No its  PSIMe  We dont sell anything to patch that kind of hoseAG  WhyMe  Because it could kill youAG  Ohhow much to rent a pressure washer hoseMe  I dont think we rent just the hose out let me checkMe  Sorry you have to rent the machine Its  with a  deposit that gets refunded when you return the machineAG  Thats not too badsign me upMe  I need a drivers license and a credit card sirAG  Well I dont have a credit card just cashMe  Sir the deposit is required to be on a cardAG  I want to see a managerManager tells him the same thing Finally the guy gets agitatedAG  If your store wasnt so cheap I could just use my Visa and this wouldnt be a problemMe  Thatd workAG  No it wont Its a debit card you idiotMe  Actually it will run quite nicely as either credit or debit I have the same card from the same bank and use mine here at least once a weekAG obviously flustered and embarrassed as hell now  Fine Ring me upHe called back later to complain that it wouldnt start It was out of gashed been trying to figure out what was wrong with it for an hourAG  What do you mean I have to put gas in itMe  Well sir it runs on gas didnt really know what else to sayAG  You guys dont put gas in them for meMe  Sir we dont sell gas hereAG  hangs upHe tried to get a refund for the machine later Was turned downNumber twoA guy wearing a Bluetooth and a full business suit comes into the store in a HUGE hurry HHHH  I need to rent a carpet cleaner and Im in a rushMe  Ok Ive done plenty of these and will have you out of here in no time I need a drivers license and a credit card pleaseHH  OK hands me the stuffOn the rental form I was required to get a home and a cell phone It was OK to get two cellsheck even a relatives cellhome just so long as we had two legit phone numbers This was a CYA for the cashier as much as for the owner If the machine goes missing the owner has two places to call looking for it and if the cashier puts two phone numbers even if it was just a neighbor then the cops had a second thing to go onor so the owner told us I was OK with it it was the rulesMe  OK last thing I need a home and a cell phone numberHH  My cell is when he said this I kind of expected the worst  not really just use that you dont need my home phoneMe  Sorry sir the form requires two phone numbers for the rental HH  Well we dont give out our home phone number to anyone we dont want telemarketers to callMe  We dont give this information out to anyone in fact this particular computer isnt even connected to the internetHH  Well I dont have a home phone lieMe slightly annoyed at being lied to  Sir I can use another celldoes your wife have oneHH  Yes but Im not giving you that eitherMy manager who knew I was a veteran at this had seen the debacle beginning to unfold and had stepped over to assist thankfullyManager  Its the store policy from the owner sir Im afraid theres nothing we can do it you wont give us two phone numbersHH  This is insane Fine Heres my work cell really all thatI ring him up and set him on his way Didnt think anything of it I the next had three days off due to the way my semester was scheduled at the time and then was on for four days When I returned the owner was on the phone yelling at someone not terribly unusual owner was great but occasionally he had to call people and be that guyThe next day someone goes to return a carpet cleaner using the form the guy had rented it with the previous WEEK at this point Theres a huge late fee which the guy had negotiated down a bit with the owner Note the guy returning HHs machine is not HHNew guy NG  I need to return thisMe  OK do you have the card it was rented on expecting the worst we needed the card to refund the depositNG  Yeah HH wont be needing it anymore Hes been firedTurns out the guy was a really midlevel fairly new employee at a local company who had invited a bunch of friends to his office to watch college football they had several rather large TVs and projectors for conferences and such apparently and party on Saturday with the intent of cleaning up the mess on Sunday Something went awry when he tried to use his company card to pay for the rental and got caughtNumber three On a really cold day a sketchy guy and his equally sketchy wifepartnernot even sure what walk into the store and ask to rent a pressure washer This is in Florida so cold is a relative term but it was legit winter and the high was in the low s I wouldnt want to pressure wash on a day like thatSketchy guy SG  I need to rent a pressure washerMe  OK I need a drivers license and a credit cardSG  Uhhhh one sec says to sketchy lady SL dig my license outta your purse for me Back to me Can you fill the rest out while she does thatMe  Ummm sure I dont see why not I need a Home phone and a cell moving to the next open bracketsSG  Uhhhh my cell is insert number here and I dont have a home phoneMe  I need two numbers sirSL very quietly and under her breath to SG  Just make one up quick hunSG Thinking that for some ungodly reason I couldnt hear SL  Yeah uhhhmy home phone is insert some obviously made up number hereMe  Yeah Im not going to put that in You just made that upSG  How do you know I didnt make the first one upI was about to reply saying because you didnt pause for  seconds between each number and forget our area code with the first one when SL picked this moment to find SGs drivers licenseSL  Oh heres his licenseI take one look at it and I see the saddest excuse for a fake ID Ive seen Probably ever It was beat to death The guy on there while also a very sketchy individual was NOT SGMe  Sir Im sorry I cant rent you this machinethis is not you in the pictureThe computer we used for rentals was LITERALLY on the wall of the owners office and the walls didnt connect to the ceiling so he could hear whenever we had a problem with a rental and he had one way glass so they could see it tooOwner comes out of the office and tkaes the fake ID  Sir Im going to ask that you hang around here for a few minutes until the police arrive or I wont be giving you your drivers license backSG  KEEP IT runs away with SL in towOwner didnt really call the cops but pinned the license up to ward off future attempts to steal our machinesNumber fourThis is one of my all time favoritesA couple in their late s early s walk in the door and right off the bat I can see something is off They just look a little confusedsomethings just differentI could tell Me  Howre yall doing today yeah southern drawl Id put it on for retail lol Can I help you with anythingConfused couple CC  Utter silenceMe now confused myself  Can I help youCC  Still silentAt this point they began to sign to each other and I determined that they were both deaf Well that explains a lot Found out that they were both INCREDIBLY proficient at reading lips to the point where they warned me not to mutter anything negative under my breath as theyd probably pick that up too We communicated via writing on slips of paper They need a carpet cleaner Ok no problem I write that I need  a drivers license and a credit card They gladly provided me with both Since they could read lips I would usually just ask them questions and theyd writeMe  OK I just need a home and a cellphonenumber I realized how ridiculous this was as I was asking for itthey were DEAF why would they have a phoneThe man just looked at me with a stare that said what the fuck am I going to do with a phoneMe  Ummmsorryone secI go straight to the owner who happened to be there that day obviously he hadnt heard much if any of the one sided conversation I was having with CC I explain the situation to the owner At first he doesnt budgeOwner  We need two phone numbers no matter whatMe  Owner They Are DEAF They dont HAVE one phone between them let alone twoOwner  YeahI guess weve never had this come up beforeummmYeahUhhhhjust fill in the blanks with numbersHad anyone but the owner told me to do that Id have told them to pound sand but that came from the tippity top and it was already an odd case so I punched it right inThey didnt give us any trouble at all returned it same day and everything went fine,Yes Yes we DO require two phone numbers to rent a  dollar machine,476,talesFromRetail
