Jaunt-701,68,167,1qwru3,715,"I opened the present. What the fuck is this shit? “Oh wow, grandpa, thanks!”

He pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose and said, “It's a Ham Radio, son. I used to have one when I was younger. It's got a hundred mile range, so you can talk to people all the way out in Fairview. Real conversations, not the text messages or emails you all use these days. I'll even let you use my old license and call sign.”

Yeah, I'm never going to do any of that. “Sounds great, grandpa!”

“Let's set it up together.”

“...Uh, yeah, cool!”

He spent two hours setting it up, showing me how to operate it, and telling me stories about the other “hams” he'd met over the years. He switched it on and got in contact with some gruff sounding dude out in Fairview. They had a lively discussion about how the FCC was oppressing their constitutional rights.

I caught a movie with Jeremy, got some free pancakes at IHOP, and turned in early. A mediocre birthday, like always. I have a bad habit of drinking soda before bed, and, as usual, I ended up staring at the ceiling wide awake. I browsed Reddit for a while, but you can only see so many cat pictures before they all start to look the same.

I flicked on the ham radio and fiddled with the tuner. Other than the police band, the air traffic tower, and some guy ranting about the Federal Reserve, it was quiet. I sighed, laid back in bed, and started to doze off.

That's when I heard it.

At first I thought I imagined it. I was in that half-awake, half-asleep state where your thoughts start to play tricks on you. I thought maybe I had started dreaming before I was fully asleep and had hallucinated a sound.

A sound like a voice calling through static.

I listened for a moment. Nothing. Just a dream. I turned over on my side and closed my eyes.

I snapped back awake. There it was again, for certain this time. A voice calling out, as if from a great distance.

It was coming from the radio.

I turned the volume up as far as it would go, but I could still hear only the faintest sound, like someone calling from the bottom of a well. I adjusted the tuner for better reception, but it didn't help. I picked up the microphone and spoke into it. “Hello?”

The voice stopped. There was a long moment of silence. Then the voice called out again, more clearly this time. “Hello? Hello?”

“Hello? Can you hear me?” I suddenly felt very stupid. It was probably just another weirdo survivalist out in the woods who wanted to babble about EMP blasts and the gold standard or something. Still, there was something in his voice. An urgency that was hard to ignore.

There was a fluctuation in the static, and the voice came in again. “Hello?” He said something else, something in what I assumed was German.

“I'm sorry, I can't understand you. I only speak English.”

He spoke again, and I could hear how thick his accent was. “Please, I ask you. When are you?”

“Where am I? I'm in Chester. About forty miles outside Fairview.”

“No, no.” The static was starting to overtake the voice again. “*When* are you?”

“Excuse me?”

“What time? What *year*?”

I stared at the radio. So this was one of those ham weirdos that grandpa was talking about. I shook my head and chucked a little. “Uh, it's 2013 dude.”

There was an excited barrage of German that turned desperate when the static started drowning him out. “Please, I must ask you. Please, wait...”

Then nothing.

I set the microphone down. Great. Another outlet for creepers to say creepy shit. We sure don't have enough of those in the world. I switched the radio off and went to sleep.

-------

“What the fuck is that shit?” Jeremy said.

I rolled my eyes. “Ham radio. My grandpa got it for my birthday.”

“That's hilarious. Does it work?”

“Yeah, hundred mile range. It's stupid though. The police band is sort of interesting, but other than that it's just survivalists and conspiracy nuts.”

“That's awesome. We should pretend we're under siege during a zombie attack, like do some *War of the Worlds* shit with this thing.”

I laughed. “I don't know man, it's just a lot of weirdos on there. Like the other day, I was listening to it, and this one guy--”

Jeremy switched the radio on, and immediately I heard a frantic voice calling out. “Hello? Hello?”

“*This* guy,” I said. “This guy is a fucking psycho.”

“Dude, sweet. I love talking to psychos.” Jeremy picked up the microphone. “Hello?”

“Hello,” the voice sounded overjoyed. “Please do not go. I do many fixes to machine. Transmission is very much better.”

Jeremy giggled. “Dude, you've got fucking Bruno on your radio.” He spoke into the microphone. “*Ja, das is gut*. Much sound. Bravo.”

“*Sprechen Sie Deutsch*?”

“I've had a few semesters, yeah.”

They spoke back and forth in German for a bit. “What are you saying?” I asked.

Jeremy sat back and shook his head. “This guy is a piece of work. I asked him where he's located, and he said 'long ago, many years in your past.'”

“When I talked to him he wanted to know what year it was.”

“He's playing a prank. He probably goes on here, pretends to be a time traveler to troll the survivalists, and then puts the recordings up on YouTube. Actually pretty brilliant, if you ask me.”

“Ask him how he's communicating from the past.”

Jeremy spoke into the microphone, and there was an excited flood of German from the other end.

“What's he saying?” I asked.

“I have no fucking idea.”

“I thought you spoke German?”

“Level three. If he was describing the animals he was seeing on a safari I could maybe follow him. But he's talking about like, 'particle tunnels' and 'chaotic duality waves' or something. I don't think I could understand him even if I was fluent.”

The voice on the radio sighed and took a long pause. Then, with heaviness in his tone, he said, “Please. Tell me about your world.”

I scoffed. “We should switch it off.”

Jeremy looked shocked. “Why?”

“He's fucking with us.”

“So? He's doing a great job of it. Don't be such a downer. This is the most interesting conversation I've had in a while, so I say fuck it. Let's play time travelers.”

We told him about our “future” world. We described airplanes, self-driving cars, space stations, microchips. We tried to describe a smartphone, which was difficult to do with the voice's shitty English and Jeremy's shitty German. He was fascinated by the Internet, awestruck by the moon landing, greatly amused when we played some Daft Punk as an example of futuristic culture. Jeremy spent a weird amount of time talking about his Vitamix.

And through it all, the voice kept repeating, “Beautiful. So beautiful.”

“Okay, enough about us, *mein herr*,” Jeremy said. “Your turn. Tell us about your world.”

A long silence. “My world,” the voice said, “is very dark. Bad things happening. I do not know...how we will escape the shadow.”

“This guy's a great improviser,” Jeremy said.

“Please, my friends. I have question. It is very important. I must ask you.”

Jeremy smiled. “Sure man, go ahead.”

The voice asked something in German. Jeremy frowned.

Suddenly, there was a noise like breaking glass from the radio. The voice gasped, “*Nein, nein*.” There were other voices, angry voices, clamoring and shouting. It sounded like a crowd was in the room, and they were wreaking havoc. Loud bangs and thuds, like furniture being turned over. The voices grew louder, and louder. There was a tremendous crash.

Then silence.

I looked over at Jeremy. “What the fuck happened?”

He shook his head. “I don't know. Other people were there. They were saying, 'Dog. Worthless dog,' over and over again. Sounded like they smashed the place up.”

I fiddled with the tuner, but there was no sign of the voice. Jeremy and I sat quietly for a moment.

“His question,” I said. “What did he ask you?”

Jeremy stared at the radio. “He said, 'Can they be stopped?'”

-------

Too much soda again. Another insomniac night. I counted the cracks in the ceiling, over and over. Over and over. My eyes began to feel heavy at last.

A burst of static from the radio made my heart jump. I shot upright in bed and looked over. The static faded out and the voice faded in. He was speaking German, quite softly.

Anger flared in my chest. I was sick of this. Sick of him and his stupid pranks. I wanted to smash that goddamn radio to pieces.

I grabbed the microphone and shouted, “Leave me alone for Christ's sake. I don't care about your stupid fucking time travel act, just stop bothering me and leave me alone.”

But he just spoke over me, like he couldn't hear me at all. His voice was shaky and quiet. I couldn't understand what he was saying, but I could feel a great sadness in his tone.

I grabbed my phone and opened the voice recorder. I sat there, listening and recording, until he was finished speaking. I sat in silence for a few minutes to make sure nothing else was coming through, then I switched the radio off.

I sent the audio file to Jeremy with an explanation of what had happened. I asked him to translate. The next day at school, he handed me a sheet of paper at lunch. He didn't say anything, he just handed it to me and walked away.

It read:

&gt; My friends, I do not know if you can hear me. I do not know if you could ever hear me, or if I was imagining our encounter. But I hope you are out there.

&gt; The machine is critically damaged. Perhaps with a great deal of work it could be repaired, but I doubt that I will have either the resources or the time necessary for such a task. I am deeply saddened that we could not speak further. There are so many questions I wanted to ask, so much more I wanted to learn about your world. But please know that, in the brief time we were able to speak, you gave a tired man a reason to continue living.

&gt; I know now that the madness that has gripped my country cannot be stopped. I tell my son to be strong. I tell him that our people have endured for thousands of years. I tell him that if we were strong enough to build the Pyramids, we are strong enough to withstand a few grunting apes in jackboots. But he knows I am afraid too. We are marching forward into a nightmare that will take a terrible toll on all of us. I do not know when it will end. The only thing I can cling to is the fact that, somehow, our world will lead to yours.

&gt; I think of your world, and I feel something I haven't felt in many years. An emotion almost unknown to the people of my time. I feel hope. For in a world such as yours, a world of such wondrous invention and progress, what use could there be for war? What reason for hunger? What tolerance for injustice? I know in my heart that you have solved the problems that have plagued our species and created a world of enduring peace and unity.

&gt; I do not know how such a world could spring from the darkness that is enveloping this continent. But I hope that the future is as beautiful as you described it. I hope you have built the world that we could not. I hope you have learned from our mistakes. I hope you treat each other with the dignity and respect that is the birthright of all humanity. I hope you have forgotten the word for “hate.” I hope that things are different.

&gt; Goodbye, my friends, from the shadows.

&gt; Dr. Albert Bachman. Frankfurt, Germany. November 12th, 1938.

A prank. That's all it was. I don't even know why I'm even posting this. There's no way it was actually some sci-fi miracle. It was obviously just someone with too much time on his hands playing a big joke on us. He's probably listening to the recordings and laughing at us right now.

Just a prank.

But...

I still keep the radio on at night. I'll switch it on as I'm laying in bed, and sometimes when I'm starting to drift off, I'll think I hear a distant voice calling out in the dark. A voice from the shadows, tiny and frail, yet full of hope. And I'll sit up in bed and listen. I'll listen for a sound, a word, anything. But I never hear more. Just my mind playing tricks on me.

I don't sleep much anymore. Probably because I drink too much soda, right?

horriddaydream,86,144,1r338n,570,"My mother left when I was four.
Normally, that wouldn't mean anything, but I suspected for a long time that the porcelain dolls were coming from her, like some pitiful little attempt to show me that she loved me. 

My father; he worked overtime to keep things going in the household even if it was just the two of us. His hands were always worn from working the machines at the shop and he slaved even more when he got home and had to make supper for himself and I, and go through my nightly routines before I hit the sack. I sometimes woke up in the middle of the night and he was still awake, cleaning a room in the house, and I thought to myself, ""This man is dedicated. Has to be awake in only a few hours…and here he is."" I love my father, and I always have.

One of his most trusted friends from high school, Alexander, was my babysitter from the time my mother left, to the time I was about seven years old. We trusted Alexander. He worked night shift and so he was able to work babysitting in around his hours, and he would have done anything to help out my father to make that work. My father paid him even though he asked for nothing; he said he was just 'doing his good deed', ""and I like it anyway!"" My dad used to come home from work and Alexander would pick up his bags full of toys that we played with; he always brought the best toys and trinkets with him. His daughter had passed away when she was ten years old, and I think it brought him great joy to now share her old toys with another little girl. He would say to my dad, ""She was great for me. She ate well, and she took her usual long nap. I'll be back tomorrow!"" And he always came back. 

Well, eventually times changed and my dad's work schedule changed with them. We didn't see Alexander anymore because we didn't NEED Alexander anymore. My father thought that they lost touch permanently and when I asked about him he told me truthfully that Alexander was a very busy man. And he understood that, and I did too. 

For my eighth birthday, the first porcelain doll arrived. It had beautiful, blonde curly hair and a painted on face. She was wearing what looked to be an expensive, velvet dress with an attached tutu. She came inside a stuffed envelope with nothing else on the package to identify who had sent her. Just my name, that was all. The first thing that my father did was call my grandmother, who said, ""No, I didn't drive by and place a present on the porch. I'm not her coward mother; I would have given it right to her."" That gave my father the second idea: my mother. Only thing was, we had no way of getting in touch with her and finding out for she had literally taken off and abandoned us both. And over the next few weeks, nobody came forth and said they had gotten me the doll, so we assumed this is who had sent it.

They showed up every year since then. Each unique in their own ways, each more beautiful than the last. I thought it was a little odd, yes. Especially because my mother made no outreach to me so if she was sending me gifts but not bothering to even so much call me and check up, then that was just plain rude of her and her gifts meant literally nothing. But I continued to set them up on my shelf in my bedroom and they looked nice there, I suppose.

The year I turned nineteen, I was moved into college and was taking courses on my birthday. My father called me from home and asked me when I was coming back home for a break, and I told him that I had time this weekend, but I only said this because I sensed some urgency in his voice. I could make it work. He told me not to worry about anything but that he would really like to see me. Then he stressed that I always lock my doors and always have somebody walking with me if I was out past dark, which I already knew.

I returned home that weekend and my father said there had been an accident.
My porcelain birthday doll had arrived, my nineteenth year doll. When my father brought it inside the house, it had smashed into a hundred separate pieces.
Inside, there was a diary entry on a piece of paper.
We spent the entire day smashing open every porcelain doll, and the entire night speaking with the police.
Alexander had written diary entries for every time he had drugged and molested me, each more explicit, admitting that he had done the same to his daughter up until the time of her horrible death. My father and I hadn't a dry eye in our house that entire night, and I continued to have problems throughout my college career knowing that Alexander was somewhere out there, probably assuming a new identity and doing the same thing to other girls.

Now I know why he had always commented on me taking such 'usual long naps.'

honeymoonatthefalls,59,123,1r0fus,539,"The falls have a pull, according to the locals.  Something dark and unearthly like a siren’s song, sweet and somehow terrible.  It draws people “of a certain intent”.  That’s the polite way to say a lot of people end up crushed on the rocks below, their limbs torn apart by the unending rush of water, the brains that made them who they were nothing more than bits of foam and meat floating to the surface.  20-40 a year, in fact, depending on who you ask.

We were happy.  Weren’t we?  I thought we were.  I thought maybe we were different from everyone else, that we’d actually make it.  We wouldn’t end up in that 50% statistic.  We’d grow old together, laughing at the same stupid jokes, knowing what was going to come out of the other’s mouth before they even had a chance to say it.

Was it the pressure of the wedding?  The fact that I’m still “between jobs”?  Young 20-somethings in one of America’s bleakest economies, doing what we could to get by.  Scrambling for every scrap as the magazine covers reminded us how worthless our generation is, the snide remarks about our smartphones and Facebook and selfies.  Maybe getting married wasn’t a good idea.

But we were in love!  We were in love and we knew deep down in that secret place in our stomachs that she was the one for me and I for her.

So then why did it happen?

No.  I’m not supposed to ask that anymore.  I’m supposed to accept that she’s gone.  I’m supposed to accept the fact that she’s her own statistic now, one of 20-40 people a year.  Another tumble of bones on the body count that’s reached over 5000 since the falls became an attraction both for tourists and people with death on their mind.

But it’s hard to accept when I can still see her face so clearly, that sweet heart-shaped face with the little crescent-moon scar on her left nostril, the way her big blue eyes lit up when she showed me the fantastic deal she scored on Groupon, a Niagara Falls getaway for our honeymoon.

If only I could go back.  Tell her that the price was nice but I’d rather go to a beach, or Ireland, it doesn’t matter, anywhere but those cursed falls.

It’s impossible to describe how it feels to stand at the crest of Niagara, the mist peppering your face like cold little kisses, drinking in the smells and the sound and the remarkable way the water rushes down, down, ever down.  Your existence seems like a cosmic joke in comparison to this almost hauntingly beautiful feat of nature.  For a moment, it is.

The locals say you can tell who has a death wish by how close they’ll get to the edge.  Those who shy away, who shake their heads and insist nervously that they can see just fine from where they are, thank you very much, those are the ones who can’t trust themselves to get too close.  If they get too close to the edge, some little part of them knows they’ll jump.

She didn’t shy away.  She went right up to the railing.  She was smiling.

That’s the worst part.  She was smiling.

It was early in the morning, one of those damp gray dawns only possible in the new spring of upstate New York.  We had the sight to ourselves.  It was a little spooky, being out there alone, the kind of spooky you get from being in an empty shopping mall after hours, all those metal gates pulled down and the lights turned off.

She was standing there, a little too high on the guardrail, leaning just a little too far over, smiling as the mist touched her lips and made her hair curl in damp little tendrils on her cheeks.  She was beautiful.

I’ll never know why I pushed her.

That’s something I have to accept.

yurglar,64,92,1qrlzl,389,"This is a true story and by all means, I am fully aware all stories on this website are true, however I am also fully aware of the suspicion natural to people upon hearing something beyond their comprehension. The case I’m about to relate to you is one of those situations, where reason and logic mean nothing when compared to the facts, and I wish to find someone who believes me here. I am a doctor, a pathologist, normally in charge of autopsies and anatomical studies at a highly regarded university (its name is not relevant for the narrative). I am writing here in this site because all my doctored friends do not believe a single word I tell them, and I have also been threatened of losing my post at both the morgue and the university. I do know however, that I am perfectly sane.

The events began when I took a trip, alone, as I have no close family, to the north of Europe, to Sweden. It was not on holidays, the University of Uppsala invited me to give teach there, an offer which I quickly accepted. I needed the money and Uppsala was quite a prestigious university, boasting 8 Nobel Laureates. However, I did not stay in Uppsala, I stayed at a town, further north, near a forest, a beautiful and serene place, just half an hour away. 

I stayed in an old, typical Swedish house, painted red with a dark rooftop, and a small garden. There was something odd about it, but I ignored it. I should never have done so. I stayed there, a few nice months, opening bodies and examining entrails, until it started getting cold, and the ravens started circling around the village crops. The leaves were starting to fall and there was something ominous about the whole village atmosphere. People seemed sullen and shut in, old ladies gave me hateful looks and kids avoided my path like I was some kind of pedophile. I was starting to think the townsfolk were avoiding me for some reason, and upon reaching that conclusion, I decided to talk to the only friend I had there, named Father Erik, the local priest. I told him about the townsfolk behavior as he was the only man who did not show any signs of being afraid of me. He looked at me and I remember he smiled, his teeth shining through his thin lips. “They think you are this year’s Midvinterblot.” “Mid-what?” I replied. Father Erik then explained it to me, how in this place, back in the Viking age and throughout the middle-ages had a ritual performed here, where men were chosen to be sacrificed to please the old Norse gods. Mid-winter blood, Father Erik Ragnerson said slowly, like the words meant anything to me. “And how is that related to what I told you?” I asked, as politely as I can. He shook his head. “You’re not from here, you wouldn’t understand. These people think…” he chuckled “think the dead come back every nine years to claim another sacrifice, another Midvinterblot.” I saw the Christian disbelief in his green eyes, and the same disbelief was also in mine, pale blue eyes. “Viking dead?” I asked, somehow amused, to which he responded affirmatively, I cannot remember his words correctly, adding that the souls of previous Midvinterblots are the responsible for the collection of yet another. We quickly shifted the conversation, as another proof of how foolish town superstition is something global and went through several beers, to which he did not say no, in spite of being a man of God.

That night I returned home from the church, slightly dizzy with the beverage. There was snow all over, and I held my scarf over my nose afraid it would freeze. My house was at the end of the road, and I kept walking steadily. I remember, as if it had been yesterday, the shivers that ran down my spine, as I head distant, loud, horns playing, and ululating voices. Coming from the dark, from the forest. The streetlamps flickered and I closed my eyes shut, and when I opened them, the sound was gone with the wind. I thought back then the cold was just messing with my brain, so as soon as I got home I drank hot tea and sat in front of the fireplace. I googled all Father Erik Ragnerson had told me and confirmed it. Then, with some curiosity, I accessed the town’s morgue register. That was one of the privileges my profession had. Running through the names, there was an odd pattern. I ran my hand through my hair and that time, the hair on the back of my neck prickled. Every nine years a person had been found dead, in gruesome circumstances, in the snow of Mid-winter. However, suicides were far more common in Sweden than car crashes where I come from and the police never paid it any heed. That was when I should have left, but my stubborn mind refused to see the evidence and I lingered, until Mid-winter finally arrived.

That day, I had forgot about all the townsfolk nonsense and was busy in my study, drawing an anatomical diagram when someone knocked on my door. As a precaution, I had become weary of serial killers or general psychos and went to the kitchen, grabbed a butcher’s knife and opened the door to find a small old wrinkled woman looking up at me. “Hello?” I asked inquisitively, the knife hidden behind my back. “Wear this tonight. For Midvinterblot.” She held out a white tunic to me. I remember snapping angrily at her, telling the few Swedish insults I knew and grabbed the tunic from her shriveling hands, hell-bent on burning the thing. The woman walked away and when she turned her head, she had the ugliest expression I have seen in this world, an expression of hate, disgust and cruelty combined.
 
Angrily, I kept working until I fell asleep on top of the table, only to be awoken by a man on the TV announcing a starless night. That is when the knock came. As soon as it hit my door, I felt my heart sink, the TV went quiet and all the lights, candles and illumination were gone with wisps of smoke. I stood up, gulped nervously and rationally grabbed the butcher’s knife, still standing near me from my encounter with the old woman earlier. I took cautious steps to the door and inhaling deeply, opened it with a full swing.

The image that was before my eyes still haunts me today. A procession of people walking in the snow, along the village road, dressed in white tunics, all shaven and either with their throats slit or limbs chopped of. All of them were pale, wore blank expressions and had dirt all over them, like they had literally rose from their graves. The drums sounded loud, and all was silent but from their thud. As soon as I opened the door, they all stopped and turned their heads to me at once, some in impossible angles, twisted and turned. Screaming, I closed the door. The townsfolk were hiding in their homes, afraid, and I remember how quickly the dead began to bang on my door, on my walls. Thinking quickly, I came up with the stupidest idea. I dressed the white tunic, took some white powder I had in the bathroom and ran to the backyard and around the house, pretending to be another one of the dead. As I struggled through the thick snow, my heart stopped when one of the dead turned its shaved head, which I remember was painted with dark patterns and circles, and spoke to me in a deep voice, something so obscure, it still shivers me today. For some reason, he seemed regal, as if he was the commander of the procession. He said something in old Swedish, a harsh voice from the afterlife, impossible to describe in words. I nodded instinctively, almost pissing myself and the man turned away and kept walking towards my house.

I ran as soon as he was a good distance away, my feet burning in the snow and my entire body turning purple with the cold. I remember knocking at Father Erik’s house, and how he opened the door. I remember taking a shower and crying in front of him like a baby, as I told him how I had luckily escaped. After I recovered somehow, Father Erik still eyed me with disbelief. “The man actually talked to you?” “Yes, he bloody did!” I snapped angrily. “What did he say?” the calm, still rational priest asked. Surely he had heard the drums, I though. I told him the words the dead had said, in old Swedish, and I saw his face go pale and his eyes widen. “What does it mean?” I asked, half afraid of the answer. “It means” Father Erik said, trembling. “Death awaits the heathen priest.” I dismissed his superstitions, trying to convince him there were more priests in the surrounding villages, and the next day I left Sweden, Father Erik Ragnerson and the town behind.

Yesterday, after nine years, I received a mail from Swedish authorities, telling me how a man had been brutally nailed to the front door of my previously owned house in Sweden and that they would desire to ask me some questions. 

His name was Erik Ragnerson.

narrativeofthelife,79,264,1qv1z1,377,"I might be a big, fat idiot, but I didn’t think anything was wrong when the CAPTCHA “Are you Human?” screen told me to kill one of my roommates.


I was trying to stream *Twilight* online, but I want you to know right now that it's not because I actually like the movie. I was drunk and needed something to laugh at, okay?

Anyway, I was past three shots of rum when the CAPTCHA screen appeared:


KILL ROOMMATE


I showed it to one of my roommates, Rachel, who almost pooped herself laughing. It wasn’t actually that funny, but drunk people think dirt is hilarious. Rachel and I watched the movie, while our other roommate, Ava, did homework in her room.


I was hungover in the morning, so I stayed in bed and streamed more movies. It was time for *Breaking Dawn*, except this time I was actually interested in Bella and Edward’s relationship. Don’t judge. I was sprawled in my bed, weakly navigating to the stream page, when another CAPTCHA appeared:


KILL AVA


I narrowed my eyes. What the fuck? I forgot about Breaking Dawn and sat up, rubbing at my eyes. At this point it wasn’t funny anymore, it was just weird. Ava isn’t a very common name, and what kind of sick CAPTCHA algorithm would generate stuff like that? I mean, I’m majoring in Tourism Management, but I sure as hell know that companies block out phrases like that.


Someone had to see this, no matter how bizarre it was. It was Sunday afternoon. Rachel was gone, and Ava was usually at the South’s most annoying megachurch, NewStart!!. Yes, the church’s name has two exclamation points in it. I heard some rustling on the other side of the apartment— Ava must’ve skipped.


“Yo, Ava!” I yelled. Maybe CAPTCHA went all NSA on me. “Come on, I want to show you something!”


“Yeah?” She rounded the corner into my room, wearing her usual placated smile.


I spun around the laptop on my lap to face her. I tilted the screen so she could read, and as I did her expression dropped from a smile to neutral as stone.


I watched her expression with one of those eager dog faces after you show someone something funny.


She punched me in the mouth.


I whipped over the side of the bed and smacked on the floor, eyes rolling to Ava for a split second before she kicked me hard in the stomach.


I retched and rolled over, scrabbling to get up, hair in my eyes and my heart thumping. She was screaming the entire time, this shrill, one-note screech, kicking me over and over again. As she rolled back for another kick my mind suddenly snapped into action. I threw myself to my desk and she threw herself at me, screaming and scratching at my eyes. I grabbed the knife in my desk and jammed it in her shoulder. She screamed, dislodging herself before running out of my room.


I stood, shaking, before lunging at my door to lock it. I drew back and caught my face in my mirror— my mouth was dribbling blood and I was missing a front tooth. I looked like a hillbilly. Whatever. I already go to college in South Carolina. Deal with that later.


Nothing that happened in the past five minutes made any sense, but I knew that I had to get out of the house. I couldn’t stay locked up in the apartment with her.


I grabbed my tote bag and pocketknife before waiting at my door for a minute, listening.


Nothing.


Knife in hand, I cracked my door open and looked around the crack. The living room was empty. I inched out of my room when I heard a whisper. It was coming from Ava’s room; quick and frantic whispers.


“*FIRSTANDLASTfirstandlastfirstandlastnononononononononononono*”


First and last? Uh, no thank you.


I rushed past her door and out the front door to the apartment complex. I decided to go to my friend Sam’s apartment. I thought that once I got to his apartment, I could explain things and call the police. Sam gets drunk a lot and wears fedoras ironically, but he’s still a pretty normal person.


He answered the door on the first knock, giving my hillybilly mouth the stink-eye. “Kierra, what the hell happened to your face?”


“Ava beat me up.”


“*What*?”


I pushed past him and dumped my stuff on his couch before grabbing paper towels from the kitchen. He plopped his generous frame on his couch and I explained my story in detail, pausing once in a while to blot my bloodied mouth. I split my lip on my tooth and it hurt like a mofo.


“Was she drunk?” he asked.


“No. You know she doesn’t get drunk.” I was getting antsy. I tossed the paper towel in the trashcan once the bleeding steamed. The whole thing seemed completely batshit. Ava was tough, but she wasn’t unstable.


I finally looked up at Sam. “Any ideas?”


“Call the cops…?”


Well, no shit, I could’ve just sat on my ass in my locked room and done that 30 minutes ago. I picked up my phone to call the cops when my phone buzzed. A text from a blocked number:


CAPTCHA
NEWSTART!!
GO NOW


That damn church Ava always went to. Great. This was the last thing I wanted to do hungover. Sam looked over my shoulder and we both frowned. 


“Who the hell texted you?”


“I don’t know. But I think we need to go to Newstart!!.”


“No way.”


“The last time I didn’t do something internet communication told me to do, I got the shit beaten out of me.”


“That’s a stupid reason to follow some random text!”


There was a knock on the door.


I flinched, but Sam brushed me off. ""It's just Trey back from church.""


He waddled to the door and Trey stepped into the apartment, smiling, before his eyes locked on me. His expression slacked.


""THE FIRST AND LAST,"" he screamed.


Oh, shit.

thorninhisside,78,176,1qtj6z,353,"I don’t know if what I saw was true. But, I’m pretty sure it was. You might think me mad, but I've read loads of accounts of people on the internet where people who have had shit like this happen to the recount it for others to read. And now, I’m doing the same. So here goes...	

Snapchat is a fun little app where people take selfies and send them to each other. I used Snapchat pretty much every day to send pictures of myself doing stupid things to my friends and they would send pictures of themselves back. That was, up until that one afternoon.

I had just returned home after a long day at school, made even longer by my friends absence due to his little brothers funeral, so I decided to recline on the sofa and procrastinate on my IPad for a while. As it usually did, my procrastination took the form on messing about on Snapchat. I had a few unopened pictures, several of them from my friend who had been absent that day. I opened them. Each of them was a selfie of him in his room after the funeral. He looked like shit. I guess he just wanted sympathy from the many girls he was looking to hook up with. So I sent him a picture of me with a message attached saying ‘Chin up man’. It wasn’t long until he replied. He just replied with a sombre image of himself and a simple message saying ‘thanks’. But, something caught my eye for the briefest second - A pair of eyes sunken and dead, peering out of his wardrobe. 

I was a little shaken by this, as I could not be sure that I saw what I saw. For, images sent via Snapchat can only be viewed for 10 seconds then they’re deleted. I replied immediately. ‘Are you all right man?’ With a picture of me trying not to look freaked out. I waited anxiously for his reply. When the little notification that I had ‘1 unread Snapchat’ popped up on my screen; I was slightly nervous about opening it. I was worried about what I’d see; I was worried about what was waiting for me… 

Curiosity took the better of me - I opened the message. Another picture of my friend and a simple message saying ‘Yeah…’ At this point, my IPad froze, leaving the picture message from my friend on the screen. I couldn’t do anything. The home button didn’t work nor did the lock button. I was left with the image of my friend staring back at me.  This gave my chance to view the picture with more depth. After close inspection, I saw nothing out of order. No eyes in the wardrobe door. In fact, his wardrobe door was closed. I was about to hook my iPad up to my computer to see if I could unfreeze my device when I noticed that my wardrobe door was wide open…

TheeMikeG,19,57,1r4fsf,275,"Dear Mike,

They’re letting me write a letter so I figured I’d get my story out there.

It was a routine night drop, nothing different from what we’ve done countless times before. The steady hum of the C-130 as it tore through the clouds was the only thing keeping me calm. Yeah, I’ve done this a lot, but you can never get rid of the nerves before a mission. We had an idea of what awaited us down there, but we couldn’t be a hundred percent sure. People are unpredictable, and that’s scary. The plan from higher was to have our five man team infiltrate by night drop a small village I can’t pronounce to search for and capture or kill a HVT whose name I also can’t pronounce. The gunship would rise up and provide overwatch until we were extracted. Airborne all the way, hooah. 

The LT joined us again, which he decided to do from time to time. Nice enough guy, I respected him. Was supposed to be having a baby girl soon, he would always talk about it during PT. Good for him, I could never hold down a relationship for very long. I figured it was just because I’ve seen too much shit to be normal and cuddle or whatever the fuck it is that couples do. The rest of the squad was the usual guys. Mitch, Craft, and Burroughs. All experts in their craft. We were a solid group and I’d take a bullet or hell, even two, for any of them. 

“Thirty seconds!” shouted the LT from the bench, a few spots to my right, closest to the door. The jumpmaster heaved the door upward and the familiar sound of air whooshing past the plane made my heart jump. There was always a kick. “Hook up!” he shouted. We all stood up in unison and clipped our static lines to the wire that ran through the plane above our heads. I tugged on my static line to make sure it was attached. There were no reserves for this one. The jumpmaster held up his hand. Five seconds. The red light turned green and the LT positioned himself by the door. The jumpmaster smacked his rear and the LT jumped out and was whisked away. My stomach turned in knots. Over a hundred jumps and I still hated this shit. I was last to go out. I tucked my head, took a hop out of the plane and suddenly there was the rush and I felt myself getting tossed. I heard my chute above and I breathed a sigh of relief. 
Looking up to check my canopy I saw a fully inflated chute and I thanked the Lord once again. I looked down for the rest of the squad and saw their chutes inflated too. Past them, I expected to see the ground, but there was only a thick smoke, or at least that’s what it looked like. A storm cloud? Why didn’t the jumpmaster hold off the jump until the bad weather passed? 

“Staus check” I heard the LT ask through the radio. 

As I watched the other’s canopies disappear into the black cloud I began to worry. I heard the squad all check in though so I felt a little better.  I held my hand up to my ear to activate our comms. 

“Sir, what’s the situation down there?”
	
“Zero visibility guys. Pretty foggy. Can’t see my own canopy,” he said.

Then I entered the black cloud and couldn’t see a damn thing. I heard something nearby. Flapping? My radio clicks before Mitch starts talking. “I heard something. Flock of birds?”
	
“We’re too high,” replied the LT. “Eyes and ears open.” I tried to look around but there was no point. I couldn’t even see my canopy. What if I was falling to my death right then? Heavy flapping got my focus. It sounded large, whatever it was. 
	
“Sir, something is up here with us,” I say.
	
“Simmons, stay calm, what’s gotten into –”
	
“Fuck!” Craft interrupts through the mic. Then I hear a long, painful scream far below me. 
	
“Jesus Christ!” yelled the LT, “Craft! You there?!”
	
Silence. Not even static. 
	
“Guys, stay calm. Get ready to hit any minute. I can’t see the ground in this shit but we’ll sort this out on the DZ.”
	
I checked my watch. It takes maybe two minutes to hit jumping from a mile up. It’s been six minutes and I know this wasn’t a HALO jump. Was I caught in a thermal? I pulled on my risers and felt myself drifting through the air. When I released, I didn’t notice any change in descent speed. The LT must have noticed the same thing because I could hear him cursing through the radio. There’s a loud screech; unlike anything I’ve ever heard. After it ended a few seconds later the LT had to shout over the commotion we were all making on the radio. We were scared. 
	
“Guys! I don’t know what the fuck is going on but stay calm! Weapons on amber.”
	
My combat gear was in a large sack between my legs, but my USP was on my belt. I took it out and held it ready. I didn’t know for what, but I was ready to go. How had we still not hit the ground yet? Then I got an idea. My combat load. We are supposed to release if before landing, and it slides down a twenty foot rope so we don’t break our legs when we land. I thought if I could cut it free, maybe I could hear it hit the ground. I asked for permission from the LT who quickly approved. He must have been as freaked out as me to allow me to abandon my combat gear. I pressed the handle on my hip and the gear slid down the rope and out of sight into the darkness. I took out my knife and sawed at the line until it snapped. I waited and waited but couldn’t hear a thing. 
	
I heard the flapping again, and someone fired their weapon, two, three times. Then silence. “Jesus Christ,” whispered the LT. “Status check.”
	
“Burroughs.”
	
“Simmons.”
	
Nothing.
	
“Sir, what the fuck is going on?!” I knew he wouldn’t have an answer, but I was desperate. 
	
“I have no idea.”
	
We drifted through the air for ten more minutes. Then I touched down. I didn’t hit hard, it was like I was just set down. Didn’t even have to fall over. I still couldn’t see a damn thing though. I heard quick steps and then Burroughs burst into view and tackled me to the ground. He was frantic. He begged me through tears to follow him. We wandered around until we came to the LT. He didn’t have a right half of his body. He was barely alive, sputtering through bloody lips for us to run. 
	
“My baby, my baby, my baby,” he whispered over and over until he didn’t say anything anymore. The cloud cleared from the area behind him and there was this thing. All I saw before I turned and ran was large leathery wings. I heard the screeching and the flapping of those awful wings again. Burroughs screamed as he was ripped backwards from beside me. Somehow I burst out of the cloud and I saw headlights. I nearly got hit by the jeep but dove out of the way just in time. Out got two guards who spoke a language I didn’t understand. Burroughs was the translator. They prodded me with machine guns and kicked and beat me until I was barely conscious. How did they not see the thing behind me? They dragged me into the back of their vehicle and drove me to their camp. 

I’ve been their POW for nearly a month now. If you get this letter, please get my story out there. I’m not crazy, I promise. I can’t explain what happened any better than that. We’re not alone. Something terrible is going on over here. Time to go; they’re beckoning me to come outside. It’s awfully dark out there. Is a storm coming in?

AmbiguousGopher,26,58,1r5xlc,275,"For most of my life, I've been drawn to a certain room of my house. A bedroom at the far end of my basement, which used to be a guest bedroom. I can't really explain why, but I just always wanted to sleep there. Until the age of 8, my older brother and I shared a room right across the hall from the bedroom of my parents. When he was 13, however, he moved into that bedroom, and over the years, the room become even more interesting. The room is now filled with posters of The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix, an authentic Spanish sword he bought hangs above his desk, and loads of other bits and pieces which captured my imagination when I was younger. To top it all off, there was an air vent connecting his room and mine. Almost directly below my room, I could hear him some nights talking to his friends on the phone while playing video games late into the night. I envied his freedom. If I had tried that, my parents right across the hall would hear me and I'd be grounded.

When I was 13 myself, my brother and sister (twins) left for college. Now the only child at home, I called my brother up one weekend and asked, 
""Can I have your room?""
My brother paused for a long time before responding
""No.""
He gave no explanation, but I didn't really care. I could understand that when he came to visit, He'd want his own room to sleep in. For 4 more years, i didn't ask to have the room again, but when i was 17, my brother bought a house. To me, it seemed like he was pretty much beyond the point of having any reason to care about his old room, so one day when he called to check up on things, I asked again.
This time he responded more quickly. His voice sounded casual, but at the same time, It kinda freaked me out. He said,
""Nah, let mom make it a guest room again. Besides, your room is super classy! My room isn't that great.""
And so, yet again, I let it go. I stayed in my room and didn't really think anything of it... that is, until last week. 

This summer, I started having severe anxiety attacks coupled with spells of incapacitating depression, especially at night. I've been on different medicines to help, and have been going to therapy to help work on relaxation techniques. Last week, my therapist noted that sometimes the brain can form associations with certain rooms or areas. She suggested that my brain, due to the recurring spells in my room, may have formed a negative association with it. She told me that switching rooms may help me relax when I start having an attack.

That night, I did it. I switched to my brother's room, and it was amazing. Since my basement always stays around below room temperature, the sheets and pillow stayed cool, which was just to my liking. I slept better than I'd slept in weeks, and thought that perhaps this room was going to turn things around. But the second night didn't go as well. I woke from a nightmare, and felt as if there was someone watching me. I shook the feeling and went back to sleep. This kind of thing happened for a few more nights; each time, I awoke more worried than the last. 

Then came the big one. I fell asleep as usual, and I began to dream: another nightmare, but this time it was more vivid. In the dream, I saw looking at my brother, when he was only 13 or 14 years old. He was sitting on his bed, talking to something. I couldn't see it, but he was looking at an angle which suggested something much larger than himself. Tears were flowing steadily from his eyes, and he was pleading, BEGGING the thing to go away, to leave him alone. The power in the room went out; I heard a horrible screeching, like a pig being tortured. The lights turned back on and my brother lay there, unconscious. A large black bruise had appeared on his ribs. The clock in his room recovered from the power outage, blinking the numbers ""00:00"". My brother then jerked upright and walked over to the only poster in his room at the time, his Hendrix poster. He took a pen form his desk and put a tally mark on the wall behind it.

I jerked up in my brother's bed. I turned on the lamp and looked around the room. I noticed every poster. Sweat started pouring from my forehead, burning my eyes. I looked at the clock. The numbers blinked ""00:00"".

horriddaydream,37,132,1r0562,261,"By the time that I was seventeen years old, my parents sighed as they walked into my room one afternoon and told me that it was a necessity that I get my license. I had been hanging onto that shitty little piece of paper for months that said that I could drive, that meaningless little permit that meant nothing in comparison to the real deal. My own license. My reasoning behind waiting to get it? I was terrified of the road, despite the recognition others gave me that I was doing fairly well as only a permitted driver. My father handed me the keys to his old Explorer that night with the promise of, ""If you schedule your appointment and make it happen, this SUV is yours."" And as far as I was concerned, that was all I needed to hear.

The license took a good four attempts. Parallel parking was not 'right up my alley' and every time I would exit the driving center with that smug look of sadness written across my face, my father would pat me on the back and say, ""Next time."" And he was right; after that fourth time and only a few short months, I had received my license and I exited the center that day smiling as I held up my 'temporary card', flashing it to both of my parents, them excitedly smiling and nodding at one another. I drove them out for pizza right after.

We lived in a fairly disgusting country area even though my parents were well-off and lived on their own secluded road in a huge, stone house that all my friends seemed to be quite envious of. There was always your usual shit on the backroads to my house - dead animals, trash, things left behind from people's midnight outdoor sex sessions including garments of clothing and used condoms. I would shake my head and swerve out of the way for these things as carefully as possible; protecting this SUV was a very important ordeal to me. 

One day as I was driving into town from our backroad, I came up around the corner and had no time to think as my eyes met with a cardboard box, fairly large, maybe even large enough to hold a large screen television. In the blink of a second my car has collided with it and it took a few seconds for it to become apparent to me that I had hit HARD, and whatever was inside it, was now damaged all to hell. My tires had shredded the box to pieces as I had seen it fly up in front of me as it got pulled along with the car. I hadn't seen what was inside.

I was cursing up a storm inside my car as I pulled off to the side. There were no houses around here and I felt uncomfortable with doing so because it was getting closer to night and I really didn't want to be back on a near-abandoned road, checking out some stupid person's box contents, and be picked up by some creep who would want to do who-knows-what with me.

I turned off the car and slowly opened my door, not looking into my mirror or anything before getting out. I slammed my door and trudged back to the start of the bend where the box had been. It was in that moment's time that a part of me wished that I had 1.) Either not gone back there, or 2.) Not even left the house that night to go pick up some measly groceries for my parents. Nothing could compare to the feeling that struck my heart as I noticed the two small bodies ripped nearly to shreds in front of me, two little children who had been alive and well probably playing inside of a box, before I came along and completely fucked their day all to pieces. They wore looks of total sadness on their faces from what I could make out, a brother and a sister perhaps, both with black hair and rags for clothing. Underprivileged. Dead.
	
The trauma and torment I endured within the next few weeks was the worst experience of my life. I worked alongside the police as these children went unidentified, and nobody could piece together where these two children had come from. I got little to no sleep at night wondering what their lives had been like, what their parents were thinking, wondering about where their two kids were. Did they even care? Had their parents been homeless and just left them alongside the road in a box, and they had decided it would be worth a try to make a game out of it and push the box to the middle of the road? I mean, why?! 

One night I was getting a good night's sleep for once after this traumatizing incident, and I heard a knock at the front door to our house. I swept out into the hallway and noticed that my parent's door at the far end of the hallway was still closed and that they hadn't heard the rapping, which was usual because they were horribly heavy sleepers. I ran downstairs as lightly and quickly as possible and opened the front door, but to my surprise, nobody was standing there as I had thought would be. I assessed the situation and realized that it was stupid of me to answer the door in the middle of nowhere late at night, but then I saw the box. It was sitting off to the side of the porch and I leaned out of the door, plucked it up, and brought it into the house. There was nothing on it. It was light. It was around the same size as the one that contained the children.

I took a kitchen knife and seized open the tape that held the box closed, and again to my surprise, noticed that the only thing inside it was a small piece of paper with writing on the inside.

My heart skipped a beat. I dropped it to the floor and screamed in sheer terror and panic, until my parents were both at my side, hugging me and comforting me. 

""Unwanted child? Make a donation.""

theworldisgrim,42,79,1qsnvw,252,"I was jolted awake about an hour ago, confused and disoriented; my heart was pounding and my sheets were soaked in sweat. Some slavering, malevolent horror was in the trailer with me, creeping up on me while I slept with poised claws and razor teeth. The absolute certainty of this coated my mouth with the metallic taste of fear, sour and dry and thick. I grabbed the baseball bat that lays beneath my cot and tip-toed around the cramped darkness of my trailer, straining to hear over the keening of the wind outside.

And the pounding of my own heart. 

Of course, there was nothing here except my goldfish and yours truly, the sweaty guy in his underwear. It was the gusting wind that startled me awake - it happens quite often in the late autumn and early winter. The wind rips through the scrub of skeletal trees that surround the trailer park and charges, with a lion's roar, into our lonely huddle of frail little shelters. It gibbers and shrieks and pounds on our walls with fists of dead leaves and frozen grit.

Satisfied that I wasn't about to become chow for some unspeakable creature, I laid back down on my squeaky, saggy old cot and tried to get back to sleep - but I couldn't. Instead, I found myself thinking about that night in the penitentiary, the night of the lockdown; I kept thinking about Mikey and Big Rob and the rest of them, all of us huddled in a cell with the lights off and the frigid northwest winds howling at the walls. After a while, I gave up trying to sleep. Instead, I sat down in front of the computer and I started typing. I'm no story teller, not like Mikey or Hutch, but I'll try my best.

When I first came to the Pen, the thing that struck me the most about the place was just how *much* the cons talk. On the occasions when I'd served time in the County jail, there had been talk, sure, but it was terse and impersonal  - when they're only serving a few months, I guess a lot of people feel the situation is too temporary to bother forging any ties with their fellow inmates. You'd play cards with your cellie, or you'd sit in the day room and watch TV in relative silence; the only time that there would ever be any noise or action was when a scrap broke out over a card game. Fights were the only thing that passed as excitement in County; every other moment of the day was comprised of dull, boring nothing. Going in, you just hoped that the food wouldn't be too bad, and that your cellie wouldn't end up being a gang member or a meth-head biker waiting out a long patch of dead time. People, in other words, who might beat the shit out of you as a way to pass the hours.

The Pen, though - it's an incredibly noisy, smelly, *vocal* environment. I remember, very clearly, the moment when my little group of new arrivals were let out of the Fish Tank and into our new home, a pod housing two hundred inmates. I was overwhelmed by the deafening din of voices and activity when the hacks marched us, bundles in hand, out onto the range. Of course, there were the obligatory cat-calls and wolf-whistling, but most of the cons seemed completely oblivious to us - they were too busy living the ebb and flow of penitentiary life.

Of course, this was not actually true. Cons see everything. And I mean *everything*. But they talk even more.

My first cellie wanted both my bale and my ass, in that order. That wasn't happening. I hammered him in the mouth and it was on - the fight spilled out of the cell and into the corridor of the pod. He was a big, tough old bull, but I had him leaking and his confidence was shaken. Before the C.O.'s got to us, I'd managed to get the nasty old fuck face-down onto the floor, and was whamming away on the back of his head and neck like a jackhammer. Then the hacks got there and one of them laid a size twelve boot upside my skull. The kick knocked my brain clear over the Moon: the world immediately went out of focus and it stayed that way for almost twelve hours. I spent the next three weeks in the Hole for fighting, and when I got out I was placed in a different pod. Word had got around that this fish wasn't exactly new, and that I had a mean right-cross; no one bothered to try and roll up on me in the yard that day, and when I sat down at chow with my new cellie and some of his boys, no one objected. I had been checked, and I'd passed the test. I wasn't a punk or a sissy: I could sit with the men.

Yeah, it's a different world, the Pen is, and it has wildly different rules. You couldn't fully understand unless you've been there.

It wasn't long before I settled into a routine: up for headcount and chow, off to work in the laundry, chow, nap, work out, chow ... and then the struggle to fill the dead hours between supper and lights-out. There wasn't much to do. The cons played cards, betting with tobacco bales purchased from the commissary and individual, hand-rolled smokes. Some watched TV, and others watched the wall. Some watched each other; tensions were always high between the rival gangs. Dope fiends spiked what they liked to spike in the bathrooms. Daddies took their sugar-boys into rented cells or the showers, and they got some ass-pussy while a homeboy held watch for the cops.

And there was, of course, a lot of talk. Talk of family back home, women had and lost, of misdeeds proudly done. There were enough stories flying around that place to fill a library.

 My cellie was an old con named Mikey. He had originally been sentenced to fifteen years for second-degree murder during a robbery - but he had gotten into so much trouble since landing in the Pen that he'd managed to acquire an additional ten years on top of that. Mikey was doing all day and he'd made peace with that fact - a good cat, all in all, a straight shooter who didn't fuck with the spike. The thing was, he'd kill just about anyone, if he got it into his head that he wanted to. In earlier years, Mikey had been a trigger-man for the bikers. He'd been convicted for the murders of six people, and was a suspect in sixteen others ... and I can well imagine that a number of them had probably been friends of his, at one point or another. In certain circles, a good friend can become your murderer in the blink of an eye.

That's the kind of people you do time with in Maximum security.

Mikey and his crew liked nothing better than to spend a Sunday evening crowded up in someone's cell, drinking Pruno and shooting the shit. Personally, I didn't care much for the hooch - it tasted like rotting garbage with a heavy fruit bouquet - but the stories were welcome. When Mikey or one of his homeboys were on a roll, we could all forget ourselves and be somewhere else for a little while. As far as cons go, they were good fuckin' guys, they were, and these bull sessions were the glue that held Mikey's crew together. I remember watching and listening for hours on end, spellbound, as Mikey or Big Rob or whoever wove a tapestry of words in the thin air around us. They'd make us roar with laughter, clench in rage, and even silently choke up in sadness. Some of those guys could play a man's emotions like a violin with their storytelling. They were masters of the form.

Most of the time, the stories were pretty coarse (which was to be expected - look where they were coming from), and occasionally, they were downright fucking horrifying. But ... there's one in particular that I can remember word for word, quite literally; I can actually close my eyes and *see* Mikey and Rob Hutch and the rest of them, sitting there in the cell that night, all of us bathed in the sickly red glow of the emergency lights and transfixed by what we were being told. This particular story likes to pop up in my head in the small, dead hours of the night, when the harsh winds of drab old November lash and rock my rusty little trailer hard enough to wake me up, as they did tonight.

Coincidentally, it was on a November night just like this when I heard this story. I was about a year into my four-year sentence for armed robbery, and this was my second winter in the Pen. I recall that the goddamned wind was cutting through the walls really badly that night, and the drafts were freezing our toes solid. There had been a murder that day, and the whole Pen was on lockdown, all five pods and the Protective Custody unit, too. Big Rob Hutch was a man who had his ear to the ground, and he had known that the lockdown was imminent; we had just enough time to make preparations for what was coming. Happy for a chance to hang out and get fucked up, seven of us quickly herded into his cell with our bedding, snacks from the commissary, and as much gear as we could get our hands on. I remember that we were all wrapped up in our thin, scratchy blankets like convict burritos. The blankets were grey and made of rough wool; upon checking into the Razor Wire Inn, you were issued one and one only. In the winter, blankets were at a premium. Men would fight for them; sometimes, even kill for them.

Mikey and Big Rob were both sitting on the lower bunk. Coltrane and his kid Remmie had the top one. I was freezing my ass on the floor, along with Nick and Richie. The young pups had to sit on the floor; that's just the way it was. The old cons got to snuggle their asses into the relative comfort of the thin mattresses that covered the squeaky spring-slats (and, in Coltrane's case, the old con's bitch, as well). We weren't complaining out loud about it, though - we knew better than to do that.

Big Rob was a trustee, and one of his duties was to mop the floors in the prison morgue. He was telling us what had happened when the coroner performed his autopsy on Stutters. Stutters was a junkie who had been suspected of ratting out various other cons to the cops in exchange for smack. He was the reason why the entire Pen was on lockdown. He had been discovered in his bunk after lunch, dead as day-old dogshit and full of ragged holes. The shiv was found in a toilet in the shower room. It had been made from plastic bags, heated to melting with a Bic, then compressed to form a sturdy, sharp little weapon. 

""So I'm mopping up by where they keep the gurneys, and down the hall the door's open a bit, so I can see the Doc leaning over Stutters on the table. He's humming and singing to himself like usual, and I'm smiling at how shitty his voice is, when all of a sudden the Doc says, 'Holy shit, wouldja lookit *that!*' and then he starts gagging and retching. Then - get this - then he actually screams - for real, he fuckin' *screamed* - and he yells, *'Jesus Christ, it's all over my fucking arm!'* He runs outta the room and down the other hall, and I'm like, 'What the fuck is that all about?' I heard him yelling for his assistants or whatever they are, the younger ones. They all come runnin' back and I heard one of the assistants say, 'Oh, fuck, you gotta be kiddin' me!' Then the smell hits me, from all the way down that long-ass hallway, and it's *putrid,* boys - it smelled like a combination of rotting flesh and an old shit-house in August. I had to grab my nose and run the fuck outta there. Worst thing I ever smelled.""

Nick asked, ""What was it from?"" and shifted uncomfortably where he sat beside the toilet.  He was a good bit younger than me; he'd just celebrated his twentieth birthday a few months ago. It was his first time in and he'd drawn the fuckin' short straw - fifteen years, eight before he'd be considered for parole. His uncle, fortunately for Nick, was also serving time in the same facility: he was an upper-echelon Hell's Angel who ruled both B Pod and C Pod with an iron fist. As a result, Nick was getting the easiest ride a first-timer to the Pen ever had. Coltrane and Mikey had personally welcomed the kid into the crew, as per the old man's orders. He was fresh-faced and physically soft. I occasionally wonder if he'd ever really known just how bad it could have been for him in there.

""Apparently,"" Big Rob said, lowering his voice to a husky stage whisper, ""Stutters was getting checked for pokes and track marks pretty regular, because he got busted so much for possession. So he started shooting in his ass. But not, like, in his ass-*cheek*, ya dig; I mean right into the wall of his rectum. He was shooting it right inside his fuckin' *asshole*, man. Can you imagine that? Pretty soon, he developed a fuckin' *horrible* abscess. Because of all the fecal bacteria and crap that was living up his old dirt road, the abscess got infected real bad. After a while, it skinned over with a crust of white blood cells and gross stuff and ballooned out into a giant pus-bubble. That bubble got so big that it eventually closed up the poor fucker's ass, and I mean right fuckin' *shut*. He was apparently going around like that for weeks, man, for real. *Weeks*. It musta hurt like a bitch ... so, the Doc saw something kinda bubbling out of the dead fucker's asshole and he prodded at it with his scalpel and *pop!* Out gushes a metric fuckload of bloody green pus, full of dead bacteria and stinkin' like the Devil's ballsack.""

""Aw, fuck, that's just *dirty*, man,"" Mikey groaned, and mimed throwing up all over Hutch. We were all wrinkling our noses in disgust and shaking our heads. 'Dirty' was not nearly adequate for this disgusting image.

""That ain't it, though, my friend ... that ain't it. The worst part,"" he continued, ""was the fact that Stutters had been bunged up with this fuckin' pus balloon for a few weeks or so, y'know? It stopped up his shit-canal. When the Doc popped that thing with his scalpel - aw, hell. It was a literal shitstorm. It spurted out of his ass like a high-pressure hose.""

We regarded that image for a moment or two in stunned silence. I felt a bit ill.

""So ... *fucking ... DIRTY!""* Mikey roared, and despite what I'd just heard, I had to laugh. Coltrane and the others joined in. Remmie just looked disgusted. He was filing his nails. Remmie was no longer just another cellblock punk, a weaker man that traded what he had to trade in order to get by in world dominated by strength; in recent months, he'd gone and went full-blown sissy. After a year or so of enduring the subservient ""female"" role at the receiving end of Coltrane's hog-leg (Coltrane was, in fact, the one who'd turned Remmie out in the first place) he'd finally stopped playing the part of a woman and was now living it.  It was apparent that he'd started taking illicit female hormones -his arm hair had thinned out, and it seemed that he had recently grown the barest suggestion of breasts beneath his orange jumpsuit. By the time I got out of the Pen, Remmie had changed his name to Rhianne and was the wife of (get ready for this) none other than Nick's uncle, the unofficial King of Pods B and C. Rhianne was known for causing savage fights amongst inmates who were vying for his attention. That, incidentally, was exactly how Coltrane ending up earning an unexpected early parole ... a 'back-door-parole', as they call it. Because you don't leave through the front gate when you're dead.

""So the Doc got shit on by a corpse,"" said Richie, in a slow and dreamy tone. ""It was *pus*-covered shit. That's fucked up, man. Hey ... do ya think that happens a lot to him? Or, like, was that the first time?"" Richie had snorted some hydromorphone earlier, and now he was somewhere in the clouds, floating around with a stoned grin on his face.
 
""Richie, *that's* just fuckin' ..."" Mikey trailed off. ""Actually, it's a good question. Want some hootch, boys?""

I was just opening my mouth to say *Fuck, no* and then there was a POP and everything was dark. The cons began yelling and hooting all across the pod, both tiers on both sides. Big Rob yelled, *""Shut up, ya fuckin' idiots! It's just a blackout, fer Christ's sake, pipe the fuck down!""* and, for a wonder, some of them actually did. The thing was, Big Rob Hutch was ... well, just that. Big. He was as big as a buffalo. I was surprised that the lower bunk could support both Rob *and* Mikey, who was not exactly small himself.

The emergency lights snapped on, soft and red and eerie. It made the common area of C Pod look like a scene from an apocalyptic horror movie. We could see the guard standing there in the guard hut through the bullet-proof glass, waiting to see how the cons were going to react to the power going out during a lockdown: now, not only were we being sequestered in our cramped little cells for an indeterminable length of time, we had also been rendered unable to properly read a book (a number of the cons could actually read, and did) or see your hand while playing cards, or even listen to the radio, for Christ's sake. The hack was a dark figure swathed in dim red, his body language alert and poised for action. I'm pretty sure it was Robson who was the boss on hut duty that night. Robson was a dead-eyed, square-jawed oaf without an ounce of empathy in his whole body ... and he just so happened to have a twelve-gauge shotgun on hand with a modified choke. I fervently hoped that no one would take it into their heads to start some serious shit - because if they did, there was a good chance we'd *all* regret it.

There was a lot of hollering and door-kicking around the pod, but it soon became apparent that the ruckus was just for show, and was half-hearted at best. We all silently thanked Whoever might be listening that the Emergency Reaction Team wasn't going to be called in. The ERT didn't fuck around. Kevlar-suited and anonymous in their visored helmets, they'd march into the pod and indiscriminately barge into cell after cell, busting heads and whapping out teeth with their batons. Hell, you might even get shot - and the ERT shoot to kill.

Richie broke the silence. ""Man, I was gettin' real worried there, for a minute. If the fuckin' Goon Squad busted in here and found all our shit, we'd be dicked."" Richie was doing six years for selling pills, the sentence for a second-time loser. Oxycontin and Hydrocodone were his chemicals of choice. Faced with the boredom of prison life, he'd started using the products he sold. He was a straight-up junkie by Christmas of that year. Mikey didn't care about anyone using junk - would even have a little snort here and there, himself - but he didn't like addicts, not one bit. He cut Richie out of the crew. Addled by junk, plagued by debt, weak and alone, Richie ended up bunking with some fellas from the top tier across from us. The ""black"" tier. In a maximum-security penitentiary, this has unpleasant connotations. Business might occur between the color lines, but that's generally where any benign fraternization ends. You might not be racist when you're on the outside, but when you're inside, you don't have much choice. To be blunt, it's like this: if you're white, you stick with the whites. The black and Hispanic cons don't want to be your buddy, and vice versa. There are, for a variety of reasons, a large number of hostilities between the color lines. They'll stomp the shit out of you ... or worse. When we got word that Richie had been seen walking, his face cast down, up the stairs to that second tier ... well, we knew. Richie had heavy debts. Forced to either trade himself or die, Richie had chosen life.

Jesus. I felt horrible for how it ended for Richie; I still do. His desperate last bid to cling to his wretched mortal existence only prolonged the inevitable; he was dead within a month. One day, after enduring his morning gang-rape, something must have finally snapped in Richie's head. His will to live crumbled and fell. Richie stayed behind while his tormentors went down for morning chow, and he stuck a spike in his arm for the last time. High as a kite, Richie then hung himself from the corner post of the top bunk. He did it with a rope made of knotted-together socks.

I'm rambling, now, aren't I? Sorry, I do that sometimes - you'll just have to bear with me, I guess. I'm not a good at this, not like Mikey or Hutch. I'm just a lonely guy who can't sleep some nights, when the shrieking wind could be mistaken for the wailing of lost souls, shaking and rattling the windows in their frames. Even though I was released from the Pen fifteen years ago, I can't shake the feeling that I'm somehow still inside. But I suppose that we're all imprisoned by *something*, on some level, aren't we? On nights like tonight, my prison is this rusty trailer. It's my pathetic, menial job. My divorce. My raw, red-eyed fury, unfocused and impotent. It's sorrow and regret. On nights like tonight, my prison is the past, and my inability to leave it behind.

So there we all were, sitting there in the weird red gloom and listening to all the yelling and bullshit slowly die down. Richie abruptly went on the nod: Nick balanced a shoe on his head. We all chuckled. Coltrane started talking about the hockey game that was about to start, then abruptly shut up. We were on lockdown with no electricity - there would be no hockey game that night, not for us. We passed a jay around, and when that one was roached we passed another.

Finally, Mikey spoke up and broke the silence. ""So ... who's up for some Twilight Zone shit tonight? I gotta good one for ya. You remember the last time the power went out, Hutch?""

Hutch shot him a dark look, then did something very unusual, for a hardened con - he shuddered. ""You wanna tell the boys *that* story? I dunno, man ...""

""Why not? Fuck, the lights are out and the wind's a-howlin' out there. Perfect time for it.""

 ""Okay, fuck it. Let's do it."" Big Rob cleared his throat and said, ""Okay, boys, it's time for a scary story. Crowd around the fuckin' campfire and grabba cup of this fine wine.""

""It's more of a brandy, I think, Hutch,"" Mikey grinned, and offered me some. Reluctantly, I accepted a Styrofoam cup of the murky, eye-watering stuff and steeled myself to swallow it. I was feeling a bit happier, now - I've always been a fan of spooky stories.

His voice stern, Mikey growled, ""Okay, first thing's first - this shit is one hundred percent true. Got it? We're not bullshitting about any of this. For real. So don't tell us that we're full of shit, or you can go have a fuckin' sleep-over with that asshole over in the Hack Shack.""

""Got it,"" Richie grunted, then flopped over onto the floor. He was out of it.

""This all went down a long time ago, before any of you were here. At least twelve years, I'd say. Mikey?""

""Yeah, fer sure. At least that long. Back when these little punks were still givin' out handjobs in Juvie, ha.""

""It was a while back, anyways. Me and Mikey here were both running with different crews back then, into different shit, but we knew each other. I guess I woulda been about your age,"" he said, pointing down at me. ""So, one day The Fish Tank had just been emptied out into the pod, and there's a new fish with 'em that immediately starts turning heads. I was playing checkers on the tier upstairs when they all came walking through the gate, looking like a bunch of lost little lambs down there on the range. They came toddling in behind a couple of the hacks, and at the end of the line is the prettiest little sweet-boy this whole penitentiary has ever seen. I don't play no grab-ass like Coltrane up there, but this kid ... he was, I dunno ... almost like an angel, or something. He was *too* perfect, like a picture out of a magazine, y'know? Slender and fair-haired, teenybopper heart-throb material. Yeah, the kid was pretty, all right, and he looked like he'd be easy to punk.""

Big Rob took a moment to pause and force back a swig of the awful, cloying Pruno, a noxious blend of fermented fruit, sugar packets and yeast. As he grimly swallowed it down, Mikey jumped in and continued the story. ""The new fish immediately drove the whole pod completely fuckin' nuts. The wolves were losing their minds, for real. The guards were looking worried - a pretty kid like that can cause a lot of hard feelings between the bulls. Hard feelings usually turn into murder. So they released the other fishies to the care of the boss at the guard hut, then hustled the pretty-boy off to Protective Custody, post-fuckin'-haste. They kept him there for a few days, but the wolves didn't forget about him, not for a moment. All the time, they're asking about the kid to the trustees who had access to PC. They're asking if the kid's lonely, if he wants a candy bar or a fuck-book or a baggie of fuckin' horse, whatever the kid might possibly want ... they're handing the trustees love notes to give to him, money, weed, all kinds of shit. Finally, a con named Holbrook called in some heavy favours, and the hacks moved the kid back into the pod. More to the point, into Holbrook's cell. I remember watching as the hacks walked the young fella across the pod and up the stairs to his new home. The kid had no expression in those wide, blue eyes. None at all. Just ... blank.

""Holbrook was a big, greasy son of a bitch, real nasty. You could smell him from twenty feet away. Complete psycho, that guy. Man, I'll tell ya - watching as Brookie grinned and waited at the door of his cell for his new little bunk-buddy to arrive, hell ... it made me feel sorry for the kid. He was planning do bad things to the boy, you could see it in that grin. He was gonna hurt 'im. No expression at all, though, on that kid's face. I remember thinking that the fishie was either brave as fuck or just too stupid to understand what was in store for him.""

Rob tossed back the rest of the hootch in his Dixie cup and tried not to gag. ""Gah, this shit is just fuckin' *awful.* Who brewed this?"" His voice sounded dry and burnt.

""Our fine neighbours just down the hall, that's who,"" Mikey chuckled. ""They managed to hide it in the toilet tank long enough to get 'er finished, and holy *Jesus*, ain't it nasty.""

""Fuck, I think I'm going blind already."" Hutch held out his cup and Mikey poured him another glurt out of the plastic bag, taking care to make sure that the sock he was using as a filter didn't slip out and spill rotting fruit cocktail all over the bunk. I tried a sip of mine and almost retched. They all had a good har-dee-har at this - except for Richie, I guess. Richie was still laying on the floor, his eyelids fluttering and twitching.

""It broke more than a few hearts, to see Holbrook get his dirty hooks into the kid first. He would wreck the kid's asshole and destroy his soul, that was the general consensus. Come morning, they'd be rolling the kid out to the infirmary and, afterward, probably stick him back into PC for a twenty-four-hour suicide watch. Even if he *did* come back to the pod again, no one would want the kid, not after the permanent damage that Brookie was liable to do to him.""

""See how lucky you are?"" Coltrane said to Remmie, and the little Frenchman smiled down at his nails in response. Then kept filing them, delicately, with all of his concentration. Every now and then, I wonder if Remmie was already planning the flirtations and indiscretions that would inevitably result in Coltrane's murder, his skull smashed in with a twenty-pound dumbbell in the weight pit. Coltrane, the bull queer who had taken Remmie's manhood and, eventually, transformed him into something that he'd probably never wanted to be ... thinking about it now, I'm pretty sure he was. And I can't blame him for it.

Rob told us, ""I heard screaming that night. It was muffled, but I could still hear it. So did my cellie - back then, it was old Johnny Franzini. I whispered up at him, *'Hey, you hear that shit, man? Fuck, that's awful,""* and he answered, real matter-of-fact, 'That boy, he hadda know it was coming, hey? He's too pretty like a girl to be here in this place. He should have never come here!' As if the guy had fuckin' volunteered, or something. I just shook my head and told Johnny to go to sleep. I felt so *bad* for the kid, y'know? I think that was one of the worst nights I ever had in here.""

""I heard it, too,"" Mikey interjected. "" I think we all did, including the bosses on duty that night. But no one went to check on him, 'cuz money makes the fuckin' rules around here, not the Warden or the government. It's money. I don't doubt that the sick fuck offered big coin for the kid. And some cold son of a bitch sold him without a second thought.""

Hutch nodded sourly. ""Money's a whore. That's okay, though, 'cuz there's a thing called karma, too. When morning came, lo and behold, Brookie ain't standing outside his cell, waitin' to be accounted for. Neither is the kid. A whisper popped up real quick and spread down the lines like the breeze, and it said, *'Holbrook went apeshit on the kid last night 'n killed him. He's waiting in his cage for the ERT to come in and bust his head.'* The boss doing the head count paused at Holbrook's cell and every con craned his head to see what was gonna happen next, all of us in unison. I seen the hack pull out his radio with one hand and his club with the other. He started talkin' real fast into his radio; at the same time he's slowly walking towards the door of Brookie's cell with his club poised to bash a skull in, like he's trying to ward someone off. He started yelling for the other hacks to get the fuck over there, pronto! They all came thundering past with their keys jangling and their boots clomping, and then we all got ordered to step back into our cells with empty bellies. I heard 'em down there at Brookie's cell, yelling into their radios and stomping around, and then I heard someone barf. I heard the puke splatter on the tiles.

""We had to stay in our cells for a few hours, and there was a lot of bitching. I remember being totally, completely pissed at Holbrook, me and Johnny Eff. We'd assumed that he'd gone psycho on the new fish and cut the kid's throat while he was fuckin' him, or some shit like that. But then some of the emergency response guys came past wheeling a gurney, and when they wheeled it past us again you coulda knocked me flat with a pea-shooter ... because it was *Holbrook* strapped in there, not the kid. I only saw him for a few seconds, but I remember that his face was fucked. It was mostly gone. Stripped right down to bloody sinew and bones. No skin or muscles left. It was fucking *gruesome*. I kinda gasped out loud, and even close-mouthed, crooked-nosed old Johnny Franzini had to look twice and say, 'Eh, what the fuck?' They only way I knew it was him was the hair - a big, greasy mop of it, like a caveman. The sheet covering the body was soaked right through with his blood. I think that the rest of him had matched his face.""

Nick whistled and said, ""Fuck, man, that's hardcore,"" then sparked another joint. We floor-dwellers had almost forgotten about the discomfort of our numb behinds and tingling feet: we'd forgotten the lockdown and the power outage and even poor Stutters, who'd not only died a violent death, but had also died with his ass blocked up by a cystic sore the size of a man's fist. Mikey and Hutch were telling a story and we were *living* it, you know what I mean? We were right there.

Mikey said, ""Must've been five minutes later, the cops are rolling this crazy-looking thing down the block and I'm like, 'What the fuck is that?' to my cellie, but he don't know either. Before too long, they roll it past again and I'm like, 'Ohhhhh *shit*, lookit this!' You ever see *Silence of the Lambs*? The dolly-cart thing that they strap Anthony Hopkins into when they're moving him? Yeah, that's exactly what it was - and they've got the kid strapped into it. Bite-mask and everything. And the kid is just *soaked* in blood, man. It was dripping off his clothes and I could hear it pattering on the floor behind him. It left a trail on the floor.

""They let us out for breakfast about a half-hour after that, but by then it was almost lunch and we got served a fucked-up mix of warm lunch and cold breakfast. There was more talking going on than eating, though - and everyone was saying the same thing; we were all saying, 'What the fuck did the kid *do* to 'im?' Most people thought that he must've gotten hold of Brookie's shiv somehow, then sliced the fucker's shit right off. Whittled him right down to the bone. But ... Brookie was a really big dude, and the guy was a crazy motherfucker. How a skinny little bitch like that could have overpowered a bad dude like Holbrook so easy ... well, we didn't know.""

The joint travelled across the floor-folk and was then handed up to the bunks. Mikey hit it hard and made that funny choking noise that older guys sometimes do when holding in a big toke, nasal and strangled. He gave Nicky the thumbs-up and blasted out smoke like a grizzled old dragon.

""Shit's pretty good, Nicky. Good score - gotta get some more of that. So, yeah, the kid ... he got rolled off to the Hole on his fuckin' Hannibal Lecter dolly, and they had him on a super-tight lockdown: nobody even catches a glimpse of 'im. They had the kid on a twenty-four hour watch and the whole works. A couple trustees tried asking the hacks what happened with him and Brookie, and they got told to mind their own business and mop the fucking floors.

""The kid was in the Hole for a week, then two, then a month ... all the while, ain't no one heard a peep about him getting charged with murder. There was a rumor going around that the coroner said in his report that Holbrook had died from a heart attack. Maybe his heart seizing up *was* the thing that actually killed him, sure ... but there wasn't any mention of the way he'd been carved up like a Sunday turkey. None at all."" Mikey poured himself another round of refreshment, and the stink of the open bag made my eyes water.

Hutch smiled a little, an action with no real humor behind it. ""Well, tongues were wagging, as they tend to do, and pretty soon people were saying that maybe the kid wasn't natural. That he did Brookie in with his teeth ... that he ate the fucker alive, like some sort of monster. Guys were even saying that the priest paid him a visit in the Hole and ended up leaving with tears in his eyes ... actually fuckin' crying and shit. Wouldn't say what happened, just that he didn't wanna talk to the kid, never again. He quit working here not long after that happened. Just up and quit, and I heard that the Padre ended up selling his house and moving away. Like, across the country. Somewhere far, far away.""

Mikey's iron-grey beard split with a slight grin of his own. ""Now here's where shit gets *really* weird.""

courtneymadison,32,78,1r2j24,235,"I'm just a normal 18 year old that lives at home and goes to class. I've never really had any unexplainable experiences but I had one today. I woke up and started getting ready for class, I thought I saw my mom in her room so I started having a conversation with her while I was getting dressed. She was responding as per usual so I thought nothing of it. (Quick sidenote: Nothing felt wrong with the way she was responding. Whatever this was it sounded just like my mom.) After a while she stopped replying to me. Being curious I decided to go see why. I went to her room and it was empty, looked in the kitchen and it was empty, She would of had to have walked past me to leave the house so I knew she hadn't left. I decided to call her to figure out where she'd gone and when I looked I had a text from her that was received at 5:27 a.m. saying ""Got called in to open. Be home at 11 so you can take the car."". I called her to see if she was messing with me but she was actually at work. I don't know who I've been talking to all morning and I'm really freaked out. Can anyone help me? 


EDIT: I asked my little sister if when she had had anything strange happen when she was getting ready for school and she looked at me like I'd lost it. For all the people that asked about the conversation, the previous night my mom had found a ouija board (unused and still in the packaging) in my closet and she had thrown it away, ""She"" was talking about how ouija boards are dangerous and I shouldn't mess with them. She was very persistent that I don't get involved with things like that but she's always saying stuff like that so it wasn't a very out of the ordinary topic for us. The conversation was about an hour long and I was fully awake when it took place. We checked the house and nothing was missing or out of place. We live in an apartment and all the windows were locked and the screens were intact, so someone couldn't have gotten in or out through them. My mom is really into the weird/paranormal stuff so I told her everything and she has no idea what it could be. Also I feel I should mention we've lived here for 15 years and nothing like this has happened before.

BONUS EDIT: My mom went to leave for work and there were footprints leading out of our house in the snow.",Who was I talking to?,313
PeckerPoker,41,68,1r58lt,209,"Ok, so this isn't a long story filled with twists and turns, but it just happened about 15 minutes ago, and I'm a little uneasy now.

For reference, my husband, son, and I moved into an apartment in the top-half of a century-home a couple months ago. The doors all have old knobs and the doors don't always close easily - you really have to pull sometimes.

Anyway, I just put my son (almost two years old) down for his nap. I told him night-night as I closed the door. As I always do, I pulled the door shut firmly and made sure I heard it click. I swear I heard it click.

I walked away and into the bathroom to go pee. As I sat down on the toilet, I heard my son start crying, which isn't that unusual, but normally he doesn't do more than fuss for a minute before falling asleep. I even kept him up a little longer than usual to make sure he fell asleep. He seemed pretty ready to go down... thumb in mouth under his blanky, he rolled over onto his side and put his blanket over his head like he does when he's really tired.

I finish peeing and walk out of the bathroom and his door is wide open. I see him standing in his crib crying. I go in, feeling uneasy, and lay him back down and cover him back up. He lays there and just keeps crying as I check his closet... like there would be someone hiding in there or something. Kind of dumb, I know, but I couldn't just shut him back in his room alone without checking.

Even if I was wrong and the door didn't click shut (which is possible), it shouldn't have been wide open. When I haven't completely shut it in the past, it will open up about 5 or 6 inches. It's never opened up all the way like that.

I checked the rest of the rooms and closets, feeling nervous, but kind of stupid. Of course, there wasn't anything unusual anywhere. Still, I'm kind of on edge. I wish my husband was home.",Nap Time,277
PlotThickener,12,42,1r0aj7,183,"This is a story I've never discussed with anyone aside from those people involved. But I figured it belonged here. For the longest time I chalked it all up to pranks, my imagination, whatever...but hopefully you'll all be able to make more sense of it.

I was driving in a rural part of Wisconsin (which, if you live there, you know is much of the state). Lots of flat farms, country highways named for letters, empty back roads, etc. It was 10 p.m. or later--I don't really remember when, but it had been dark for some time and it was the middle of summer, so it must have been late. 

It was the time of night cars stop moving on the rural roads so it's just you and your headlights and the world around you starts getting really creepy. Plus you're always watching out for deer on these roads, which can just pop out at any moment, so you're kind of on ""yellow alert.""

I'm driving north on a long section of road. There's a big flat farm on my left, mostly empty-looking, probably planted with soybeans which don't grow high. I'm concentrating on the edges of where my headlights meet the darkness to watch for deer, and I think I see one walking out of the farm toward the road.

I tap the brakes, not sure of what I see, but soon I realize it's not a deer. It's upright, something walking on two feet, and it's HUGE. And it's all black. It's still moving, but it's not moving with any kind of walking movement; it's just sort of gliding across my vision.

At this point I've stopped the car completely--in the middle of the road, just watching. One instinct was to hit the gas and drive past, because I could have easily passed it, but I'm not sure if it was about to jump out. I'm not really afraid yet, I'm just frozen; you know those moments where you can't figure out what something is so there are no real emotions? That was me.

Then it comes into clearer view in the headlights. Well, that's not very accurate to say, because it didn't seem to reflect any light. It was like the light moved through it, if that makes sense. But I could see the outline of the figure against everything else that was lit--the road, the trees, etc.

The figure looked like Death. I mean EVERYTHING you imagine when you read the stories--the scythe, the big black hood. It was exactly what you think when you think Grim Reaper, only unnaturally tall and thin. It was so tall and thin it looked a lot like this guy's halloween costume when he wears it after about five minutes or so: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8PoCkNKDGk Especially how tall it was. I mean, ten feet minimum. I think most people think of the Grim Reaper as being as large as a big person, but it wasn't really like that.

But that was my first thought. A halloween costume. It was still summer, though, so not Halloween. But, I rationalize, maybe it's just a prank. But then I pay attention to how it moves to the middle of the road.

It just GLIDES. I see no feet, no hint that this thing is doing anything but flying off the ground, but you can't see feet or anything because the robe hits the ground.

Then, in the middle of the road, maybe ten feet in front of me, it stops.

The hooded face turns--toward me.

It's so slow and smooth, and just plain UNNATURAL, that I completely freeze in the car. My hands are locked on the wheel. The face is turning to me, slowly, perfectly smoothly, and I'm scared out of my mind. Even if this is some prank, this thing clearly means business. Maybe it's some psychopath scaring people, and not just an innocent prank.

It sees me. I don't see eyes, no glowing eyes or anything, just black, but somehow I KNOW that it's looking at me, making eye contact. I got goosebumps even on my scalp; I remember my hair feeling like it stood straight up. I feel like I was literally looking death in the face. My stomach sank like someone just told me a loved one had died. I mean, you do not want to feel this feeling. Ever. The thing stood perfectly still, too, as if considering me or weighing me. I felt really judged, if that makes sense. Like I was being considered.

Then he glides off so fast I don't even see where he goes. The roads are clear again, and then I heard the engine running as if all of the world's sound had suddenly been un-muted.

I drive back home, still frozen, still rationalizing what I saw. A prank, I figure. It had to be a prank, some overzealous Halloween lover setting up rumors of the Grim Reaper walking around the farms. I tell my parents about it, and they're sure it's a prank. So sure that I eventually rationalize it away, and the memory is filed away as creepy, but nothing supernatural.

At about the same time, I heard that a farmer who owned that soybean field had died that night. But it took me a long time before I put two and two together, when I realized that I saw something that looked like THE FREAKING GRIM REAPER on the same night that farmer died. I remember when I first had the thought, and my stomach sank.

It was like the rationalization I had used to remember the story of the Grim Reaper was suddenly stripped away, and I had to confront the fact that I saw something very, very scary.

But what else can I do but live my life?

I went back to college--every time I came back home at night I took an alternate road just because I got the creeps so bad. Had a good semester, mostly A's, had some good times with friends. I drive back mostly during day or evening time so I don't have to revisit those unpleasant memories.

Then my parents tell me that there are more ""Grim Reaper"" stories going around lately, all pretty similar to mine. When you live in a  small town it seems like there are a lot of funerals for old people that you know or at least heard of going on all the time. At one funeral, an old lady's granddaughter cried because she saw she said a big black figure over the casket. My parents heard that story and thought of mine, but they still just treated it as a joke.

I would stay up a lot later than the people in my house (parents + younger brother, plus an uncle aunt and cousin who were spending Christmas with us), and slept in a room upstairs on this little side road in a rural subdivision. No streetlights out there; just the lights that other people kept on their garages all night.

One night I went up to my room at about 2 a.m., and of course the whole house is quiet, and I go to my room and turn out the lights so I can go to bed. I usually throw a glance out the window and you can see most of the side street because the neighbors kept their garage light on all night.

This time the whole scene looks a little different. There's a big shadow looming in the front yard, and it's blocking a lot of light. Then I look closer and I realize it's not a shadow--it's something black that's cutting THROUGH the light.

Then I feel my heart practically stop as I realize…it's back. The Grim Reaper figure.

It was just like before. It cast no shadow. The scythe was there, and the tall hooded cloak, with no face.

The breath went out of me when I realized that, unlike before, this reaper was not looking to the side when I discovered it. It was looking right at our house.

II stood there, frozen again, my finger still on the switch from just having hit the light. It was a windy winter night, and you could see some snow move, but the creature's robe didn't move at all. The same way its movements before had been unnatural, now it loomed like a statue. No flailing around in the wind. Just standing tall, scythe up high, staring at our house.

I looked away, then looked back again. Still there. Looming. I didn't get the sense that it was looking at me, but I still couldn't stop staring.

Then I looked away, and looked back again. This time I KNEW it was staring. Again, it was hard to see--there was really nothing that I could tell that suggested it was looking at me. No evil glowing eyes or anything. I just felt it. Felt the same feelings as before--a rotten pit in my stomach, the feeling of being measured and weighed and considered.

I heard a squeak, and realized it was me. My breath was being squeezed out of me, simply from the fear. Keep in mind I had no idea what this thing would do next. What, fly up to my window? Suddenly disappear? Rip off its hood and reveal a laughing skull?

After a moment, its gaze departed from me, again. I felt good enough to go to my brother's room and wake him up to show him something in the window. It took him forever to get out of bed, but it may have only been a few minutes. By the time he woke up, rubbed his eyes, and listened to the panic in my voice, a few minutes had at least past. I showed him the window but, of course, the figure was gone.

But still, that was it, I knew. The night I saw death.

That was the night my uncle died.

Big Rob grunted, ""Billy Tremont,"" and hauled hard on the joint, decimating it to a smoldering ember between his thick fingers.

""Yeah, him. Billy Tremont. He was a hack who worked the night shift, and I'll tell ya something - he was just as dirty as they come. Fucking guy wasn't just on the take - he *was* the take, you know what I'm sayin'? He was as much a gangster as any of the boys in here. He controlled what came into the Pen, and when, and who got it and how much they got. The dude squeezed out whatever competition he had from the other cops that were playing the game, by any means available - he set 'em up to get fired, payed to have 'em shit-kicked by the bikers, you name it. He was a complete fuckin' asshole, but he was also real good at getting you what you wanted ... for a price.

""Well, it's a fact that people love a mystery, especially people who ain't got fuck-all to do with their time. A few guys pooled together some cash and they came to Billy, 'cuz if anyone could find the answers to their questions, Billy Tremont could. Billy laughed and tells 'em that he'd love to take their money, but he couldn't do what they were asking. He says, 'The weird little bastard didn't have no file, as far as I can tell. I don't know who he was, why he came here, or where he came from. No one does, and that's the goddamned truth.' The guys called him a bullshitter and Billy got serious on them. He narrowed his eyes and said to 'em, 'You guys don't think I tried to find out for myself, already? Hah? Far as I can tell, the kid just sorta popped up into the Fish Tank outta thin air. Looks to me like everyone just kept processing him along 'cuz no one wanted to admit that they didn't know who the fucking kid was. Call me a liar again and I'll beat the fear of God into you.' It was clear that they weren't gonna get anywhere with Billy, so the guys-""

""What kid? Wait a minute, man ... which one's the kid?"" Richie's eyes looked like black, bottomless pools. I remember that. He had already sunk deep into the mindless tar pit of addiction, by then. He was past the point of no return. You could see it in his eyes.

""Shut up, dummy."" Rob turned to Mikey and made a gesture that said *please, continue.*

Mikey gave Rich a cold stare, then said, ""So the guys gave up and said, 'Fuck it, then,' and that's that for a while. Life goes on. Then a day comes when Billy sidles up to one of the cons while he's standing in the morning chow line and tells him that he'd found some information on the fish, if anyone still cared to know. Billy was lookin' bad, they said. He looked tired and scared.

""That night, Billy comes to see the guy in his cell, after lights-out. He asks the guy for a smoke ... and Billy had quit smoking years ago. Billy says to him, 'I don't want any money for this. Keep your lousy fuckin' money. I don't wanna be the only one that can't sleep at night, is all. You pieces of shit got him into my head, and I couldn't get him out. Fuck you for doing that. Fuck you people sideways.' The guy said that Billy Tremont's hands were shaking so fuckin' bad that he could hardly get his smoke lit.

""Billy tells the con that curiosity had been eating him fuckin' alive, so he spent some time thinking on how to go about getting want he wanted ... then he picked his mark. Billy always had his ear to the ground, y'know the type - he knew this and that, who did what and where and why. He knew stuff about people. He knew that one of the suits in the office had a bad coke habit, the kind of raging habit that most people can't afford for long. He also knew that the suit and the Warden were both banging the same chick - the Warden's secretary. Billy gave him an quarter-ounce of good rock cocaine and told him what he wanted. He promised to shoot the guy an eight-ball on top of what he already gave him, if the guy could deliver the goods.

""The suit came back to him a few days later with the sniffles and a file folder that looked older than the Bible. It was made outta some kind of rough, crumbling old cardboard, dry as dust. The office stiff says that the Warden's secretary told him where to find it, locked up in a cabinet in the Warden's office. He said that he'd put himself in all kinds of danger to get it, and he wanted more than a 'ball for his troubles. He wanted more than a quarter, too. Billy told him that he could either take the 'ball, or Billy could let the Warden know that one of his minions wasn't just a coke-head and a thief, but he was dipping his wick into the Warden's honey-pot, too. Billy told the suit that the ass-fucking the Warden would give him wouldn't be anywhere near as bad as the one the wolves would deliver. The guy shut his yap, took his eight-ball and they parted ways.

""So, in between drags of his smoke, Billy tells the con that the first documents in the folder were pages taken from a court transcript, some back-water courthouse sittin' way out in cow country. They were hand-written with an old-time pen, Billy said: you know, the kind that you had to dip in a fuckin' ink well, then pat dry against a blotter so the shit didn't smear. That's how old the thing was. All the dates and the kid's name were scribbled out, Billy said, but he figured that the first documents in the folder were from the late 1800's.""

Nick snorted. ""What? That ain't even possible.""

 Mikey shrugged. ""It is what it is, Nicky. The transcript said that the kid had been charged with multiple murder, practicing Satanic rites, cannibalism, arson, mayhem ... he was only sixteen years old when they tried him. The prosecutor wanted to hang 'im for his crimes. But the defense lawyer that the Crown had appointed, some greasy little fucker - he argued it would be Godly to let the kid live out the rest of his days in jail, seeing as how the kid was known to be an orphaned vagrant who'd raised himself in the woods. No moral guidance in the woods, that was the argument. The jury ended up getting all pious and they commuted the kid's date with the rope to a life sentence. They shipped 'im off to the clink and, that very first night, he killed his cellmate. Killed him with his nails and teeth, and then he ate the poor sonofabitch.""

Coltrane looked disturbed. ""Holy fuck. This is horror movie stuff. I'm sorry, but you guys have *gotta* be shittin' us.""

Mikey shrugged again. ""Kinda wish I was. But I'm not. Not according to Billy Tremont, anyway. Billy said that they stuck the kid in a loony bin for the criminally insane, after he ate his cellie. Put 'im in a strait jacket. At some point, the quacks realized that the usual treatments weren't working for shit, so they decided to give the kid a lobotomy. He was out like a light from the ether and they were just getting ready to start, when the kid suddenly breaks his arm restraints and sinks his teeth into the lead surgeon's throat, just like a goddamned wolf. Ripped it right out. There's no way that he should have still been conscious, let alone being able to snap those thick bands of leather ... but he was, and he did.""

""Way I heard it,"" Hutch said, ""after he killed the quack, they put the kid back on the stand - and this time he got twelve votes for death. They took him to the town square and marched the kid up to the gallows, with all the townspeople screaming and throwing moldy bread and cow shit at him. He was laughing at 'em. The hangman put the rope around his neck, and asks the kid if he has any last repentant words to share with the crowd. The kid says, loud and clear, 'There's nothing to repent in doing what you want. I'd fuck your mother's ass and fry up her heart, if I wanted to, and after I was done picking my teeth I wouldn't so much as fart her a blessing. Why should I?' So the cops beat on the kid with their clubs a bit, put the hood on the little fucker and the hangman pulls the lever ... but the trap door wouldn't open. He fiddled with it and tried three more times, and each time the fucking door wouldn't swing open. They didn't know what to do. All the while, the kid was laughing and cursing at them and praising the Devil, just being a general pain in the ass. People were screaming for him to swing. It was getting ugly out there, and fast. So someone gets the bright idea that they could just put the kid up against a wall and shoot him, and be done with it.""

""Only that didn't work, either,"" Mikey added. His words were becoming thick and slurred - it sounded like the hootch was starting to do the trick. ""They put the kid up against a brick wall and five cops took aim. Five cops pulled the trigger, and five guns misfired. They tried again and the same shit happened again. By now, the people watching were getting spooked. The crowd of farmers and mill workers who came out to watch the kid hang - they all suddenly had places to go. Everyone left, and the Lord's Prayer was on more than a few sets of lips as they went, I'd bet. When everyone was gone, the cops packed the kid back into the wagon, because there was nothing else they could do. They took him back to the courthouse and, after some debating behind closed doors, the judge had him sent to a different jail, where he was locked up in an unused room in the basement. Then they boarded up the door ... and *then*, for good measure, they bricked the whole thing over.""

Richie attempted to focus his eyes up at Mikey and asked, ""Can they ... can they really do that, man? Just put someone in a hole and brick the fucker over?""

Nick spoke up. His voice was hoarse. ""Maybe not these days, but we're talking back when a lot of people didn't even have a birth certificate. Sure, they coulda done that. Who'd ever know?"" He lit another joint and passed it.

""So, what, man? They just left the crazy little fucker there to die?"" Richie appeared to be in the grip of a dubious species of moral outrage.

""Another good question, Richie. Maybe you haven't killed every single brain cell yet, after all."" Mikey slugged back some more of the noxious hootch and grimaced. ""Billy Tremont said that there was only two other documents in the folder - an extremely fuckin' old mug shot, and a report to the Board of Corrections from a sanitation engineer. It was written sometime in the Fifties. He'd been down in the old basement of the very same prison where they walled up the kid; he was down there checking out the shit-pipes. It didn't have fuck-all to do with what he was looking for, but the engineer mentioned in his report that he'd found a bricked-over doorway down there. Curiosity got the better of him, and he tore away the crumbling old brick with a crowbar. Pried the boards off and popped the door open. Do you know what he found?""

""A skeleton,"" Richie muttered. He was struggling to keep his eyes from sliding shut.

""No. Nothing. That's what he found. When he forced the door open, the room was empty.""

We all took a few moments to digest this.

 ""And then Bulldog ate his gun, don't forget about that,"" Hutch rumbled. He handed the jay back over to Nicky. Nick curled his lip in disgust.

""Who slobbered on this shit?"" he demanded. ""It's wet as fuck. Gross, man, fuckin' gross.""

No one owned up to the deed. Nick started to bitch about it some more and Hutch gave him that look, the one that said *shut up immediately or regret it.*. Nick shut up. Mikey snickered.

""Thank you kindly, Hutch - and Nicky? C'mon, kiddo, just pinch off the wet part and stop yer bitching. Anyhow, that fuckin' prick, Bulldog ... he was one of the least-loved hacks in the entire history of this joint. A real, genuine, dyed-in-the-wool piece of shit. He was still a few years south of retiring when this all happened ... late fifties, I'd say. A huge, fat, red-faced motherfucker, he was. Meaner'n fuck. His blood pressure was right off the scale, all the time; there wasn't nothing he liked better then to find an excuse to smash some unfortunate bastard upside the head. He'd do it with a sock full of quarters that he kept hanging on his belt. When you heard the jingling of the change, you straightened up and stopped fucking around until it was gone. If that nasty old fuck was in a mood, well, you steered clear and you kept yer big yapper shut.

""So, they put this fuckin' guy on watch in front of the kid's cell, doing the graveyard shift, right? He was all alone, too, no partner or nothin' ... I guess the other hacks didn't like the fat, mouthy fuck, either. There he was, night after night, just him and this creepy fucking kid, all night long. Normally, this wouldn't have been very good for the con being watched - being alone with a tired, grumpy Bulldog, and no witnesses? It woulda been a long, long season in Hell for most cons. But the fish wasn't the usual white-boy dummy we get in here - you know what I mean. Like, a kid who got mixed up with something stupid, then wasn't rich enough to buy his way out of it. Not this fish. He was something else entirely.""

Mikey paused to force down a big glurt of Pruno, and Hutch jumped in. ""Well, Ol' Bulldog only lasted for about a month before he goes to his shift supervisor and requests that he be taken off the watch. The head screw's office door was open a bit, and some dude named - uh, Tags or Rags, some shit like that, I can't remember - anyway, he supposedly overheard most of the conversation while he was waiting to see the Warden.""

""Why was he waitin' to see the Warden?"" Richie mumbled. As per usual with Richie, he wasn't really getting the main focus of the story. ""Fuckin' ratting on someone, right? Fuckin' *goof!* I hate those fuckers. Rats need to get *hurt*, bro. Fuckin' rats need to get -""

""Jesus, Richie, go on the nod or something, wouldja? You're a waste of skin."" Hutch looked dangerously displeased. Richie grinned a big, goony grin and whispered, ""Fuckin' rats, though.""

Hutch frowned at him thunderously, then continued. ""So Tags or Rags or whatever hears Bulldog say that he wants off the watch. His boss asks him why and he won't say. Just that he's tired and he doesn't like watching the kid. Boss asks if he wants a partner and Bulldog says nope, he just wants off the goddamned watch and that's that. So the head screw huffs and puffs and blows him off. He gives Bulldog some shitty speech about not wanting to abruptly change everyone's schedule for one fucking guy, and how if he *did* do that, little Johnny wouldn't see his Daddy up in the fucking stands at his next ball game and it would fuck him up for life. You know ... guilting the fat prick, and all that sorta thing. Then he tells Bulldog no and sends him on his way. So Bulldog went home, and he drank most of a bottle of whisky ... then stuck his service pistol in his mouth and pulled the trigger.""

Nicky roached the allegedly slobbered-on joint and blew out a tremendous lungful of smoke. There was no way that the smell of the dank wasn't rolling through the whole goddamned pod by then, but none of us were concerned about it. If everyone was behaving themselves, the C.O.'s would leave us to our vices in peace. The situation was volatile enough already.

Mikey piped up and said, ""It's a sad fuckin' thing, you know ... when one of *us* string ourselves up or gets his hands on a razor blade, no one gives a fuck. The hacks laugh atcha because your bowels let go and you fuckin' shit yourself when you died, and that's your obituary. Life goes on, and no one gives you a second thought. But *this* asshole sticks a gun in his yapper and blows his brains out the top of his head, and hell, suddenly he's a hero. There was even a big article in the local paper about how the stress of being a Corrections Officer causes depression and blah blah blah, sensitive souls can't handle the gritty reality of working with drugged-out, ass-fucking convicts. It was kinda laughable, really. Whoever wrote that article didn't know Bulldog personally, that's for sure.""

Hutch interjected, ""But the fuckin' newspaper didn't mention nothing about what actually drove the piggy to pull the trigger and ventilate his own skull, fuck no. No mention of the kid at all. The kid was the Warden's nasty little secret. Because they still didn't know who the fuck the kid was or where he came from; and one way or another, the creepy little bastard was making people dead. All they had to go on was an old court document that read like a horror book, a passing mention in a sanitation report and a black-and-white picture of someone who looked like the kid, but couldn't possibly *be* the kid.""

I was suddenly aware that I was getting a bit freaked out. In the soft, red gloom, stoned out of my tree, every word that Mikey and Hutch uttered seemed frighteningly plausible. I cleared my throat and announced, ""I gotta tell you guys, this is a fucked up story. I'm getting creeped out down here.""

Hutch blinked down at me with inebriated surprise. ""Shit, I forgot that you were even down there! Quiet little fucker, ain't he? More bubbly in yer cup, my friend?""

I still hadn't managed to finish my first helping of the vile stuff. I shook my head and finished up Nicky's doobie instead. Mikey lapsed into silence, and we were silent with him. Even Richie. In the silence, something dawned on me. I said, ""Hey, Mikey ... when they brought the kid to a different jail and walled him up, after they couldn't execute him ... that was *this* place, wasn't it? When you guys first saw him, he wasn't a new fish at all - the kid was the oldest con in this entire joint.""

""This one's pretty smart, Mikey,"" Hutch said. ""Compared to Richie, he's a fuckin' scholar. We should make him our Treasurer or something, whaddya think?""

""We ain't got nothin' to treasure here, old man. Not in this fuckin' shithole."" Mikey poured himself some another shot of the eye-watering concoction in the bag. ""Yeah, you got 'er, buddy - according to Billy Tremont, it was right underneath this very building."" He let out a raspy sigh and hoisted aloft his Dixie cup of hootch.

""To Billy Tremont,"" he said. ""I sincerely hope God took it easy on you.""

""How'd he die?"" Nick asked, and Mikey flashed that humorless smile again.

""Not long after Bulldog ate some lead, we woke up to the sound of gunshots in the middle of the night again. They found Billy Tremont dead in the C.O.'s locker room. His brains and bits of his skull were sliding down the wall beside his body like snails. The coroner declared that it was another suicide, but here's the thing ... they found five chunks of lead embedded in a wall, all at chest-height. And one in his brain. There was a full cup of coffee spilled on the floor beside him and he still had a vacation request form clutched in his free hand."" Mikey leaned back against the wall and let out a scornful gust of air. ""So, according to the official report, here's Billy sipping on a fresh coffee, just about to go to the office and request some vacation time - when suddenly, right then and there, with no warning or reason, he decides to shoot himself. But, before he does that, he fires all the bullets in his service pistol into the wall, except for the one that he fires through his own temple. That's a hell of an odd way to commit suicide, dontcha think?""

Nick looked disturbed. ""The kid came for him. That's what happened, isn't it?""He appeared very young and very vulnerable in the dim crimson light, his face unlined and guileless. ""It got out of its cell and ... it was coming for him. The cop tried to shoot it, then turned the gun on himself before it could ... get at him.""

""Can't say for sure, Nicky. The only guy who can is thirteen years in his grave.""

Remmie tentatively cleared his throat from the top bunk. ""You said something to Hutch about the power going out before, and something that happened when it did. What were you talking about?""

""Nah, maybe we shouldn't get into that tonight-""

""Hell, might as well tell 'em the rest,"" Hutch rumbled. ""Gone this far, haven't we? A week after Billy bit the dust, a storm rolled in and knocked the power out, clear across the county. We were all herded into our cells and told to shut up and fuckin' behave. A lot of the hacks couldn't make it into work that night, on account of the roads being all fucked up with accidents and torrential rain and shit - so the bosses who *did* make it to work were all carrying heavy firepower. They made it clear that they weren't going to fuck around if somebody got out of hand.

""Right around midnight, I heard a shotgun go off somewhere on the other side of the Pen. Can't mistake that sound, if you're familiar to it. I was wide awake and on my feet in a heartbeat. Then, sort of muffled and far away, I heard screaming. There was a boss standing nearby my cell, and over his radio a voice was squawking, *""He's out! He's out of his cell and he killed Aimsley! He's ripping everyone apart! Get your asses over to Solitary NOW!*"" The hack took off running and I turned to Johnny Franzini - but he stole the words right out of my mouth. He said, 'The boy - he is loose. This is bad.'

""It was dark in there, but I'm pretty sure I saw Johnny cross himself.""

Mikey's eyes glittered at us in the semidarkness, glassy from the drink and wide from the memory on his lips. ""There was a second gunshot, and then a whole lot more. They echoed and boomed and scared us shitless. When they tapered off we heard more screaming. It sounded like ... like animals at a slaughterhouse, squealing and bucking while they breathe their last. Me 'n my cellie, we fuckin' hid in the corner with a mattress in front of us. We didn't know *what* was happening, just that the hacks had tried to shoot  something and they didn't fuckin' succeed. I'm not afraid to admit it - I was shitting my pants.""

""I heard feet come slapping against the cement and then three hacks sprinted past our cell,"" Hutch said. ""They weren't just running - they were fuckin' *sprinting*, haulin' ass like Olympians. I seen their faces for a second, and they were wild with fear. I've never seen anyone look like that, before or since. Everyone was hollerin' at 'em as they passed, asking them what the fuck was going on. They didn't answer, didn't even hear us - they just ran on by and kept going.

""After a few minutes, a fourth guy comes along, and he's limping real bad, using his rifle as a crutch. He got left behind, I guess. The hack was looking over his shoulder a lot and sorta jog-hopping as fast as he could manage. He was leaving a trail of blood behind him. The hack's uniform was shredded and torn on one side of his body, flapping around like rags. I yelled at him, *""Hey! What the fuck happened to you guys? What's going on?""* and he stopped in front of our cell. I could see the guy a little better, now, and I wished I hadn't. It was Aimsley. He wasn't dead, after all ... at least, not yet. His right arm had been shredded to almost nothing. I mean, it was just a few flapping pieces of meat and stringy shit, oozing blood and barely holding the bones together. His right thigh was missing huge chunks of meat, too ... and most of the foot. The guy's face was grey from blood loss. His eyes were like a doll's ... like twin pieces of round, murky glass. He was in shock. He moved his mouth, trying to find some words, then said, 'I think I'm dying.' Then he started hopping again. There was a puddle of blood on the floor where he had stopped.""

""Okay, that's enough,"" Remmie said, and his voice quavered a little. ""I don't want to hear anymore-""

""I don't remember asking if you did,"" Mikey rasped. Remmie pursed his painted lips and was silent.

Hutch continued. ""I heard something else coming, then. It sounded like something running on all fours, something with claws. I backed up against the wall, as far away as I could go, and Johnny cowered down into his bunk with his blanket pulled up around his face. It came in fast and ripped past my cell, just a fuckin' blur of arms and legs, and about ten seconds later I hear Aimsley start wailing like a siren. It was awful. Those were death-screams, man ... nothing else can force a living creature to let out such awful fucking sounds. it took me a moment to understand that Aimsley wasn't just screaming; he was saying something. He was saying, *'Mommy! It's eating meeeeee! Mommy! It's eating meeeeee!'* Then I realized that I was screaming right along with him. So was Johnny. The whole pod was screaming. You remember that, Mikey? All of us, two hundred murderers and stick-up men, fuckin' screaming in unison like little girls.""

""I won't ever forget that. Not ever."" Mikey said, quietly. ""The hack finally stopped making noise, and we all did, too. You could almost taste the terror in the air, sharp and bitter. I could smell Aimsley's blood, that coppery smell that gets in your throat and makes you want to retch. It was so quiet ... silent as a tomb. You could have heard a pin drop. And then, slowly - so slowly - a figure comes strolling into view on the range. It was the kid. He was red from head to toe, completely covered in blood and guts and shreds of stuff that kept sliding off of him and dropping onto the floor. He wandered right down the middle of the range, and he was carrying Aimsley's head by the hair, dangling beside his leg as he walked. I watched him as he passed by and I didn't breathe, not once did I even fucking *dare* to breathe. The kid ambles on up to the Hack Shack, just as casual as could be, and he puts Aimsley's severed head up on the ledge of the window. Then he walked out into the middle of the range, raised his arm, and pointed at all of us, each individual cell. Like he was marking us, each and every one. Marking us for death.

""When he was done, the kid walked back the way he came, and he disappeared from view. That was the last anyone ever saw of him. He was just ... gone.""

There was a full minute of silence. Finally, I spoke up. ""Why the *fuck* did I never hear anything about this before? *How?* This should have been everywhere - the news, TV crime shows, fucking everywhere -""

Nick chimed in and said, ""I never heard nothing about this, either, and used to love those fuckin' crime shows.""

""No, you never heard nothing about that ... but you might have heard something about a prison riot,"" Mikey said. ""According to the newspapers, the cons took advantage of the power outage and went apeshit for a few hours. Most of the guards on duty died trying to stop us, or so the story goes. The government funded a swell new electronic locking system, all because of what happened that night.""

I thought about this for a moment, then said, ""I dunno ... ""

""What don't you know? Huh? I'll fuckin' tell you the rest, how's that?"" Hutch glared down at me, and his narrowed eyes slammed phantom punches into my face. I froze. ""The three hacks that we seen running for their lives - they ran right into the arms of the SWAT team, who'd just gotten on the scene with their guns drawn. The cops busted through the gate, and they found what was left of Aimsley first. They ignored our hollerin' and followed the blood trail. They found the rest of them in the hallway that runs down the middle of Solitary, lying in a raw heap with the blood congealing in a pool beneath the bodies like gravy. All the cell doors had been ripped away from their hinges, and the cons inside had been torn into pieces. From what I heard, it took a crime scene cleanup crew six days to clean out that wing. And even after that, the cons and the hacks were finding dried-up bits of flesh and bone for months on end.

 ""We toldja what happened, and you can believe it or not. I don't give a fuck, and neither does Mikey. Ask around, if you wanna - there's some long-timers here that might talk about it, if you give 'em something to loosen their lips. Once again, I don't give a fuck. This whole pod had nightmares for a long, long time. I'm probably gonna have 'em til the day I die, and I doubt I'm the only one. There is something within these fuckin' walls that looks human, but isn't. It's something that you don't want to meet, and believe me - you better hope you never do.""

Hutch stopped talking, then, and as the hour was late and we were all pretty fucked up, the silence soon turned to sleep. I recall dreaming of a fair-haired young man who stood amongst us as we slept, silent as a shadow. His eyes were completely black in the feeble glow of the emergency lights, his expression vulpine and hungry. I remember that, in the dream, I was very, very afraid that the boy would sense that I was not actually asleep. If he discovered that I was awake, he'd devour me. I remember this quite clearly.

We awoke early in the morning to the pitiful sounds of a junk-sick Richie, dry-heaving into the toilet. The lights were back on, and the lockdown was over. Richie wasn't the only one who was feeling like shit that morning - we were all in pretty rough shape, especially us floor-folk. Sleeping in a sitting position on cold concrete makes for a stiff, painful morning.

None of us had much to say. We all sat and smoked and waited for the hacks to do morning head count. I wondered if pounding hangovers weren't the only reason for that. I suspected that I wasn't the only one whose sleep had been disturbed by the fair-haired spectre. A thing that should have ceased to walk the earth years before, but had not. A thing with a terrible appetite.

The cops finally came around and let us out of our cages. They pointedly did not perform the morning cell check. If they had, there simply wouldn't have been enough cells in Solitary to confine all the rule-breakers. We all trooped off to stand in the chow line (except Richie, who opted to stay behind and, undoubtedly, indulge in a snort or two) and that's pretty much where this story ends.

Well, almost.

I was released a year early for good behavior. During the rest of my time there, most of Mikey's crew were paroled either through the front door - or the back. Richie was the first one to get wheeled out the back way. Then, eight months later, Coltrane's skull was pounded into a new and messy format, and he followed Richie out the back door. Six months before I was uncaged, Big Rob Hutch had a heart attack while walking up the stairs that led to the tier above ours. He fell backwards, clutching his chest, and was dead before he somersaulted over the last few steps and landed at the bottom.

So, for a while it was just me, Mikey, Nick and a few casual homeboys. It got boring. The crew unraveled at the seams and, by the time I was paroled, it had ceased to exist.

A few months after my divorce was finalized, I got nostalgic one night and decided to try and find Mikey online. Soon enough, I did - through his obituary. He died in hospital of a ""short illness"" not long after I was released. Remmie was also deceased, the victim of a shower-room rape and stabbing. And Nicky? I discovered that he was in a mental institution.

I visited him in there, once. I'd rather be in jail, any day. Most of the patients I saw there were zombies, chemically bitch-slapped into subservience by their meds. There were a few others who were just ... strange. Their gaze made me feel unsafe - and for Christ's sake, I did time in a federal penitentiary. I was shown to where Nicky sat by himself at a table, and he instantly recognized me. We greeted each other like old friends and made small talk, just like anyone would. He seemed completely normal to me. I didn't understand why he was in there ... until I mentioned Hutch.

""What do you think happened to Hutch, exactly?"" I asked him, and his relaxed grin suddenly became a twisted grimace of fear. He seized me by the front of my jacket and hauled me close, and his eyes burned bright with the fire of insanity. He hissed, ""The kid pushed him down the stairs. It wasn't a fucking heart attack, that's a cover-up. The kid got Mikey, too - it ate everything but his head, it left his head on his fucking pillow -""

The orderlies grabbed Nicky and pried him off of me, and they dragged him away while he screamed and flailed and twisted in their iron grip. I watched this with an open mouth and my heart pounding. 

Then I went home and got very, very drunk.

Somewhere within those prison walls, there is a thing that hungers. And, sometimes ... it feeds. I don't expect you to believe this, any more than I did. But, you know what? On nights like this, with the wind howling and the fine hairs standing up on my neck, I couldn't care less what you believe.

And, if you were ever unfortunate enough to meet him face to face, well ... I'll bet the kid wouldn't care what you believe, either.

NEWACCOUNT3,57,57,1qs3hz,173,"I suffer from sleep paralysis pretty regularly.  I've grown accustomed to it, so it's not really an issue anymore.  It terrified me back when I was like, eight, but I'm twenty-five now; I've learned to cope.

It only happens to me under certain circumstances.  Only when I'm asleep on my back. Never in any other position.  It's much more likely to occur during the day, if I doze off for a nap.  It happens plenty at night too, if i'm too tired or not tired enough to sleep yet.

The first step to dealing with it is to realize that I am, in fact, having an episode (or whatever you call them).  That's pretty easy- if I am awake, scared, and unable to move, it's pretty much a given.  This seems like a trivial step, realizing that i'm paralyzed, but it's really important.  Having that realization help me block out all the terrifying shit that's going on in my head.  It helps dull the ominous chanting that I always experience.  Helps me ignore the shadows moving around the room.  Helps dull the terror I have of whatever is behind my bathroom door, that I generally assume is on its way to get me.

The fucker behind my bathroom door isn't always behind my bathroom door.  It depends on where I'm sleeping.  Sometimes he's around the corner of my living room.  Sometimes he's coming from the back door.  He was even coming from the closet door once, though I don't know how he managed to cram himself in there.  It's hard to convey the visceral terror that fucker instills in me, at least to those who haven't experienced such a phenomenon.  He's the only thing that haunts my paralysis.  Others get ghosts or demons sitting on their chests or whatever, but all I get is the sense of impending doom, knowing it's right there, coming for me to do only god knows what.  It's a feeling of all-consuming fear, of absolute and complete panic, and of utter helplessness.  Which leads me to:  

The next thing to do, obviously, is snap right the fuck out of it.  I think most people who deal with this regularly probably have their own little tricks to get out of it.  Mine's simple: I shake my head back and forth.  That's it, but it's easier said than done.  Because I can't actually move my head (hence the paralysis).  But I put forth the effort.  Over and over again, back and forth, back and forth.  Honestly, this is the most terrifying part.  It really sucks to try to move and not be able to.  Especially when that fucker in the bathroom is on its way.  But eventually, after some time, one of the mighty shakes of my head manages to move me, and then everything is okay.  The chanting stops, thank god.  Why my head conjures up some cultist shit is beyond me.  The corners of the room clear out, and that fucker in the bathroom goes away.  The sense of terror evaporates, and that's that.

Next thing to do is to roll over onto my belly to ensure it won't happen again, grab my girlfriend and go back to sleep.  No big deal.

That's how it usually goes, anyway.  But lately it's not quite been the same.  I'll explain more about that in a bit, but first let's take a detour to address the question that some of you may be asking: ""NEWACCOUNT3, why don't you just, you know, not go to sleep on your back?""  And that's a good question with a simple answer.  It's because sleeping on my back, in addition to being a prerequisite for sleep paralysis, is also a prerequisite for lucid dreaming.  Lucid dreaming, needless to say, is a lot more fun than sleep paralysis.  So much fun that it's worth the risk of waking up paralyzed.  

What's more is that i'm certain that these two phenomena are related in some way.  For me, the circumstances have to be identical for either to occur.  Asleep on my back.  More frequent during daytime naps, or when i'm too tired or not tired enough to sleep.  They both occur in the interlude between sleep and not-sleep.  At their core, I think, they are 
essentially just two tricks of the mind.  One is me doing the tricking, while the other is my mind playing tricks on me.  Two distinct phenomena, but related in some way or another.  Generally, it's a crapshoot which one I get at a given time.

That's how it usually goes, anyway.  But lately it's not quite been the same.  They are no longer distinct; the barrier between paralysis and lucidity has diminished.  It started off small.  I'd be flying around and hear, ever so faintly, chanting.  Or i'd feel a bit uneasy about what's behind a door I'm about to enter, because maybe that's where the fucker's 
coming from.  Not the pure panic i'm accustomed to, because i'm free to move around, but a sense of apprehension.  Gradually it became worse, over the ensuing weeks.  

I'd emerge into the world of lucidity to full-blown chanting, that came from nowhere but came from everywhere. The fear and terror i'd only experienced when paralyzed would overcome me, and i'd have no choice but to flee.  But no matter where i'd go, no matter how fast i'd run or fly away, I knew that fucker from my bathroom was close.  I couldn't open any doors, because I knew he'd be there.  I couldn't stop moving or he'd catch me from behind.  I couldn't fly too high because I just knew he was waiting in the clouds.  There fear was all-encompassing. Pure and absolute terror was the only thing my mind 
could comprehend.  I'd wake up exhausted from spending all night in fight-or-flight mode.

This new phenomenon was infinitely worse than sleep paralysis.  When I was paralyzed, I could eventually shake myself out of it.  But now, I couldn't force myself to wake up. I'm trapped for as long as the dream lasts. I'm free to roam, but I know he's coming. All I could do is keep running.

That's how it usually goes, anyway.  But lately it's not quite been the same.  Because last night I had normal dreams.  The kind you can't remember when you wake up.  I had to pee when I got out of bed, but I didn't really like the bathroom door.  I was groggy, though, and didn't think much of it.  I used the bathroom downstairs before I made myself some eggs.  When I got back to my room and turned my computer on to browse reddit, I heard something.  Ever so slight, like it was far away, I heard an all too familiar chanting sound.  What's worse, my dog, Riley, won't go anywhere near the bathroom door.",Sleep paralysis is one thing...,230
SamMarduk,16,57,1qvt4k,169,"I have been a Disc Jockey for five years and counting.  I started at high school sporting events with a cheap ipod mixer but slowly moved up, both in equipment and venues.

Being a DJ is just as monotonous as any other job for most gigs.  Usually, the client only wants top 40s hits with smooth transition to each song (no silence in between).  God forbid they let you showcase any talent.  On the off chance you're allowed to scratch and mix you have to still be careful not to let any expletives slip out, or else be fired on the spot without pay.

I have done jobs for churches and the community and I've done high school house parties and college keggers.  My rates don't change and I get it up front.
Now, the scariest thing for some DJs is the equipment, you never know if it will work when you want it. Other DJs have wicked stage fright, so they just create music on their computers and post it online.  Some DJs are afraid of ""lower in"" venues like a house party. All it takes is one drunken boyfriend one time to beat the shit out of you and no more house parties for that DJ.

I've dealt with all these things and yet I have only truly been afraid once.

It was a pretty large party.  The client called me two weeks in advance and gave me the rundown.  I was thrilled.  He offered double my asking rate and told me it would be all EDM (techno) and that he wanted ""a show."" The crowd was set at 500.

It was a dream event.

I arrived about 2 hours before the event started.  I came to the address I was given to a large, empty warehouse.  I parked at the back in some tall grass and brought my stuff inside.
When I walked in the door I saw the stage lining the short wall at the end of the building.  This place was huge and it could easily hold 500.  The dome lights that all warehouses have were brightly lit so the staff could set up. There was a large circular bar in the center of the floor and multicolored lights all over the ceiling.  There were tables on the far side, opposite the stage and one main entrance besides the two emergency exits.  Throughout the entire ceiling there were cages with paid dancers waiting to climb inside to perform.  There were waiters and bartenders standing around and a few burly guys taking posts at the doors.  

""Yo! DJ!"" 

A voice called.  I saw the client approaching from the far wall. He was a young, rich, white guy, probably in his 20s.
We shook hands and he showed me to the stage after quick hello.
It was massive.  I could see the whole warehouse. Lights were all aimed at me and the crowd area. Behind the stage was an emergency exit for the performers.

Setup was very routine and soundcheck went well.  He had a great speaker system.

All was well and I could tell it was going to be a good night.  Everything was perfect.

All except for my headphones.
In my ears, behind the tracks I swear I heard what sounded like static... whispering.  

The main lighting turned off. Then the colored lights flicked on. The cage dancers started moving in their cages.  Smoke machines poured fog into the giant dance floor and the staff took position.
The doors opened and people began flooding in as I hit the first track.

Several girls who I assumed had ""pre-gamed"" before entering came in dancing and several douchebag guys followed.
As the stage lights came on and as the fog thickened I began to see less and less.  While they danced I realized that I could only see the lasers in the fog and maybe a few feet in front of the stage.  I was having a blast and so were the patrons.  Until that noise came back, this time clearer. I could make out chunks of hissed words.

""Essaaa..... Hialaa.... Charamph.""

Obviously not real words but god it sounded so clear.

The night rolled on past midnight and it was insane. People were drinking, dancing, probably doing drugs and banging on the dance floor.  I kept playing until I heard my headphones make a static coughing noise.  This time it was loud enough to mess up my focus.

""That's it."" I thought, ""I'm fixing this asap.""

I let the track play as I examined my headphones.  I turned my laptop brightness up and for a split second I thought I saw a face.  Eesh. Probably the lights against my relfection. 

I gave up and kept playing through the off and on static noises; the headphones tightly attached to my ears.

It was roughly 2 am and I decided to scan the crowd. The fog was still thick but I could see heads dancing.  I looked until I locked eyes with...something.

At first glance she was a college aged girl. She was in a pink raver tutu and had pigtails.  However, the closer I looked the more horrified I became. 

She was soaked in blood.  

On her skin looked like black scuff marks.  She had one eye bulged out of its sockets and her jaw looked smashed.  Her arms and legs were mangled beyond the point of function but she still stood, hunched, but still standing.

I shook my head to make sure I wasn't insane but the next moment she was gone. 

I want to point out that I was entirely sober for this event. All that I heard and saw was done so in my right mind.
I tried hard to ignore what I had seen so I made sure my ears were covered by my headphones and continued to play
I was getting worried that the stress of such a high profile event was getting to me, but I was able to brush it off and return to my work. Until 3 am.
At around three the static was back.
This time very clear after a few seconds.  I heard in my noise canceling headphones a tiny, hissing woman's voice:

""see. shee. leiiia.... ssssss. shhhh. shsa.  
SHUTUP! SHUT UP! SHUT. UP!""

Followed by an intense screech. 
I yelled and tossed my headphones off onto the tables, silencing the track.
As my ears adjusted from the ringing I heard it.

Screaming.

Several people were screaming.

The main lights suddenly came on and the doors opened as people rushed out. 
One of the security men ran up.
""It's a good thing you saw that.""

""Saw what?"" I replied as the fog was still thinning slowly.

""The cage?"" 

""I can't see ten feet man!"" I retorted.

""Oh god,"" the big bouncer muttered.

""What the hell is going on?"" I demanded, more annoyed than confused at this point.

""A cage fell. Nearly a hundred feet. Crushed the dancer and some poor girl under her. Her friend was screaming and that's why we thought you stopped the song.""

I walked out to my car after the paramedics came and placed the dancer DOA. The other girl was crippled but survived.

I saw her body as the smoke cleared. She was the same crushed corpse that watched me that night. She was the same voice I heard as foreshadowing to her death.


I am not afraid of the crowd.
I am not afraid of my equipment malfunctioning.
I am not afraid of people dying at my shows.  
But there is one thing I am afraid of. 

I am afraid when I'm at a prom or block party or house rager and in the back of the crowd I see a trampled bloody body, wearing a pink tutu.",What scares a DJ?,226
DarkPie,20,66,1qqxas,161,"""Mom. I love you. I'll be here whenever you need me.""

Those were the last words I said to my mom before they put the sedative into her veins, the serum pumping through her blood and bringing her frenzied tears to a rest. She had been here, at Washington State Mental Health Institution, for almost a month now, and rather than getting better she was deteriorating. She'd been giving me letters every time we met, recently, and by her description was a horror-movie type event, transpiring within the very institution.

Tests. Monitoring. Illegal abuse. Drugs that weren't quite fit for human consumption. She described these things with vivid awareness, and told me that God had taken her side. Forgive me when I say that I was... Skeptical, to say the least. After all- This was an accredited facility. Others who'd gotten out of the facility while my mom had been in, who were once patients, even described my mother as, well... Insane. How was I to take her word, one who'd lied to me and seemed totally crazy, over patients in the same hospital, and over doctors who swore to help?

In hindsight, I should have taken her to a new hospital, at the very least. If only to put her mind at ease- But then, hindsight is 20/20. Every week I went to visit her, and every week she gave me those notes. ""Mom. I love you. I'll be here whenever you need me."" Those were the words I left on, every time. Every time, she became more and more desperate.

The doctors approached me, telling me she needed to be transferred to intensive care. My senior year in college, I was stressing out enough as it was. An only child, father no where near the picture, my mom was all I had. Seeing her deteriorate wasn't helping my case, so of course, I agreed. I should have seen her first.

While gone, she was allowed to send just one letter, in her first week, before she was completely enveloped by the program. Her letter was short, to the point. ""I need you."" I was there for her, if only in spirit. But my senior project was taking a toll, and going out with friends allowed a relief from the stress I'd been taking on.

I didn't go. 

I decided, despite her words, that this was for the best. If not for her, then for me. She'd hopefully come back calmer, and I'd be a happier person. We'd pick up where we left off. The institution contacted me before the police. My mom had escaped, while on a ""nature walk"" with her psychiatrist from the main facility, where she first went. He'd gone with her, despite how much she hated him, thinking he could help. Or at least, that's what he said. I guess I'll never know which one was telling the truth... 

He was found dead. The words ""God Has Forgotten You"" were written, in his blood, on his chest. His shirt and coat had been taken off, his skull bashed in with a rock. The police said they'd keep me updated, and asked me to tell them if I heard anything from her. The institution warned me to get out and go somewhere safe, perhaps even in police hands, but I turned it down. She was my mom, and no matter what she'd become, she'd never hurt the one who'd been there for her.

I thought that, of course, before I noticed the humanoid figure, shooting out the spotlight in front of my house. My frenzy kept me from seeing the truth as I attempted to pick up the phone, only to find it holding a dead signal. My fear drove me upstairs, to my room, to open my laptop, to try to email my friends... To try to message someone, anyone, for help.

Four shots. One to my stomach, one to my shoulder. One to each leg. She told me I wasn't there when she needed me, so all she needed now was her God. She wrote ""I Have Forgotten You"" beside me, and left me to bleed. I've typed this to the only people who can do something with this. To remember me. That's all I need. After all, my friends are partying and haven't answered me. My cellphone is downstairs, I forgot all about it while panicking. And the home phone is still out. I'm getting tired...

I love you, No Sleep. You better be here, now that I need you...

Resident_E,39,91,1quso7,146,"I've always been into Jessica. 

The first day I saw her, I knew she was the one for me. I can't say my affection has been well-received. Every time I try to make a move, she just seems oblivious to my advances. Whether it's a polite, girlish giggle or my innuendo simply went over her head, I get no real reciprocation. Though, I feel like it's only because of her over-protective family. Her father is the main roadblock. He's the type that will set a curfew for eleven o'clock and be waiting with his shotgun on the porch if you're a minute too late in bringing his daughter home. Not that I've even gotten to the point of being able to ask Jessica on a date. There's always something that keeps me from getting a moment alone with her.

The most Jessica and I have done is gone to the park together. Played on the swings, slid down the slides - innocent fun. I offered to take a break from playing and have a picnic, but of course, her father showed up just as we were about to have a romantic lunch together and gave me a terrible glare, like I was some kind of creep, just for wanting to date his daughter. What's his problem, anyway? I guess he sees me as some sort of ""bad boy"". I've got a few tattoos and wear leather jackets, but I've got a part-time job and a college education. I'm a nice guy, never hurt a fly. 

One of these days, I'll find a moment where I can just swoop Jessica off her feet and bring her back to my place, and she'll realize how over-bearing her dad is. She'll love me, if only I got the chance to woo her. True love is patient. True love can wait. But not too long. If I wait too long, I won't be into her anymore. I'm not into girls for very long. 

Oh, Jessica.

[deleted],18,51,1qvjha,148,"The shadiness of this whole ordeal wasn’t apparent at the time, but boy do I feel stupid now.

It was a Friday, I think, and I had just signed onto Facebook and noticed that I had a friend request. I’m usually very cautious when it comes to adding people but the person listed their college as the one I’m attending so I obviously accepted. After scrolling through my timeline for a bit I decided to call it a night and go to bed.

The next morning I woke up because my phone kept constantly buzzing practically begging for my attention. Through my blurry vision I was able to read the notifications and they were all from the guy that had added me. Most of them were him liking my photos—some of them being ones I posted years ago, but whatever, it was just a guy trying to get my attention, right?

I shrugged it off and scrolled through my timeline in my tired state and noticed that he had tried messaging me. He said that he claimed he’s seen me around campus, which wasn’t exactly unusual, but then he started to message me about trying out an app for him. He said I could be one of his first beta testers.

I gladly accepted because what if the app became the next big thing, I’d be one of the first people to have used it. How fucking rad.

He eventually sent me the file via messenger and he told me to just drag it into iTunes easy enough right?

The app was titled “Smile for the Camera” and the icon was a glossy animated girl with gigantic breasts, typical male.

When I opened the app I was greeted by a friendly message explaining how I was merely a beta tester for the app and any progress made may or may not continue onto the final version, whatever.

It made me sign in through Facebook which I wasn’t too bothered by, but I was beginning to think that all the hassle wasn’t necessarily worth it.

Fast forward ten minutes of trying to navigate around the app and I found myself at the main menu. I clicked the ‘Instructions’ option and it redirected me to another page. 

Since the app is no longer available, I’m trying my best to recall what it had said but it was something like:

“1. Load the app (Obviously..)
2. Once you are redirected to the Main Menu click the small camera icon located to the left.
3. Now that you have the camera loaded, take a few pictures and then you can post them onto Facebook or whatever social media you have connected. Be sure that you have your location enabled for Twitter.
4. You can add a few filters but not too many, your natural state is always the best. ;)”

By then I had concluded that it was a sort of Snapchat knock-off but continued on anyway.

I clicked the icon and proceeded to take a few pictures, flashing a few funny faces that I was sure my friends would get a kick out of.

When I had taken quite a few I clicked the ‘Export’ option and it redirected me to Safari and loaded what seemed to be the Facebook login page.

I put in my information and clicked ‘Log In’ and was redirected to yet another page.

The site looked like something Facebook would make and it had a few boxes that asked me to type in a mailing address because they occasionally liked to ship out Facebook merchandise. Maybe that should’ve been a red flag right there.

I put in my college’s address just for safe measure because whatever they shipped out could easily be given to me so I clicked on the ‘Next’ option and Safari then closed.

Once I had got to college I opened my laptop and checked Facebook to see if the pictures had actually posted and they were nowhere to be seen. I tried to message the guy who had originally given me the app to test out but he had evidently deactivated his account. Red flag number two.

Right then and there I uninstalled the pointless app and thought nothing of it, until this past Friday.

I was in my Anatomy class when an officer came into the room and asked for me. By then I was freaked out because as far as I was concerned I had done nothing wrong.

He asked me to come with him to the station—which I gladly complied.

Once there I was sat down with two other officers and they started asking me about the damn app.

I told them everything I knew, from the guy giving me the download straight to when I tried to post them on Facebook.

By then they were rubbing their temples, clearly flustered by the whole situation.

“That app, that app was a sex trafficking app.” One of the burly officers said, sighing as he leaned back in his chair. “That guy that claimed to go to your college wasn’t a real person. Well they were but not who they said to be.”

By then my eyes were brimming with tears, I was honestly terrified, what did this all mean for me?

“You see, these criminals did their research. You were merely a target. It looks like they gathered as much information as they could about you to make it seem legit. You’re lucky we got to you in time.”

“What do you mean?” I remember asking, trembling as they explained it further.
“You see, those pictures you took were listed on a sex trafficking website. If they wanted you all they had to do was bid on you and you would’ve been stalked and eventually kidnapped to finalize the sale, we’re assuming. I talked to other victims who almost got kidnapped but managed to get away. They didn’t really give us much to work with; they just said that they’re cleverer than we all take them for. We had a few undercover cops bid on that website and we bid on you.  Once you’re sold your information is revealed to the buyer but it mentions that whoever you bought the person from will get them to you within a week’s time. We noticed that it was a local college’s address so we went to get you and here we are now.” 

By then I was dumbfounded, it all made sense once you put the pieces together and I can’t believe that I almost fell prey to something so sinister.

Afterwards they had told me that if anything fishy happened to call the immediately and they also mentioned that they were close to busting the case.

I think it’s safe to say that I’m staying away from anything having to do with pictures for now.","""Smile for the Camera""",199
mathearetice,17,51,1qsodj,142,"About a year ago, give or take, I took my time walking home from class at around 10 at night. The reason why I was out so late was that it was a Friday night. The night my stepfather would always become intoxicated and abusive, not something I enjoy being around. I was never afraid, my mum would sometimes question me otherwise and I’d always joke about how even junkies can be lovely. I remember it had began to drizzle a little bit but I didn’t bother quickening my pace, I enjoyed rainy nights so I took the route that would add about an hour to my journey, a bit quicker if you ran. 

I came onto a narrow back street it before I saw the silhouette of a tall skinny man emerge from the shadows. 
I stopped in my tracks. 
I wasn’t scared; he was in my way. 
I couldn’t really see him because he was standing next to a dimly lit bus stop. 
I squinted as best I could before I noticed him getting closer. For every step he took, he’d purposely drag his other foot behind him. I could hear the Stomp, scraaape just barely

Stomp scraaape.
Stomp scraaape.

I knew he wasn’t really handicapped; his movements were too quick and easy.  
As he limped closer I noticed his hair was long and hadn’t been washed in what looked like forever.
His clothes were white and covered in dirt. 
His lips looked blood red, like he had put on lipstick. 
Stomp scraaape.
What really put me off about him was that his clothes were close to looking brand new. I found it very odd. 

Stomp scraaape.
Stomp scraaape.

He stopped. 
He stopped limping and he stopped facing me. He had turned to look at the sky; to me it looked like he was admiring it. Maybe he was.
I was a full moon tonight, an especially bright one. 
He faced me again

He started to limp, and before I knew it he was feet away, and at this point I was scared. He did this disturbing giggle. 
“Girly” he cried, “Come with me… Let’s… Have some fun” He reached out his bony hand that was attached to a long, skinny arm.
It took me forever before I figured he must have been drunk, so I politely said no and smiled. His face went twisted with anger for a few seconds in the dim light.  He was provoking me, and it was working.
“Girly” he growled, “are you sure?” I gave him no answer and continued to walk.
I dreaded every step that brought us closer before realising he wouldn’t let me pass. I decided to be brave and walked right up to him, leaving a few inches between our faces. 
He smelled putrid, like fresh road kill. I didn’t show any sign of wanting to puke; I stared him in the eyes and tried to look fierce. 
My instincts told me to be defensive. To say something threatening like ‘Get the fuck out my way’, so I did. Well I tried. All that came out was a whimper 
“get the fuuu…”
Just because humans cannot smell fear doesn't mean we can't hear it. I heard it in my own voice, anyone could.
For a second I thought he didn't hear it, was wasn't affected by it at all
Without saying a word he turned and limped away. I watched him disappear into the darkness before taking the next turn out of the street. 

Stomp scraaape.
Stomp scraaape.

Still shocked from the strange encounter I began calculating the quickest route home. The best I could think of was a walk that would take 20 minutes, 10 if I ran. Even after figuring it out I didn’t start walking, not for a few minutes anyway. I finally managed to bring my foot forward and start my pace again, constantly keeping a look out for any weirdo jumping out of a bush or shadow. I was halfway down the street before I began to feel a bit calmer.

I could hear something in the distance. 
I turned around for the last time.

Stomp scraaape.
Oh, no…

Stomp scraaape.
No…

As I did my heart erupted and all blood vanished from my head. He was standing there, about a truck's length away from myself.
This time I could see him perfectly under the streetlight between us. 
He was hunched over but his eyes looked straight up at me, burning two holes into my face while his teeth were bloody and gritted.
I wish I said he was drunk or high. But he wasn't. Not at all. He was very, very insane. He was the scariest THING I had ever seen. 
He started to limp. Every step he took pained me, like he was killing me on the inside. 
When he was just a foot away from me horror had consumed my whole body. 
We were in the light. 
I could see everything. 
His lips weren’t covered in lipstick but in blood, and that wasn’t dirt on his clothes. 

When I gasped from the sight he just smiled. 
I didn’t get my phone out because it was dead. 
I didn’t run because my legs wouldn’t listen. They just shook. 
And I wish I had pulled out my pepper spray, but I left it on the counter. 
I finally looked up at his blood red eyes. His mouth got wider and became an unnerving smile. 
“Get the fuuu…” he mimicked.
Silence had ceased the moment. His eyes wide and wild his mouth still holding that painful smile. He raised his hand to me, expecting me to give him mine.
I took a step back instead. 
His face snapped straight into rage and grabbed my arm. Just as he took a loud deep breath I ripped myself out of his grip and ran for it. I ran for my life. 

The agonizing roar behind me made me run faster.
“GIRLY!” he screamed, “GIRLY!”
It sounded inhumane, like he was possessed. 
My arm hurt so much I felt tears in my eyes. I think it was broken
I didn’t want to look back. I didn’t want to see that rage in his face. 
I tried thinking of all the routes possible, but his roars clouded my mind. 
I tried blocking them out as hard as I could.
If I took the next turn and went straight home not only would he follow me home but he’d know where I lived. 
If I ran to the park to try and lose him I’d probably fall into a ditch and break a leg. Then I’d be done for. 
My only hope was to run to traffic that was on the end of the street. I ran the hardest I had ever in my life. My lungs were aching and my chest was sore but I didn’t care.
By the time I had reached the end I spun around and saw no one. I looked around frantically, hoping I could lead him into traffic, hoping someone could run him over. 
But I couldn’t. He was gone
I ceased the opportunity and went as quick as I could back home, checking every shadow, every bush. When I reached the front gates of my home I looked around for the last time. He was nowhere to be seen. 

I exhaled loudly and collapsed onto the floor. I felt an overwhelming wave of relief hit me and I began to smile.
‘I made it!’ I thought to myself, ‘I actually fucking made it!’ 
My celebration was interrupted by my stepfather’s drunken cries and relief had disappeared. I got up, ready to open the gate.

Stomp scraaape.
Wait…
Stomp scraaape.
No fucking way…

I looked down the hillside of the street and there he was. Right at the bottom. Even in the distance I could see his wide eyes and smile. He raised his hand and waved at me. I wanted to scream but my vocal chords didn’t want to cooperate.

He started to limp.
 
Stomp scraaape.
Stomp scraaape.



",I now stay home at night,193
FishCustard,21,42,1qrr82,128,"This is the story of how I became a monster.

----

I was heading home from work on the day it started - I'd stayed late to finish up a presentation for the next morning and had to take the slow train home. It seemed to stop at every little place between the city and the small town where I lived. The darkness closed in as the train trundled on, and I drifted off into a light sleep.

When I awoke, a few stations away from home, I was startled to find myself staring into the face of a young woman. She had long, ever so slightly curly black hair, bright blue eyes and a very pretty pale complexion.

""Hello!"" she chuckled as I blinked myself awake.

""Hi there,"" I replied, forcing all the services in my brain to start as quickly as I could.

""Heading home I'm assuming?"" she said, smiling.

""Yeah."" I explained that I was heading home from work. She asked what I did and I gave a quick overview of my very boring job. In almost any other setting this conversation would have been beneath notice, but on the cusp of night, in an empty train carriage with a beautiful girl, it was rather odd.

I asked her what she was doing out; she said that she was visiting someone in one of the towns we passed through as I was sleeping. The conversation went on - I learned that she lived in the same town as me, that she'd just moved into an apartment there and didn't know anyone, that she was looking for a job, etc. We got off the train and exited the station still engrossed in our conversation. Before we headed our separate ways I thought I may as well ask for her phone number - this wasn't something I'd usually dream of doing, but we seemed to have just clicked.

She smiled, took my phone and tapped in her name and number.

Elysia.

A pretty name to go with the pretty girl, I thought as I walked home. We continued our chatting via text over the next few days, and even had a Skype session over the weekend during which we argued the merits of the latest film releases and swapped favourite movies.

Everything was going swimmingly until I received a text one evening that made my chest tighten instantly.

&gt;Jake, I'm scared. I think there's something weird going on here...

&gt;What do you mean, what's going on?

&gt;Yesterday when I got back home the door was already wide open. Nothing was taken though. Thing is, the same thing happened today, and now there's a horrible smell in the bathroom.

&gt;Ok, call the police and I'll be right over. What's your address?

She texted it to me - one of the new build apartments on the edge of town. I remembered them because of how unusual the blocks are: each floor is painted a different colour, the first floor is blue, the second green and the top floor is red. They looked a bit like alien angel cakes.

I drove out to her as quickly as I could without drawing unwanted attention to myself. The parking lot was almost empty, so I parked as close to the entrance of her building and rushed in. I looked at the address again to confirm: 404, that means 4th floor I thought to myself.

I decided to forgo the elevator and bounded up the stairs two at a time, heart thumping through my ribcage. When I got to the 4th floor landing it was pitch black. A strong uneasy feeling crept up my spine, but I crept forward, groping the wall for a light switch as I went. Eventually the lights came on of their own accord - a faulty motion sensor, I thought to myself as I headed for #404 at the far end of the corridor.

Elysia opened the door as I approached, she must have been watching through the spyhole.

""You didn't have to come over, but... thanks,"" she said.

""No problem - did you call the police?""

""Yeah, although they didn't seem to take me very seriously. They said they'd send someone though, to take my statement and have a look around.""

I asked whether she wanted anything, but she declined. I continued by asking whether she minded if I had a quick look around myself - she didn't. I started with the bathroom.

As soon as I walked in I was hit by a disgusting combination of sickly-sweetness and metallic tang. I checked everywhere I could think of to find the source of the smell, but it seemed to be coming from all around me; there was nothing obviously out of place, no rotting horrors under the bath, no Cthulhoid beings in the toilet cistern. I was about to head up into the loft space when the lights went dead.

I froze for what felt like a whole minute, but could only have been a second or so. I called out to Elysia. No reply. Shit.

I fished my phone out of my pocket and turned on its flashlight. I crept out of the bathroom and walked straight into something. Leaping back in terror I turned my flashlight on it, expecting to see some shambling horror, but was immensely relieved to see that it was only Elysia.

""You frightened the life out of me!"" I said.

""Sorry! I didn't know you were still in there. I don't know what happened, everything's dead!"" Elysia said. ""What do we do, what's going on...""

Putting my arm around her, I led her toward the front door, gently but quickly. ""I don't know, but I do know we have to get out of here.""

""But the police...""

""We'll wait for them in the lobby, where it's bright and there's more than one way out, okay?"" I think I was trying to convince myself of the plan more than her. Nevertheless I felt her head nod against my shoulder.

As we reached the door there came the sound of scraping metal from outside. My heart nearly lept out of my mouth until I realised it was the elevator doors opening - the cops must be here. The sound of heavy boots striding down the corridor followed. I looked through the spyhole, and immediately wished I hadn't.

The lights outside were flickering on and off, bathing the corridor in stroboscopic lighting. In the flashes of illumination I saw three large figures heading directly for the apartment. They had elongated faces that appeared to taper to a tentacle-like appendage, no mouth and huge, black sunken eyes. They walked slowly, with a vaguely stooped gait.

As they approached the door, I heard their raspy, gurgling breathing. Only then did it click that these things were *right outside the fucking door*.

I grabbed Elysia and ran to the kitchen, telling her to hide in a closet. She screamed at me that there were no closets in the kitchen. I was about to tell her to make a run for one, when there was an almighty crash - the splintering and rending of wood. They were inside.

I frantically searched the drawers for a knife, eventually finding one. I grabbed another and gave it to Elysia. A second later one of the things filled the kitchen doorway. I ran at it, knife raised, but the next thing I knew I was on my back on the floor - and the knife had slid somewhere under the cooker. Elysia was too terrified to do anything - the monstrous being simply picked her up and put her over its immense shoulder. I got back to my feet and looked around for another weapon, eventually settling on a large marble rolling pin.

I followed the thing out into the living room, only to be confronted with what must have been one of the others. By now I was running on adrenaline only and my eyes had adjusted to the dark somewhat. I swung the marble rod at the creature's head with all the force I could muster, expecting it to magically deflect, or simply have no effect. But it didn't. It connected, and the horrible thing collapsed to its knees. I struck it again and it collapsed to the floor, its unearthly rasping breaths laboured and uneven.

Despite my triumph, two lights clicked on in my head. One, by now the thing that had taken Elysia would be long gone, back to whatever fucking dimension these things came from. Two, there were three of them.

I turned on instinct. Too late. It was on me before I could react, punching me to the ground with a massive fist. I tried to stand, but fresh darkness was creeping into my vision. As I drifted away from consciousness, my arm began to burn with pain - it had injected me with some kind of venom. I was going to die.

----

Only I didn't. That might be the worst part of all this.

I woke up to blinding white light and an unfamiliar ceiling. I looked around and new fear gripped my heart. I had no idea where I was, but I knew I had to get out - clinical white walls, intense lighting and nothing in the small room bar a metal-frame bed and a bedside table. One door. I tried to get up but I couldn't coordinate any of my movements properly. What did that thing inject me with?

Thoughts swam through my brain as I remembered the beings and the apartment... Elysia. They took Elysia. My train of thought was brought to a shuddering stop by the door opening. I fully expected to see one of the tentacle faced horrors, come to finish the job.... but it wasn't. A man wearing a crisp black shirt, black trousers and a deep red waistcoat stepped in to the room. His clothes were totally at odds with the bright white room, but his hair seemed to blend in nicely. It was thick, almost bushy, and bright white.

""I'm sorry about all this,"" he said. His accent was odd... British? I couldn't place it. ""We're normally a lot better than this. Long story.""

""What did you do with Elysia?"" I shouted.

""The girl? She's safe. For now.""

""You monsters,"" I spat, imagining what they would do to her.

""That's a very interesting point,"" the man said, walking to the table and pouring two glasses of water from a jug I hadn't even noticed. He offered me one but I obviously declined. ""Hm, I don't blame you,"" he muttered at that point.

Wanting any answers I could get, I blurted out ""what the fuck were those things?"".

""What things?""

""The tentacle-faced things that took Elysia. They're something to do with you I assume.""

The man looked genuinely confused for a moment, before his face fell. ""Was this what you saw?"" he said, heading back to the door. He muttered to someone just outside the room and one of the horrific beings followed him inside.

Only it wasn't a horrific being. It was a man. A man wearing a full-face gas mask and some kind of respiration equipment on his back. A long rubber tube connected the bottom of his mask to the pack on his back, and there were two large black lenses over his eyes. The equipment must have been heavy as he walked with a slight stoop.

""What the fuck is going on here?"" I just about managed to say.

""This is Iain,"" the man continued. ""You're fine to breathe in here, this one's clean."" The 'monster' reached up and took the mask off. Underneath was a broad-faced, brown haired man of about 40. He nodded curtly.

""So... what happened?"" I said, unable to form more of a thought than that.

""Well, tell me about Elysia,"" the first man replied.

I told him the story of us meeting on the train, how we got closer over a few weeks and then how she texted me to say that her apartment had been open and there was a weird smell.

""This is the interesting bit,"" he said, almost smiling. ""Where did she live?""

""In an apartment on the edge of town,"" I said, sighing. Clearly they knew all this.

""Yes, one of those weird multi-coloured low-rise blocks. Which number?""

The instant he said that my world started to upside down. ""404,"" I whispered.

Realisation hit me again like a freight train. Those wacky buildings where the first floor is blue, the second is green and the third is red.

There is no fourth floor.

""Which leaves us with the question of just where you were last night,"" the man said. He continued prattling but I wasn't listening - I was too busy replaying events. Meeting Elysia after waking up on a midnight train, texting her... she never mentioned work, or even what she did all day. Then the dark landing, the smell in the bathroom, the lights going out... the fact that she didn't reply when I called out to her, yet she was *right outside the door*. I practically fell over her when I came out of the bathroom. Oh God.

""So Elysia..."" I said, unable to finish the sentence.

""Let's just say that you weren't meant to get out of that building.""

""But she looked perfectly normal.""

""*But* we now know that appearance is far from everything. It was dark. Did you *really* look at Elysia after the lights went out?""

As I replayed my memory to see if I could pick out anything about Elysia's appearance, something else jumped out at me. ""I hit one of... them,"" I waved a finger at Iain, ""with a rolling pin.""

The white-haired man sighed. ""Yes, you did. Understandable under the circumstances.""

""What happened to him?""

""He died. Subdural haematoma.""

I collapsed back onto the bed, cold and shaking. ""What's going to happen to me?""

""Well, under official procedures you'll have to be charged with... manslaughter probably. Obviously you'd have self-defence and diminished responsibility as defences though. Can't guarantee you won't go to jail, they're under instructions to push for hard sentences.""

""Instructions from whom? Area 51? CIA? NSA? The SCP Foundation?""

The mysterious man stared at the floor for a couple of seconds. When his eyes met mine, there was a distinct sadness in them. ""No. Me.""

For a brief moment, silence filled the room. Then I burst out laughing. ""Wait, you're going to tell all this to a judge and jury? I killed some man in a mask on a floor that shouldn't exist while he was trying to stop some fucking demon from eating me?""

""They... they don't eat people,"" the man corrected as if I'd just said that two plus two is nine. ""Anyway, not that kind of court. You've heard of military tribunals and such, yes?""

I nodded.

""It's like that.""

Despair was about to consume me when I caught onto something. ""Hang on, you said 'officially'...""

The man smiled. ""Well, I *am* one operative short now. And things are so inefficient these days, they're always losing evidence and having to drop cases...""

And so that is how I became a monster. A monster with a long face, black sunken eyes and raspy, gurgling breath, trying his best to save the next person from similar fate.",Elysia,170
PatMallon,18,49,1qwsuf,128,"It had me where it wanted, delivering its final test, or perhaps threat. “Blink and they will all be gone. Everyone you love. Everyone you care for. Stripped from your mind like they were never there.”

The following minutes were agonizing, feeling like an eternity. My eyes twitched repeatedly as I unnaturally pried them open. They streamed tears of both pain and misery, but soon those tears ran dry and dust began collecting.  That’s when the burning started, like hot irons singeing my corneas. Despite the suffering, I cried out, “I must keep them open.” But I knew I wouldn’t be able to do this forever.

Soon, I regrettably freed my eyelids from their pry and let my lashes engage. Moisture returned. The pain ceased – not just the searing of my eyes, but the sadness within. I suddenly realized its plan was flawed. I raised my head with a cocky grin to let it know that it should have chosen someone, unlike me, who actually had others to love.

For whatever reason, it simply returned the very same grin.","""Blink and they will all be gone.""",177

Ill start with the basics and excuse me for spelling mishaps for I am writing this out via mobile device. I am supposedly a eighteen year old female. Currently living in Canada, although I hail from Debrecen, Hungary. I moved to Canada when I was ten years old. For as long as I can remember I have questioned what I am. Certain signs have always been there. I feel things I'm sure others do but most don't, I see things and I talk to things. 


First weird occurrence, I do not remember life in Hungary at all. I only remember from the age of ten and up. It feels like I've only been alive for eight years. Second I don't know where my parents are. I lived with a woman named Tina and a man named Marco since I moved to Canada up until I moved out a couple months ago. They tell me they adopted me, and that my Hungarian parents went missing and were never found. 


I feel cold all the fucking time. My feet and hands always feel like ice blocks, to the point where my boyfriend can't take the chills he gets when I put my hands around him at night. In the summer even on the hottest days I am always wearing a sweater and avoiding the shade. I love the sunshine. In the winter months it is ten times worse. I can feel my bones aching from being so cold. 


I can't swim, I float but I can't swim or ride a bike. People are either left handed or right handed, I am niether. I can't write worth shit with either of my hands. I try to only eat food I don't have to use silverware for. 


A polar bear follows me. I see him everywhere I go, tried to touch him once but he disintegrated into the air. I see dark figures that roam the streets at night, I see people in my mirrors that aren't there when I look behind me. I've gotten so used to seeing things I'm not even scared anymore. A few have spoken to me, they mainly ask for help. I helped one once but he burned me. 


I feel pain, and I bleed though. I pass out when I hold my breath, I have emotions. I look normal I think. Sorry for the male readers, I don't bleed once a month like I'm supposed to. I don't even have the organs I am supposed to, to reproduce. I have baffled x-ray techs and doctors everywhere. 


My dog not only hears me but he understands what I am saying. He can do all his tricks without hand motions, just my voice. No big? When my boyfriend tries to get him to do a trick just by speaking to him he doesn't know what to do until my boyfriend gestures along with the words. Tina and Marco tell me Oz (my dog) has been with me since and during Hungary. 


I've gone a week without food before I started feeling light headed all the time and gained hunger pains. I didn't lose any weight, I never do. And I never gain any. My teeth were so sharp they used to cut into my cheeks and cause discomfort, but last year the dentist filed them down for me. Baffled. 


I don't think I can see as well as a cat can in the dark but deffintly better then most other people. I've never had friends, people have always avoided me or left me out of activities. 


Tina is a ethologist and Marco is a paleontologist as their professions, why can't I remember. 
What happened in Hungary?
",I have fear I am not from this place.,159
you_are_all_jerks,24,49,1qyvt1,125,"I grew up in northern NJ my entire life.  We lived in a couple different houses/apartments in nice, quaint neighborhoods with good neighbors and an all over good vibe.  The first house we lived at after my parents split up will be one I will never forget, and I was only 3 when it happened. 

My parents were divorced on my first birthday and a year later my mom, aunt, and I rented a house in the small town of Blairstown.  The house was split into two houses as it was a fairly large older house.  We had the upstairs and a rabbi lived below us; he lived there for many years.  Even though I was only 3 or 4 at the time, it seems like yesterday.  I remember being in my moms arms as we took a tour through the house and I just felt very uneasy, like someone was watching me.  I guess my aunt and mom liked it because no sooner had we looked at it did we move in.  As most normal renters do when they move in, we cleaned the house up, there was this weird red paint on the walls and water in the kitchen, we thought there was a water leak.  After a plumber came, there was no water leak so we just assumed someone left the picture window open during the storm the night before.

Everything seemed to be going great the first couple weeks.  It was a lovely neighborhood and all but there was just this weird vibe I kept getting.  I woke up one morning to my aunt screaming, it wasn't loud or anything but just a small shriek of surprise.  Getting out of my bed I noticed the floor was really cold, but then again it was winter and real hardwood.  But the heat was on last night, why was it so cold?  I walked down the hallway and saw my aunt and mom with buckets cleaning this red paint off the walls again.  I overheard them talking in low voices to one another;
Mom: Gum (my aunts nickname was Gumby), this smells like blood not paint.
Gumby: I noticed.  

They continued to wash the walls off as I, being the little explorer I was, decided to go upstairs to the attic to look for my barbie dolls.  The attic door was at the end of the kitchen and usually hard a hard time closing, the house was way old.  As I  walk up stairs I smelled something really bad, like warm dog poo on a hot summer day, bad.  I get up stairs and see a pile of what looks like coal in the corner and a big red door next to it.  A noise from behind the door startles me and I run back down the stairs, nearly falling on my butt most of the way.  When I open the door I start crying and run to my mom.  She asks me what's wrong and I tell her there is a big red door up stairs and there's something behind it. My aunt looks at her, she looks at my aunt and they both tell me it's probably a squirrel or something, I knew better than that.  There was something bad up there, I could feel it.

A few more weeks pass and things are getting more and more creepy.  Every morning I listen to my mom and aunt clean blood off the walls.  They just kept saying it must be paint that is bleeding through the wall paper.  You could tell by their voices they were scared.  I spent most of my time playing barbies or doll in the living room but it kept getting really cold.  The pilot light on our furnace kept blowing out and we couldn't figure out why.  Again, my aunt and mom told me it was cold because it was winter.  

We would sit on the couch and watch a movie or TV at night before bed.  One night my mom and aunt watched a scary movie, of course I wanted to watch and they actually let me but said I couldn't get scared.  Looking back now, I laugh at my childish self, I am a wimp for good reason!  We were about 15 minutes into the movie when I heard a knock on the window next to the couch.  I look over and see someone looking in our window waving.  It was hard to tell if it was a male or female, it was solid but not, had a face, but didn't.  I screamed and jumped on my mom's lap yelling ""Mommy someone is outside!!!""  My mom quickly glances at the window, she saw it, I know she did!  She runs out the front door and around back.  Only a few moments later she came back, pale as could be and told me to go to my room.  I cried that I didn't want to but she said it was time for bed.  

I stayed up and listened to my mom and aunt talk at the kitchen table. 

Mom: Gumby, that window is 10 feet up off the ground, there is no way someone could be in the window.
Gumby: Tee (my mom's name is Tina), she's a kid she probably just saw a reflection of the TV.
Mom: I saw it too. It wasn't a reflection.

The house got this eerie quietness to it.  I went to bed and fell fast asleep.

The next day I wake up to footsteps in the attic, I go out into the living room and see the attic door open, my aunt is cleaning up the blood.  I asked where mom was and she said ""Upstairs, checking out that door for you.""  I had completely forgotten about the door. 

I go outside and sit on the porch, the neighboors dog comes up to me and starts licking my face, he was the cutest black lab ever.  Suddenly , his fur stands straight on end and he starts viciously barking at the front door of our house before whimpering off as if someone scolded him.  I go back inside and my mom is pacing around the kitchen talking on the phone to someone.  Under the door knob to the attic was my little rocking chair I had, it was in my room, I wondered why my mom put it there.

That evening we were eating dinner and I felt weird again.  I was sitting across from the attic door eating when I noticed my rocking chair was ever so slightly rocking, almost as if the wind blew it, but it was smooth.  Never really slowing down or speeding up.  I guess my aunt saw me staring at it and looked over.  I felt her kick my mom under the table and nod towards the door.  My mom turned her head, after a few more rocks the chair stopped, dead.  The lightbulbs in the small chandelier over the kitchen table started dripping water.  At first it was slow but it increased to the point where there was a steady stream coming out of the bottom of them.  We all looked up, completely silent, you could feel the wave of panic/horror in the room though.  I look back at the rocking chair and there is a little girl with a grin on her face looking at me.  Her fingers are all bloody and her old school dress looks torn.  My mom let out a shriek my aunt jumped out of her seat and ran to the attic door just before the little girl turned and walked through it.  The water stopped dripping.

My mom worked nights and had to leave that night for work, my aunt was watching me.  She put me to bed with a glass of water as usual.  I don't know what time it was but I know it was before 4AM.  I woke up and was really thirsty, I reached down on the floor and picked up my glass of water.  After a nice big drink I start putting the glass down and it falls, shattering into a million pieces.  I looked at the door, I hear my aunt come running down the hallway.  When I looked back down I saw a face in the puddle of water.  I blinked twice, thinking it was the reflection of the moon playing tricks on me.  I was mesmerized by this face.  It was purple and black and had this slightly evil yet welcoming grin on it's face.  I reached down to touch it when all of a sudden I felt this pain on the back of my hand.  I screamed and the trace was broken as my aunt flung my door open.  She picks me up and takes me to the kitchen where she sits me on the table.  The back of my hand is covered in blood, I guess the glass cut it all up, but why the top of my hand and not my palm I wondered.  My aunt ran my hand under water and it became clear why it was bleeding so bad.  It was glass that cut me, it was teeth.  There was a full imprint of teeth on the back of my hand.  My aunt started yelling at me for biting my hand and I told her it wasn't me, it was the lady in the puddle.  She didn't say much after that.  She just bandaged up my hand the best she could as she called my mom to tell her she was bringing me to the doctor.  

The doctor looked at my hand and confirmed that I did not bite my own hand.  He also had to take imprints of my  mom and aunts teeth to rule out child abuse.  They weren't a match and everything was fine.

When we get home I over heard my mom and aunt saying that they want to move.  My mom suggests they talk to the rabbi and see if he knows anything about the house.  We all head downstairs and knock on his door.  His smile is warm and welcoming and he lets us in.  He gives me a toy to play with and I go about letting my imagination run wild but still keep an ear open.  My mom and aunt tell him everything.  The big red door in the attic that goes no where, is hot to the touch and doesn't have a knob.  The bat crap that's next to it that she cleans up every day.  The pilot light constantly going out, the kitchen raining, the face in the puddle the window, EVERYTHING.  After choking back tears my mom asks what we can do.  He suggested to move out, and leave everything.  He pulled out a box of newsclippings and started showing them to my mom and aunt.  There was a mother and little girl who used to live in the house years ago.  They didn't have much money so the mom worked all of the time.  One cold windy night the mom left to work, leaving her daughter in the house.  The wind blew the pilot light out on the furnace, and with the age of the house, the wind whipped through there making it nearly freezing really fast.  This little girl got cold and wrapped herself in a blanket.  The walls of the kitchen were still warm since the furnace was close to there.  She began taking panel after panel off the wall to get to the warmth.  She crawled into the insulation to keep warm and doing that cause her to choke on fiberglass and die in the wall.  When the mother came home to see her daughter dead she hung herself by the window in the back.  There it was, all laid out on the table.  The rabbi explained that most people who had lived in the house since then didn't have a problem unless they had a small child, particularly a girl.  My aunt and mom thanked him and we left back to our house.

A week later we were finally moving into our new house.  That week was the week from hell in our current house.  We packed our essentials and left them in my moms truck.  I had a diamond cross that was given to me as a baby that I wanted but it was stuck upside down on my dresser.  The diamonds also looked like they were dying, that is the best way I could describe them.  

The last night we were there we decided it would be best to put the queen mattress in my room since it got the most light from the outside light and moon and we would all sleep there.  I was in the middle, my mom to the left my aunt to the right.  My aunt being the prankster she is kept knocking on the floor to scare me.  Finally my mom reached over and slapped her and told her to stop because it was scaring me.  A few seconds later she did it again.

Mom: Gumby knock it the fuck off you're scaring her!
Gumby:...It's not me.

No sooner did she say that and my water glass started to move across the floor towards the hallway.  We looked down the hallway and saw this figure at the end of the hallway where it meets the kitchen, kneeling down and pounding on the floor.  It was pounding so hard that you could feel the vibrations in the bedroom.  The figure also sounded like it was wailing.  A shrill cry of sorrow and despair is the best way I can describe it.  We slammed the bedroom door shut and locked it.  My mom grabbed her cross on her neck and just held us all close until the pounding stopped.  I don't know when it stopped, I was being clutched so tight the only thing I could hear was my moms heart beat until I fell asleep.

The next day we were gone at the crack of dawn to our new place.  We had left so many things in that house, we were too scared to go back in let alone possibly bring something with us.

To this day, I still remember everything pretty clear for the most part.  There are a few things I have forgotten but that is to be expected after almost 22 years.  Whenever I am back home I like to cruise up to Blairstown and drive by the house.  I still get the creepy vibe but then again that's the whole town.  After doing some research my mom found that the town was once known for devil worshiping.  Makes sense as to why my cross looked like it was dying and there was bat poo all by a red hot door that led no where.  I'd definitely like to go back in one day just to see how things are.  I'd also one day like to go to the library there and do some more research on the town and that house.

Oh, and to this day I am still afraid to pick up broken glass for fear of seeing that face again.",The house on Lake street.,174
Odyssey_The_Crip,40,36,1r4dm5,122,"Fuck me.
I was told to come here by a friend of mine, having never heard of nosleep. personally I'm not really on board with the idea of having a community of people read my story for personal pleasure, but hey, what ever. 
I guess a little bit of back story is needed here. I live on the nice end of Vancouver city, with my grandmother. I'm in secondary school, and that school is in my general posh-ish neighborhood.  

2 days ago I was Getting home from a long-ass boring day at school, I decided to Fuck around on DayZ until either I died, or fell asleep at the keyboard. At around 11:30 my Dog, Buddy, Decided to be the most annoying little shit possible. So i turned my computer off, and put the little fucker's leash on. At this time of night, the whole block was lights out. I Could barely see 15 feet.
10 minutes of walking later I began to feel a bit paranoid, street light's were flickering, fog was getting thicker. Buddy, on the other hand, was  trotting along rubbing his little schnauzer face in the frosted grass. 
Then, he stopped. Dead in his tracks, then buried his head in my calves. I urged him to keep moving, and after much encouragement he reluctantly followed.
I rounded a corner, going back toward my place, when i spotted a figure in the fog, a big one. Thinking nothing of the fact, just someone else enjoying the fucking weather or something. 
As we got closer buddy started barking, crazily. I urged him to shut up, lest he wake the neighbors. 
Then I got a good look at the figure. It was a man, 6'7 about, pale, He had a brown tweed waist coat, a brown tweed fedora and some brown baggy suit pants. 

As we neared him Buddy grew more and more frantic.
That's when I noticed his smile. The scariest fucking smile you will ever see. He looked like he won the lottery, got laid and inherited a mansion within a period of 2 minutes. It stretched from ear to ear, a yellowed, fake smile.
God, i wish i could have unseen it.
I was within about 3 feet of him, then the smell hit me, It was a mix between pure decay, shit, aged cheese. 

Then, he stopped right in front of me. and said in the most strange voice, like an elderly man trying to be smooth.

""You have a cute dog there, boy.""

""Uh, yeah, thanks.""
I guess something in my voice must have pleased him. or something, cause he chuckled a sick, smokers laugh. I began to move away from him breaking eye contact. Looking back on it, I should have just fucking ran.

He grabbed my arm

""Do you want to see my dog?""
I looked down, and i realized he had a leash too. He yanked on it, and trailing blood, Came the corpse of a maggot riddled dog.
I threw up in my mouth, This thing that was once a dog was missing patches of white fur, it's skin was turning green, bits of skin were missing, it's ear was ripped and an eye was gone. I couldn't even tell what the dog's fucking breed was.

Through his smiling teeth he said.

""Pet the dog""

My dog was oddly quite this whole time,i missed his barking.
I tried to get away, he tightened his grip on my arm then he dug his finger nails into me.

""Pet the dog""

""Please, No"" was all that came out of my mouth.
His smile drained instantly. Into an angry twisted frown, teeth still showing. 

""PET THE FUCKING DOG"" He screamed. yellow spittle flying from his mouth. my arm was turning red from the irritation his brown fingernails were causing me.
I had no choice but to pet the dog. I reached down slowly and ran my free hand along its back. The fur and skin began to peel back as maggots crawled along my palm. My hand was covered in a clear, slimy film. 
He let go of my arm, then shoved me. I landed flat on my ass on the pavement, Then i took off running. My dog was sprinting along with me. Then i heard him laugh, then scream.

""NOW I WANT TO PET YOUR DOG.""

My blood went cold.

I heard pounding on the pavement behind me, and a dragging. 
He was coming after me, pulling his dog along with him. Running 2 straight blocks, i ran down my alleyway, my house was at the end of the block. I flew down the alley, still hearing his laughter and slamming footsteps behind me. I got to my house, ran up the stairs and fumbled for my house keys. As His laughter grew in volume to an unbearable height, i got the door open shoved my dog in then slammed it, and locked it. not even a full second after I locked the door, there was a slam on it. 

He had ran into the door. 

This slamming continued for 20 minutes and then, silence. I waited 5 minutes then called the cops. in less than 10 minutes, they were here. I told them exactly that what happened, they told me they'd book the guy. Until then they told me not to leave the house.

not 5 minutes after they left, i was asleep on the couch with my dog.
I was awoken to the sound of a door bell ringing. I practically jumped off the couch, ran into the kitchen, grabbed a kitchen knife, and went to the door. thinking to myself, 

""I'm gonna kill this bastard.""

I Flung open the door knife in stabbing motion.
No one was there, Nobody.
Then I looked down, And threw up. 
The fucking dog corpse was sitting there, in a pool of blood.
Nailed into the dog's head was a note

""I don't like it when they run.""

Right now I'm sitting in my house, With no one but my grandmother, who is too sickly to get out of bed. My parents and my little brother are out of town at a dude ranch in the interior of the province. 
Fuck dammit.

EDIT: I'm sorry if there's any spelling mistakes, grammar errors, or punctuation issues. I'm shaking right now",Pet The Dog,158
horriddaydream,11,40,1r68c5,117,"My father always taught me to be kind to everyone.

There was this garbage dump close to my home; I can't say anybody got a thrill out of living closely to the wretched thing, for it stunk all to Hell and the trucks constantly entering and exiting could be an extreme annoyance. I walked on the outskirts of town frequently past midnight, which you may say is stupid, especially if you saw my build and how small of a person I am, and just how difficult it would be for me to protect myself from anyone. 

A few times as I passed by the always-opened gates of the dump, I also passed the man who would enter their limits every single night.

As shady as he was, he had a lot to say.

His name was Terrance and he had been staying in the dump at night ever since it had opened back in 1980. He had long, straggly hair and he claimed that ""this area was just too dry; the job shortage was unbelievable."" He would probably never have his own house. I felt the upmost of pity for him and sometimes I even welcomed him to walk with me. Everybody always seemed to know Terrance. He was like the friendly neighborhood hobo. They would nod to him, wave, give him a few dollars, thank me for being so kind to him even though I would shrug it off and whisper that he was simply good company. 

I asked him where he went during the day and he just said ""everywhere."" He had a huge, black satchel that he slung over his back that probably contained normal homeless materials like paper towels, maybe a few little scraps of food. It always smelled but he smelled in general, though I was too nice to say anything. He claimed that there was a hollowed-out truck near the far side of the garbage dump and he would stay there at night because it was warm, and it was shelter. 

It made me want to cry; just the situation that this poor man was in.

I lived with only my father and so on occasion I would invite Terrance home to have a warm meal, and my father was more than happy about this. He was a kind man as I was a kind young adult, and he completely understood that my heart was in the right place. Terrance knew everything about our family in only a short amount of time and he never once took advantage of us. He was just a man who had no direction after losing his way.

Terrance disappeared for a couple of days. I peered in through the gates of the garbage dump, thinking twice about entering. 

I walked to the back and noticed that there was nobody inside the shell of the truck that he had described to me a many of times. But as I peeked inside the windows, I saw many black satchels just like the one that Terrance was always carrying. Most of them were empty, but others were still shut tightly and looked full. 
I reported the scene.

The cops had found small children of all shapes, sizes, ages, and genders inside the bags. He had been living off of them for years. 

There was a lack of missing children in the area, though some were found to be local. Nobody knew where they had all come from.

He had been inside our house. He had been inside my head.

Now he was nowhere to be found.

Magnum6,32,58,1r5par,111,"Born in the mid 90s, i grew up active, and was outdoors alot. However, as the technological age began, I found myself inside more and more. As I grew, i spent more and more time watching T.V., playing videogames on my Super Nintendo. And when the Sony Playstation came out, my parents couldnt pry me from the screen. As a consequence, my eyesight suffered. Slowly at first, but as i got older, it became an issue. It was never so bad that I couldn't see without glasses, but it was bad enough that i needed them to drive when i turned 17. However, as senior in high school i quickly lost my glasses and proceeded to drive anyways. No wrecks, no tickets. I thought that maybe my eyesight had improved over the few months that i had actually worn my glasses. Oh how I wish I had been right. Halfway between being 19 and 20, i picked up a job as a delivery driver. Easy at first. Until i had to start driving at night. The night I almost ran off the road because I couldn't see through the oncoming cars headlights, was the night I knew I had to get a new pair of glasses. The next day I made an appointment, and 7 - 10 business days later i had my new glasses. Nothing special. Just a simple blue metal frame with slightly skinnier than average lenses. I Wore them all day. And whenever someone asked how it felt to have new glasses, i smiled and would comically sing ""It's a whole new world"", you know, that cute little song from The Little Mermaid. Oh how right i was. As I prepared for bed that night, getting changed, taking a shower. It all seemed normal. Until I wore my glasses into my darkened bedroom. No light was on in my room. And i had foolishly turned off the hallway light before entering my bedroom. Now in total darkness, I realized just what real fear was. You see, with my slightly blurred vision of not wearing glasses, any shadow could be brushed off, simply because i couldn't focus and see what was just beyond the outer veil of darkness that covered them. But now, with those infernal glasses. I could see them clear as day. The creatures from monster stories. My own personal Boogiemen. All sitting around my room watching, waiting, inviting me to lay down and fall asleep right in their midst. Right in my own bed. I stood stunned. Terrified. Not Knowing what to do. When suddenly, one of them spoke. The most terrifying voice I had ever heard. ""Why not run away again child? It amuses us to watch you at night, oblivious to our very existence. Unaware that you lay right where we want you. Each and every night."" I stared blankly, and felt confused. Again? How could i have seen these creatures before and not remember it. Surely I would have some memory. But none came. As if to answer my question, it spoke again. ""Perhaps these will jog your memory."" It brought up its gnarled hand and un-clenched its fist, palm up, to reveal my original pair of glasses. A pair now almost three years old. That's when it hit me. I hadn't lost my glasses. But thrown them away. Into a river. Nearly twenty miles from where i lived. Now more afraid than anything, I did the only thing I could, I laid down in my bed. Removed my glasses, and watched as those terrible Boogiemen, again returned into those empty, featureless shadows, that surround each and every one of us every night as we lay down to sleep.",Glasses,169
mrmappy,9,34,1r4x0l,93,"I always listen to music as I sleep. Before I go to bed, I turn on my laptop by my bedside table, run any pending downloads I still have, open Banshee (my music player), press play and leave it as I drift off to sleep. At times I would wake up, groggy and sensitive to the sound so I would stop the music and go back to sleep. Two nights ago however, what I woke up to was not music. Instead it was the voice of my mother. Telling me something with the sweetest motherly voice I have long been familiar with.  

Mom already passed away. For almost four years now.  

Was I afraid if hearing her voice? Of course not! Everyone at home longed to hear her again. Everyone at home longed so much to see her again. I missed that sweet voice, and boy was I happy to be able to hear that again. Of course, I understand that it was just a dream. A dream in the most familiar of environments, with the voice of your late mother talking to you. I'm happy for just that.  

What she told me in that dream though, did make me scared. Her words, though in the most caring and motherly of voices, were:  
""Hi honey. I'll see you real soon okay?""

I used to be on NoSleep every day.

___________________________________________________________________________________

Sunday night, maybe 2am.

I had just shut down my computer after my nightly gaming session.  I was laying in bed, browsing reddit on my phone, and debating whether or not I was hungry enough to eat another can of spaghettio's, or if it would even be worth the trouble of walking downstairs and waiting for it to heat up. I'm not sure what made me notice it, what actually snapped my senses to the realization...but it was suddenly too **quiet**.

Granted it was 2am, so its not like I was expecting any sort of noise in particular.  My roommate had fallen asleep hours ago, but it was just so *still*.  I'm not sure if any of you know what I'm talking about, but it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  I felt like I was in a vacuum; it was utterly oppressive. 

I'm not sure how long I sat there, waiting for something, before the glow.  A deep blood red light had flooded the hall and oozed under my door, and it was slowly pulsing.  I wanted to call out, to tell my roommate to fuck off, but I knew it wasn't him. I just knew. I don't think I could've formed words if I tried.  The vacuum sensation I had felt was gone, and now, sitting in my tiny bedroom I felt like I was under a microscope. That terrible “like you're being watched” sensation I read about so much hit me like a brick.  I can't explain how exactly I felt, a mix of horror, dread, and confusion.  I wanted to bolt, but I wouldn't have been able to force myself to open that door if I tried.

I managed to shuffle off my bed, and to the floor.  I opened up my nightstand, reaching for my revolver. I needed to feel that cold steel, and the heft of it in my hand. As soon as I picked it up, I was at a loss because for the first time, it just felt like a toy in my hand. I looked back to the door to that glow, and felt completely powerless.  There was a shadow now, someone was standing outside my bedroom door, and I felt like I might as well have been holding a nerf gun.  

When the long scratch started, I felt nauseous.  Like I was 17 again, smoking weed in my room when I thought I had the house to myself and my mom knocked on the door asking why the fuck it smelled like burning leaves in the hall. That sudden weight in my stomach, the sudden dryness in my mouth.

It was like a nail being dragged down the door, from the top of the doorway to the bottom.  I followed the sound with my eyes, and when it stopped, I heard a voice.  “Hear” might not be the right word, because it came from inside my head.

*Michael. Please put down the weapon.  We do not want to harm you, and I do not plan on doing so. Your weapon would be useless anyways, but I respect your autonomy. May I enter?*

This had to be a dream; a nightmare. If every waking moment since I...heard that voice hasn't been an eternity in a waking hell, I might be able to convince myself that it was.

*I wish to speak with you, Michael. We have much to discuss. May I enter?*

There was no fucking way this was happening.  I'm...lucky I didn't need to, because I couldn't have spoken if I tried.  Whatever it was must have known there was no way I would have let it in, because it answered me anyways.

*No matter, you will see us in due time.  We would like to invite you on a journey, Michael.  You will come with us, and see everything you have always wished to. We've known you for a long time, you would say “years”.  You have a week to decide, we will not force you. You will require no luggage, no currency. You will want for nothing.  You will not see your family or friends again, but in time you will cease to worry about them.*  

 *We respect your decisions. I do think however, you only have one real choice.  I will see you soon.*

__________________________________________________________________________________

Then it was all just over...I might have sat there for hours. At some point, I got up and sat on my bed.  When I finally mustered the courage to look out the window, it was already dawn. When I heard my roommate get up and go to work, and finally figured it was safe to open my door.

I am a shell.  I don't know what to do you guys.  I haven't slept. I forced myself to eat something yesterday, but everything tastes of cardboard.  I booted up my computer, but now my *life* just feels like a game I'm sick of. 

I forced myself to talk to my parents the other day, and smile at work, but any interaction I have feels forced and artificial...like I'm just going through the motions. There was no way I could mention what happened Sunday night to anyone. 

He was right...I have only have one choice.  If I don't go with him...with *them*, I'll be trapped in this empty hell. My life feels like a hamster in a cage.

Who the fuck knows what will happen if I **do** go with them...?  

I cannot sleep. ",Invitation.,122

Alright then. This will be a long post. Ive been putting off writing this all down, but Ive got a growler of Pech Mortel and half an hour till new shows download, so here goes.

Post #1
So a week or so ago I was sitting, minding my own business enjoying a delicious club sandwich, lasagna soup and Extra spicy Caesar for lunch at a local pub, when I received about 7 calls from a local, but unfamiliar, number. 

Now, Im not really one to talk on the phone, if you know me well. Text message, facebook, whatever is fine. I also really dont like having to take the time out of my day to listen to voicemail like some kind of archaic peasant. My voice mail message is something along the lines of ""Hey, I dont listen to my voice mail, ever. So text me or email me at *****@gmail.com""

So I return to work and notice that I do, in fact, have a voice mail. Now again, I normally wont bother even listening to them, but, with that many calls, it could be an emergency call from a payphone or so. I give it a listen, after then painfully arduous process of dialing the number, password, and the like.

""Errrrrrm, *scramble scramble* you call this number about 5 times yesterday *scramble scramble* I dont know who you are *scramble scramble* the authorities are on to me *scramble scramble*""


Ok.

Like an idiot I deleted the original message. I instantly regretted it.
Well, first thing first is to google the phone number. The only hit I receive on the internet is a personal ad from the Los Angeles Times newspaper.

http://i.imgur.com/hT3hbNV.jpg

Hmm, thats bizarre. If you look up those Revelations quotes they are all in the ""the streets will flow with the blood of the non-believer"" vein.

Well, I text the number back ""Hi there, who is this?""

No response for a few days, figure thats the end of it. But definitely curious as to the back story of that ad....

*****************************

Fast forward a few days, my phone rings again, I answer. It is a relatively pleasant, rational, elderly sounding gentleman

""Hello?""

""Hi there, Ive recieved like 17 calls from your number in the last few days, my name is Greg. Just wondering if youve been trying to get ahold of me?""

""Sorry buddy, no idea. Ive definitely never called you. You do have a pretty crazy personal ad in the Los Angeles times with your phone number attached to it though....""

""Ahh yes, the ad! I put that there. If you know about the ad, then you know who I am!""

""Umm, no I really dont actually, who are you?""

""Well then, Im in fact Jesus Christ!""

""Well(wtf!?!), Amen to that!""

""Good, im glad you are on board! We shall keep in touch!""

""Ummmmm, ok. Cheers man""

Oooook. Well thats interesting......

An hour later I receive the first Email.

lynzo,10,40,1r79t5,87,"Through years of failed attempts to have my own kids, I yearned for children of my own, well, used to. 

I would travel for hours just to baby-sit my nephews while Helen (my sister) goes for their fortnightly romantic dinners to ""keep the flames of passion going"", in her words.

Playgrounds and parks were my favourite hunts. Toddlers old enough to walk would sometimes totter their way to the bench I'm sitting on just to smile at me. Young children would come up to me and play 'pretend' with me. It's quite a strange phenomenon, but without my trying to, children takes a liking to me. Of course, I'd gotten strange looks from parents, as though I dangled a carrot in front of their children's noses to lure them to me. There were carrots, but just not fr.

I met my BF (now husband) some years ago. In the beginning stages of courtship, he would just look at me and smile, and I just thought he was just smitten with me. It was only some months into our relationship that I found out he could see spirits. His childhood was shaky when he first realised no one else saw the paler beings. He had since gotten used to them as they would either wander aimlessly or just stay rooted to a spot. Apart from seemingly looking at him, they don't try to communicate with him.

One day, a few months after finding out about his ability, he told me he has something to tell me. For one, he isn't the secretive or romantic type so I guessed it wasn't to propose. He held my hands and looked at me straight in the eye, and said, ""Umm... How should I put this..."" After a few false starts, impatient me started losing my cool and he finally got it out, in the crudest way he could put it (I know I deserved it), 


""You have three little ones following you since the day I met you and that's the reason why I looked your way and smiled at you. I've been wondering, but why are they following you?""


He went on, with a matter-of-factly tone, to explain that the children at the playground were not approaching me, but the little ones following me, and that the little ones aren't like the usual spirits he have seen but are much smaller (thus the name ""little ones""). Despite it being a hot day, the chills and the cold in my chest made the weather more bearable.

Before this, I had a failed relationship with a man who loves children as much as I did, but just upped and left, the day after I was discharged from the hospital for my third miscarriage.

I don't exactly know where to turn, like the majority of the sub I'm assuming you share the same interest as me in the supernatural, the other side. I've always been intensely fascinated with it, usually the furthest I went was browsing /r/nosleep or heading into abandoned houses to sate my thirst for the creepy, although, the same routine things quickly became dull and eventually, I slowly got desensitized, bored. This was about the time I started reading 'recipes' for paranormal experiences.


The whole thing seemed awesome, the Midnight Man, One Man Hide and Seek, The Shoebox Telephone. All gave me chills, but I remained quietly skeptical the whole time. Fuck. Why did I have to be so blind. I still can't find the place to blame myself, I mean reading scary stories on the internet posted by a bunch of anonymous people, it would be stupid to take it all for fact, right?


Of all the rituals, one caught my eye, The Three Kings. I'm hesitant to post the link but I feel like it would be naive to think that no one would give it a quick search. http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wbo0u/please_dont_actually_try_this/ A blunt explanation of it would be a recipe where you can contact the dead, and ask them questions through two propped up mirrors.


After reading it I felt like I had to do it. I quickly spread it to a few friends and it wasn't long until hype was built upon the whole thing. Me and my best mate (For his sake i'll call him, Darcy), organized to do this when we had a few friends over for a small gathering whilst my parents were out for the week. Funny enough, at the time the thing I was worried the most about was it not working. We had tried a ouija board once at my request, and nothing happened, we all just sat there fingers on the cup for 10 minutes blaming each other for pushing it whenever it moved in the slightest. They all probably thought I was an idiot. So I thought I would give it a kick, my bright idea would be that we would all get absolutely hammered beforehand so that when it (surely) didn't work we would imagine that it did or at least get really scared in the process. Well at least we had the 'really scared' part down pat.


So everyone came at around 9:00pm yesterday, and it was all pretty normal, caught up, bitched about a few people, had some laughs and it wasn't until around 11:00pm that we started to set up. The atmosphere then was so... amusing of all things. We all giggled the whole time in our stupor, acting as if we were kids in primary school kids about to pull a really lame prank. It all seemed fun then. Of course I had to be the one who volunteered to be the one who sat the throne, eager to show my courage off to my friends. My lifeline was Darcy, if anyone was to hold the key between my life and death i'd gladly hand it to him.

For the sake of the story I'll skip all the tedious setting up and get to 3:33am. We were all fighting sleep by then and I think Sarah and Alistair were already gone, though we were sitting outside that door for so long it was hard for us to miss the time. When I had walked in I was immediately hit by the cool air, though this one wasn't the ghostly cold, it was literally fucking freezing from the fan that had been buzzing on for a few hours. Though something did feel off, it was either the fact that I was in a pitch black room holding a candle to my chest with a chair and two mirrors propped up adjacent to it, or it was that all of a sudden everything was quite. As if the world around me was devoid of life bar the constant drone of the fan. 


I sat down clutching the candle tightly, persistent to not let it go out, suddenly very aware to what i was doing. I remember shifting in my chair uncomfortably for a while but what follows that still remains hazy. I remember trying to call out for answers, ""Who's there"" ""What are you doing?"" ""Is there another side?"". None were answered, just silence, and the buzzing of the fan. I then said something stupid and heard giggling, assuming it was my friends outside I started cracking jokes. The more jokes I made the harder they laughed until I said ""Why arn't you responding, too scared to show your faces?"" and looked into the mirrors. Now, the huge cardinal rules of this recipe is not to look in the mirrors and around about this whole thing turned to fucking shit. The worst thing about looking into the mirrors isn't what I saw but rather the absence of it. I saw nothing, i saw the chair, the fan, but no me. I quickly looked to the other, and greeted by the same emptiness. Then the rumbling began, have you ever been in a house when a plane has flown overhead and the ground slightly shakes? It was like that except the sound emanated from the floor rather than the sky. It continued to get louder and louder until my eardrums felt as if they were going to burst and then I peed myself. The mirrors shattered and sent shards of glass everywhere and my candle was quickly snuffed out, and I screamed, boy did I scream, I legged it out of there like nobodies business and slammed the door behind me. Of course everyone was fast asleep but woken up with a few of my screams and sharp kicks to the ribs. They attempted to calm me down but i was flailing and screaming, I told them we had to get out of my house, but where do seven 17 year olds go at 4:00 am in the morning? Eventually I calmed down and tried to pass it off as a drunk hallucination which i knew was very impossible but it made my mind sort of at ease. 

We decided to get everyone up and camp downstairs in the living room. I felt safer with all of them around me and after much apprehension my tired state got the better of me and I drifted off to sleep. Last night was some of the worst nightmares i ever had, I saw my friends hanging and mutilated, I saw my childhood cat lay gutted on the floor, I saw myself smiling at a mirror. When i woke up, i was upstairs in the room. In between both mirrors, which had been shifted to face me lying on the floor. All my friends had left, when i called them they all gave me half ass reasons and some just avoided the question altogether. 


I'm scared. It is now 6:27 and starting to get dark again and I haven't been into the room since I woke up this morning. Help me, please. I don't feel alone in my house anymore.","Please, help. I screwed up.",102
ephique,27,24,1r5tqd,81,"Me and my brother were spending some quality time playing old video games from our childhood, just chilling on the couch in my upstairs bedroom when the electricity in the entire house went out. It was just us two home at this point, and it was pitch black outside. In desperation of finding our way through the house we used our phones to take flash-shots, giving us a small update of where in the big upstairs level of the house we were; trying to make our way to the staircase leading down.

We finally did, and from there it wasn't ridiculously hard to manage ourselves to find some candles and what not. We did what we could to drain out the time while waiting out the electricity-problem. Eating sausage rolls, gossiping and having conversations about what games to play once the electricity was back.

It did come back after a couple of hours. We already found ourselves in the kitchen, positioned in the lower level of the house so we brought some snacks and drinks before we inevitably decided to continue our journeys into Donkey Kong: Country, Super Mario World and Castlevania 4 on the Super Nintendo.

Upon starting our Super Nintendo my brother asked me where the remote for the tv was, since we both were too lazy to actually use the power button on the tv. Although the remote was nowhere to be found. While looking for the remote, which we both swore has never been anywhere else than on the coffee-table next to the couch, the electricity ran out again.

My brother expressed as he sighed: ""Oh come on, are you kidding me?"" Being slightly more prepared the second time, we picked up our phones and started taking flash-shots again. After a couple of shots the memory on my phone ran out. I never thought we had taken that many pictures. Either way I entered my image library on my phone to delete the old photos from the first time the electricity went out. I took a good look at the first picture I opened, it was my brother walking ahead of me, just before we reached the stairs. There was a man standing just next to him in the picture.",Where is the remote?,105
BensonHedges1,4,21,1r2xlz,77,"I heard the coffee pot drip before my alarm even went off, bizarre, I don’t usually set a timer. I like to go to the gym before I have my coffee. Maybe it was my boyfriend being nice. He typically works the graveyard shift, and sometimes he comes home in the early morning to leave nice surprises. 


“Might as well get up” I said aloud to myself, since no one else was home. 


My cat was absent from the bed, which is also weird, he’s usually by my head in the mornings. As I stretch my legs and arms out, I notice an odd chill run up my spine. Surely it was the weather, New England has a way with inconsistent temperatures, and the blanket over me was not quite fit for winter. It’s November, that sixty-degree weather is bound to disappear sooner or later. I haven’t quite figured out the thermostat, we just moved in, and the heat only seems to kick in on times when I’m not home. Must be the reason we bought this place so cheap...and why people keep selling it. New England is not the place to have a busted heating system. This has been the biggest point of arguments since my boyfriend and I started co-habitating. 


“Get out of bed, you’re going to be late to your class…” 


I said this to myself a few times, in hopes to have motivation to get to the 5:15am class at the gym. I had no idea what time it was, but if the coffee pot is going off, it’ was creeping close to sunrise. I haven’t unpacked the alarm clocks yet, so my phone’s been the only thing reminding me what time of the day it is. 


I thrusted my arms to the floor and pulled my phone to my bed — 2:11 am. 


“What the fuck?! I’ve still got two-and-a-half hours of sleep…and why is the coffee pot on?”


I slipped out of the bed from the left side and stumble to the kitchen to turn off the coffee pot. I’m a coffee lover, but nothing smells worse than burnt-coffee. As I went to flip the switch to off, I realize the time isn’t illuminated on the pot. Directly above on the microwave - nothing. Damnit. The power went out! The drip-sound of the coffee pot was so loud, and it was too early. I was confused. I could even smell the lingering scent of fresh brewed coffee…but it was 2am, my mind must be playing tricks on me. 


I headed back to the bedroom, a little freaked out, but convinced it was just all a coincidence. This hallway seems so much longer in the dark, and I still haven’t gotten used to the layout of this condo. As I pass the bathroom, I notice a shadow out of the corner of my eye. I turned my head and didn’t see anything, except the shower curtain pulled all the way open. Since we’ve moved in, we haven’t used that shower…we’ve got a shower stall in the bedroom…much more convenient. Though, I am sure there was a logical explanation for it. 


When I get to the bedroom - another chill down my spine. This was uncomfortable, it was a winter chill I was feeling. I was sure of that. Something was wrong, but i couldn’t figure it out. 

I need to go back to bed.


I hop in the bed and pick the blankets from off the floor. As I turn on my side, I hear the heater click on. The electricity is back on…fantastic! I start counting sheep in my head to fall back asleep, and keep thinking…”how did the blankets end up on the floor?”


What feels like an hour later, my alarm finally goes off. The smell of burnt coffee has filled the condo, and now I’m frustrated. I should have just unplugged the damn thing. And where is my cat? I have most definitely woken up on the wrong side of the bed. I moved to the kitchen to pour some coffee - and it’s dry. Nothing. I must be imagining things. 


That chill again! I could feel the hairs spike up on my neck - absolutely razor sharp. I decided to skip the gym and start my morning. I remained timid, but continued with my normal routine. As I rummaged around the kitchen, I noticed my cat out of the corner of my eye. He was twitchy, and obviously anxious. 


A few years ago my cat had major anxiety problems, and he developed what my vet called - “Rolling Skin Syndrome”. When my cat got anxious, his skin would roll around his body, it looked almost as if he had a small gum ball moving around beneath his fur. Today that ball was most definitely moving.


He paced back and forth around the house with me now, seeming more comfortable now that I was up with him. Every time I moved to another room, he cautiously peeked around the corner, almost as if he was looking for something. We moved to the bathroom, I started to floss, and then I heard it…drip drip drip. I am sure it’s not the coffee pot, and the house starts to smell again. As I analyze my senses the smell become more pungent. Less of a coffee smell and more of a rancid scent. 


Drip drip drip…


I follow the noise, it seems louder now, and it seems like it’s coming from the bedroom. Surely I would have heard it loud and clear when I was in bed earlier…it seemed so distant then. I enter the bedroom, and my cat stopped dead in his tracks. His skin is rolling again and he appeared more on edge, tail straight in the air and it’s hairs following suit. And that chill, of course, it was back. And my sheets and blankets, on the floor again.


WHAT THE FUCK? 


I’m working from home today, and every time I walk by the bedroom, I get the chills. I’ve resorted to closing the door until I’m not alone. It sounds like the wind is blowing up against the windows in that room, but from where I’m sitting, the trees are as still as ever.

CDC_,14,31,1qwsx4,76," I always hated going outside after dark. Night casts a natural shroud around my home; what is familiar during the day, becomes a mystery to me at night. It's a mystery I have no intention of solving. Those were my thoughts as a child. At 28 years old I'm suppose to be over my fear of the dark, but the darkness fills me with dread. 

As far back as I can recall, going outside, alone, after dark has scared me. As a child I had a ritual. If for any reason I had to walk outside after dark, I was not allowed to turn around and look behind me.  There was no rhyme or reason for it, I just had this very real sense, this feeling, that if I turned around, someone would be standing there, waiting for me to see them. The feeling was almost a taunt, as though some force was daring me to turn around, but I couldn't seem to bring myself to do it. At around 10 years of age, I had been dealing with this problem for quite some time. Be that as it may, my absent minded ways got the better of me, and all to often I would leave my bookbag in the car after school. After dinner it was homework time, and I, inevitably, would have to go outside to fetch my books. My mom drove a Cutlass, but we also lived with my grandparents, and my grandfather had a rather large GMC van. It was fun to take camping, which we did, often. The van was parked parallel to my mom's car in the driveway. On the nights that I would leave my bookbag in the car it was same system, every time. Walk straight to the car, open door, grab bookbag, spin around, look directly at front door, walk straight inside, never look back on the way inside. Never.  

One night, everything changed. I'll never forget that night. My grandmother had made fried chicken for dinner, and it was an especially cold night, so I put on my blue coat to go out to the car. I loved that jacket, though I was beginning to grow out of it. My arms stuck too far out of the sleeves and it was beginning to look ridiculous on me.  Such is life, I suppose. People outgrow things, and they replace them. Although I could feel the brick in my stomach in regards to having to go outside after dark, it was a brick that had been laid long ago, and was generally regarded as a familiar fixture. That night I walked out the front door, walked to the car opened the car door, leaned in, grabbed my bookbag, spun around saw the front door in the distance, maybe 50 feet, and I began walking, slower than usual. 

""I'm too old to be doing this anymore,"" I told myslef out loud. 

I stopped walking. I stared at my front door for a while longer.

""Fuck it,"" I told myself, for perhaps the first time ever.  

I slowly turned my head and my body followed. Turning I saw my mom's car about 20 feet away from me. I spun all the way around and looked directly at my mom's car. Same as it always was. No different. Nothing. I raised my head ever so slightly and caught view of my Grandfather's van beside my mothers car. I didn't notice it at first. I stared for probably 6 whole seconds before we locked eyes. Peering at me from behind the van were two eyes, two unfamiliar eyes. The eyes were connected to a face that seemed to be grinning at me, ear to ear. For a moment I stood frozen, eyes locked on the man behind the van. His smile seemed to get wider the longer I stared. All I could see of the man was his face, partially obscured by the blanket of night, and his right hand, planted firmly on the back door of the van. I couldn't tell you how long the staring match lasted. It felt like an hour, though, it was probably more like 30 seconds. There was a taunt in his expression, a dare. Was he daring me to come closer? To Turn back around and walk toward the door? I felt there was nothing I could do but continue this stand off until his head slowly pulled back behind the van, and he was gone. I walked back into the house backward, never taking my eyes off that spot on the van. Somehow I managed to make it back inside without falling. Good memory I suppose. 

Today I'm 28. I still have to go out to the car after dark somtimes, but I never dare to look back. I know he's there, watching, waiting. He wants me to know he's there; he wants me to see him. He'll never leave me. The winter is coming, and I'll need to start wearing a jacket soon. I bought a nice heavy one about 5 years ago. Kind of old, I know, but it does the trick, and this one fits me just fine. ",He's still there.,107
Sleepwalking_t,21,34,1r7w1t,65,"I have been having sleeping problems for about 6 months now. I have troubles falling asleep and staying asleep. I also have issues with sleep walking, serious sleep walking issues. I live in a dorm, on the first floor, and right outside my dorm across the street is the smoke pit for my area. I once woke up sitting at the smoke pit in my pajamas sitting on the picnic table with my elbows on my knees, face in hands.

 
Please, hear me out, I know this doesn't seem supernatural, but I'm terrified and I don't know who to tell. I am going to continue with my sleep walking issues. 
I will not get into specifics on where I was but let's just say I was not in an area you would want to walk around alone at night. It was a community sleeping area, massive tent and I woke up sore, bruised, and covered in dirt. I figured I must have slept walked outside and fallen down. I have woken up standing in the middle of my dorm room, woken up sitting up right on my couch when I had fallen asleep in my bed. 


A few months ago I could not sleep for 2 days straight; no sleeping aids or cold medicine would work. Frustrated, I finally made a doctors appointment for my sleeping problems. I left out my sleep walking because I could loose my job if they knew I slept walked, and was prescribed Ambein. 
The first night on Ambein I still had troubles getting to sleep but they finally kicked in after an hour or so laying in bed. I woke up refreshed but a bit groggy, and got dressed for work. 


The next night on Ambein the pills kicked in quickly and I had , what I thought , to be a deep dreamless sleep. When I got into work my co worker laughingly asked me what the hell I called him for last night. 


"" What are you talking about?"" 


"" You called me last night, crying hysterically."" 


""What?!""


"" Yeah... I was about to get dressed and come over to check on you. You said , ' It's here Myke, it's here!'. Then you started snoring sooo... yeah figured you were just dreaming...""


Completely bewildered I apologized. I checked my call history and sure as shit, I had called him at 0447. 


Strange. I just played it off as a side effect of the Ambein. 
A few weeks went by and nothing else strange happened. I continued to take the Ambein. 


Sometime during the work day I went to show another co worker a funny picture I had saved on my phone when I noticed I had a lot of black photos on my camera roll. I selected the first one and it was my  dark room lit up from the flash. The next one of a different part of my room again lit up by the flash. This went on for 12 different photos: different parts of my room, dark, lit up from the flash. I downloaded an app so I could see the time stamp from the photos. I was definitely asleep; great, sleep me was taking pictures in my sleep.

 
I have started waking up with bruises, cuts, and feeling sore for no particular reason. 


I was staying the night at my guy's house and he told me the next morning  I sat up out of bed and asked him: 


""Do you see it?"" 


""See what?""

 
Silence from me, then I laid back down.

 
He jokingly told me that was the last night he would sleep with me. We laughed but I felt terrible creeping the hell out of the poor guy. 


It's escalating, Ive started seeing things when I'm awake. I see a black form walking into my bathroom while I'm getting ready in the morning. I ignore it, there is no way in hell I'm going to investigate that. Things disappear from my room then show up in the same spot days later.

Children making their way to the bus stop walk by with more and more layers, on their way to looking like brightly colored fluff balls. Leaves are falling more frequently as winter approaches. My thoughts of you become more frequent too. Don't get me wrong, I've thought of you nearly every day for...what has it been? Ten? Eleven years? 


It's hard to think it's been that long since you destroyed so many lives. It was around this time too. I remember because I was watching the brown leaves fall just before she told me what you did. Did you think they'd forget? Did you think they'd ever forgive you? I know I haven't. I haven't forgiven you. And I definitely never forgot you. Sometimes I repeat your name before I go to sleep. Like a mantra. A slow, soothing mantra that washes over me in waves. It keeps me sane.


My thoughts of you are becoming more frequent. Like they do every year.


Sometimes after I repeat your name, I dream of you. I dream of the day I can finally introduce myself. That's right! I forget ever so often. You don't even know who I am. It must be satisfying to know how many people you REALLY affected. So fucking satisfying. You wanna know what I dream about? I dream of making you scream. Like he screamed. Would I use fire? No. I would be too jealous. The fire would be taking my job - inflicting the suffering I want you to know I'm causing. Would I tear away your flesh with my teeth? NO. I don't want any part of you inside of me. You filthy bitch. No... I'd cut you slowly. I'd make you bleed for days. Bleed and scream and bleed some more. I'll make you scream the exact number of days you put him in the hospital, verging on the brink of death. I'll make you scream.


But not now. Not today. I've been busy keeping up appearances. I have a very clean record, you see. A spotless one, in fact. I don't want to fuck this up for me. Oh, I don't give a shit about you, but I have a life to live after I take care of...your rot. Your rotting, filthy, insidious heart. YOU FUCKING CUNT!


I've been thinking of you so much. Can't you tell?

But I really do need to focus on myself right now. Playing the good girl. Maintaining the 4.0. Staying out of trouble. I don't want them to suspect me when your body washes up and some whore finds your rotting, bloated corpse. I want to get away. Just like you got away. 10 months of probation. What a joke. What a terrible, heart-breaking, unfair joke. You killed him. You fucking monster. YOU'RE A FUCKING MONSTER!

God, I hope you read this. I hope you show someone too. I hope a little tear leaks out when they tell you you're imagining the coincidences. That you're letting the guilt get to you and that you should just leave the whole messy ordeal behind you. I hope these words make you worry that someone else out there knows your dark secret. Someone besides your friends and family who you've convinced that it was just a mistake. Who you've convinced you really are a good person who made a simple error. 

I hope these words slowly begin to sink in and make you tremble at every little creak of your house. I hope you hear a branch scratch your window, and flinch away in fear. Cause I want you to know I'm coming. Oh, yes, I want you to know this is coming. So when I hold the blade against your ear, you know exactly how much you deserve this.

Until then...I'll be thinking of you.

Shanbo88,12,19,1qurwo,65,"My room is in the attic. It's nothing special, has a nice Velux window, loads of music and gaming equipment and a nice big double bed. I love to leave my window open a crack when it's warm during the Summer, but here in Ireland it's now getting into the deep part of Winter so I always keep it closed. Thing about Winter is that sound carries better at night. Living in the suburbs, I can hear every drunken scuffle and argument in the wee hours.

A few months ago I started hearing these footsteps at night, like high-heeled shoes. It'd be at about 2 in the morning, I'd hear them start, out of the blue. They'd fade in from one end of my road and keep going as if they were just walking forever. I'd hear them go past my house but then get caught in a sort of limbo and never get any quieter. Then after about 10 minutes (my road is only 15 houses long), they'd fade out again.

They usually keep going. Not anymore. Now I hear them every night. I hear them fade in. I hear the steps walking until they get to right outside my house. Then they stop. My windows are on the back facing side of the attic so I can't look out to see what's going on without going downstairs and waking the house up. But I know she's out there.

JohnFrostNeruda,6,16,1quu9h,60,"Strange things used to happen in my childhood home. The house that I lived in was ancient, almost a hundred years old. It's only reasonable that a couple of people could have died in it right?  Over the course of ninety-six years, five people died in that house. I did research on all of them.

Because I saw all of them.

Every single night, the house would force the souls to replay their deaths.  I noticed this when I was fifteen (yes it took awhile).  I was up to get a midnight snack when I saw James Gunderson in the kitchen with his greasy haircut, his leather jacket and denim jeans.  He was vomiting uncontrollably and then he passed out, choking on his own filth.  His spirit was gone the next morning.  You would think I was scared out of my mind, but I was more perplexed.  I looked up James Gunderson and found that he died of alcohol poisoning after coming home from a party in 1954.  He was sixteen. I never touched alcohol after watching his death.

James Gunderson was there again the next night, and he had company.  Alice Williams was chasing a dog down the stairs when she slipped and fell. She was such a cute girl too with blond curls, and deep nut-brown eyes.  She would've been a heart breaker. Her head struck the edge of the fifth step.  I would then see her mom run screaming down the stairs to find her five your old daughter spasm uncontrollably as the family dog lapped up poor Alice's blood. That was a sad case. But you should never leave your toys on the stairs.

Jack Saline was an elderly man who slowly passed away in his room, which my mom turned into a guest bedroom.  I remember enjoying watching his death. It was somewhat serene. Mr. Saline would gaze out the window as a spectral beam of sunlight would hit his face. He smiled and then closed his eyes for eternity. His body would shake with a death rattle, and then he would fade out. Until the next night of course.

The fourth death was strange because I never could figure out who it was. A man was in the basement. I heard him thumping around one night and went to investigate. The man's face was sweaty and his face was stained with anxiety. He got up to pace around when he looked up at the top of the basement steps. Our eyes met, and I saw years of wear and tear on the man's face.  He nodded his head like he knew me, and then he walked out of site into a dark basement room leaving his cause of death unknown.

The next person to die in my house was my sister.  She was never right in the head, and we seldom spoke to each other.  She was the eldest of my parent's children, and yet it seemed like she was forgotten. She hung herself on the ceiling fan in her room.  I remember my mother and my two other sisters being devastated but my father and I were largely indifferent. He always had trouble finding feelings for others, and I was a regular chip off the old block.  The night after her funeral, I watched Ellie grab a rope from the tool shed and tie it to one of the fan blades. She hesitated a little bit when she put the noose over her neck and stepped on the chair. Our eyes met, and I saw a hint of fear in her eyes.  She took a deep breath and jumped. Her face got redder and redder and redder and she started tugging on the rope to set herself free, but she was only making it worse. She had second thoughts. She didn't want to die like she thought she did. This wrestled with me for a couple of days. My parents decided it would be best to move, and I agreed with them.

Before we left, I set the house on fire. I didn't even think about it that much. I just did it.  I watched it burn, and it was strangely comforting.  I don't know if it had any effect, but I like to think it did.",Souls Rewinded,76

“Stupid bitch. Die after work!”

Those are the words that hung over me like a prophecy. I’m not sure exactly why; normally, I’d dismiss such comments as someone’s emotions and sense of self-importance getting the best of them. But for some reason this time the words worked their way into the back of my mind like little tendrils. Strangling all reason and perverting my perception.

I’m getting ahead of myself; I should explain a few things before sharing my experience. I work at an answering service and about a year ago, I worked third shift. What this means is I answer phone calls for businesses from all over the country when they aren't in or are otherwise unable to answer their phones. I then take messages and either forward them to the office or dispatch them to people on call. Third shift meant I was manning the phones 11p-6a by myself. I was the sole person in the building from 11:15p to 5:30a, most nights. 

Now, the majority of the calls we receive are people complaining about something. They need a prescription called in, their water heater is leaking or they've locked themselves out of their apartment. Something along those lines. And people will often get upset when you’re unable to help them. This is usually expressed through yelling and cussing, etc.

I want to share with you a series of calls I received one night around 2a and my experience afterwards.

It began with an older woman calling on a public housing property management account. She had a southern accent. The kind where the letter “R” has two syllables instead of one. Like “are-uh”. Anyway, I answered the line by saying our answer phrase for the particular account.

This is how I remember the call going:

//

**Me:** “Thank you for calling [blank] Housing Authority. This is [Unrealsky].”

**Her:** “Thank goodness y’all answered. I need help. You have to…[something].”

*(She was rushed, out of breathe. The end of her last sentence was unintelligible, she was speaking so fast. This isn't uncommon. People tend to panic when their apartment is being flooded or something similar. My job is to keep them on task, gather their info and get someone out as soon as possible.)*

**Me:** “The office is closed, ma’am; you've reached their answering service. What is the reason for your call?”

**Her:** “I’m telling you, it’s not workin. Oh, lord, please help me, please. It took my boy. I.. I...”

*(She had started sobbing now. That last statement was kind of strange, but I moved on.)*

**Me:** “What is not working, ma’am?”

**Her:** “Oh, my god. Oh, my lord. I’m sorry. [Something]. I’m sorry. Oh, my god….”

*(Her voice trailed away as she moved away from the phone. I then heard a familiar beeping on the line. On this particular account, the company has one of those buzzer boxes on the front entrance of the building where you can ring a particular apartment to be let in or you can press a certain option to get the office or security desk or whatever. After hours, choosing that option causes you to get the answering service -- me -- and we have no way of letting anyone in or anything like that. We’re in a completely different state. And the line is timed, so when that time is up, the line will begin to beep notifying you that it’s about to be disconnected.)*

*(And the line disconnected.)*

//

The call kind of rattled me. People will act like anything is the end of the world, but she sounded like she was actually in fear for her life. Like she was in immediate danger. I sat there a minute just looking at my screen as I pondered the idea of calling the security guy. I mean, I knew she was at the front of the building, he could go check it out. But before I got a chance to, the same account popped up on one of my other lines. I answered it:

//

**Me:** “Thank you for calling [blank] Housing Authority. This is [Unrealsky].”

**Her:** “Let me in!”

*(She screamed this at the top of her lungs.)*

**Me:** “Ma’am, I’m at an off-site location. I don’t have the abili…”

*(She interrupted.)*

**Her:** “God damn it! Please, let me in. I can’t [something]. Oh, god, it’s…”

**Me:** “Ma’am. Ma’am.”

*(I tried to interrupt her.)*

**Her:** “Oh, god. Oh, please.” 

*(Her voice trailed away from the phone again, but came back. Her pleading had morphed into anger now.)*

**Her:** “You son of a bitch! You don’t let me in, I swear, boy, I...”

**Me:** “Ma’am, I want to help you. I can’t let you in, but I can contact securi...”

*(As I started, the beeping started as well. Right before the line disconnected she said those five words -- yelled them actually -- interrupting me.)*

**Her:** “Stupid bitch. Die after work!”

//

A chill went down my spine and my heart started racing. There was so much hate in her voice. It was terrifying. Briefly paralyzed by fear and confusion, I stared at the screen scrambling for what I should do. Her voice and those words felt so powerful. Finally my brain found it’s way back to reality and I quickly pulled up the number and called the security guy on his cell phone. As it rang, I tried to figure out a way to put what I just heard into words.

//

**Security:** “....Hello?”

*(He sounded groggy; I woke him up.)*

**Me:** “Hello, this is [Unrealsky] with your answering service. I've got kind of a strange call for you.”

**Security:** “... Yea? What is it?”

**Me:** “I just had two calls; they both came in from the buzzer box on the front of the building. It was a woman and she was kind of hysterical. Sounded like she was in danger, practically begging to be let into the building.”

**Security:** “Shit…”

*(I could hear him moving, probably getting out of bed.)*

**Me:** “Yea…”

*(I didn't know what else to say.)*

**Security:** “Probly some stupid crackhead.”

**Me:** “Um.. I don’t know. It sounded legitimate to me. I thought I’d at least notify you in case you wanted to go check it out.”

**Security:** “Alright, I’ll go check it out.”

//

I started to say thank you but he hung up on me before I could get the words out. He didn't sound very pleased to be woken up. I didn't care, though.

What she said echoed in my mind, “Stupid bitch. Die after work!” 

I had done everything I could. I did my part, but I still felt antsy. Uneasy. Afraid. I wasn't really worried for the woman’s safety. It was just that her threat -- no, her curse -- had freaked me the hell out. It sounded… unnatural. Powerful. Real. 

That was when I realized that I had been sitting up straight in my seat the entire time, had started to sweat pretty profusely and was bouncing my legs up and down like a maniac. I had to laugh at myself. Why was I letting something like this get to me? Being concerned for her safety made sense, but why was I so scared? Why was I taking her emotionally charged, but completely insubstantial, curse so seriously?

I stood up from my seat and threw my headset on the desk. I had to walk around. Walk it off. Forget about it. I made my way out into the break room and grabbed my coffee cup from the cupboard. As I was filling my cup with the fresh coffee I had just put on not long before, I was playing the calls over in my head. Trying to make sense of it all.

What did she mean by “it’s not working,” and, “it took my boy?” And why did she say, “after work?” I mean, I understand people get upset and will say anything when they’re mad, but why “after work?” Seems unnecessarily specific.

What’s going to happen to me “after work?”

Maniac_Mortician,8,13,1r4jq5,58,"I am surrounded by death. Mr. Jones on the prep table, currently expelling the blood that gives us life. Mrs. Loughlin is dressed on the side table, waiting for the casket to be delivered. The 4 year old Ryan awaits my oven in the walk in fridge. And the 23 year old, Jill Brewer, is lying in the casket, sitting silently still, waiting for her family to pass by, look upon her pale, lifeless shell, and weep. 

Jones finishes pushing the blood out of his system, and I set to work. I use the needle injector to put the wires into his upper and lower jaw. I pull tight, and twist, like sealing a loaf of bread. He looks at me, with his eyes partially opened and his mouth firm. I grab 2 eye caps, lubricate with Vaseline, and grab my tweezers. One tug of the top lid, one placement of the bottom, and then again to the other eye. He no longer looks at me. He now looks like hes sleeping, if sleeping involved 2 hoses connected to the arteries and veins of your neck. His naked corpse is covered in purple and blue bedsores. They come with the elderly, and especially the cancer patients. Most of these dead who pass from cancer are older, and the older they are, the less they have moved in the months that the infliction slowly ate the remaining life from them. 

A quick threading of the needle send me into cleanup. I baseball stitch his neck, scrub him down, and rinse again. Some skin is slipping on his left hand. Nothing the embalming fluid shouldnt take care of. If it continues, I resolved to just wax it before putting him in the last suit he'll ever wear. 

I look up, just in time to see my colleague wheel in the dark blue casket. The younger worker is  guiding it through the door. He looks pale. *Id probably use the pink dye for him rather than peach. Would make him more lifelike.* I plan the embalmings of the people I meet. Some call it morbid. I call it early planning. 

We grab Loughlin, get our arms around her frame, and place her in the casket. They wheel it to the parlor, and set up the chairs. I take off my gloves, remove my apron, roll down my sleeves, and grab my jacket. As i shut the door behind me, i hear the door buzzer go off. The Brewer family has arrived. The service goes normal, and I tag out with another director to go finish up Loughlin. I prop the door open, get on the gloves and apron, and grab my trocar. I stick the pointed metal pole into his stomach, and vacuum him out. With the plug in place, i rinse him again. I glance to the clock, and a figure invades my vision. 

A little boy in his suit and tie. I panic, and immediatly stop what I'm doing and throw a sheet over the body. I ask the boy his name. He just stares at me. I ask if hes lost? He smiles, and walks away. I follow him. He goes into the first room, and circles back through the office. I get back to the hallway, and hes back in the prep room. I tell him he cant be here. He looks at me, sadness in his face, and looks back to the walk in. He begins to sniffle. I walk next to him, and say ""Ryan, it's okay."" He looks back at me, and stops sniffling. Instead, he holds out his hand to me. I reach for it, and... Hes gone. I open the door, and hes sitting on the tray, in his little suit, waiting for my oven.

On 12/4/2009; James E. Parker (17 yrs), Richard ""Lou"" Marcus (19 yrs), Helen Greene (17 yrs), and Barbara Holmes (16 yrs) left school at exactly 4:57pm. These four teenagers were reported to have last been seen headed in the general direction of Harverfield.

On 12/6/2009, phone calls from all said teenagers were recieved and responded to. The calls all reported that their children had not been home in two days which was out of their normal behaviour. Police arrived at the four homes and acted in ordinance of ""Missing Person(s) Act,"" and began to search for the four teenagers. A search was conducted extending from their school to Harverfield itself. None of the missing were located during that search. Police issued an Amber Alert once more for the four children. However, there were no new leads brought forth.

On 2/2/2010, a man named Weasly Conner called into the station reporting to authorities that he had seen Barbara Holmes (16 yrs) wandering the street and that he was currently on his way to the nearest hospital to have her submitted for large gashes on both her left wrist and the lower left portion of her neck. Police notified her parents and arrived at the medical center roughly 8 minutes later. Officers found what was described as the stereotype used for how one would envision a mental asylum patient. The doctors were eventually able to sedate Barbara Holmes (16 yrs) with the aid of authorities. The cause of her meltdown in the hospita care is still unknown. When the medical staff managed to stitch her wounds, they reported to police that the cuts were far too deep and seemed to have been ripped into for it to have been an accident or stabbing. They stated that it was also not likely to have been self inflicted. Authorities remained on site.

During the night of March 14th, police were notified by a hospital that they had found Richard ""Lou"" Marcus (19 yrs) during a response call to a man lying on the sidewalk covered in blood. Richard Marcus's (19 yrs) family was notified of his discovery and were already at the hospital when police arrived to be notified that he had bled out before they got him to the emergency room shortly before they arrived. His body has been sent to autopsy.

Three weeks after the death of Richard ""Lou"" Marcus (19 yrs), a 911 call was made from Harverfield by someone claiming to be Helen Greene (17 yrs). The dispatcher reported that she could hear a male screaming in the background and something screaming in the distance; however; she was unable to identify what could have made the noise. Officers were sent to the site that the call had been traced to during the call which lasted for a minute and thirty-nine seconds. When the arrived on the scene, they found no landline. Officials are investigating into how a landline was traced to the location but so far no results have been yielded. There was a single report by an officer on the scene saying that he heard a woman scream in the general area that they had been searching after discovering no telephone.

On 6/13/2010, a letter was recieved at the police station written using cut outs on a dirty grey crumpled sheet of paper. The message read as follows:

*""There were four for fear, but they shriveled to one in here. Please send us more, for this we shall endure. The deaths of few lead to the strength of plenty, prey to us and you will witness the darkest entity.""*

The envelope was noticed to have a bulge, which when turned upside down, dropped a human finger onto the tiled floor. Forensics found it belonged to James E. Parker (17 yrs).

Terzis28,15,34,1r6la8,52,"So, a while ago (about a year ago now) I was sitting on my bed with the laptop on my lap. Next to me was my desk with my lamp on it. I was using an MSN video chat with one of my female friends. 

After talking for a couple of hours with my friend she messaged me (we both did not have microphones) and asked ""What is that kid eating? haha"" i simply replied ""What are you talking about?"" She stated that there was a kid sitting next to me with his hands at his mouth, as if to be chewing and gnawing either on his hands or something that he was holding. Chills ran through my body, but i soon realized that she was most likely messing with me.

I replied ""Seriously, stop messing with me"". She seemed like a pretty good actor considering she wasn't laughing or smiling at all. ""I'm not messing with you, I was just curious as to what he was eating"". At this moment I was getting a bit worried and decided to put her to the test. ""I want you to swear on your life that right now, you see a child next to me who looks like he is eating something"" I requested. ""I swear on my life, that is what I see"" she replied. I was pretty worried at this point and just when I thought I couldn't get much more creeped out, my lamp turned itself off.

I know it wasn't a power surge because my alarm clock was still on, and the standby light on my TV.

This could just be a strangely timed sequence of coincidence, but it sure did freak me out. I left the room immediately.",Child Eating,86

My friend /u/shelbels and I went over to check things out. The front door was unlocked and I found a journal lying on the floor right inside the door. My neighbor was lying on the floor in a pool of blood with a gun next to his hand. I took the journal and read it, I think he was truly disturbed and in need of help. I went to the police of course but I am posting the contents of the journal here because while frightening they are also very interesting.**

**October 12th**  
Last night I was woken at about 1 by a picture on my wall, when it fell. It seemed like it was darker than normal. Without turning on the light I got out of bed and picked up the picture and hung it back up, barely giving it a glance. This morning though, I gave it a second thought. It’s an old photo of my family at the beach, taken on a vacation when I was about 10. Despite being taken over ten years ago, I remember the vacation vividly. My twin brother was tormenting me as much as always, but the picture was one of the few where I actually looked as though as I was enjoying myself. It’s almost time for work now so I need to finish getting ready and stop reminiscing about the past. I don’t know if dreamed last night so nothing else to record.


**October 13th**  
A crash woke me up again, the clock next to my bed said 1:05 AM. The picture had fallen again, I hung it up before going back to sleep. After falling back asleep I dreamed about the family vacation. My brother kept dunking me under the water, I was afraid I would drown until my mom finally came to my rescue.The sad part is that it wasn’t just a dream, but more like a memory. I haven’t seen my twin brother in years, for good reason. I should probably call mom later today, I haven’t talked to her in weeks.


**October 14th**  
This is starting to get a little creepy, the picture fell again last night, at 1:05. There must be some kind of animal living in the wall. I will call animal control later today. Instead of hanging it back up this time I just set it on my dresser. I did not dream last night.


**October 20th**  
It wasn’t an animal. They came out and looked at the house, there are no openings for anything to get in, but I didn’t believe animal control so I ripped out a panel of drywall and found nothing. I have not been dreaming at all the last week.


**October 21st**  
It’s 1:05...again, the picture fell off my dresser. I cannot think of a reason why this would happen, maybe my dresser has a tilt to it. When I picked the picture up I stared at it for a few seconds, I could almost swear I am turned more toward the ocean than I remember being. Not to mention the fact that I look, I’m not really sure how to explain it...the smile I remember me having in the picture is more of a frown. I am going back to sleep now, but it just bothered me enough I felt like I had to write this down tonight.


It’s morning now, took another look at the picture, nothing has changed. I must have been half-awake last night when I thought I saw that stuff. Though honestly the stuff with the picture is starting to creep me out, I have it set on the floor now. There is no way that it can fall.


**October 22nd**  
I woke up to a sharp pain in my foot and found myself standing in the broken glass from the picture frame. There was a little blood but not much, if it continues bleeding I will go to the hospital. I haven’t slept walked since I was a kid. I’m going to have to buy a new frame for the photo. As I picked up the picture from remains of the frame I saw another change. I am almost positive I have taken a few steps away from where I used to be, I am behind my family. I know that is not what the picture looked like before. I decide to put off cleaning up the broken frame until the morning. I stare at the picture studying it. I doubt I will fall asleep tonight.


I fell asleep at some point last night and woke up with the picture underneath me. It was exactly as I remembered it, a little crinkled from me sleeping on it though. I must have been imagining things again last night. I would write it off as all a dream if it wasn’t for the cut on my foot and the shattered frame on  my floor, which I still have to clean up. My birthday is coming up in a couple weeks, we are supposed to be having a family dinner. I am going to ask my mom if she has another copy of this photo. It’s one of my favorites from my childhood and I want an unblemished copy.


**October 30th**  
I have continued to wake up at 1:05 every night. I stopped looking at the picture. I put it in a drawer. But tonight I dreamed about it. In my dream 10 year old me was moving backward slowly like some invisible force was dragging me toward the ocean. The first thing I do in the morning is look at the photo. It’s still the same. Always the same. The five of us, my mom and dad in the center with my dad’s arm around my moms shoulder. Smiling the happiest of smiles. My older sister next to my mom her head on her shoulder a half smile on her face and her hand on my brother’s shoulder. Then me and my twin next to my sister in one of the few moments where he wasn’t trying to strangle me, we almost look as if we want to be around each other. All this on a beautiful beach with blue waves crashing in the background. A picture perfect happy family. I know this picture by heart. It can’t change it’s impossible. I tried calling my mom, she didn’t answer. My sister also didn’t pick up her phone. I’ll try again tomorrow.


**November 1st**  
I decided to look at the picture when I woke up tonight. I pulled it out and was horrified. I’m in the water now, up to my neck, choking on a wave. I immediately shoved it back in the drawer. After a few minutes I reconsidered, opened the drawer again and carefully placed it in an envelope, further adding another layer between it and me. I tried to call my mom again but it’s late, I’m not surprised she didn’t answer. My birthday is in two days. We never came up with any solid plans but I always go home for dinner on the holidays so I will see everyone soon and maybe this will make more sense. I haven’t been sleeping well since all of this started.


I didn’t sleep last night. I spent most of it thinking. I don’t know when was the last time I talked to my family. Or saw them for that matter. I wonder if I did something to upset them. I mean that’s the only reason I can think of for them avoiding me. Maybe it was that fight I got in with my brother.


**November 2nd**  
I managed to sleep for about 3 hours last night and I had a very disturbing dream. I dreamt that my brother was laughing and eating me alive. I think I might be going crazy. I pulled the picture out at around midnight and it was normal. Looking at it though I don’t really look included in the family. I don’t think it represents the happy memory I want it to. 


**November 3rd**  
Today’s my birthday. I am about to drive to my parents house. I’m bringing the picture along to show them.  

…………………………………………………………………………………………………….  

I don’t know who I am. I don’t know what’s going on. Are all my memories false, am I crazy? I am trying to calm down enough to write this out…


I arrived at my parents house a little after 6pm. Dinner is always at 7. Their old black sedan was parked in the drive the same as always. At the last second I hesitated and decided to leave the picture in the glove box, I have gotten too obsessed with it and I don’t want to scare my family. And I can describe which one it is pretty easily anyway to see if my mom has another copy.


I went up to the door and rang the bell, I haven’t had a key in a few years. My mom opened the door and looked confused. She asked what I wanted. I told her I was there for dinner just like always, she only looked more puzzled. She said she had no idea who I was but she was very busy getting ready for her son’s birthday dinner. I thought she must be trying to play some kind of joke on me, I reached for the screen door to open it. She yelled out “Stop!”, sounding afraid. I jumped back. I realized she truly didn’t know me. I wondered if in the time since we last talked if she had had some kind of accident or started to develop early onset Alzheimer’s, I was very worried.


Having heard my mom’s yell my brother appeared at the door behind her and asked what was going on.


Trying to cope with what was happening I started talking to her as if she was a child. I told her I was her son, I was born November 3, 1992. She told me she only has one son. My twin brother was standing right behind her, getting scared I yelled at him, asking what was going on. He responded that he had no idea who I was, but November 3rd was his birthday and he did not have a twin. Upon hearing this my mother began crying. Through her tears she told my brother he did have a twin, but he was underdeveloped and died at 1:05 AM the night they were born.


At this point I was terrified and confused. As a last ditch effort to understand what was going on with my family and make them understand they were mistaken I told them to wait, I had something to show them. I frantically ran to the car and popped open the glove box. I pulled out the envelope with the picture and ran back to the doorstep. I told them it was a picture of our family at the beach around 11 years ago. I slowly pulled out the photo and turned it over. It was a picture of a happy family of four people. I wasn’t in the picture. My mother and brother both gasped seeing that it was indeed a picture of them. My mother then began to get angry and demanded I leave before she called the police because she thought I was trying play some sick prank on them. I got in my car, crying, and came home. I’m still sitting here in shock, not knowing what to do next. I pull out the picture looking at it. I’m not in it. How am I not in it? I cannot accept this as the truth.

iwillneverbefree,8,18,1r1p8k,50,"I'm just your average everyday guy with a job. I cook, I clean, I drink; hell, I even had a girlfriend before all this started going down. If you saw me on the street, you'd walk right by me without a second glance. It's just that I have a job. I'm a Paramedic.

I don't do anything important, I just help those in need. I started doing this because I didn't feel great about myself. I always loved helping others, and I always loved A&amp;P, so I saw this as a logical step. I loved every second of it when I first started. There was no greater high than when your adrenaline kicked in and your hands moved faster than your mind could think. It was ecstasy. This went on for 8 years. Every day I fell more and more in love with my job. My calling. The only thing that bothered me was that overwhelming sense of being in a battle. I thought it was normal; after-all, I was fighting for someone else's life I thought. If only I knew how true that statement was.

It started off with a shadow when I walked onto a scene. I thought it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. Maybe it was my constant concern of someone attacking me. God forbid I got shot while working. I should have known something wasn't right when my partner looked in the same direction when I did. I should have known better when he just shut down and barely spoke the rest of the night. This went on for a while, every so often seeing the shadow. Things started to get worse, however, when the whispering started.

At first, they were nonsensical. Sometimes I wondered if they were even there at all, if I was just going fucking nuts. But they were... They WERE there. It only took me losing my first patient to hear them clear as day. They were congratulating me. They were telling me how great of a job I did. I didn't understand then. My mind had been turning on me, it had to have been. ""It's the stress... It's the stress of losing someone"" I told myself on my way home. I sat at home and hit the bottle. Hoping that my next shift would be an easy one... one quiet shift.

It wasn't quiet. I should have known better than to use that word. It's bad luck. The voices didn't go away. They only got louder. Every patient I had I could hear them. ""It's their time"" ""She's ours now"" ""Let her rest"". I thought I was just compensating for losing someone. I thought I was just preparing myself if I lost another one. The more people I lost, the more they got more sinister. ""You're almost ready."" ""I haven't seen one this talented in eons"" ""You can't change fate""... ""Come join us"". I didn't understand right then, but I understood it all soon.

It was a 5 year old male. His heart stopped. I had to save this one, he was just a child, I HAD to save him. We got him to the back of the ambulance and I started my work. Things felt... odd. I felt as if I was in a daze. My vision was blurry, the lights seemed faint against the road. I tried not to think about the voices, I tried to block them out, I did a damn good job until it screamed my name.

""JOHN"". I heard. I stopped, and slowly raised my head to look at the bench seat across from me. It wasn't what you would expect death to be. It wasn't a man in a robe with a scythe. It was just a man in a suit with black eyes. I froze. I had to have been insane. I needed to tell my partner to drop my off in the psych ward when we got to the hospital. His smile was... calming. It was the kind of smile you'd expect a great car salesman to have... calming... but also sinister. His hair was well kept for a man his age, I'd have to say 50's or 60's. His eyes like a void of everything that makes us human, as if they were a black hole that sucked all feeling out of whatever had the poor misfortune of getting caught in their path.

""Haven't you been listening John?"" He said with a caring tone

""You know what you must do... You know who you'll become... Why are you fighting?""

I started screaming at him. ""Who are you?"" ""What do you want?"" ""Why have you been following me?""

He ignored all of my questions. He simply put his hand to the child and started rubbing his head.

""You fought for so long John. You know this is your fate. How much more pain can you endure?""

""What are you talking about?"" I yelled at him as the child's rhythm became worse and worse.

""Don't you understand John, we've been with you since day one! We are who you fight every day... We are the ones who you ignore to do your job... We are you.""

I began to understand.

""John, you must know something."" He said looking at the monitor as it flatlined. ""This will also be your fate. You will die just like everyone else. There's nothing you can do about it""

""Don't you think I fucking know that?"" I yelled grabbing the epinephrine out of my bag.

""JOHN"" He yelled again knocking the epinephrine out of my hand.

""You need to understand the forces that be. When you die, John, you will become one of us""

""The fuck I will"" I said, standing up, but was forced back down by some unknown force.

""It's not something you can change, John. You have so much potential... so much promise... We've been watching you from the day you were born... and we are very, very, excited to meet you""

I stopped fighting. I looked into his eyes and I felt something. Something I wish I never would have felt... I felt at peace. It was if all the stress of saving a life was gone. It was as if I didn't have to fight anymore. It felt like I was being held by my mother again, like all was right with the world.

I sat there and placed my hand on the child. I felt death pass through me. I felt the coldness of the nothing reach my heart and sit there. I understood now. I understood why I am who I am. It was as if everything made sense to me...


You don't have to believe me. Hell, if I was you I wouldn't either. All that I ask of you is that the next time you see an ambulance look closely for the man in the suit with black holes for eyes. Maybe I'll see you too.",I work with death,68
jinn979,8,40,1qzm6d,48,"Ok, so I'm not a writer so please excuse my mistakes and storytelling telling style. I'm not great at descriptions or anything like that so forgive me. 
This actually happened in 2001. I have a son who at the time was 6 years old when his father and I moved us into a small two bedroom house in an older part of the city. I was telling him about the spooky things that happened  in that house and this is when he told me something new about our time there.

First, I have to describe the place. When Lee and I went to look at it, it was so adoreable on the outside. It was painted white on a quiet street, with a huge backyard. It completed my ideal of a family home. We were living in a basement suite at the time and I was tired of living in suites, I wanted my own space and backyard. 

This little house was within my budget. It was a two bedroom, the second bedroom being in the basement. The first bedroom faced the street and to right of that small bedroom was a livingroom/kitchen area, and towards the back to the left a bathroom, and across from  that to the otherside of the kitchen a stairwell into the basement.

The very first night Lee left me and my son alone, I dont remember why. I just remember that I had this continuing nightmare throughout the night about something dark coming for us from the basement, and it took its time. I felt frozen in the front room and I struggled to get to the front door which was a few feet from where we slept. At about sunrise, I woke up finally. The horror of the dream lingered but the sunrise eased my fears. I made it away in my dream, but after I woke up I still felt haunted. That was the first night.

Lee and I got a dog. We adopted one from the spca and he was already full grown. He was named Sparky ( my son named him) Sparky was a lively, gentle and smart dog. He had something stuck in his paw, but he never snapped at anyone who bumped it. We only found it after we had taken him to the vet. It was open and bleeding, and we had to give him antibiotics for it and keep it cleaned. but he never snapped or showed any discomfort. The reason why Im going on about this is because when i tried to get him to come downstairs so he could sleep there instead of outside, he growled when i pulled his collar and he knashed his teeth at me.

So he had to sleep outside. Lee worked until 2am because he was a cook, and so it was me, my son and Sparky each night except for weekends when my step kids came over to stay with us. Anyways, this dog would always bark at 11:30 at the back door. I told that to Lee and the dog had to sleep outside after that because he was noisy.
Lee had three other children, Sally who was 7, Asher who was 10, and lily who was 7 months old. Thats a different story.*sigh* Our family was complicated.

The first thing I suspected something was wrong was the night I went to bed downstairs. Lee was already under the covers, and I was in my tshirt at the foot of the bed, I felt this draft come from the floor up my legs under my shirt. I got goosebumps all over me. It couldve been a draft I know.  A draft that went up and across me. It was a basement afterall.
The second thing that happened was in that basement bedroom again. I woke up with the moon shining brightly through the small window above our bed. I looked over at Lee and he had this grimace? on his face, and it changed his face ..his expression made him look like an older man. plus, ive never seen him make that face before. I got chills, and rolled over to face the wall, and cringe...but then i thought maybe he was having a nightmare, so i turned back to see if he was ok. his face was smooth and he looked like Lee again. I dont know how I fell asleep but I did.

Life continued, Lee and I were arguing in the basement...when al of a sudden he went white and his knees buckled...shit, that scared me. I grabbed him and put his arm around my shoulder and took him upstairs.
His daughter would scream and cry when he tried to bring her down there. I told him the second time she did that to stop bringing her down there. I knew the house wasnt right, I just had other more pressing things on my mind.

Ok, this is part is from my sons point of view. It was a weekend, i had the kids and it was a hot summer day. Sally was feeling left out from the boys, and so I told Asher to stay with my son while i went ot get ice cream with Sally. I wanted to have some girl time and make her feel special and wanted because with the new baby(lily) it was a rough transition to going from daddys girl to big sister.

Anyways, we get back and I knew something happened. Both my boys were in the backyard and not arguing, just serious and outside watering the lawn. I asked Asher what happened, I was thinking an accident of sorts. He tells me there was a man in the basement. A man with a green shirt. My son collaborates with him on this and they are both looked very disturbed by this. I asked him where he went, and a white faced Asher says he didnt know. he didnt come out. The chills up my spine man! I asked if the man talked to them, tryed to come close to them or anything to make sure they hadnt been touched or anything, and they said he didnt come close to them, he just walked around downstairs. thats when they ran outside and waited for me to get back.

This last part is when my son told me just recently. He said one night, he and Sarah were awake in the bedroom ( they all had to share that one room. Asher and Sarah on one side, Aer on the other bed)
In the white light fixture, it was one of the square white shallow dishes put over the light bulbs. Anyways, in the light fixture in the saw a woman in the kitchen moving around looking like she was cooking something, but the could clearly see the kitchen and no one was in there. and I guess Sally asked Aer if he saw it too. He said no because he didnt want to say yes out loud. he said he was too scared.

he said it was the middle of the night, we were downstairs.
We moved out shortly after. For different reasons, but that house without a doubt had something in it. I tried to ask the neighbor next door but she said nothing ever happened there. 
It looked so cute out on the outside.

-- Part 2 -- 

I started walking back into the call center from the break room when a thought occurred. We have a voice logger that records every call that takes place on our system, so I stopped at the supervisor station on the way back to my desk. Maybe if I tried to figure out the pieces of what she said that I couldn't understand, I could make some sense of it. I pulled up the logger and searched for all the calls on the account in the last hour. There were three. The two from her and the one where I called security. I clicked on the first one to start playing it:

**Me:** “Thank you for calling [blank] Housing Authority. This is [Unrealsky].”

But then where I should have heard her voice there was just this static. It kind of waved in and out, getting higher pitch at times, but there was no woman. Just static.

**Me:** “The office is closed, ma’am; you've reached their answering service. What is the reason for your call?”

And then the same static again. There was nothing besides my voice talking to and responding to this static. I sounded crazy. I set down the headphones I was using to listen to the call.  “What the hell is this?,” and various other similar thoughts trampled through. I tried to mitigate the wave of confusion and fear with some sort of reason. Maybe there’s just a problem with the call or the voice logger and it only recorded my side of the conversation. Maybe it was because she was calling from that buzzer box. Maybe it was just that call.

I picked up the headphones again and clicked on the second call.

**Me:** “Thank you for calling [blank] Housing Authority. This is [Unrealsky].”

Suddenly this painfully loud static screeched through the headphones causing me to drop them. I could still hear it as they laid on the desk, so I clicked stop on the call and just stared at the screen for a while.

I reasoned that that had to be it then. When they use that buzzer box to call in, it has to cause some sort of problem with the way the lines are forwarded or something and for whatever reason the voice logger can’t pick up the other end of the call. It just comes through as static. It’s the only thing that made sense. It was the only explanation.

Deciding to just forget about it, I walked back to my desk and sat down. A few calls came in on other accounts before I got another call on the housing authority account. Nervously, I answered it:

//

**Me:** “Thank you for calling [blank] Housing Authority. This is [Unrealsky].”

**Security:** “Hey, man, it’s [security]. Just wanted to let you know there wasn't nobody out there.”

**Me:** “Oh, um, alright.”

*(Again, I didn't really know what to say. On call people rarely check back with us about this sort of thing.)*

**Security:** “Was probly just some stupid kids out playin pranks, tryin to scare people. Fuckers spray painted your name on the front door in big red letters.” 

*(He laughed. My heart raced and that chill came back. My name?)*

**Security:** “Probly thought you were goin to be the one to find it. Heh, idiots.”

*(I feigned a laugh.)*

**Me:** “Yea, people can be ridiculous sometimes.”

**Security:** “You’re tellin me, makin me get up in the middle of the night.”

**Me:** “Yea, sorry about that, she just sounded…”

*(He interrupted me.)*

**Security:** “No, no, it’s not your fault this town is full of idiots. Bet you’re as ready to get off of work as I am to get back to bed.”

*(He laughed again. What’s with all the small talk? They never do this especially not in the middle of the night. “Ready to get off work?” What’s it to this guy? What’s going to happen when I get off work? I feigned another laugh.)*

**Me:** “Yea, um, you have no idea.”

**Security:** “Well, you have a good night, man.”

**Me:** “Alright, you too. Bye.”

//

My adrenaline was pumping. Ready to get off of work? What the hell was that? And my name spray painted on the door? It had to just be kids. They knew my name from how I answered the phone. That made sense. And their story wasn't even very good, it didn't make any sense. “It’s not working,” “it took my boy.” Amateur. Just some stupid kids trying to scare me. Stupid kids and a line forwarding problem. Nothing more.

Regardless of my attempts to reason it away, it all kind of lingered on the edge of my thoughts as I tried to collect myself and took a few calls on other accounts. As the time passed I managed to push the subject further and further away, but I just couldn't shake it entirely. I felt uncomfortable and tense. Despite being alone in the room, I felt like somebody was watching me. Like something was waiting for me. When not on a call, I paced, looked out the windows repeatedly and drank my coffee. Hidden in my little room, counting the time until I was off work and I could see that this was all just some stupid kids playing a joke and nothing was going to happen. I mean, they were in a completely different state, what were they going to do to me?

I drank so much coffee that night. 

The rest of the night was really slow, even for third shift. Usually, I would consider that a good thing but that night I hated it. It felt like torture, waiting and watching the clock. I knew nothing was going to happen, but… that didn't matter. Those words had a grip on me.

“Stupid bitch. Die after work!”

At 5:23a, I heard the door buzzer go off, meaning someone had opened the back door. Only employees know the code to get in, but regardless, it startled me. The back door is in the break room and I could see the door into the break room from where I was sitting, so I leaned back to peer through the little window. It was the first shift supervisor early for her shift. Despite knowing that was who it had to be, I was relieved. I don't know what else I would have expected. 

We greeted each other as she entered the room and she offered that since she was there early and it was slow that she would just take over for me and I could go home. Normally this would be something I’d jump at, but this time I was hesitant. Suspicious. I got a grip on reality, though, and took her up on the offer and thanked her. I thought about telling her about the weird calls I’d had, but figured I’d just end up sounding crazy. Back in reality, it was kind of embarrassing. So I just left it alone.

And that’s really what I've done with the whole thing for the past year. Just left it alone. Nothing ever came of it. Obviously, I’m here writing this so I didn't “die after work.” I realized it was just one of those things where something finds just the right spot in your brain in just the right circumstances to plant this little seed of fear --  of some inexplicable unknown -- that grows and grows, gripping and strangling your thoughts until you find all the pieces. Until you can explain away that unknown. And that morning when I got off of work and nothing happened, I was able to leave it all behind.

But, there’s a reason I decided to type all of this out. I still work at the same answering service, though now I’m a second shift supervisor, and we still answer for that same housing authority. One of my agents tonight received a call on that account and asked me to listen to it. She said the person gave all of their information really quick and she wasn't able to get it all down before they just hung up on her. So, I pulled up our voice logger, listened to the call and wrote down the information the caller had rambled off. At the end of the call, though, my heart started thumping again. The caller didn't hang up on my agent. She was calling from the buzzer box; I heard that familiar beeping again shortly before the line disconnected.

That means our voice logger works just fine recording the calls from that buzzer box.

off-black-cadillac,7,13,1r4jax,48,"Hi reddit, I just need to tell someone, because no one else would believe me and I'm not even sure if I'm imagining things or not but here goes.

Last Thursday. I went to a pub night organized by my college's student union, but I wasn't feeling too well so I decided to go home early. I don't live too far from the area, so I decided to walk.

I'm from Toronto, by the way (please I can't worry about Rob Ford right now). Most of the streets around here are pretty busy on weeknights. But as I was walking back (along College, for you fellow Torontonians), the street was eerily empty. No cars, no other people. I didn't think much of it at the time, but it was quiet. I remember that. And I also remember a car zooming down the road eastbound. I had my head down and was on my phone when I heard this loud, high pitched scream. I literally jumped back and almost dropped my phone. It wasn't like a drunken I'm-having-the-time-of-my-life scream. It was almost like a horror movie scream, but worse. It sounded tortured. It sounded  like that sound you get when you scrape your fingernails down a blackboard. I remember looking up at the car. It had already passed me, but I could see the passenger window rolled down. And I could see someone's head sticking out and looking back at me. But it was all wrong. The head was bending off the neck in a strange angle. I think it was a woman - it had long black hair waving in the wind, but it also had a blackened shrivelled face. And no eyes. I was so certain of that because I had felt such a strong sense of repulsion when I looked at the screamer's face and saw nothing but holes. But I did have a few drinks.

It wasn't the drinks though.

Last night, I went to bed relatively early. I'm usually a heavy sleeper and never wake up in the middle of the night. But last night...ok this is weird because I live on the 17th floor of an apartment (no roommates, for the record). But I woke up because I heard a thump. Like something hit my window. I thought it was a bird at first, because don't birds fly into buildings all the time in the city? But my lights were off. And I got these chills, and my stomach dropped, and I knew something wasn't right. I also got this feeling - no, I absolutely knew this - that someone was staring at me. At the time, I was turned away from the window and facing the wall. I didn't dare turn around, even though my blinds were closed. I just squeezed my eyes shut and waited. Someone was still watching. 

Eventually I fell asleep because the next thing I knew I was being woken by my alarm. Half asleep, I rolled out of bed and went to pull back the blinds.

And fuck, I should have left them. There was a huge print on my window: two hand prints and two foot prints, and a print that looked like it might be from someone's face? Except the hand and foot prints would have belonged to someone with extremely long fingers and toes. And actually I'm not kidding when I say that my building was doing window washing that same afternoon so when I came back home after night class and the prints were gone, I was pretty sure I had dreamed up the whole thing. Or had I?

Something seemed off about my place. I couldn't quite place it, but fuck. When I walked into the bathroom and turned on the light, they immediately flickered off. I turned the switch off and back on, and light flooded the bathroom. I looked at the bulbs. They seemed to be working. I didn't even notice I was holding my breath but I breathed out in relief. And then I looked at the floor. 

There was long black hair everywhere. Large greasy clumps. It wasn't mine. I had long hair too, (and girls you know it's a nightmare cleaning up hair after showering) but it was dark brown, not black. And I had recently dyed it blonde. So no way it was mine. 

I absolutely freaked out.

I packed some things in a duffel and my laptop in my backpack and headed over to a friend's place. I arrived looking like a train wreck and in tears. Fortunately, she's letting me stay for a few days. (She thinks I broke up with my boyfriend.) Right now, I'm lying on her couch and typing this because I can't fucking sleep. I don't think I imagined any of it, but... 

Sorry reddit, this was poorly written but I needed to unload my thoughts somewhere. I'm not sure when I'll go back to my place yet, I still need a few days.

MissMonstrosity,20,26,1r5z11,47,"Hello everyone. I told this story to a friend who told me I should post it here in Nosleep. I'm sorry for any grammatical errors or bad commentary, I''m not much of a writer.

About four years ago I was a troubled thirteen year old, who like most teenagers, didn't get along with my parents.
It was just me and my little Brother, our Mother who spent more time on the computer then being a real Mother, and our Step Father, who in most cases, acted more like a frat boy room-mate then a parental figure.

Anyway this all started one day when my and my Mother got into an argument, only god knows what it was about since we argued all the time  back then. 
All I remember is that I stormed off, taking a backpack of clothes and some food with me, and ran into the woods.

We live on a huge property in the country, and the woods go on for miles and miles in every direction, with only a small creek running through it to break up the never ending amount of trees.
Alot of people might be freaked out by the ominous looking place, but I loved it. I went exploring out there everyday and I knew those woods like the back of my hand.
I ran to the south west, down a large hill that had the creek I mentioned earlier at the bottom of it, the creek itself went on even farther than the woods, cutting through several private properties and stopped just outside of a town over fourteen miles away.
I decided I'd follow to town, where I'd find somewhere to stay the night.
Why not just take the road to town? well we lived in the country, there were alot of crazy people out here, drunks, hill-billies, prostitutes, and a combination of all three. I figured if I took the road I'd only be asking to get raped or robbed.

I'll fast forward a little, about 2 hours later I finally came to the edge of our property.
The property after ours belonged to an old man, we met him in church a couple times. Despite several threatening ""No Trespassing"" signs  I wasn't worried, If he did so happen to come all the way out here and somehow find me, I could just claim to be lost.  I was sure he wouldn't be this far out in the woods anyway. 
Here the woods thinned out a little, and there were several small fields tucked between the trees. I came here before, but never went any further then the edge of the fields.
At this point   the sun was only an hour or so away from setting and I started walking faster to hopefully get to town before nightfall, I ran through the creek that separated me from the field, and slipped on something causing me to fall.
It hurt like hell, later I found out I had broken my toe. It was bleeding badly and I had to limp the rest of the way through the creek and fields.
I came to the end of the fields several minutes later, where a small path, either for ATV's or a tractor, led through the woods.
I never went this far before, but I knew if I kept going straight I'd get to the town within only an hour or so, so I went on.

After what felt like forever of following a twisting path that seemed to go nowhere It finally came to a small circular clearing. There was a fence surrounding it, with a large sign once again threatening anyone who crossed. I thought it was strange, we were hours from any house, why bother putting up a fence blocking off where no one would ever be likely to go? Then again I was going through, so maybe it wasn't all that uncommon. I crawled under the fence, foot still hurting like hell and went on through the clearing. I knew I wouldn't be caught, theres no way there would be anyone out here.
I walked, or more less, limped, through the clearing, on the other side there was another small field, and just my luck, there was a old tree stand in one of the trees surrounding it. 
We have a large hunting community, and hunters often hide out in the tree stands that were often camouflaged in the trees.
I thought it would make a great place to stay the night, since the town was still a long ways away and it was already starting to get dark.
I went up to it and poked my head inside, it was perfect. Just enough space to lay down and sleep if need be. 

I climbed back out and headed back to the clearing, There was a large hill to one side of it, I figured if I climbed up it I could see just how far away the town was. 
Ignoring my aching foot, I limped over to the hill, and right in that moment something hit me on the back of the head. It felt like someone angrily poking me, or throwing a small  pebble
I turned around quickly, expecting to find an angry farmer or hunter, no one was there, it was probably just an acorn or nut falling from one of the surrounding trees.
I laughed at myself for being stupid and rubbed at my now aching head.
For whatever reason, I decided to not try to force my way up the large hill, and instead went to the opposite side of the round clearing, I dont know why, it just felt like something was pulling me there.

About half way across the clearing I stopped dead in my tracks and gasped. I literally uttered  the words ""Oh my God"" Before quickly shutting my mouth in fear someone might have heard me.
There before me, were several grave stones. All ranging in height and design. 
The ground in front of some of them was lower than the rest of the ground, almost as if the coffins underneath had caved in.
I stumbled over to the graveyard, and bent down to try to read the head-stones.
Most were unreadable. Only one of them had enough words I could make out, it looked like two head-stones fused together.

The one on the left read ""G.A Keaton -date unreadable-
The one on the right said ""Harriet Keaton 18?? - 187?""
at the bottom, just visible, was ""Our angels, together in heaven""

At this point, I turned and ran.
I blacked out for most of the time I was running, I ran through the clearing, ran along the path, ran across the fields until I was finally back on our property. 
I only slowed down because it was pitch black outside, and stupid me forgot to bring a flash-light. It was so dark I could hardly see in front of me.
Once again, I'll fast forward, I finally got home after my step father had found me, apparently he went out looking for me, not to ensure I was safe and guide me home, no. 
Only because he wanted to drag me home to make me apologize to my mother.
I didn't care, I happily followed him home.
After finally getting there I found my brother, looking like he was crying, and my mom sitting at the table eating dinner, looking like she didn't have a care in the world. She glanced at me, made a face. And left the room.
Over time I ended up telling her about the graveyard, she found it interesting, and soon enough all my family knew about the weird graveyard in the woods. It became quite a conversation topic in our family, before over time, being forgotten.



One thing I never told anyone though, And the reason I went running out of that place like a baby-
 Was because, shortly after finding that cemetery, I started to hear whispering, and among the trees behind the graveyard, I could've sworn I saw something moving.

 Then, right after reading what was on the one tombstone, what felt like a long boney finger,
Started tapping on the back of my head.

wezziford,7,18,1qxs1g,46,"There is almost nothing that I hate more than flying.

Unfortunately (yes yes, first world problems), due to the course my life has taken, I find myself on a plane at least once or twice a month.  Generally speaking, my flights are boring and uneventful with a smattering of panic attacks here and there when we fly through a thunderstorm or encounter severe turbulence.

Generally speaking.

One of my more recent flights was from Miami to Boston, a voluntary trip home to see friends, family, and dog.  Mid-afternoon departure, exit row to myself - all ingredients for an almost enjoyable flight.  Honestly, except for the woman in the row ahead of me chatting (yelling) with her row mates all flight, I would have had no complaints.

Unfortunately, for those of us that fear a ""fiery plane crash into watery grave"" type of death, the most direct flight path from MIA - BOS is largely over open water.  For most of the flight I had my nose in a book and felt no need to even peek out of the window next to me.  This time, though, the captain announced that the left side of the plane had a ""postcard perfect""view of New York City.  However, as I am lazy and perhaps spoiled in the sense that I've seen the city so many times, I decided to stay put and see if the right side of the plane had any majestic vistas to offer.

I started to lift the shade - what the fuck was that?

Alright wezziford, you're a paranoid flyer.  Look again - rip that fucker open.  Holy shit.

An unfathomably huge head, blunt at the end and longer than the freighter it was surfacing next to.  I looked around me - of course.  The view of the city had almost everyone on the other side of the plane, ooh-ing and ahh-ing.

Snap out of it.  Look again.  Too much medication before the flight?

A literal gaping maw.  It looked like a portal in the ocean, full of teeth on top of teeth.  And...shipping containers?

The freighter!  Fuck!  Now listing heavily to one side as its cargo tumbled into the ocean cavern, and just as quickly swallowed by the blackness.  In about 5 seconds, maybe even less, the ocean was still again.  The ""hole"" in the ocean replaced by what looked like a huge grey-blue island that shot a geyser into the air that seemed it would hit the plane before disappearing back into the sea.

I turned my head from the window, breathing heavily and sliding the shade back into place.  I denied, denied, denied, willing myself to believe that it was an overactive imagination and paranoid mind at work, always assuming the worst when it comes to flight.  As I settled back into my seat, trying my damnedest to stop sweating, I realized how quiet the exit rows were.  I noticed wide blue eyes looking around the seat in front of me - the loudmouth.  With a face as white as the clouds we were flying through, she looked to my window and then back at me.  Hands clutching the cross around her neck, lips moving without sound, I knew at that moment that she had seen it too.  This wasn't a Benadryl-induced illusion.  This was real, and true, and completely unnoticed to anyone but us.

Maybe the Biblical tales and sailor's stories have been true all along.  We laugh and poke holes in the plots, looking for scientific explanations to prove them wrong, because it makes it easier to sleep at night.  The ocean is vast, unexplored and desolate, even more so than outer space.  Perhaps it's best we keep it that way.",Livyatan,64

I've been trying to find similar stories to mind, but I wasn't able to find anything that would help me figure out what is going on. But I found this sub-reddit so I figured I would just register for an account and try to find help here.

I recently moved to a new town, it's all been great and I love it. One evening at a park, a woman approached me and started asking me how have I been doing, how is life, and in the end - why am I in that town, how did I decide to come, she wouldn't expect to find me there. She referred to me as Magdalena and asked me why didn't I stay in a certain small village. When she figured I had no idea who she is and that I was rather shocked that I was approached by her, she got kind of angry and first told me to cut the shit, and kept ranting. I couldn't shut her up to ask what is this all about, she kept rambling and rambling, on and on. In the end I just told her to shut the fuck up, she's a freak, I have no idea what was all of that about and I don't want to hear any more. I even started making threats. She was pissed but she walked away. 

I'm not Magdalena, that is my great-grandmother's name. She lived in the village the woman mentioned.  She's dead. And the woman that approached me couldn't have known her, because she doesn't look older than 30, my great-grandmother has been dead for more than that. People say I look like her when she was young, and there is only one picture of her - when I compare it to me, yes, we do look alike, almost the same. My grandmother says we even have the same walk, same mannerisms and voice. But that's not a weird thing - not freaky at all.

What is weird in this - even if this woman DID know my great-grandmother, or saw a picture, or whatever - why would she address me as Magdalena? No one can stay the same after more than 60 years, and that's how long ago she COULD have looked like I look now. If she was alive, she sure wouldn't be a young woman walking around parks in random towns. It's a ridiculous assumption.

I asked my grandmother about this, she asked me to describe the woman and tell me about her behavior. I did. She asked me how did I react, and as I explained the exchange, she just cut me off and asked me if I was bitchy to the woman. I had to admit that yes, I was, but she provoked that reaction. My grandmother said ""Good, she won't bother you again"". But that was it. 
I asked her about the woman, who is she, what does she want, why and how would she assume I am my great-grandmother but my grandmother just told me to leave it as it is because I got rid of her.

My father told me that it's all ridiculous and she must have made a mistake looking for someone else, but it doesn't sound like it. What kind of a coincidence would it be that she was looking for a Magdalena from that village? And plus, there are no young people in that village anymore. Especially not ones that are called Magdalena and look like me.


I met her in the same park again and she just apologized to me for her behavior, I didn't. I figured if my grandmother says I got rid of her by being bitchy I'm not going to take it back.

I was still in shock, but a few days later I approached her (she's always  in that park in the evening) - I asked about her name, who is she, why did she talk to me that day, etc. but she wouldn't answer. She would keep going off topic, saying that it's a nice day, or that the woman over there has a nice jacket, or the dog under the tree is cute, etc.
So I just let it go.

But I'm still creeped out.
Plus, I see this woman all the time in that park. And the moment I arrive - she turns to me, looks, stares. She listens while I talk to people, looks at me no matter what am I  doing. When I leave the park, she stares at me for as long as she can see me. She never gets up, even though I assumed she'd follow me.
I don't see her any other place but the park.

My grandmother told me not to talk to her, not to mess with this, to just let it be and let it go, but I can't.

Help, advice, opinions?

 UPDATE 20.11.20132 :
-I called my grandmother since I figured it would be better than trying again with the woman. 
At first she wouldn't tell me absolutely anything, but once I said ""She couldn't have known greatgrandma..."", she cut  me off and said ""She could and she did."" Then she said something like ""But she doesn't need to know you and I'm telling you to stay away.""  Obviously I tried asking who she is, what is she, but I got no answer, so I asked is she dangerous, evil - she said no, but she isn't such good company either.  She compared her to a friend I had when I was about 14 that wasn't really evil or bad, she just often caused trouble and if you were her friend, you'd be in that trouble too of course. She'd stick with you through everything, but she'd cause the shit that you have to stick through in the first place. I told her I want to know more and if she doesn't tell me I'll find out on my own, possibly by asking the woman, she said I don't need to know but it's my choice and if I don't trust her enough to stay away, that's fine but she's not talking.
My father told me it's all bullshit and I can just go talk to the woman and ask her is she crazy or drunk or drugged or something. But how the fuck did she know.",Who is this woman?,58
Desequencer,3,21,1qwubp,44,"I woke up this morning with little to no recollection of the day before. It’s not the first time, either.

I remember waking up. I vaguely remember going to work. I don’t remember what I worked on. I only remember waking up again this morning.

Being a detective, you can imagine that this type of mental illness would not go over well with my higher ups. No one knows that I have a fleeting memory, except my brother. I call him every time it happens, because I have no one else to talk to.

“Again?” he asked wearily, not even greeting me after he picked up the phone.

I sighed and rubbed my head.

“Still no headaches or anything?”

My brother works in pharmaceutics, so he knows his fair share about medicine, but he’s still no doctor. I haven’t gotten any pills from him; instead, I’ve only gotten pleas do go to a real doctor. Like I said, I can’t do that. Not with my job.

“I’m going to work,” I said.

“Come on, man. Be reasonable. What case are you working on right now?”

“That missing person case, where the husband claims–“

“Right, right.” He became more serious, solemn even. “I know you don’t trust him, but…”

“But what?”

“Maybe he’s telling the truth.” 

I laughed. “Like hell. There’s a realistic explanation for everything that appears supernatural. Including hauntings.”

“I believe him.”

After the brief chat with my brother, I got ready for work. It pained me to be unable to remember a single damn thing from the day before. The best I could do was believe I followed my usual routine, deep into the fog of my memory. Shower, breakfast, drive, case… I would have interviewed the husband about the case. I would have written down new information. I would be fine.

I got to work and found the most recent folder in my case list. A missing persons report, and the husband was being held for questioning. There was no new information from the day before, so I wondered what work I had even gotten done yesterday.

An officer brought the husband into one of our interrogation rooms at my request. “Still no headway, huh?” the officer asked when I met him at the door.

I furrowed my brow. “Why do you say that?”

He shrugged. “Well, you were in here with him yesterday. You left in a hurry so I figured you… you know, *had* something.”

I glanced at my folder, in which I had written nothing about this interrogation yesterday. Struggling with what to say to cover, I shook my head. “Nothing.”

“Didn’t mean to step on your toes, Detective. Just curious.”

“Not a problem.” I gave the officer a reassuring smile and entered the room.

“What is this for, man?” the husband asked before I had a chance to shut the door. He was frustrated, and I didn’t blame him. I needed answers for more than just this case, though.

I sat down across the table from him and opened the folder, skimming over it. I’d already read through the available information, but I wanted him to sweat. Based on what I had, I suspected the guy, and I wanted him to think that I’d found the evidence to nail him. But when I looked up after a minute or so, he wasn’t sweating. He was dejected, his face in one of his hands.

“So what’s the story?” I asked.

“I told you,” he groaned. “It was that–“

The last four interviews, he said the same thing. That’s what my reports say. But the last time, I don’t know what he began the story with. I glanced up at the camera in the corner of the room, deciding to pull the tape and see what had happened. As for now, I’d had enough. “Why don’t you tell me something new, John?”

“Like yesterday?” He was quick on the trigger. “What about yesterday, huh? You hurry out of here like you’ve got to take a huge shit, and now you’re back here today, starting over.”

I held my hands up to calm him down. “Alright, okay.”

“You didn’t find her, then?”

I didn’t remember. “Sorry, not yet. You know I’m working on it.”

“Go talk to the dry cleaner or his wife, they’ll corroborate my story.”

“That your wife is missing because of a ghost?” Maybe I had already gone to see them, and one of them hit me over the head so I wouldn’t remember.

Then again, maybe my lapses in memory were related to the case. *There’s a realistic explanation for everything that appears supernatural. Including hauntings.* I was making headway but forgetting the progress, and not for inexplicable reasons. Was someone keeping track of me? I glanced up at the camera again, briefly imagining that one of my higher ups was responsible for this. I suddenly felt in over my head as I tried to reason through this logic. It was as unreasonable as a haunted dress, right? 

“Are you even listening?”

I snapped out of my train of thought and looked at John. “No, I was thinking.”

“Don’t…hurt yourself,” he said quietly, sitting back in his chair.

When I noticed that his eyes were fixed on my nose, I became aware of something draining from it. Blood.

“Are you alright, Detective?”

I didn’t have an answer. “I’ll be…” I got out of the chair. “I’ll be back,” I stammered, backing out of the room.

After waving the officer off I got to the restroom to clean myself up. The bleeding stopped after a moment, but even then I remained to stare at myself in the mirror, trying to figure my own self out. There was a piece to this puzzle in my brain, and I didn’t know how to get it out. Maybe my nose would bleed it out for me.

I went back to my desk in a daze. I sat down and found that my computer was off, which was peculiar. Due to the long boot up time, I usually just logged out and left it idle overnight. Groaning, I pushed the power button on the tower and waited the agonizing several minutes before the login screen appeared.

Once logged in, I used the shortcut to open the program we use for digital case information. Instead of opening the program, it opened a text file.

*Check your trash, and you’ll see!!*

A wave of chills crashed against my back. What was I supposed to see? I swallowed and looked at my trash can. Empty. Not that I would rummage through it while the office was busy anyway. Then, realizing my mistake, I checked the computer’s trash.

A single text file. Untitled.

I opened it hesitantly, and I was greeted with a long slab of prose instead of a single line of text. Shaking, I began to read.

Decendent,4,28,1qwq4m,41,"My mother recently told me about how she(oblivious at the time) was almost raped and possibly murdered by Mike ""The Mall Passer"" DeBardeleben (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_DeBardeleben).
He was a serial rapist, murderer, counterfeit money passer, and sexual sadist.

She told me recently that in 1979 while she was in college in North Carolina, she noticed someone following her in a big car as she walked home one night from class. She tried to ignore it at first, but when it was obvious that she was being stalked, she got scared. She saw a cop car parked at a gas station and ran to it, and the car that had been following her peeled off. Once she thought she was safe, she continued her walk home. Everything was ok until she had to cross the little footbridge that's on her way home. Once she was over it, the same car ripped around the corner and stopped her, and a man rolled his window down and started small talk, and asked her if he could give her a ride. She said ""No"" and started to turn, at which point he grabbed her and tried to pull her into the car. She said she jerked away and immediately ran to a house that was across the street, and he sped away.

2 weeks later, she awoke to the sound of her roommate screaming (Mom, and 3 other girls all shared a 2 bedroom apartment, so it was 2 to a room). When she gained her vision she saw THE SAME GUY standing in the middle of her room looking at her. She said that the look on his face was calculating. The roommate screamed ""Who are you what are you doing here?!"" and he turned and replied ""uh...I uh..forgot my guitar"" and grabbed a guitar that was leaning on the wall. The roommate shouted ""That's my guitar!"" and he threw it to the ground and ran out.

After reporting this event to the apartment manager, the manager told my mom that some guy had come by a few days earlier stating that he was a family friend of ""the pretty girl with long dark hair that lives upstairs"" and wanted to surprise her. So the apartment manager gave her pretty much ever detail about my Mom. Where she works, goes to school, basic weekly routines. Of course my Mom flipped out on her, as anyone would.
That was the last she ever saw or heard of him, until several years later. 

She was reading a book about notorious serial killers in America and read the story of Mike DeBardeleben. Who was all over the country raping and apparently killing some of his victims. When she flipped the page and saw his picture, she gasped. It was him. They also showed a picture of his car, and it was the one that followed her that night. 

Once she told me, I started to research. I found this page : http://www.docstoc.com/docs/54025280/James-Michael-DeBardeleben-Mall-Passer that showed that he was in the North Carolina area at the same time my Mom was attending college there. Also, the victimology shows that he targeted women around age 18 and 19, my Mom's age at the time. Seriously got the creeps. 

He died in 2011. I wouldn't be here today if he had done what he was planning to do. I'm glad he dropped his pursuit, but I wonder more often than I should...why? I can only assume that his initial plan failed and it would have been too easy to tie him to any crime committed against my mother at that point, so it was easier to move on.

His next victim was Laurie Jensen. She lived, but was repeatedly raped. Who knows where she is now, but for some reason I can't get her out of my head.


TL;DR - My mother was almost raped and possibly killed before I was born, by a serial sexual sadist named Mike DeBardeleben. He died in prison in 2011.",I was almost never born,69
LightTheDark,3,24,1qw2x2,43,"Recently I have noticed little changes to things around the house.  The electric blanket had been turned off on the temperature control rather than at the wall, a tape measure was moved from the store room at the back of the house to the glass shelves at the front of the house, my kindle opened to a book I had finished reading weeks ago, rather than to the book I was reading now.

I didn’t think too much of it, maybe my husband had changed the electric blanket setting to 0, maybe I moved the tape measure and forgotten I had and electronic devices sometimes do some wacky things.

Then, last night, just before bed my husband and I were having an argument.  Just a silly little tiff about nothing in particular, the kind of fight people have when they have been together for so long, normally for us this is triggered by the tomato isle in the supermarket.  No idea why.  

We were both tired, and I don’t like to go to bed angry with each other, so I tried to end the fight by saying if I wasn’t to blame and he wasn’t to blame, then who was?  My husband responded saying ‘Nobody’.  I laughed and said ‘naughty Nobody, you really should apologise’.  

Very quietly somebody said ‘sorry’.

DickBanditDoneLanded,10,63,1r1zac,39,"As a kid, I grew up singing songs of joy with my friends. Fun songs that made me feel like a child. There was one song that I never really liked, for reasons unbeknownst to me, but that one song would become a living hell during my adult life.

My wife packed my son's lunchbox with a pizza lunchables; It was always his favorite one. I had the privilege of walking him to school that cold October morning, holding his hand the whole walk. We talked about toys, games, and then the topic of songs came up.
""Hey, dad...how come you never showed me the song about Josh Jacob Jinglehyper Smith?"" he asked. ""Haha, you mean John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt? I never liked that song, kiddo,"" I replied. ""I thought his name was Josh, like mine!"" He added.

 We got to the school about half an hour earlier than the entry time, so I suggested we go to the playground located around back; Josh agreed and followed me. The air felt relatively dense that day, I could barely see fifty feet away and asked Josh to stay in sight and have a little fun before school starts. I look away at the birds in the trees and I'm startled by the piercing cry of my son, nowhere in sight. I call his name and he says ""Sorry, dad! I fell off the monkey bars, I'll be fine!"" I sighed and laughed a little knowing my kid was such a warrior. I notice Josh riding a swing and laughing with another little boy who also came to school too early. I see his father standing on the side, laughing and I worry about not being a good enough dad to Josh. I start to walk toward the boys and that's when it hits me; I wasn't watching Josh play, none of the two boys was mine. I tried to keep calm but felt the need to yell out his name to locate him. I look around the playground and the school bell rings, announcing the school's opening. The dense, foggy air dissipates and I'm able to see everything clearly. I find a note in the second floor of the jungle gym, it reads: ""I know how hard you tried to avoid me, I wouldn't want the same thing happening with Josh.""

My heart sank and my eyes widened as the note dropped on the mulch and made a thud. I felt every possible emotion at that one point in time. I didn't know what to do, where to go, who to ask for help, so I walked into the school, where I come across a corkboard with pictures of kids on it. All of these children were abducted by a strange man who walked into the forest beside the school. I knew what I had to do, I ran into the woods, clenching the note he had written. ""John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt!"" I hear a high pitched voice scream from the bushes, as I fall to the ground in fear.

 I noticed a building on a hill about a mile into the wild. It was a greenish wooden house, much like the ones mystery inc. would investigate, but this was not a game, this was my son's life and possibly that of many other children. The smell of rotting was emitting throughout the air, and I feared the worst for the status of the kids. Not willing to be detected, I snuck in through a window that was left open and creeped about the dark house with nothing but my signal-less cellphone and my dedication. I was in the basement floor and couldn't see anything, so I turned on my flashlight app. I had no idea I was about to come across one of the most horrible sights anyone could've seen.

 There were mutilated corpses, not just any corpses, but children, kids who I had met through class pictures my wife bought and showed me. The kids were decapitated, burned, sliced, naked. I was scared for my life, I almost threw up one too many times but swallowed it back along with my will to flee. I found a wooden staircase that was old and rotting. The first step I took on it made a loud creak and there was a groan in the distance. I hid behind a giant flowerpot as a huge figure approached the area I was in. I could barely breathe as I noticed this man had blood between his fingernails, as if he mutilated the children with nothing but his fingers. He returned to the room and I followed him from afar. The smell I picked up earlier was much stronger than before and I heard muffled cries coming from the room the man walked into. 
""Say it with me, now, kids!
John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt! 
His name is my name too! 
Whenever we go out! 
The people always shout! 
There goes John Jacob Jingleheimer Schm-"" A kid bit a hole through the duct tape on his mouth and was able to scream while he sang. I heard the kid's name; It was Gary.

The children were all able to remove their mouth bindings and cried in unison for about ten seconds. Then I hear a loud laugh, followed by a ""SHUT THE FUCK UP!"" At this point, I was enraged. Nobody has the right to scream at kids like that, nobody. I barged in, grabbing this freak by his back-length hair and slamming his face into a table with limbs on it. ""What did you just say to those kids, you motherfucker?!"" I yelled, oblivious to the children in the room. ""You're gonna pay for all your shit, you son of a bitch!"" I said ""Well that's just too damn bad!"" He added ""I didn't know today was the day I'd be found! It's such a shame you've missed your playdate with your son...he was SUCH a nice boy!"" He said, laughing his head off at the sight of my expression. I was cold, I was numb. My son was dead.

 I unleashed my fury on the man, not holding back at all. I knocked him unconscious and tied him down to a giant piece of metal. I broke both his legs and made sure he'd never walk again, then I released the children, many starving and ready to go home. I tugged the slab down the hill and walked alongside the children toward the school. The police had previously raided the woods, but never came across the house in the entire year he had been performing the kidnappings. I called the school and notified the authorities of the serial killer I had slayed and I wanted to make sure he was arrested and would suffer his whole life for what he did to my wife and I. She was hysterical, unable to perform for almost a whole year. We cancelled any holidays and vacations and mourned a year away. We finally concluded that our son was happy in a better place with the rest of his friends. Although my wife and I never had any other children, I became teacher at an elementary school in another state and was happy knowing I had kids who were fun to be around and nice to me. 

One Monday morning, we have a new girl come in and I ask her to introduce herself. She's laughing and she's shy and she wants to whisper something in my ear. ""I'll introduce myself if we can just play today."" She says I promise her, along with the class, that we'll have a free day and she introduces herself and makes friends. I start to like this girl because I never had a chance to have a daughter and always wanted one. She was very sociable and was the class clown.

She stopped coming to school for a week, and out of curiosity, I called her parents to ask about her sudden disappearance. Her mother was crying and I couldn't understand her, so her father came to the phone. I told him about how the class missed her and he told me about a note that was left at their door one afternoon. It read: ""Go through her drawings"" I asked the dad to give me a minute while I did just that. *HE* was in the pictures. Every drawing she made had *him* hiding in the background. There was a folded piece of paper that was thicker than the rest. Little did I know, it wasn't school paper, it was skin; Pressed and cut to replicate a note. ""I thought, by now, you'd figure out I was never human"" I got on the phone to tell the girl's father the news, but all I heard was a demonic, maniacal laughter. I felt a hole in my chest, as the phone line went dead, followed by three beeps and elongated static.","His name is my name, too.",102
Capntallon,20,16,1r8n66,53,"I got this letter from an old friend I haven't seen in a long time. I figure that this would be best place to ask for advice. Here's the transcript of the letter:

*Hello, Daniel. Haven't seen you for quite some time now.*

*No time for formalities, though. I need you to do something. Remember that old house we used to hide out in down by the farm? I need you to go there. When you approach the house, try not to make any sound. Go up to the loft and you will find a trunk. In it you will find a small vial, a razor blade, and a folded piece of paper. Take the razor and prick your finger. Touch your forehead and make a dot of blood. DO NOT touch the vial before you do so.*

*Open the vial and drink it. When you do so your vision will go blurry, but you have to stay calm. Pick up the paper in the trunk and read the first paragraph. It's in German, but I know you won't have trouble with  pronouncing it. At this point, you MUST stay calm. You will start to feel closed in and you will start hearing voices. DO NOT listen to what they have to say. Tear the paper into the smallest pieces you can and scatter them on the floor.*

*When that's done, go downstairs to the ""kitchen"". You will find a gas can and a lighter. Set fire to the house. No matter what the voices say, you HAVE to set fire to the house. After it starts going, the voices will go away. Then you need to get away from that house as fast as you can.*

*Good luck,*

*Tiffany*

I'm really freaked out. What should I do?",I got this letter a few days ago...,69
YourOldPalHoward,40,22,1qzw9o,34,"I first discovered the darker side of the internet in the very early 2000s, when I was 12 or 13. Between 3 and 5pm every week day, the window where I was home from school and both of my parents were at work, I'd be on the family desktop browsing gore sites like Rotten.com and Ogrish. I don't know what the fascination was for me, but it was (thankfully) the sort of thing I grew out of with time. That's not to say I don't enjoy a good /r/WTF post from time to time, but it's been many years since I've had the urge to intentionally trawl through those dark corners of the web.


At 13, however, I was a real glutton for disturbing content. I wittingly exposed myself to photos of horrible deformities and medical conditions, the aftermath of grisly road accidents, videos of Al Queda beheadings and public suicides, the list could go on. I desensitized myself to such stuff, and troubling as it may be, I remain mostly as desensitized to this day.


But that's just how it is when you grow up with unrestricted internet access and a morbid streak.


There was one site I remember stumbling across, though, that haunts me to this day. Not because the videos on it were especially gory or anything—once you've seen the Bud Dweyer suicide, or Nick Berg screaming as a terrorist saws through his neck with a rusty knife, gore on its own just doesn't do much for you.


If I had to come up with what was so terrifying about this site, I guess it would be the fact that I just can't imagine what sort of person would make videos of this nature, much less in such obscene quantities. You can kind of get into the head of a terrorist bomber or cartel executioner— they're often products of circumstance and have identifiable motives. But the sort of person behind these particular videos...I just don't understand his particular sickness of the mind. And as terrifying as such an unknown might be, I'm not sure I'd even want to.


There had to have been at least 50 videos on the site. They all had titles and descriptions in Russian, but this was a good few years before the days of Google Translate, so I still have no idea what they read. I don't know if that makes it better or worse.


Each and every video was filmed on a tripod in the middle of the woods. They'd start out with nothing in frame for several seconds while the angle was being adjusted. Then the cameraman would walk into view wearing a balaclava and pulling a dog on a leash. He'd usually speak to the camera briefly (again, in Russian). Sometimes the dog would get anxious and whine, and the man would kneel down and speak softly to it for a moment.


Then he would take the leash, wrap it around the dog's neck, and choke it to death. Sometimes this took several minutes. The man would maintain the choke until a full minute or so after the dog had gone completely limp, then get up, walk towards where the tripod was mounted, and end the video.


Again, there were *at least* 50 of these videos on the site. I watched way more of them than I'd care to admit, and every one of them went exactly the same, just with different dogs. Some of the dogs would whine during the video, but all of them were docile and obedient— some of them were even playful and affectionate towards the man before he began choking them. These dogs clearly weren't taken from Russia's feral dog population, these were pets. 


Were they other people's pets, that were stolen and killed? Or did the man in the video adopt and care for animals just to choke them out for his video collection? I'm not sure which would be worse.


Lastly, I don't recall any two videos having a dog of the same breed. Though I didn't watch all of them, I saw everything from beagles to Great Danes get the same treatment. Sometimes there would be a particularly uncommon breed, including some I didn't recognize at all, and the guy's cadence and body language reflected a kind of creepy excitement. It was almost like the guy had made a game of acquiring and killing as many distinct breeds of dogs as he could come across.


So yeah. Nothing supernatural about my story, no danger or unexplained phenomenon. Just a Russian guy and his awful hobby. I don't even know if it will count as NoSleep for you guys— all I know is, whenever I think about what sort of person was behind those videos, and the fact that he's in all likelihood still around somewhere, it gives me the fucking chills.


I don't remember the name of the site. It might not even be up anymore. But I can't be the only one who came across it. Someone else who sought out fucked up shit at the time has to have encountered the same videos. Right?",I can't be the only one who saw these videos...,56
breezy84,4,13,1qvgrc,32,"I was about 15 or 16 when this happened, and I will never forget it! 

I ate lunch with my little group of friends every day at school. We noticed that our friend ""Erin"" had been overly tired for the past few days and asked her if there was anything wrong. At first she answered no, but then she said ""Well, there is, but you guys wouldn't believe me if I told you."" Well, of course we wanted to know what it was after that! We finally got it out of her. ""I've been waking up in the middle of the night lately, and....I swear my dolls are breathing."" Woah! What?? Our friend ""Blair"" and myself automatically gained interest - we were big fans of the paranormal. ""Mary"" wasn't as interested and was very skeptical. Blair and I decided a slumber party was in order, stat!!

The next day was Friday, we all arranged to have a sleepover at Erin's house and find out for ourselves about these ""breathing dolls"". Erin had a rather large bedroom upstairs. At the far end was a bay window with a bench to sit on, and on both sides of the window there were two shelves lined with Erin's porcelain doll collection, probably about 30 dolls in all. We had a great time, doing normal dorky things girls do at sleepovers, we all practically forgot the main reason we were staying there in the first place. Time flew by and before we knew it, it was about 2am. ""Well,"" said Blair, ""let's hit the hay and see what these dolls do!""

We all settled into our sleeping bags or make-shift beds, shut off the lights, and waited. Occasionally one of us would say something that would make the rest of the slap-happy gang laugh, but eventually we settled into silence. We all laid there for probably about an hour, listening and waiting and trying not to fall asleep. I was just starting to doze off when I heard Erin whisper ""There it is...do you hear it???"" Blair, Mary, and myself lifted our heads up and listened. It was quiet, but definitely there...a faint, rhythmic breathing. ""Are you sure we're not just hearing each other??"" asked Mary. We all held our breath to test that theory, but the breathing still continued. Blair, the bravest of us, got to her feet and slowly made her way over toward the dolls. Erin and I got up and followed...Mary followed also, but hung back a ways.

The moon was shining through the window, illuminating the dolls from the side. As we leaned in to have a closer look, we noticed something...condensation underneath the noses of several of the dolls. The condensation coincided with the breathing we were hearing, the spots getting larger on the exhale and smaller on the inhale...THE FRICKIN' DOLLS WERE BREATHING. Needless to say we freaked out. There was a door in Erin's room that led to a storage area over the garage. We flipped the lights on, ran into the storage area, grabbed a box and threw all of the dolls in it. Then we took it back into the storage area, put a couple heavy boxes on top of it, then closed locked and barricaded the door. None of us slept very well the rest of the night, after experiencing that and just knowing that those dolls were still under the same roof as us.

Erin's house was (and still is) incredibly haunted and all kinds of weird things have happened there over the years, but this was by far the craziest! I had one porcelain doll that immediately went into the trash as soon as I got home. To this day I still refuse to own one and really just hate dolls like that in general. I know it wasn't the ""dolls"" themselves so much as whatever was possessing them, but I'm definitely not providing a vessel for whatever it was!",The Breathing Dolls,45
DarkPie,12,14,1qvq2y,31,"For those of you who didn't see my original entry, I figured I should put a link to it. [Here you go.](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qqxas/mom_i_love_you/)

I was asleep a lot the past day or so. I think it was the blood loss, personally, but as soon as I was awake I was confronted by a psychologist. Dr. Sharon Richardson, a woman who I never met before, but she knew a lot about me. She knew of my mom, her snap, the wounds I had received. She was worried about me, to say the least. ""One does not get betrayed by their own parent and feel nothing."" That might be true, but that wasn't how mom saw it.

""I'll be okay once she gets the help she needs."" The look of pity on her face made me confused, but she simply said it was someone else's job to explain that to me. We talked for about an hour, about everything from school to the recent craziness, and she came to the conclusion that I was in mild shock. It sounded right- I still hadn't wrapped my head around the fact that I was alone now. ""I'll talk to you in a few days"" she said with a smile, resting her hand on my head.

A woman in her early fifties, she had aged well. A fine wine among most women who age, admittedly, like milk. She left, and I thought I could rest. I couldn't- I was confronted instead by Officer Hughes, a man of Filipino descent. He introduced himself, asked how I was feeling, seemed like a genuinely good man. He slid up the chair and sat down, looking at me with the somber expression that made it seem like he'd be telling me my mother was dead.

""Son... It's about your mother."" My heart stopped. My pupils dilated, my muscles tensed. I sat straight, making the bullet wounds stretch and feel just awful. ""Do you have any idea where she might be?"" She was still alive. I thought that had been what I wanted to hear, but instead I panicked. My mother, when she was more sane, was OCD. She didn't like leaving jobs half done. Face growing pale, I shook my head. ""Uhm... I have... Grandparents."" I could barely talk, and the answer didn't please him.

""Yes, we know. On your mothers side. They've both been killed. It seems after your mothers escape, she went there to talk to your parents. We assume that your grandfather decided to call the institution and tell them where your mother was, and she found out. Your grandmother died from lacerations, your grandfather- Well. They're no longer alive"" he said. Now I felt it. Remorse, pain. Without his assurance, though, I knew this wasn't my fault. Mom was... She was going crazy.

""How do you know they were calling the institution..?"" The officer smiled. ""They received the call. They just never heard his voice. She was too fast for them"" he said, trying to say it as calmly as possible. ""From there, she took your grandfathers Browning M1911 handgun, and .375 H&amp;H rifle. I guess you came into contact with the handgun."" He seemed solemn. ""My mom... She's not going to jail, is she?""

""If we catch her, she'll be in an institution the rest of her life. Medication forever. She won't escape there. Is there any other family she might go to?"" There wasn't. ""Do you guys have any regular places you'd like to go?"" We didn't. ""Well fuck, where would she b-"" his voice was rising, but he was cut off by the nurse entering the room quickly. 

""We received a phone call"" she said in a panic. The officer stood quickly, and she almost started balling. ""Some woman, she sounded mad. She... She said she was coming to pick up her son"" she said among chokes of tears. ""Goddamnit"" The officer yelled, running his fingers through his hair. I didn't understand the problem, but apparently the area they thought she was in was the complete opposite side of town from the hospital. He was my only protection. 

""I have an idea..."" I offered up timidly. The officer looked at me, bemused and irritated. ""Well... If I know her, she just wants to finish what she's started. Which means she knows charging in here won't work out. She'll probably just sit around until I try to go home. So why don't you just take me home in your car, we'll beat her there, and you guard me? You can have your backup waiting like a block or two away..."" 

""And she'll think she has a chance if it's just me there! Kid, that's actually a good idea!"" he exclaimed. He helped me into a wheelchair and took me to his squad car, loading me in and watching his back like he was the one being followed. Once I was strapped in, he entered his seat and we started driving. I arched back, watching the hospital fade away as a nurse stepped outside to see me off.

It wasn't a nurse though. It was my mom in a nurses outfit. She'd been in there. I was wrong. She was going to finish the job in there herself. I cried. I lost it, unable to keep it in anymore, and explained through sobs what I saw.

He shook his head, unable to believe it. ""Don't worry kid. I offered my service to this career to help people like you- Innocents. It'll end soon, and you'll be okay"" he tried soothing me, I know, but it did little to help. She almost had me. She knows where I'm going- I can feel it. It's about to end. I feel scared. I feel like you're the only ones I can talk to. None of my friends have contacted me, and this officer... 

He's great and all, don't get me wrong. Nice, down to earth, and genuinely wants to help. But he took me upstairs and put me in my room, and has been watching out since. The police agree that staking out the house would scare her away, and we need her captured fast. Hughes will be staying in my house with me, sleeping during the day while they have a squad car parked outside, and an officer who comes in to check up every five minutes. Hughes stakes out at night in my moms old room. I'll have no time to talk to him, to take the load off my mind. But it's coming to an end soon. I can feel it.

Please be with me Nosleep. I need you.","I Love You, Mom (Part 2)",45
IrishSurfer,2,14,1qscwt,31,"On June 4th, 1983, my high school was one of many that took us to Disneyland for Grad Night. If you’ve ever been to Disneyland on Grad Night, you know how much fun – and how crazy – it can be. The park stays open extra late, the skippers who drive the Jungle Cruise boats let loose and tell dirty jokes, and there’s plenty of opportunities for people to sneak booze and weed in. Getting a bunch of amped high schoolers in Disneyland is one thing, but with a nightlife and party atmosphere behind it, things can get pretty nuts.

My two friends and I, Anaheim locals, were particularly excited. We all loved Disneyland, and while we didn’t get to visit often, living practically in the park’s backyard gave us more opportunities than most. In addition, we hadn’t been since the new Fantasyland opened earlier that year, going from a sort of Medieval fairground into a storybook village, so I was kind of looking forward to that. Unlike a lot of people who were there, we intended to keep things clean and have a grand old time of it, hit as many rides as possible, and just revel.

But the big plan for the night was kind of ambitious and maybe a little reckless – to this day, I can’t remember who suggested it first, only that we all thought it was a great idea. We had already gotten into the park and gone on a number of rides when it was brought up, while we were sitting on a bench in Frontierland eating churros. From where we sat, we could look across the Rivers of America to Tom Sawyer Island, and past that where the river curved to New Orleans Square. Poking above the trees was the cupola of the Haunted Mansion, with its clipper ship weather-vane. The sun had just gone down, and the sky was awash with dull orange and purple clouds, most of which seemed to loom behind the cupola. I pointed out how perfect and spooky the whole thing looked, and that got us talking about it. The mansion was a collective favorite, and being dumb kids, we agreed to do a little exploring: to effectively “spend the night” in the Haunted Mansion.

We laughed about as we got in line for it, moving past the brick columns and up the walk toward the mansion, but inside I was a bit nervous. You have to understand security was a bit more lax back then, so it was plausible that we would be able to pull this off if we were careful. Plus, Grad Night always had kids getting into trouble, and the likelihood of us getting banned for good was not as high as it could have been. But I still felt tense, that feeling you get when you’re scared about going on a thrill ride for the first time, excited but hesitant.

The three of us – Mike, Karen and myself – had it all worked out: when you first enter the mansion, you’re escorted into a room that seems to stretch and warp before your eyes, which is actually an elevator that takes guests below ground, where a hallway connects to the ride building beyond the park’s berm. As everyone else crowded out of the room and into the Hall of Morphing Portraits, we lagged behind (which the disembodied voice of the Ghost Host jokingly warns you not to do) and fell in at the very back of the line. By the time we piled into our “Doombuggy,” there was no one else behind us, and the black, endless procession of clamshell-like cars were empty.

We went through the ride as normal, cracking jokes and making banter at all the old familiar scenes, until we reached the exit crypt. We stepped out onto the moving platform and walked toward the escalator ramp that leads from the crypt back to the park outside. If you don’t know, the escalator hugs the wall on the right, but on the left is a small crypt scene where a tiny, ghostly bride stands on a stone shelf and tells you to “Hurry back…Hurry back…” Mike took charge here, deliberately turning backwards as we went up to watch the cast member near the buggies below us. Mike’s a big, broad-shouldered guy, a football player through-and-through, and his bulk hid me and Karen from view as we slowly ascended. At his signal, when the cast member monitoring the exit had his back turned, Karen and I climbed over the rail and dropped down into the crypt scene, where we quickly scurried under the dusty space beneath the escalator. Mike was over a moment later, and we laughed and congratulated each other on a job well done.

We must have spent a good hour or so down there, giggling into our hands whenever we heard footsteps and voices overhead of unsuspecting people exiting the ride. Karen even had some snacks she’d brought with her, and we sat there in the dark and ate and whispered to each other. It was like being in a weird clubhouse, and it felt good that we three shared this delinquency together, even as the narration of the ghost bride looped over and over again in the background: “Hurry back…Hurry back…Be sure to bring your death certificate. If you decide to join us, make final arrangements now. We’ve been…dying to have you.”

Eventually the novelty wore off, and we got quiet, and then listless. Sure, we’d managed this much, but then what? Karen pointed out that it had been eerily silent for awhile – other than the monotonous speech of the bride and other spooky ambient sounds, there were no more people coming up the ramp. Mike said he thought maybe the park had closed, but that made no sense because it was open all night on Grad Night. Not wanting to get in trouble, but also wondering what was up, I volunteered to clamber back up and take a look. When I did, using some of the crypt scenery for hand and footholds, I saw that there was no one around, not even a cast member down at the unloading platform at the end.

When I reported this, Mike and Karen climbed back up as well, and we went back down the unloading station to look around. All the Doombuggies coming along the corridor were empty, and there was not a person in sight. It was odd, to say the least, and I felt like something was definitely off to have the place so empty. I was about to suggest turning around and heading back outside when Mike said he’d always wondered where the Doombuggies went after they dropped you off. They rounded a dark corner in the crypt area and vanished from sight, and Mike was curious what was down there.

Now really, I should have said no, that there was no point and that we could get into some serious trouble if we snooped around back there. It was probably just a utility corridor anyway, since the buggies just looped back around to the loading room anyway. But I was young, and I was stupid, and when presented with a golden opportunity like that, it was hard to pass it up.

So we went ahead and jumped into a Doombuggy going by, and it slowly rounded the corner into the darkness. This was uncharted territory for us, and even if it turned out to be boring back there, at the very least we’d get a chance to see it, and maybe get another ride out of it.

Hardly a day goes by where I regret not having said something.

The main thing I remember was how spartan it was. It wasn’t quite pitch black, but it was even gloomier in there than the rest of the ride. There were small lights set into the walls on either side of the track, but they were low to the ground and far between. The walls were painted black, and the corridor seemed so narrow that I felt boxed in. It was quiet too, other than the hum of the track moving the buggies. I felt tense, and Mike and Karen weren’t helping that, because they looked tense too; I think it was dawning on all of us how much trouble we might get in.

I think a minute or so had passed like this, us going down that dark, featureless backstage corridor, when the ride suddenly stopped and I nearly jumped out of my skin as a voice came from somewhere overhead – and laughed when I realized I’d been startled by the normal breakdown spiel. “Playful spooks have interrupted our tour,” the recording went. “Please remain seated in your Doombuggy. We will proceed in just a moment.”

The teasing was immediate, as we all pointed out to each other how we’d jumped. We waited for the ride to start again, and every thirty seconds or so, the spiel would play: “We have been unappointedly detained by prankish spirits. Kindly remain seated in your Doombuggy. We will continue our tour momentarily.” This went on for good long while – ten, maybe fifteen minutes – and still the buggies hadn’t moved, no one had come looking for us. We were getting antsy, and the silence between the announcements was becoming unsettling.

Then Karen leaned out a bit and looked around, and she noticed the door first. Just ahead, past the buggy in front of us, worklights revealed a little alcove and a utility door on the right-hand side of the corridor. We were so sick of being in the buggy by that point we were willing to try anything, so after a short discussion, we all squeezed out of the buggy, pressed against the wall to go past the next one – Mike had trouble here – and stood before the door. I pushed it open, finding it unlocked, and it led to a metal staircase leading down into the darkness, footlights like the ones in the corridor revealing where to go. I was thinking up excuses in my head as we went down the stairs, to explain why were likely stepping into Disney’s underground utility corridors – the infamous “Utilidors” said to run like a spiderweb beneath Disneyland – if someone found us. And by this point, I hoped someone did.

At the bottom of the stairs, another closed door with a sign on it, reading “Cast Members Only.” We pushed through that as well, and were legitimately surprised to see that it opened into what looked like a themed hallway. Disney, even backstage, seemed to be paying attention to style, as this hall sported the purple “demon wallpaper” and wainscoting of the rooms above. It was even lit by candle sconces on the walls, the fake flickering bulbs coated with cobwebs and dust. Several detailed wooden doors lined the hall, with out-of-place white placards mounted to them. Each was marked as a Prop Room, with a corresponding number.

As we made our way up the hall, we tried each door we came to and found them all locked. The first door, Prop Room 1, shook a bit but wouldn’t budge. Same with 2 and 3. Mike chuckled and said he wondered if we would find Walt Disney’s frozen head down here, but I could hear a nervous waver in his laugh. Even I was feeling some sense of dread with each door we tried, something hard to place but nagging. At Door 4, I put my ear to the edge of it and thought I heard what sounded like rushing water or faint TV static from the other side, and at 5 I noticed that the faux candles flanking it were flickering more sporadically than the rest, like they were faulty. Door 6, to left and near another plain utility door that marked the hall’s end, was the only one that yielded to us, and I was the one who turned the cold handle and opened it for the first time.

It’s difficult for me to describe what I saw in there without shuddering, because even now my telling makes it sound fairly normal… That is, as normal as a room hidden under a theme park attraction can possibly be. It wasn’t very big, almost like a large storage shed. Unlike the hall, this one was the bland utility black, and lit by a single fluorescent light in the ceiling, albeit a dim one. The walls were lined with metal cabinets, and there was some sort of large, archaic gadget shoved into one corner, not unlike the old computer banks from the 60s. But what caught my attention right away was the grinning figure near the far wall, across from the door – a dummy or animatronic of some sort, lifeless and unmoving but standing on its base.

The discovery was fascinating to all of us, and without thinking we all edged into the room and immediately approached the figure. It was clearly meant to be one of the ghosts in the ride, a specter in a top hat with a skull-like face, cartoony bulging eyes and a leering smile; one of the teeth was even painted gold. He stood in a bow-legged stance, one gnarled hand holding a cane and the other a hatbox. None of us had ever seen this particular character on the ride before, though Karen said its face looked a lot like the tall, skinny hitchhiking ghost from the end of the ride.

I was just turning away from the figure to look at the cabinets when there was a combustion roar from the hall outside, like the sound of a passing motorcycle, followed by a loud, bassy boom that made the floor shake. The door to the room swung shut, and the fluorescent light sputtered and went out, leaving us in total darkness. Mike gasped and Karen screamed, and I was just reaching out for them in the dark when I heard a peculiar whirring sound. Another light came on, this one a concentrated green light above the hatbox ghost, showing its skeleton smile for a moment before that light faded and another faded on, illuminating the hatbox. I could see through the material of the hatbox now, and saw the ghost’s head grinning at me from inside. The pattern repeated itself rhythmically, making it seem like the ghost’s head was disappearing from his shoulders and appearing in the hatbox. It wasn’t a terribly convincing effect, but in the dark and with the strange things going on around me, it genuinely scared me.

I turned and stumbled through the room, ready to get out of there, feeling around for the door. Now even the light on the ghost shut off, and I heard Karen and Mike’s feet behind me, a crash, and the sound of something solid tapping the concrete floor. I tried pushing the door open, but it wouldn’t budge, and somebody slammed into my back in the dark and caused me to hit it hard. I was dazed but unhurt, and another scream from Karen fueled my adrenaline even more. I instead gave the door a tug and it opened.

I was out in the hall without a second thought, without even looking back. I started running, sprinting back the way I had come, gasping for air. I was never a very athletic kid, but panic kept me going. I heard sounds behind me – footsteps, Mike and Karen yelling in terror as they followed, and what seemed like rapid knocking and banging on the doors around me – but I refused to look over my shoulder. Up the stairs and back into the Doombuggy corridor in what felt like a matter of seconds. The Doombuggies were moving now, endlessly traveling through the shadows. I knew it was risky to jump into one in this narrow corridor, and for a moment I stopped, trying to figure out what to do.

I finally looked back, back down the stairway I had come from. I thought Mike and Karen had been right behind me, but they were gone. I called out their names, my voice echoing down the stairs, but there was no reply. Not until I heard something tapping the metal stairs, coming up toward the door, and saw an unfamiliar vague shadow on the wall that I flung the door closed and dove into the nearest buggy, which carried me down the corridor a little ways before finally emerging into the limbo-like loading room.

All of the effects were still running here, including the eerie music and sounds, but there was still no one else around. I yelled for help, but no one appeared. As soon as I could I jumped out of the Doombuggy and ran back up the line, into the Hall of Morphing Portraits. Ahead was the door to the elevator, the Stretching Gallery, but I remembered that this area had a more immediate chicken exit, meant for those too scared to ride the ride and wanted to head back up to the park. The door was marked with an obvious exit sign, sitting between two shuttered windows that made it look like it led outside to a stormy night, and without hesitating I pushed through that as well.

Beyond was another corridor, on either side of me flashing lights pointed at the windows to simulate lightning, flickering with each thunderclap that boomed through the hall, disorienting me even further. Turning left, I followed the hall as the floor inclined gently up, my throat tight and a stitch in my side.

And then my throat closed altogether as I turned a corner almost ran into the hatbox ghost.

It was standing smack-dab in the middle of the hall, between me and the door that led outside. I scrambled backward instinctively, but the figure didn’t move. It was a static prop, grinning its cadaver grin, back-lit by a ceiling light further down the hall. The light also broke the illusion of the hatbox, and I could see vaguely the shape of the disembodied head through the scrim.

I was convinced – thoroughly convinced at that moment – that thing was going to suddenly jerk to life and come after me, but it didn’t. I had no idea how it had gotten there from down in the sub-level, or how it had so quickly. Maybe the one I’d seen below wasn’t the only figure; maybe Mike and Karen were pulling a fast one on me, and had dragged the figure up with them. I was frozen, trying to figure out where to go next, not wanting to go anywhere near the ghost but not wanting to backtrack either, because I still felt like there was something sinister behind me. Nervously, I croaked out the names of my lost friends, but there was no reply. Noises from the ride seemed to come floating down the hall, muted but ever-present.

Then I heard the groan.

It could have been a human groan, or something mechanical, but I definitely heard it. It didn’t sound like any of the standard audio, and it came from a point somewhere near or past the hatbox ghost, maybe even from further down the corridor past the exit. As if this were a trigger, I realized that either my eyes had adjusted to the dark or the lighting had somehow changed, because I looked again at the hatbox and saw the thing inside through the scrim.

There was still a head in there, but I know it wasn’t the ghost’s head. It wasn’t even a cartoon caricature of a head. It wasn’t Mike, or Karen.

It’s at this point the details allude me. I know that what I saw shook me to my very core, and that’s part of the reason its taken me so long to recount this. I remember seeing the thing in the box, seeing that it was indeed a human head – a man’s face, a face I didn’t recognize, seemingly looking back out at me with shocked, pleading eyes – but after that there’s a blur of sheer terror and snatches of frightening images: gnarled hands; tombstones; pneumatic hissing; the stretching room going in reverse, shrinking, shrinking too fast, the ceiling rushing toward me, the corpse hanging in the rafters descending on me…

I try not to dwell on them too much, because now I’m no longer sure which really happened and which were the results of the nightmares I’d have for years after.

The next thing I can remember clearly after that is being on my hands and knees just outside the fence of the Haunted Mansion, vomiting onto the pavement, while around me crowds of people stood. Most of them weren’t paying me any mind, there was lots of whispered talk and a few were crying. There were red-and-blue lights, police cars parked nearby, but I couldn’t tell why. I just sat there gulping and sobbing until a cast member finally noticed me and led me to a first aid station.

Karen was there when I arrived, and she jumped up and hugged me tight when she saw me. I don’t think either of us made much sense, we were both at our wit’s end, but it was such a relief to see her after all that that any questions I had fell by the wayside. I’ll never forget how haunted she looked, wide-eyed and pale, barely able to form a sentence without tearing up.

Mike never turned up.

—

That fateful night has never left me, and in the years since then I’ve slowly begun to piece together the details, trying to (vainly) make sense of what happened. It became sort of a private obsession, something to do in the background as I moved on with my life.

First, it didn’t take long for Karen and I to learn why the police cars were there, and they weren’t for us. According to the reports we heard later, an 18-year-old guy from New Mexico had died while we were in the Haunted Mansion. He and a friend had snuck into a backstage area on Tom Sawyer’s Island and stole a rubber emergency boat to go for a joyride around the Rivers of America. Apparently this guy was pretty drunk and it wasn’t long before he hit a rock, throwing he and his friend from the boat. His friend went for help, but he drowned before they could find him. His body was discovered an hour later.

I wonder now if that’s why there was no one around when we crept backstage. I managed to track down a few cast members who were working that night, and though most of them claim that they were told by management to not cause alarm and keep to their posts, several admitted they had gone to check out the grim spectacle… especially those CMs that were on attractions near the river, like the Haunted Mansion. Was the timing such that everyone turned a blind eye while we stumbled into something hideous?

Mike’s disappearance was something me and Karen both felt deeply, and we tried for years to get something from anyone about it. His parents told us later that he’d shown up again a day or so later, behaving erratically, barely registering them, deeply disturbed by something. Mike had planned on moving out beforehand, but that night after lashing out at his folks, he grabbed very few personally belongings, took the family car and drove off to points unknown. After that, he dropped off the face of the earth.

Karen and I eventually drifted, probably because we blamed each other for what happened. She never expressed to me what she experienced after we got separated, either because she wanted me to feel guilty for leaving them behind (oh Karen, you have no idea) or that she, like me, can only recall so much. We were both too shaken to recount to each other. But time and distance make things easier, and with the advent of the internet there was suddenly a wealth of new information. I’ve since begun to piece together clues.

Almost immediately I found our Hatbox Ghost. Plugging that into any search engine will turn up multitudes of pictures of that bow-legged, grinning figure that has often floated through my mind’s eye in the dark. It was apparently part of the attraction when it first opened in 1969, and much of the promotional material of the ride at the time featured this character and his ubiquitous hatbox. He originally stood in the attic scene, right across from the ghostly bride with the beating heart, but was quietly removed from the ride after only a week; apparently, the effect of his disappearing head never worked properly, or so the official account goes.

In recent years the Hatbox Ghost has gained a fanbase, groups of Haunted Mansion fans that want to see him restored to the ride. It’s wishful thinking, I’m sure, because that figure had to have been stored downstairs for a reason.

It took longer to find out about the backstage area where the Doombuggies go, that empty corridor not originally meant to be seen by guests; disabled guests, however, travel that route all the time. Wheelchair access to the ride is done through the Limbo-like loading room, and guests travel back around to this room to reclaim their wheelchairs and head back out. I’ve posted about it and posed queries for details about that area, but no one has given me a description that sounds anything like what I went through. It’s been described as short, bland, and with some sort of catwalk going over the track, but no mysterious alcove or obvious doorway. It takes less than 30 seconds for the Doombuggies to go through, and then you’re back in the loading room. I suspect Disney might have changed that area since ht 80s, but why?

Most recently though, I’ve come across an odd factoid that seems more like a morbid curiosity than anything else, unless one’s been through what I have. It’s not about the Haunted Mansion, however, but its nearby E-ticket neighbor, Pirates of the Caribbean. According to the story – and this has been published in various Disney-owned books, so its no vague rumor – the Imagineers who built the ride felt that the faux skeletons of the time weren’t convincing enough for the underground grotto scenes. So they borrowed real human remains from the UCLA Medical Center, dressed them up as pirates, and put them in the caves. Let that sink in for a moment: millions of people went by on boats and had no idea they were looking at real skeletons, all propped up in pirate garb. Eventually, a later team of Imagineers would replace these with more convincing facsimiles, and supposedly the bones were returned to their countries of origin and given proper burial.

But whose to say they were? What if something was left behind in that basement when the bones were taken? And what if Pirates wasn’t the only ride that did this? The show building of the Haunted Mansion was built along with the rest of New Orleans Square in 1963, but it took another six years for the actual attraction to open. Why the delay? It couldn’t have just been the gridlock from the 1964 World’s Fair and Walt Disney’s death in ’66, could it?

All of this is speculation, a string of understanding that raises more questions for me than it does answers. I want to get to the truth of what happened that night, but everything I’ve found doesn’t add up to a concrete explanation; perhaps there isn’t one, though I desperately want there to be. And I can’t go back – I won’t – not after the things I saw and felt. I haven’t set foot in Disneyland since that night.

Maybe, though… Maybe its time I tried again.

Karen, if you’re out there and you’re reading this, I’m sorry about everything. I’m trying to make it right, trying to put some meaning to this. Contact me if you can. I need to know what happened to you and Mike – maybe you have the key to the mystery in your memories. I can’t do it alone, but together we might get to the bottom of this.

For everyone else, let this stand as a testament: some things are backstage for a reason, and a company like Disney must have a multitude of skeletons in its closets. Think twice before you pull some stupid stunt like I did, because it might not be security that finds you.

misstiddeR,6,11,1r1ypf,29," when I was younger I never really had friends.My Parents were drug users and no one wanted their children around the drug baby. I passed my time playing in fields and building forts, somewhere along the line I created an imaginary friend. We were the same age and she looked just like me. She would come to school and even stay all night at my house but no one else could see her. She wanted to be seen so badly.Sometimes she would get angry.One time she was so mad she scratched my arm and told me if I said anything to anyone she would hurt my parents.  She was always there staring at me, she wouldn't even blink. One day I started to cry. I was scared. my mother finally asked what was going on and I told her. ""Its Madi mom my friend she's mad at me.""The look on her face went from concern to questioning. ""who's madi honey"" I didn't want to answer her madi was in the corner of the room ripping her hair out and her eyes had grown dark.I told her she was my friend but no one could see her aside from me. My mother at that point thinking it was some silly kid thing began to joke around. ""oh and what does this madi look like?"" I told her she looked just like me and my mother froze. She began to get angry ""Did your father tell you to say this?"" I shook my head and looked over at madi she was smiling but where the black eyes had been before were now clawed bloody holesMadi spoke ""what did I tell you?""She stated to slowly come towards my mother and i. She said something over and over again. ""dirty bitch drop the needle"". And before i could do anything she grabbed my mothers head and with a single move killed her.I never saw madi again. The police ruled my mothers death as a drug deal gone wrong. And when I told my father what happened I found out some chilling facts. I was supposed to be a twin but my sister died at birth from complications due to my mothers drug use. Her name was madi.",Madi,40

Anyway, my grandparents own a farm outside of a *very* small town. We only had some horses and ducks, but my 9-year-old self thought it was pretty cool. There was a field, with the main house in it, a driveway up a small hill, leading to my grandpa's garage. Just beside the driveway, many meters, is the barn, the barnyard, and the 2 fields behind them down the other side of the small hill. The rest of the property is woods that me and my cousins used to explore.  
Now onto the story in question, it was the middle of the night, and I was having trouble sleeping. Which was odd, because I normally slept well especially at their house. The guest room door was just open a crack, to let the hallway light illuminate the room just a tad. I was never afraid of the dark, however I was terrified of the idea of someone watching me sleep without my knowledge. The bed was parallel to the window, so I could see the stars when the blind was down. I sat there, telling myself to sleep, and eventually I did, but I just couldn't force myself to, at the moment. I have a sudden urge to look out the window into the field, even though I could already see the outside sky. I sit up, leaving the warmth and comfort of the blankets. A light snow is falling, and the beautiful Milky Way lights up the field almost like day. I admire the beauty of the snowy field and woods, until I notice a shadowy figure crossing the field towards the road, staying along the treeline. At first, I dismissed it as a animal, we saw animals a **lot**, then I noticed the way it walked. It was eerily *human*.  
It may only be a hunter, I told myself, as we've had hunters trespassing on our property before, and I could see tracks behind it that *looked* human, but something was different. It was almost like it sucked the light out of the air. It looked like it *was* a shadow. Thats when it turns, but I can't see if its towards or away from me. The hallway light flickers and goes out. Leaving only the ominous Milky Way looming over the earth to light the room, I lay down  and decide I'm imagining it. The hallway light can wait until morning, plus I don't think my grandparents would be very happy if I woke them up at 1 a.m. to change a silly light bulb.  
As I finally feel myself slipping from the hands of reality, I feel a breath on my face, a small ""shhhh"" and hands locking around my neck, and I fall into the void of unconsciousness.  
I woke up with bruises on my neck. To this day I don't sleep with the blinds open.  
I also have many other stories involving that property, that I may post in the near future.  

Edit: I remember a whisper. That may have been my imagination though.   
Edit 2: The tracks. There was tracks behind it but they were gone by morning from the snowfall.

sgtatarms123,1,16,1r20rb,24,"I have been getting singular phantom door bell rings at my house, that only i am able to hear, my mum and dad don't hear anything.

The first instance was about 5 months ago, i heard a singular door bell ring at 7am, it woke me up, and i didn't think much of it. Later that day i asked my mother if she heard anything and she said no you're dreaming.

Now im not a crazy person, i am probably the most sane person you would ever meet, in addition i don't do drugs, or drink

So i don't think much about it, thinking my parents their old im young, young people have better hearing than old people.

But this keeps happening around the same time 7am, and im thinking who the heck is this, is this some joke is this the delivery man?

No it wouldn't be a delivery this early ever

Whenever im home alone i have the habbit of whenever the door bell rings i don't answer it, so it was about 4pm one day and a singular door bell ring happens, i tip toe and peek out the front window, i wasn't very fast so i saw nothing, and it never rung again.

A month later, its about 6pm, singular door bell ring, im there in 20seconds, nothing, front gate not moving, again me alone in the house.

Am i imagining all this? there is no way i am not crazy

Coincidence or not, a few days later my mum is in the house, the door rings, my mum answers, its my elderly neighbour.

So i think to myself so it was her all along, all those times i never answered the door it was her, even the times at 7am, shes old ok old people wake up early... ok case closed right.

Today

4:53am singular door bell ring, wakes me up from my sleep, i am not freaking crazy, you know how a door bell sounds, its long it lasts about 3 seconds, i am awake and i can hear the second half of the ring all around my house

I go back to sleep because i was tired, then it rings again at 7am... i tell my mum when i wake up says she didn't hear anything

Heres the good part my dad thinks im crazy too so bought some cctv security cameras and has installed one at our front porch

Today I rewinded the tape to 6:45am, 

I see two lumps laying vertically on our front porch, it is two people in sleeping bags

Skip forward to 6:55am

They get up, I see two men one wears a long brown coat and a black hat, he is big and fat but i couldn't see his face, the other guy is thin and small, he was wearing grey sweat pants and a grey sweater...

Him i saw, his face was skinny and pale almost half skeleton he has yellow rotten teeth

7:00am

I see him ringing our door bell then go back to sleep in his sleeping bag same with big fat guy, they zip themselves up before you could see their heads but here they zip themselves all the way up, and inch away like caterpillars, out of camera view (this took 3mins)

WTF - was this their sick way of saying thankyou for your hospitality 

(I rewinded the tape further they came at 3:09am and started sleeping on our front porch)

I think the ring at 4:53am meant the time they showed, i might have been in deep sleep the other times idk. I also think they hop our fence, I told my dad to put a camera there too, called cops shown them this, there's a patrol car outside our house right now. 

Nobody thinks im crazy now",Phantom Door Bell,40
slivr33,9,12,1qtewa,27,"a little groggy from the beer a few hours earlier, a little stoned, no worse for wear though.  In any condition I was good to drive.  I didn't even remember the woman's name who's apartment I had just slinked out of at 4:30am.  It didn't matter anyways, I just wanted to sleep in my own bed.  I pulled up the drive as I had any other night, parked the car in the same spot as any other night.  Something *felt* different this night though.  Maybe cause I hadn't smoked or gotten laid in a while, maybe cause my guard was down just a little bit more than usual. 

I stepped up to the door, reached into my pocket for the keys. I thought I heard something as the keys made a light clatter while coming out of my pocket.  You know, one of those faint sounds where you're probably just hearing things, where it's probably just the wind going throw some tree branches or something like that.  It was dark and I was feeling lucky so I picked one of the four keys and tried it and as I did I heard it again.. was it calling my name? I fumbled as I hesitated while attempting to grab another key and I heard it this time.. it sounded like it was coming from inside ^^""help!"" it was distant but it was urgent.  I thought it could be my roommate, it sounded like his voice, ""Mike?!"" I said as I fumbled through my keys then hastily decided the moonlight wasn't bright enough. I had to use the light from my phone.  ^^""Hello? ^^Helpp,"" once again was called out but I couldn't tell if it was from afar or from within my house, or even if it was Mike saying it.  The voice was so unusually muffled.  

I was still shuffling through the keys, finally under the light of my phone as I urgently said ""Hang on! I'm coming."" I finally grabbed the house key as I heard it again, this time it was incomprehensible, yet still, I could not pin where it was coming from.  I unlocked the door and barged in, and immediately called out to Mike, beckoning for a response; ""Mike? Hello? Mike?!""  No answer.  I stood there waiting, for what I don't know, anything.  Silence.

Distraught, I went back outside to see if the voice was actually coming from out there. My phone is dying, 4%.. whatever I'm at my house anyways, I can use it to see in the dark if I need it.  I called out ""Hello?"" loud enough so that it could be heard, but not too loud to wake up the neighbors at 4:45am.  Nothing.  A chill of realization goes up my spine as I discern that it has to be be one of two things, I'm crazy and hearing things, or there's something there.  Maybe it was the wind, maybe I was just zoning out and imagining things.  My pride wouldn't let me believe it, no, I thought, I just made a scene in the middle of the night, I *heard something*.    I irrationally recalled how I had joked with Mike about our house being haunted after watching The Amityville Horror with him a few nights prior.  ""Stop scaring yourself,"" I thought, ""that has nothing to do with anything.""

I walked as slowly and quietly as I could throughout the house first.  I didn't dare flip the light-switches for reasons unbeknownst to me.  So I used my phone as a flashlight, in hindsight this wasn't a bright idea.  I didn't realize I still had my keys gripped tightly in my hand until I got to the den.  ^""Mike?"" I whispered with doubt in my voice.  No response.  There was but a ember or two glinting in the fireplace, and his car was in the driveway, so he must've gone to bed a little over an hour ago.  I didn't bother checking his room, I now knew the voice wasn't his. He was asleep and I didn't want to wake him.

It *had* to have been from outside.  I felt as if I was going crazy, but I **needed** to find out what had happened.  3%, fuckin battery always dies when I need it.  I shined the light into Mike's car half-expecting to see something that I don't wanna see.  The muffled voice, it would only make sense.  To my relief and dismay, nothing was in there other than the ordinary debris.  I walked around to one side house, Mike's bathroom light is on, this is ordinary though so I trudged back the way I came.  1%?! C'mon, it's been like 2 minutes. I called out one last time with hope in my voice-a little louder too, ""Hello?!"" Fuck the neighbors, I wanna know what's going on.  I walked around the other side of the house shining my phone left and right methodically at an almost frantic pace.  

I stopped.  There I stood, looking into the darkness of my house through the window, my phone pointed at the ground.  I'm genuinely scared to bring the light to it, I don't know why.. it was just like any other night.  As I raised my phone to peer inside seemingly irrational fear struck me like a ton of fucking bats flying within my chest trying to get out.  I slowly raised the phone... from the ground up.. I saw nothing until... until I got to eye level.  There they were, staring right back at me, then GONE in an instant.  I shined my phone around, ""what the fuck was that?! Did that just happen?"" I thought out loud.  Then and there, right at that very moment, my phone died.","So there I was, driving home from a night out",39
lifecmcs,2,13,1qynx5,25,"When I was 9 years old, we moved into a new apartment. It was a great deal for my parents and I could remember them being so excited to move there. It was across Torrance, CA in a Redondo Beach, next to the ocean, though we still had to go 4 or 5 miles to get to the beach and couldn't see it from the apartment. It was me, my younger sister (4 years younger), my dad, and my mom. The apartment was also very big, with a stairs (important detail) leading up directly from the front door. The only thing that was a bit off was the fact that we were allowed to get the house for almost a 75% discount. I was later to find out that the previous owners had left 'all of a sudden' and only told the owners of the apartment to lease the place. Nothing really happened for a few days, only the anxiety of going to a new school, living in a new house, etc.

Prior to that move, I had had no cable tv. For some reason, my parents decided to get a plasma flatscreen and I became instantly hooked. I was watching Spongebob Squarepants, Jimmy Neutron, etc. I was a TV addict. Plus the fact that I had almost no friends at school at the time contributed to me watching TV more. Then, one day, I met Jacob. Jacob told me that he loved Star Wars and, as much as two fourth grader could, we became best friends. We would hang out all the time, play-acting star wars. Then, one day, he asked me if I was Christian. It was out of the blue. I told him that I went to church, but I wasn't too convinced. Then he told me his dad had told him that God would die. Then, he gave a 'prayer' to 'Lucifer' who I didn't know. Then that was when the wierd shit hit the fan.

My mother miscarried my younger sibling. Even now the though that I would have a younger brother/sister is still haunting to me. Then, she would have bouts of nightmares where she would scream in the middle of the night, scaring me and my little sister. Then, my dad started having nightmares as well. He told me that he heard a horse galloping outside, the hooves of the horse hitting the pavement. The thing is, the last times that had happened, his father and grandmother had died. This happened three times in a row. Turns out, one of our aunts in Korea had just passed away.

Meanwhile, nothing was really happening to me. Then, one Friday night, I was at home watching TV. There was 'Church Service' that day but I was at home watching TV. Now, the thing is, the living room is right next to the front door. So, if you enter the house, you immediately see a staircase and, to your right, you would see the living room. i was in the living room watching TV, facing the side of the staircase, next to the door. 

I saw my basketball roll down and bounce down the stairs. I ran to get it, looked up and saw my sister standing at the head of the stairs. I yelled at her for playing with my ball, then threw it back at her. Then I went back to the couch and watched Drake and Josh. However, because my mind was so addled with the hilariousness of Nickleodeon Comedy, I failed to realize that my sister was with my parents at church, and there was someone else upstairs. When I realized this, I ran out of the apartment as fast as my legs could carry me. But then I locked myself out and got sick cause it was cold and was grounded for a week. But, still, to this day, I don't know who the fuck or what the fuck that girl was.",Happened to Me.,38
BumpinRapTapes,10,8,1r0hla,25,"So I got a call from a telemarketer, nothing weird about that really.  But before I hung up the automated voice started spitting out stuff like my address, age, stuff like that.  And then my social security number.  Then a list of my room mates.  And then I was concerned.  I waited until the machine stopped, expecting some numbers to press for more info or whatever so I could find out what's up and get myself off their call list.  All the lady robot said though was ""The Intermed company thanks you.""

Reasonably concerned I started doing some research, after ignoring a bunch of message board sites  I finally found what I think was the Intermed site (in like the fifth page of results).  This is all it said:

""Intermed is at the forefront of the organ trade market and thought processing innovations.  All our services are backed with industry leading research and proven by numerous customer testimonials.  Many of our customers are satisfied to the point of frequent return, and we pride ourselves in maintaining our client pool.

Never again will the flaws of your fathers keep you from the life you deserve.  Even the best and brightest are far from perfect, and we strive everyday to make you, the perfect human being.""

Nothing else.  White page, black text.  That's it.  I decided to backtrack to the message boards to see what I could find.  This led me to some random sites and eventually I found a few message threads of people sharing stories similar to mine.  A weird robot caller with way too much information.  One guy got the call in the wee hours of the morning and totally laid a boner kill on a sweaty night with his lady.  They all seemed to be on the same hunt I was, except for one username that I saw pop up on a few of the sites, he called himself ASimpleCipher.  All this dude did was sing Intermed's praises, how he and his friends had used their ""products and services to tremendous avail"" and ""would recommend to anyone!""  All very cheesy and all seemingly marketing plants.  Since that was my best lead I decided to make an account on one of the thread sites and try and get in contact with him.

I sent him a rather aggressive message, which may've been a mistake looking back.  But regardless, and unsurprisingly, I got no response.  I decided if worse came to worse I'd just deal with it when it came up.  I put the whole thing in the back of my mind.  For a few months.

Then ASimpleCipher responded.  Here's a copy and paste of our correspondence:

[Me]  Hey man it's really obvious you work for intermed, you're not fooling anyone.  I want to know who you are, what intermed is and how you got so much of my information.  And I want MY private information deleted from your database, and I want off your call list.  Immediately.  I will not hesitate to get a lawyer involved if this goes any further.

[ASimpleCipher]   I appreciate your interest in my company, Ben!  As always, customer care is a top goal at Intermed.  My representatives tell me that based on market research, you would be a prime candidate for our products and services.  As a courtesy, we like to know as much as we can about potential customers, so as to provide the best quality care possible.  Like you, I once felt a terrible weight in my life, one that rendered me incapable of reaching my full potential as a human being.  When doctors could not help me mend the flaws given to me by generations past, I took matters into my own hands.  As it came to pass, that effort is what gave way to this current business venture.  You may hesitate at terminology like ""Thought Processing"" and ""Organ Trade"", but let me assure you the danger begins and ends at the television screen.  So, if I may, I'd like to draw some common ground between yourself and I.  We do share many similarities.  As a young man, I was plagued with severe asthma (like yourself) from my mother's side of the family, leaving me unable to compete physically with my peers.  This lead me to more intellectual endeavors as I began to mature into an adult.  Cruel as fate is however, I soon discovered I'd inherited a more severe form of my grandfathers autism.  His genes riddled me with social anxiety, and I was thus outcast from much of any community I was ever a member of.  In spite of my flawed genetics I was only more driven to clear the blemishes of my being.  Nothing, I vowed, would hinder my quest for perfection... of the perfect human being.  Given to me from my lineage, however, was the savvy and cunning of generations of businessmen.  

Years, centuries it seems, passed while I honed my craft and built my empire.  Once one is outcast from society, one develops a strong callous to sympathy.  Under a mutual agreement of confidentiality between you and I, I will admit to using almost every associate of mine as merely a means to my own end.  Well, that end is Intermed.  Intermed is my true brainchild, as it were.  I will also admit to misleading you a bit, giving the facade of a full staff under my employ.  Let me assure you I am fully capable of operating this venture on my own.  Let me also assure you your personal information is safe and sound, as I said, I only aim to ensure the best service possible.  Never miss a detail is a creed I operate under.

Enough business however!  Even a jaded outcast such as me has need for camaraderie!  During my time working in the shipping industry I found myself in Northern California in the early 1960's.  My business associate at the time was a rather unstable man.  Every bit of his free time, it seemed he would study the art of coded language, ciphers, cryptograms... whatever one may call them.  Strangely, he got me very interested in the art and it has since become a favorite hobby of mine.  Of course his were much more complex than anything I cared to attempt, he was also versed in astrology and loved to incorporate knowledge of the stars into his little puzzles (This earned him quite the sinister reputation after we parted ways).  On the other hand, I preferred to leave little clues here and there, woven into my business dealings.  Now imagine what fun it would be if someone figured out my little puzzles!  All that work of building a persona of mystery!  Unravelled by a thread I'd left loose for some cunning soul to pull!  Really, I thought someone would've found it by now.  Even after everyone I've tried to sell Intermed's services and products to it is you, cunning lad, who has finally made contact.  Very clever, indeed.  Of course you saw my companies website.  I admit it is a bit sparse, a work in progress.  Reducing my mission for Intermed to a single paragraph however, I did put in a bit of extra effort.

I have been rambling though, I do apologize!  Thank you for inquiring about my company, I hope my response has eased any concerns you may have.

-Intermed-

I really don't know what to make of this guy.  It really can't be some prank, the guy knew I had asthma as a kid.  How?  I have to say that I've never experienced such an air of creepiness from pure text.  Something about the way he composed his message was off.  I don't know.  I can't make a lot of sense out of any of this.  I stopped my investigation there, being as I have seen too many horror movies and don't like the idea of rabbit holes.  It's been a few months since and I haven't heard anything from Intermed or ASimpleCipher.  I check the thread site every now and then.  I did go back and check out the Intermed website again.  I'm really not one for puzzles, I can't make anything out of it.  So I'm submitting it here to see if someone is more ""cunning"" than me.  I hope so.

hits it differently. If you hold the eye up and turn it around, the tendons holding onto the 
eye, when pulled, will slowly rip away and create the sweet sound of ripping flesh as the 
eye tears from the tendon. if you follow the tendon, it will eventually lead to the brain. 
But there’s about something the eyes that excites me. I can’t help myself but to collect 
them. Many eyes, blue, green and brown; sometimes, if I get lucky I’ll find a amber one.

ggtheblock,4,6,1r2ucw,25,"I don't know what I saw, I'm not even really sure I should have seen what I did. 

Two nights ago I was having a wonderful dream. There was nothing odd or creepy to it, just a dream. I woke up in the middle of the night as some people tend to do but then I have wondered since if I ever really did wake up at all. From my bed I watched as 2 figures cloaked in crimsom, one considerably taller than the other, walked into my room. The shorter of the two turned to look at me as he shut off my alarm clock. I woke up the next morning several hours after my alarm was supposed to go off. Did I unplug it in my sleep? Did I even set it in the first place? I didn't want to consider any other options. Last night however tipped the scales in the other direction.

Last night's dream is still fresh on my mind. I was on a mission to stop a bomb going off. I had a key and as I raced through the city streets I checked my watch every block to see how much time I had left. I made it inside the building, rounding the last corner, checking my watch one last time and saw that I had just 2 minutes to spare but when I looked up I was no longer dreaming. I was on my couch, looking eye to eye with the hooded figures as they sat only inches away. They were green, withered. The red of their cloaks matched only by the red of their irisis. No glow to be found, however they had perfect white teeth. The smaller of the two had the larger smile, clearly taking pleasure in what he was about to do.

 ""I'm sorry but we can't let you do that."" 

It was then that I noticed a small familiar watch in his hand and didn't really realize what he did as he removed the final 2 minutes from the timer. I was back in the dream, staring in horror at the monitors of the console I was supposed to have reached in time. Millions dead, cities in ruin, more carnage then I have ever witnessed. I broke, fell to my knees and cried until the building's security came and apprehended me. 

I don't know what happened. I'm not sure if I fell into some sort of inception scenario but I pray I do not have anything important to dream about tonight.",We Can't Let You do That,31

I live in a somewhat medium-sized house, out in the country surrounded by trees.

I've always felt safe here, never once paranoid, never worried, the crime rate here is pretty low.

In the entire twenty years I've lived here I've only seen news of one single break in.
I'd say that gives me plenty of easy sleeping.


Until recently.


I was getting ready for work, my job is night cook at a local restaurant.
I left the house, noticing the cool air of November,
And as the chill whispered into my lungs, I felt,
As cliché as it sounds, as if I was being watched.

I looked around, nothing was there.
But when I finally shrugged it off, and got Into my car,
I noticed that my mirrors were all fogged up.

Normally, this wouldn't even bother me, as It's so easy to get out of my driveway. 
But tonight, everything seemed wrong.
As I turned the key, and my engine started up,

I heard my radio move to static, from channel to channel, instead of the usual classic rock station.
Living alone, I have no reason to believe anyone would tamper with my car. I don't have neighbors nearby, and My dog would have warned me if someone was messing around.

Again, I checked my clock and shrugged it off.
I'd be late if I didn't hurry.

As I reached the switch off the static, my radio stopped, 99.9FM. 
And I heard a whisper, at first I thought I was going insane or dreaming.
But I turned the volume up, and could barely make out the words,
""kill...me.......Kill....me...""

The words sent a chill colder than the freezing air through my spine, and I immediately turned the radio off, and left, 

I'm now at work, but I will update should anything else happen. ",Static voices,34
unforgiving_cake,3,14,1qx58h,24,"My best friend's older sister is pretty Instafamous.

Caroline has always been fashion-forward and very self-aware. Ever since I've known my best friend we've either admired or resented her sister, with little middle ground. Any time my friend would have sleepovers we'd all listen with our ears pressed against the wall to all of Caroline's multiple hours-long phone calls and listen to her flirting and giggling. This was when she was in *Jr. High*. We hardly ever saw Caroline when she was in high school because she'd always be off with one of her many suitors, or all her friends at some underage club.

Now that Instagram has become a ""thing"" Caroline has bested us all at that, as well. She does the weekday themes, and hashtag-this and hashtag-that. Caroline was big on the leggy shots in a bathtub, or holding a beer up next to her giant sunglasses by a pool, or snapping a quick photo of her half-eaten salad - #*sofull*.

Instagram has become an epidemic. It's everywhere with its shitty filters and the paragraphs of tags. Caroline was no exception to this (truthfully, neither was I, but I'm not as fond of my face as she is), and now she has nearly 5k followers, the majority of them people she's never met, all liking photos of her bellybutton ring and the new bikini she bought.

This past August Caroline moved to New York for an internship. She never calls home, so my friend's family has hardly heard anything from her. If they want to reach Caroline they just log onto Facebook or her Instagram and make sure she's alive. Eventually she'll respond to their missed calls with a short text: call u l8r! xo

Then, sometime in the middle of October, my friend got a call from Caroline early in the morning. It was sometime around 3 AM, she told me, and Caroline sounded frightened. She was telling my friend all about this guy, just some guy she'd met at a book signing she'd gone to, and how he hadn't left her alone for days.

When my best friend called Caroline back the next afternoon she didn't answer, but a few hours later insisted everything was fine through texts, and that she and this guy were going out for dinner that night.

Rolling her eyes, my friend turned her phone to me that night and showed me Caroline's Instagram. It was a photo of two plates and candles in between, and two glasses of red wine - #*classybitch* #*wino* #*Woody*

We both assumed Woody was this creep she'd been referring to. My friend joked he must have had enough cash to sway Caroline's decision and over the next few days there were more photos and more hashtags to come.

Caroline hadn't called my friend back, and, not unsually, she wasn't returning any of their mother's phone calls, either. Still, her Instagram was active with pictures of two pairs of feet propped up on Caroline's coffee table with #*cozy* #*Woody*. Another, the next day, was a picture of a cabin with a long porch surrounded by woods. Caroline's car was parked next to the cabin and it was tagged #*cabininthewoods* #*vacay* #*Woody*.

Nothing was too unusual until my friend and I were browsing at the mall and she showed me a picture of Caroline lying on a mattress. Her hand was propped under her head, her eyes closed, and she was wearing a plain white dress that was strangely out of season for Caroline. #*sweetdreams* #*Woody*

""It's so fucking weird,"" my best friend had said. ""It's like she's going to marry this guy, or something. And how sleazy is that, to just snap a picture of her and put it on *her* Instagram?""

At first I'd assumed my friend was jealous. We were both jealous of Caroline a lot of the time. I mean, she'd gotten to go to NYC, she was gorgeous, and my best friend's parents were practically paying for her to live in her apartment.

The following week there were countless calls being made to Caroline's phone. My friend had pointed out how odd Caroline's new guy was and her mom went into full-panic mode. This time, however, Caroline didn't even reply in texts. It was like this guy was brainwashing her. Maybe he'd convinced her to cut ties with her family? She hadn't updated her Facebook in a while, either.

A couple of days went by without any word when there was another picture. This time it was of wooden beams, a concrete wall, and stacked boxes. #*Woody*

""Is she moving in with him?"" My friend wondered.

Then another the same day. This time the picture was of the same mattress as before, but it was in a corner on the floor. Next to the mattress was an iron spike that had been lodged into the cement, and around it was latched a thick chain. The chain was pulled taut out of the picture. #*Woody*

This sort of out-of-the-ordinary situation, when reading it in this context, seems like a cause for alarm. At the time, it was definitely alarming, but didn't seem like enough to report to my friend's mom. People were still liking these photos. That last one had at least 300-something likes before my friend even showed me.

Over the next few days the pictures continued, but nothing stuck out until the one of a stove with a pan that had two eggs frying in it, and two mugs of coffee on the counter next to it. Behind the cups there was a bottle of chloroform. #*Woody*

We told Caroline's mom and then the police. There was a huge debacle and the cops telling them there was nothing they could do about it. These photos didn't prove a single thing. They were obscure, and more than likely a ploy for attention. Besides, the office said, 700 people *liked* it.

My friends family packed up a few bags and bought plane tickets. If anything, Caroline would have a big surprise when she got home that evening.

That day I kept up with Caroline's Instagram account. The final photo before I got a call from my friend was of two pairs of feet side-by-side. One pair was shackled at the ankles, the other in shiny brown loafers. The shackled feet were bare and pale and bruised, and the toenails were painted a hot pink. #*cozy* #*love* #*Woody*

The call that night was unsettling. My friend was tearful and told me that Caroline's apartment was unlocked when they got there. The inside was trashed and there was spoiling food in the garbage with flies everywhere and dishes piled. She said it was like Caroline hadn't been home in weeks.

Their family went to the police in NYC and filed a missing person's report a week ago. Their father got himself a hotel room and both my friend and her mom came back. I haven't seen either of them, and the whole family has been trying to deal with this privately, but all of Caroline's friends on Facebook have been leaving concerned messages, and everyday there's a new photo, with new likes and always signed #*Woody*.

yurglar,6,10,1r6zsn,23,"Under the Bed

I’m writing this because I simply cannot sleep and there’s something I really need to tell someone, and I find this reddit to be a good place to do so. It is something that is not what you’d consider in the domain of classical horror stories, like zombies or ghosts. It is not, because it was, and I’m afraid still is, real. 

It is so real that it happened 11 years ago, when I was only 7, on a cold morning of December. As you can see, not the night of 31st October. Just the placid, boring morning of 7th December. I was in bed, and I knew my parents were already out, they liked going on morning jogs together. It was a Sunday and my head was throbbing. I have frequent migraines and that 7th December migraine was particularly bad. So there I was, feeling shitty and thinking about lunch, when I moved and my bed creaked. The house was old, like proper old, and we had just moved in (in this regard that part of my life did sound like the beginning of a cliché horror story). I thought it was just temporary anyway, once dad left his job we would leave to California.

When I was a kid I had this habit of putting a pillow over my face when I had a migraine, normally one of those useless small pillows always hanging around. They were always cold, and the cold felt good on my forehead and cheeks. It might sound a bit stupid to you, but to me, it felt good for a few seconds. On 7th December I did this and suddenly, I could not remove the pillow.

I tried to remove it with all my strength, and whoever, whatever, was pushing down, gave in. It was more or less the strength of a skinny teenager. I started panicking, scared, my legs twisting and my heartbeat shooting through the roof. I didn’t even wonder what was happening. I managed to catch a breath and then it happened, all of a sudden. I heard the light switch of my room go out, and the blinds closing violently, and the pressure on the pillow suddenly increased. Twice, then tenfold. It was no longer the strength of a human being but something else. I felt my mind slowdown from the lack of oxygen and I stopped fighting. I felt a strange calm wash over me. Whatever was killing me was impossible to fight, it was like there was a ton of stone over that pillow. I saw a light, my vision going white and then tunneling, and I heard whispers. I was dying. I felt scared then. I put my hands over the pillow, but there was nothing there, and I only felt the hairs of my arms standing up. My hands were not smashed as I expected. My young brain could not make sense of it, but I remember 
being scared, really scared. That’s when I heard a bark.

My dog, Thor, had heard me twist and struggle in bed and had come, to my lucky rescue. The pressure immediately disappeared, the blinds opened and the light turned on and that’s when I felt it, sliding over my right arm, like a hand caressing it, but a dead hand, callous and cold hand, and I felt it, whatever it was, turning and hiding under the bed, like a snake hiding under a rock. Thor kept barking madly, teeth showing and ears back. He was a German shepherd, huge for the standards. Then he neared my bed, looked under my bed, growling and then stopped. He sniffed once, then twice, looked again under the bed, and then climbed on top of the bed and licked my face, where I laid, regaining my breath and control over my limbs, which had gone a bit numb. I remember hugging Thor and almost crying.

I told it to my parents but they did not believe me, they thought it was the migraines and started talking about a psychologist or psychiatrist and bad grades at school. I remember being angry with their reaction, but over time it faded. It took some time for me to sleep again and Thor always slept in my room, sometimes even with me, but there were never any more issues. I never even remembered it from time to time, it was just a scary, traumatic memory my brain just erased. For 11 years, I slept over that memory, over whatever was under my bed.

We moved out a month ago, after 11 years, to a new modern house in California, where my bed doesn’t even have space under it and I love it. My dad sold the house to this young couple who were his friends, who didn’t have much money, but loved the retro feeling of the house. Back then, I didn’t even remember that scary event 11 years ago.

That’s when, as I was laying on my new bed yesterday, I remembered, along with all my morning nightmare details 11 years ago, my dad complaining the other day at dinner table how John and Mary, the young couple, haven’t phoned or said anything about the house since they started living there.

I went to get Thor in my bedroom. I can’t stop thinking about it and I hope they are alright.

SwordOfCielmor,1,6,1qv4w6,22,"As a kid, I wasn't allowed any video games. My parents were firmly of the 'they'll rot your brain and make you a serial killer!' camp, and nothing could convince them otherwise. We had a computer, though, and I was allowed more or less unlimited internet use. I quickly became hooked on browser games-- you know the kind, amateur games made in Flash or Java. I'd scour various sites for them, quickly building a large collection of favorites.

I can't remember the name of the site I found Sword of Cielmor on. The main page had a light purple background and there were two columns with descriptions and thumbnails of the most popular games. Basically, it was every Flash game site ever. Most of the games were pretty generic-- there were Tetris and Snake clones, and a few platformers and rhythm games. My favorite section of the site, though, was its collection of pseudo-RPGs. Most were fairly simple and extremely short-- each game was one 'chapter,' and despite promises of updates, I never saw any series go higher than four of these chapters.

I'd played through all the games in that section and was about to move onto a new site when I checked on a whim to see if any new games had been added. I didn't really expect to find anything; updates were rare, but it was my lucky day-- three new games had been added. One was a puzzle game similar to Minesweeper, one was a trivia game with only twenty or so questions, and the last was Sword of Cielmor.

It was a fairly typical turn-based RPG set in a fantasy world. You could choose from several characters-- I can't remember all of them, but I do recall a knight, a mage, and a healer. I picked the knight, like I always did, and began my adventure to obtain the mythical Sword of Cielmor and rescue the princess, who had been kidnapped by an evil overlord who had previously usurped the throne.

My adventure started uneventfully. I traveled through a cave and then a labyrinth-like forest, killing various monsters before night fell. That was an interesting mechanic the game had-- after a certain amount of time passed, day would turn to night, and your character would pull out a tent and go to sleep. The screen would go black, and white text would give a recap of what you'd done that day. It was a neat feature, but a little annoying because the days weren't all that long, and I had no problem remembering what I'd done.

The following day, I emerged from the forest and began traveling across a field that was said to lead to my next location, a town. After killing a few more monsters, a soldier employed by the evil overlord appeared. It wasn't an especially difficult battle. The soldier was defeated, his sprite vanished, and I continued to go on my way until night fell.

This time, instead of the typical 'You made it through the forest/defeated ten monsters' text, the game began to tell me about the soldier I'd killed. Apparently he had two children, and a wife. He hadn't wanted to become a soldier, but there weren't many opportunities in the small village he'd come from. He was scared every day he was sent out to patrol, and he had no clue that the king was evil. In his last moments before I'd skewered him with my sword, he'd thought about how it had all been pointless-- that his children would grow up without a father-- that there would be no money to pay for food, or rent--

And then the text shifted to the wife and children, and how they would eventually be left on the streets. The mother would die first, of an unexplained sickness. It would come quickly for her, but the starvation of the children would be long, slow, drawn out-- their last moments would be spent wondering *why*--

There was a quick flicker, and I saw the sprite of the soldier, a few pixels of red on his chest representing blood, alongside a female sprite and two smaller ones flash across the screen before fading into nothingness.

And then, suddenly, it was day again, and I was back on the field.

I remember being disturbed, but not disturbed enough to stop playing. Honestly, but I was a little impressed. These games had never been known for their stirring stories or sense of realism, and the fact that the game's creator had gone the extra mile to make it a little more... well, for lack of a better word, meaningful, made me want to keep playing, even if I did think perhaps he'd laid it on a bit thick.

The game continued. I reached the town, stocked up on magical potions and equipment, and headed west, toward the castle where the princess (and the mythical Sword of Cielmor) was being held. On my way, I came across two more soldiers, and defeated both of them. When night fell once more, I was a bit apprehensive, but morbidly curious at what the game would have to tell me about their lives.

This time the game went into even more detail-- it's been years, but I still remember it vividly. It told me how one of the soldiers had cried when he realized he was dying, that he realized he'd accomplished nothing to be proud of in his life-- that he wouldn't be remembered at all. I remember reading that his father never forgave himself for being the one to push him to become a soldier, that for every day of the rest of his life he walked across the field his son had died on, wondering if there was an afterlife, wishing it had been him instead.

Once more, the image of the fallen soldiers flickered across the screen, but this time the graphics were slightly better-- not at all realistic, but less blocky and amateurish than the previous sprites.

By this point I didn't want to keep playing, but... well, I wasn't about to stop. I needed to know what would happen-- I couldn't look away. Several more days passed as my journey continued, and the stories of the soldiers, of the rogue bandits, of the mercenaries I killed grew longer and longer. I read a description of a daughter growing up without her father, and how one day she saw a man in a crowd that looked so much like him that for a moment--

She'd gone home and simply cried, wishing she could turn back time, wishing she had known in advance, wishing she could have changed things.

The graphics were getting better and better, but only during these sequences, only when I was learning about the people I'd killed, and their loved ones. I wasn't only seeing their corpses now. I was seeing quick glimpses of their lives before they died. I saw the soldier with his father, the father beaming with pride at his newly adult child. I saw the children who would later go hungry running through the back alleyways of a town, playing tag. I saw the daughter who would later long for her father taking him for granted, too busy thinking of her own future--

There were witches who'd spent their final moments in a numb state of disbelief that this was it, that it was over. There were warriors who prayed for the first time since they were young. And there were families left behind, or in some cases no one-- no one who would ever remember they'd even existed.

Their faces, which had originally been nothing but flesh colored pixels, were becoming more and more detailed. Rudimentary facial features appeared, and as the graphics improved, they became more and more lifelike. Each person had their own traits, quirks-- one mage had a slightly lopsided grin; a soldier had a mole just below his left eye that vanished when he smiled. And before they vanished into the darkness, it was always the same-- their eyes would widen slightly, and they'd realize what was about to happen. Then the screen would cut to their corpses, each time more real than the last, and a new day would begin.

I found the Sword of Cielmor. I rescued the princess. I completed the journey. 8-bit victory music played as the sprite of a princess kissed my hero's cheek and thanked him for his bravery. The music swelled to its peak, the screen faded to black, and the game ended-- or, at least I thought it did. As I moved the mouse over the back button, the game faded back in to the hero, sitting in a chair in an empty room, completely alone. The princess was nowhere to be seen. It was just the hero, the Sword of Cielmor at his feet, silent, unmoving. The music stopped, and after nearly a minute passed I was certain that the game had frozen.

But no, it was fading to the people I'd killed and their families one last time-- only this time it looked so real that I could have sworn I was looking at photographs of dismembered men and women. There was an image of a man bent over another, staring at his mutilated body, both faces blank and uncomprehending. The two children who would later starve to death sat side by side on the street, their bodies emaciated, the younger one confused while the older one tried her hardest to protect her little brother, clearly frightened herself. It all looked so real-- to this day I'm not sure if I was looking at actual photographs. I don't want to believe they were.

I closed the browser window and left the room. I went outside. I tried to forget what I'd seen. Over the next few days I managed to half convince myself that it had been a dream, or a hallucination, until finally I couldn't take it anymore and went back to the site. Nothing had changed. It was the same website with the same light purple background and the same two columns of games. But now there were only two new games instead of three-- the Minesweeper clone and the trivia game remained, but Sword of Cielmor was gone.

Over the years I've tried to find it again, but no one has ever heard of it. Maybe I did hallucinate it. But either way, I can't stop thinking about the people of the game-- and of the photographs. I keep trying to tell myself that it was someone with a sick sense of humor's idea of playing a joke. I keep trying to tell myself the the photographs were fake, or staged. I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't kill anyone. All I did was play a simple, poorly made browser game.

And yet... I still feel guilty.",Sword of Cielmor,28
Chenigin,7,9,1r6b7r,21,"When I was ten my parents divorced. Soon after I moved into an old house in Orange County CA with my mother and stepfather. This house had a nice floor plan but needed major work. With all the remodeling being done to the house it was not uncommon for my step father to walk around at night to check up on and see how the house was holding up. One night I was laying in bed when I heard heavy footsteps outside my bedroom window. My room was located at the side of the house. Me being young and naïve I automatically thought it was my step dad. I heard the footsteps walk into the garage and enter the house via the garage door. I knew this was the time to go to the restroom because well.. their was an adult and he could protect me from my fears of the dark. When I heard the footsteps walk past my door I slowly opened my door and called out my step fathers name. At the same time I stuck my head out my door and saw the back of a boot I never saw before turn the hallway corner. This made me reconsider how safe it was to go take a leak. I heard a sound in the kitchen.. the distinct sound of the drawers opening and a hand shuffling through its contents. After what seemed like an eternity I decided to call out to my stepfather again, this time slowly creeping out of my room so I can get to the corner of the hallway. As soon as I started to edge forward I heard the heavy footsteps make a b line straight for the front door.. I started to pick up my pace so I could get a good view of who it could be. When I got to where I could get a good view of the door I saw something I would never forget. The door slammed shut and the lock turn to the lock position. As if someone had the key and was locking it from the outside. By then my fight or flight instinct kicked in and I ran to the door to see if I could see who was in our house. When I opened the door I saw nothing... No sight of someone running away.. no evidence of anyone ever being there in the first place.. Just 10 year old me.. standing in the dark.. Suddenly the fight or flight instinct kicked in again.. but instead its the opposite instinct.. fuck! I'm ten.. I am by myself in the dark.. someone just broke into the house! I slammed the door shut and ran into my mothers room. My stepfather right away called the cops and propped a chair to the front door and the garage door so even if someone had the key they could not open it. The cops showed up and didn't find a single thing. No footprints nothing.. My mother turned on me and said it was just my childish imagination making up things.. I started to doubt myself after the years... Chucking it as what my mom said.. my youthful imagination.. I am 24 now.. I don't sleep walk nor have I ever. If it was a dream... I never had one like that ever since. If anyone has any ideas on what I might of experienced please.. I am all ears. I always wondered what other people would have to say about this. Glad to have found Reddit that's for sure. ",Still think about this all the time,30
sinbysilence,9,2,1r49de,21,"Okay. You have to believe me. And what I'm about to say is going to make you not believe me. But please, be patient with me.

You're not real. At least, the you who is reading this isn't real. You only exist because my mind tells you to exist. Regardless of how unbelievable that sounds, I know it to be true. You're helping me cope. You're helping my brain stay active.  And, I believe, to some degree, you're helping keep me alive.

Since there's no better place to start,  I'll just start at the beginning. Back before I knew you existed. Back when you had the possibility of being real.

Back when my normal life got catapulted into this current situation.  I lead a very mediocre life. Living paycheck to paycheck, small group of friends, and no one in my life worth falling in love with. I was on my way to work, just like every other day. Stopped to get coffee. Lit my cigarette as I left the gas station. I began my morning commute.  It was all very routine. Until the car pulled out in front of me.  I stood up on my brakes, but still hit him at an abrupt 45 miles an hour. I ran the red light.  My seatbelt burned my chest.  My head  was blasted by the air bag. My femur protested against the impact until it snapped. The pain was dizzying.  Disorienting. I dug for the phone that flew out of my hand. Mom was still  on the line, crying. She heard what had happened and was over an hour away. But her and dad where on their way.

Now this is what I believe may have happened next. I think I remember getting out of the car and being put on the stretcher. I remember the god awful pain of having my leg reset on the side of the road. That had to be real, right?  It hurt so badly. It was the most earth shattering pain I've ever felt. Once I got to the hospital I was drugged and put to sleep to prep for surgery.

I faded in and out all week. After four nights, I woke to a conversation with my mom. I woke up suddenly in the middle of the night and, considering the drugs in my system, I was very much alert. My mom snapped to attention when she felt me stir. I look at her as though she was a stranger. I'll never forget the confusion I felt as I asked her...""who are you? ""

""It's me, Em. It's mom.""

""Where am I?"" I cried, tugging at the IV on my hand. 

""You're in the hospital,  sweetie.  You were in an accident. ""

""Was it bad?"" I begged for an answer. ""Was it bad?"" I was more hysterical the second time.

I never got an answer. Even when I woke up the next morning she acted as though the conversation never took place. And here's why: I never woke up. Instead,  my brain started to build my new percieved reality. Looking back on it, I think that conversation we had was the last real one I had. Because the accident WAS bad. Because I am still suffering from it, to some extent.

Suffering may not be the best way to put it. Sure, the first two months were brutal. I had to relearn to walk. I had to have help getting in an out of the shower. I had headaches. I got dizzy and sick often. I couldn't work. But it had to seem real.

Now,  life is amazing. I've met the person who made me believe in soulmates. I'm back at work - they even transferred me closer to home and gave me a raise when I came back. Remember how I was the one who ran the red light?  The guy I hit doesn't want to sue me. My life couldn't be anymore perfect if I wrote it myself. Because I have wrote it myself. My brain has created a life to make everything seem normal. I would have never questioned it if it weren't for the other night when I caught a glimpse of reality.

""Nurse...nurse...I think she's waking!"" 

Mom?

Opening my eyes felt like I was fighting a week without sleep.

""Where am I?"" I mumbled.  I hurt. It made no sense.

""You're in the hospital,  baby. You were in an accident, but it's okay. You're going to be okay. I'm so glad to see your eyes.""

Accident? I don't remember anything in my recent history that would have landed me in the hospital. I've been overly precautious these past five months. I voiced my confusion out loud.   ""What accident? I've not been in an accident since June."" 

I saw mom's face fall from optimism to sadness. I asked again, ""what accident?  Was it bad?"" I was scared. Scared because I didn't remember an accident. Scared because of how badly I hurt and didn't know why.

""Sweetie, you've been here since June.""

And then I understood. Why she was so happy to see my eyes. They had been shut since June. 

""Is it bad?"" But before she had a chance to answer, I was drifting again. And the next thing I knew,  I woke up in my bed with my boyfriend at my side.

Since that night, I occasionally catch bursts of their conversation inside my hospital room. Remember how I said I think you're helping to stay alive? 

""She's showing good brain activity. That's a good thing. Unfortunately,  it was a nasty bump to her head. But we've seen people wake up from comas after months, years even. So long as her brain remains healthy, there's no reason not to hope for the best.""

Sounds optimistic,  right? So why am I scared?

I've built an amazing life inside my head. I'm afraid I'll have to leave it. I'm afraid that I may soon wake up.

theunlockeddoor,2,7,1r1j47,22,"I work at a public library and I really need to write about this.  Yeah, boring. Librarians=Blah. I know.  This is probably going to be tl:dr and dull.  I know I'm super-new to reddit, but I really need to get this out of my system and I'd feel weird posting about this anywhere else.  So, mock me for my noobness, but I really need to talk.

And aside from 'sexy librarian' sterotypes, you ought to know that the people checking books out from behind the desk have to deal with all sorts of people.  People checking out books about livestock and winking and grinning at you too much, and women, teary-eyed, avoiding your gaze, checking out books about abuse or divorce.  We're sort of like bartenders, but without the convenience of bouncers.  So, when I tell you that meeting this one particular guy kept me up at night, you ought to know that it's not because I have a simple, dusty job. 

This is a story about  person I met through my job.  It's also a story told to me by that person.  

When I came in to work one morning my boss was wandering around the workroom looking disgusted.  She kept going between the bathroom and her desk- trying to work but getting nauseous every so often.  Apparently, when she'd rolled up in the parking lot that morning, she'd found something on the pavement.

A wet set of dentures.

We all laughed at how weird that was, and set the things gingerly on a pad of paper towels in the backroom.  No way were we putting a pair of raw dentures in the lost and found tub.  We forgot about them before lunch.

Later that day, though, this guy came in.  I ended up knowing him as ""Irma's Nephew"".

He limped in and asked if we had any books about dentistry.  I told him I didn't know where to find them off the top of my head and proceeded to do a search on the computer.  As I typed things in and scanned our holdings, he kept staring at me.  His eyes seemed too large and white, popping out against his skin.  He kept chewing his lips and the sides of his cheeks.  It was so fierce, so intense and obsessive, it looked painful.

Then he said: ""Teeth.  C'mon, gimme anything about teeth.  How they grow....""  And trailed off.

I was rattled but I managed to scribble a number down on a scrap of paper and gesture towards the nonfiction section.  He hobbled off.

Twenty minutes or so later, it was the top of the hour, and my turn to do a ""walkabout"".  ""Walkabouts"" are a thing our library system made up to make sure nobody is being harassed or molested out in the stacks.  We're supposed to check all the blind spots in the building every half hour.

So, I was doing my walkabout when I spotted Irma's Nephew sitting on the floor between two rows of books.  He glanced up at me, stood, and as I was moving away, caught me.  His hand on my wrist made me nervous, but I looked back at the circ desk and saw Vikki watching us like a hawk.  Somehow this made me brave.  He told me he needed my help, that these books weren't helping.  So I asked him what else I might look up for him.

""No,"" he said, ""I need to talk to you, to someone, to someone, to anyone.  My aunt, she...""  And he trailed off, eyes bugging.

Sadly, money doesn't reach super-far in the library world, and I hadn't been trained on how to properly treat a mentally ill patron.  As a fail safe, I went with gentleness, since he had a hard grip on my wrist.

So, I asked him to talk to me (looking back over my shoulder at Vikki).

This is the best version I can write of the garbled story he told me.  I could just say: ""And then he told me a spooky story"", but that wouldn't explain why I'm jumpy. I apologize that this is long, but I'm trying to get this out in an accurate way.

""I’ve got an Aunt, named Irma, and she pretty much raised me.  She’s like my mother, but she’s been gettin’ on, gettin' on, you know, and recently she’s been forgetting things.  I need these books for her.  She’s got a problem.  A real….. strange thing goin’ on.
	
“Last summer she got all her teeth pulled.  Got dentures instead.  And she hated them, said they always felt funny in her mouth, and I TOLD HER! we’d go get them refit, recast, but she’d still hate them.  She’d just spit them right out onto the carpet and glare at me with her mouth-skin all sunk-in and puckered up.  I’m the only one of the family that visited her anymore.  So that meant she blamed me.  I was the only one around to be hateful to.  Fuck.

""In June, she started doin’ this thing where she’d say she lost her dentures.  Whenever I went over to see her, she’d ‘lost’ them and I’d scold her because dentures are damn expensive.  Pardon me.  But she’d say it’s no problem and grin big.  I’d look all over- turn the house upside down, and not be able to find them.  She’d say “They’ll turn up in no-time” and wave her hand at me like this.  

""The weird thing is that they would.  I’d come over again and she’d have them back in.  Clack them at me and laugh.  Everytime.  Clack, clack, clack.  And laugh.  Clack, clack.
	
""She, uh, she just kept losing them.  I tried talking to her neighbor down the stairs, Lucy, to try and help her out.  Lucy is a nice woman and said she’d check on her when she got the chance.  And she did good.  When I hadn’t been able to visit in a few days, I’d get a text or call from Lucy lettin’ me know everything’s alright with Miss Irma.  
	“Only I got into a car wreck.  Was laid up in the hospital doped out of my brain on pain killers for who-knows-how-long.  Doctor said I’d broken my thigh-bone.  I didn’t see Miss Irma for a long time.  I think I got a call from Lucy at some point but it’s a foggy.  I remember answering and Lucy just murmuring, murmuring something I couldn’t understand.  It must have been the drugs.  It must have been.

So, eventually, I’m better, and I go over there.  I try knocking on Miss Irma’s door.  She never gave me a key, but she always bustled up and let me in.  I knocked and knocked and she didn’t come, so I got nervous, you know?  I went over to Lucy’s then, to see if she had a back-up key, or could call the building manager.  But I when I knock on her door it just kinda…whoosh…opens.
	
I call her name, but nothin’.  So of course I go in, cuz maybe they both in trouble.  But Lucy is nowhere.  Her apartment is just… empty.  Except, just as I’m leaving, I see something pink on the floor.
	
{Here, the guy paused, licking his lips again.  It seemed to me he was winding up his courage, or working past something particularly horrible.}

""It was teeth, ma’am.  Dentures.  A top and a bottom, both.  The top was kinda falling off the bottom, was at an angle.  Like they’d just been dropped and left.  
	
“I knew Lucy didn’t wear dentures, so this scared me a lot, because Miss Irma might be wandering around lost with her dementia.  She’d started forgetting my name.  She could be anywhere, doing anything if she was spitting her teeth out again.
	
“So I run.  Run and find the janitor that sometimes cleaned up the stairwells and he looks at me like I’m crazy.  He says “I thought your gramma moved out last month.” I say “No, sir, you are mistaken.  She can’t have gone nowhere.”  And he says “Well, I ain’t seen you nor her in that time.”  And I argue with him but eventually he comes with me and unlocks the door.   
	
“Inside Miss Irma’s the tv was on, but, she wasn’t in her chair where she’d sit for hours and watch tv.  I mean, she’d sat there so much it had left an impression, her shape.  But that wasn’t all she left.  She also left her teeth. {He was giggling a bit hysterically at this point}
	
“No, not the ones in Lucy’s place.  These were different.  These were more.  These were MORE.  All over.  Pairs and pairs of false teeth were lying all over Miss Irma’s apartment.  They were on bookshelves and on the kitchen table.  The biggest pile was around her chair.  I was confused at first.  There was no way she could have collected all these teeth by herself.  I certainly only bought her the two pairs.  She didn’t have no friends to bring her sets of teeth, teeth, teeth, teeth, teeth.
  
""And they were different, too.  As in, some were little.  Like, tiny white baby teeth, just little gappy chips.  And others were big and wide and long.  And some of the sets, I don’t know how they could fit in a person’s mouth.  they were full of fangs and tusks and.

“And it makes no sense.  I can only come up with one idea.  She was on her own for a month, except for Lucy.  I know Lucy didn’t bring her all those teeth.  The only thing I can think is that she was growing them back herself.  That, every time she had ‘lost’ and found her dentures before, she’d just thrown them away and grown a new pair in her mouth.  Then that set would fall out and she’d grow more.  And then they must have started growing strange in her mouth.  And she's gone off somewhere wandering wandering, I can't find her. I don't..  I need help for her.""

I peeled his hand off and somehow got out of there.  I went back and handed him some paper I think had a number for psychiatric help on it.  Really, I went back to the staff bathroom and sat against the wall for a while, breathing and feeling really strange in my stomach.

When I left work, I had to pass the set of dentures my boss found in the parking lot that morning.  I found myself staring at them.

thelesone,13,20,1qs29p,22,"I am dating a wonderful woman with an ex, who is...crazy? He has been known to do things out of the ordinary and it really bugs me. Let me start from the beginning though (female here).

I did not really know about this ex, let's call him Brad. All my girlfriend Sam told me was that he had been to jail for sexual assault and he had attempted to rape her when they were together. She exused this behavior with saying he had a fucked up childhood. She said his parents made him wear diapers until he was 14 and that he got beat a lot and encouraged to steal. By the time he was 17 he got kicked out of his house and was living on the streets. Apparently he also has some disability mentally which doesn' fucking surprise me, the creeper. 

I met him for the first time oer two years ago. He was walking around town and it was pretty late, my girl and I were coming back from the store when we saw him. He ran up, and he called her ""sister"" and started talking about his sex life...it was weird, he didn't aknowledge I was there for much of his talking, until about 5 minutes in when he looke at me and just smiled this bone chilling smile. I was frozen to the spot, after he smiled at me he said my name (which at this point I hadn't told him...and Sam says she hadn't either) I just looked at him and was like... ""What?"" He just smiled at me, and than walked past us, down the fucking street. I just stood there creeped the fuck out. He's really tall and bigger than me (as a 100lb girl) so...I was freaked out, especially knowing his history. 

After that we didn't run into him a lot. I kinda forgot about it and was concerned with other things... But one day at the bus station by myself (No car) I was waiting for the bus when suddenly someone grabbed me from behind and picked me up off the bench. I went into panic mode and screamed loudly, no one fucking cared who was waiting... and it was dark out so of course I'm fucking scared. Suddenly the arms let me go and I turn around to see Brad smiling down at me and he says, ""Hey Beck..what's up?"" as if he hadn't just grabbed me from behind. I didn't want to be rude, but I did't want to talk to him so I just tried to say mundane things. 

A little while later, like months later we found out he was actually with out  home and he calle Sam sobbing to her, he needed money. He needed it because he had no food. I remember telling her I didn't want him in our house, but she let him in ""He has a disability, he doesn't know any better."" Fuck that shit, it's not our problem. 

I hate to sound so heartless but he was creepy...he had this aura (and I know how fucking fake this sounds, cheesy too an aura...) and I just hated this man. However Sam let him in and made him a sandwich. He watched me as he hate, he ate so gross...

But he ended up leaving after Sam said he couldn't stay, because of her parents who live on the other side of the apartment. We live in a duplex. He said that was fine and left. I remember he said good bye to me and like tried to hug me but I ducked and Sam told him to back off politely. So I woke up as I always do at 4 in the morning and went pee. The bathroom door was open because we are the only ones on that side and I didn't think to close it being so groggy. I didn't notice anything weird when I went pee, and went back up to bed. Sam woke up at 8 to go get some breakfast, and... BRAD WAS ON THE FUCKING KITCHEN FLOOR SLEEPING. 

I was so pissed, I remember standing there as Sam asked, ""When did you come in?""

""Last night a little before 4."" Brad answered, he looked at me when he said that with this sick grin.... I went pee at four...and he snuck in at four...I don't know to this day what he saw, but his grin tells me that the little fucker saw me take a piss.

""You can't do that."" Sam lectured him and he did leave. 

""I think he watched me pee this morning."" I said to Sam, she said that I was overreacting. She always does. Well later that day, I was getting ready to leave my room when I opened the door and there he was. Just standing there. I finally flipped out, I screamed at him and he just turned and walked away. Sam came home and I told her, she called him and told him to stay the fuck away from our house. 

That was months ago. I know he went back to jail for harrassing a girl again. He got out pretty damn quick though according to he rumors. The thing is, latey at night I've been seeing a figure in my street. Like walking by slowly... I bet it's nothing because we live across from a park and in a college town. But when I go to check the doors at night, it's been unlocked a few times...

I know this isn't that scary but Brad is creepy...and I

BiohazardTyrant,3,6,1r4rao,22,"So to begin, I was eleven years old I believe...

My father had brought me to a friend of his' house. Or rather farm.

I was excited because I had befriended the son of my fathers friend, for stories sake I will call him James. James had a older brother who was a year and a half older, so I was eleven, James was twelve and his brother thirteen. We had all played around the barn and fields plenty of times before. This time though it was a celebration of some sort, I wish I could remember why but anyway, they had been in this house on this farm for about half a year. Tonight was the big party, as in the most vivid thing I remember about that night. The cut off pigs head. Literally just cut right off, and sitting on a support beam about shoulder high to the adults. The body was dangling from a chain for a while, until they skewered it onto a metal pole and roasted it whole over a fire.

I really wish I could remember why they were doing that but sadly I cannot. In any case, me James and his brother were just running around like we always did like idiots. They had all of the farm as a playground and plenty of space to play. We began by walking over to the stalls where they kept the horses and cattle. The sheds were HUGE, and seemed to be endless to a younger kid as myself. 

After about a half an hour of walking through corridors left and right in the dark we started hearing noises, but not normal ones... Like chains being hit on metal and slammed into the ground, then grunts. We all took off running following James' brother who quickly let out out to the closest exit. None of us knew what the sounds were because of the fact the farm had been out of commission for about thirty years. Nothing alive should have been in there. 

We quickly made out way back to the farm house, the big one where all the adults were partying and tried to talk to them about it but of course they had all had a drink or three and ignored us laughing it off as childish imagination. 

For some reason. Some stupid god forsaken reason, James said we should go back out and just play in the field where there was a little light away from the adults and we listened. Once the three of us were out there it turned into a ""I dare you to go out in the field"" game.

We each took turns going farther and farther out into the night. Finally we all ended up ignoring the occurrences from earlier and started playing hide and seek. Bad idea. Very bad.

James and I were hiding in the tall grass near the side end of the barn and his brother came running out faster than I have ever seen anyone run, screaming bloody murder, to get away as fast as we could, get to the adults! James and I ran to him, and stopped dead in our tracks, quickly seeing why he had been fleeing. 

There we were, James, his brother and I all standing still, like sacks of meat staring to the treeline where we saw it. There were three if I remember correctly faces. All white and elongated, just weirdly shaped about six feet off the ground, and then came the true horror, the glint off the blades they were holding. 

We all ran.

Faster and faster we ran.

I turned around two times and I regret it to this day for the fact they were even closer than I thought blades outstretched trying to mince us up and drag us back into those hellish woods. 

We finally made it to the adults. The only thing I remember after that was that damn pig head, cut off, and just sitting there, I could see the spine, and every last vein... we tried telling the adults but they just laughed. None of us left the main barn after that for the rest of night.




About a week later my friend Chris came over, and had the worst part to share with me. He had been having these night terrors of these creatures tearing at him and chasing him through his own new home.

Then he told me his family had left the farm, and moved to the city.

Then he told me why. He was attacked.

Then he showed me, and lifted his shirt up, showing me a scar which I know he did not have before because we used to swim together all the time. He never had a mark there a week before. But now, across his stomach he had a fully healed scar of about ten inches going from left to right, like he had been gutted. But the scariest fact like I said was that it had not been there one night, then he woke up with that kind of scar. 

His family moved because of that, that day. And never returned to that farm.

I have long since lost touch with him, he became very paranoid after that and I just cant forget that.

Figured I would share it with the community, I do hope if any of you take anything away from this, if you see a creature, with a white face, long arms, and a huge blade by a treeline. Run, just run. And try to forget about it.","A tale of a Farm, and three young kids.",28
buffalowing1,6,7,1r337b,22,"I probably can't tell a great story but I can tell you what I saw last fall. I was outside admiring my garden that runs along the side of the house. I froze as soon as I looked towards the front of the house. I saw something short, maybe 2-3 feet walking on two legs. It was walking in the direction of my porch or front of the house. I thought it was kinda strange since I live out in the suburbs and something like this would easily be noticed by any of my neighbors. The funny part is we both made eye contact, it noticed that I was looking straight at it. As soon as it did it ran away, and I ran after it. When I turned the corner there was nothing. I ran around the whole house just in case it was running circles around my house. Nada. So yeah I saw that once. No biggie since I havent seen it again or it hasnt messed with my garden.

DeeDee304,3,13,1qx357,21,"I met Danny in my senior year of college. When I saw him at a crowded, boring party, it was like a flash went off in my head.  He noticed me staring, and the most beautiful smile lit his face, and he came across the room…… In that moment, was as if everyone else disappeared. “I think I know you….”, we both said in unison, then laughed in embarrassment. He took my hand and we left the noisy party without another word.  We spent the night sitting on a park bench talking, huddled together against the October chill. By morning we were in love, and by the next evening we were lovers. 
  
The year that followed was the most wonderful time of my life. The tired old city that I had lived in for almost four years became magical with Danny by my side. We played in the autumn leaves and sledded down snowy hills like children. We wandered the city in a daze of happiness, found out of the way restaurants and odd little shops where we fed each other and bought strange and silly gifts, and we became inseparable. By spring semester, we were living together, and when Danny proposed to me on the park bench where we had fallen in love, my heart leapt with joy. We married the day after graduation, and two days after that Danny shipped out to begin his military training. I stood beside his mom and cried at his graduation from Officer Candidate School; he looked so handsome and brave accepting his commission. 
  
We had it all planned; he would do his four years in the military and I would find a job in a library somewhere. When he got out, he would look for a job in his field and we would buy a little house in the suburbs. We would have a girl with her daddy’s eyes and a boy with his mama’s smile. We would get a dog and name it Rex. We would join the PTO and coach soccer, and make love every day.  All we had to do is wait, and our beautiful life together would unfold. For now, I would stay in our old apartment until his tour of duty in Afghanistan was up, then follow him to whatever base he was to be stationed at.

But it didn’t work out that way. They said that they sent Danny home early.  I couldn’t quite understand what they were saying through the buzzing, and they wouldn’t let me talk to him. His mom and dad came to get me, and they showed me a box covered in a flag and told me it was him. I am not sure why they did that. They were always so nice before.  They stayed until I screamed at them and made them leave.

I never did get the job in a library. Instead I spend my time cataloging dusty books for a museum and waiting for Danny to call. I think I found a way to help him. I found a book that wasn’t in the list. It is black and made of a strange leather. I have been following the directions for months now, and I sometimes hear him talking to me at night. His voice is strange, but it is him. I did not like some of the things I had to do; sacrificing the strays and the pigeons I used to feed made me cry more than once, and at first I wasn’t sure that I could do it. But tonight was the last time. I came home and washed the blood off and put on Danny’s favorite dress. My nails are painted and I am wearing the perfume he bought me for Valentines Day. It is very late but I know he is coming. My love, I have waited so long for you. I think I hear him at the door…...

BensonHedges1,2,11,1r60t4,19,"I'm writing this from my phone, I needed to get out of the house. I'm sitting at Panera Bread and my boyfriend thinks I'm nuts. In the time I posted my last update to now, Things got worse.

 It was so bizarre - my boyfriend got home around 5pm yesterday and went to take a nap. He worked a detail after his shift, so I was home alone for the most part. I did my best to stay away from the room. My cat just growled.  
There was a good hour of him sitting at the doorway...growling. For anyone that knows him, he's has the most amazing temperment...he never hisses or growls. The entire time my boyfriend was in the room napping, NOTHING. He thinks I'm crazy because I begged him not to sleep in that room...he went to work at 10pm last night, and I slept on the couch. Remember that wind? I have no fucking clue what it was, but I was on a conference call and heard a small rumble from the room. I ignored. Apparently whatever is happening - ignoring makes it worse. A couple minutes later, another rumble, and a smell. I lied when I said the worst smell ever was burnt coffee. This smell was like death. Not the death that a cat drags in by the tail. And then another rumble. As soon as my call was over, I rushed into the room, febreeze in hand. I can't explain it exactly, but as I opened the door to the bedroom, all of that windows made a loud thud like they were closing, but they were open. I sure as hell didn't open them. Is it even possible for them to thud OPEN? What the hell. Against my better judgment I went into the room. It's day time, what can happen, right? There was a stain on the floor - just a big dark stain... I don't want to say blood because it's not mine and fuck this supernatural shit. It got bigger though, like water expanding. I could see it growing, but I couldn't tell if my mind was playing tricks on me. 
I ran.
Fucking ran.

What the hell is my cat seeing? I wonder if this is just my mind playing tricks on me. 

I've had some trouble posting this today - but I haven't been home, and I'm returning tonight. My intention is to sleep in that room. I want to know what's going on, and why it's getting so cold. I'm getting the chills thinking about the chills.

gabsgirl,11,5,1qtkjz,21,"I was walking around at 3am one morning, because I do that type of thing... I was walking and listening to music on my mp3 player and zoned out. I had just been dumped by my girl and was feeling like shit. But I was finally on the street, heading home. 

I was walking and felt strange, a sense of pure fucking dread entered my stomach and made me stop dead in my tracks, directly under a street light. The headphones were still in my ear, and the music was blasting, but it seemed like complete silence. The street I live on is off of Main street and not a lot of traffic goes on it during the day, it's a little hidden. I was standing by the bridge on this street. If I took my headphones out I might have had a warning. 

I felt a tap on my shoulder, I turned around to see this girl who looked about my age (I was 17 at the time) and she was looking down. She had light brown hair and was a little taller than me. She wore a red hoodie and a pair of blue jeans, so it was nothing out of the ordinary, and I instantly felt a little calmer, even though the dread still settled in my stomach. She was dressed like me, not identical, but like me. So I figured maybe someone had scared her or something, with the way she was looking down, with her hands in her pockets. 

""Can I come home with you? I need to use the phone and call my mother. She needs to know where I am..."" that's what she said to me, and her voice was strong, and clear. It was weird because she said she needed to use the phone, and didn't have one of her own.

""You don't have a cell phone?"" I asked, she shook her head and said it didn't hold a charge very well and she had discovered it was dead. ""I can't really let you in my house. My dad is sleeping and I kind of sleep in the living room right now."" I said to her. 

This is when I freaked the fuck out, she looked up at me and I couldn't even see her eyes. It was just black, black pupils. I stood there frozen, eyes locked with hers, and finally I turned to run. I hate to say it but I just ran. I tried to run all the way home but suddenly I felt something hit me on the side of my head, and it stunned me and the person was able to pull me to the ground. The weight on me wasn't that heavy, and the hands were grabbing at my pockets. I screamed at the top of my lungs and jumped up, I turned to see a shorter man staring at me, with normal eyes. I just stood there stunned and than I screamed, ""GET OUT OF HERE!"" he turned and ran and I followed him, because I could still see the girl in the distance. He ran by her with me screaming at her to run and still chasing the man and she jumped out of the way with a terrified screech at the top of her lungs.

I ran to her, thinking nothing of the black eyes or the feeling of dread and helped her up, she had fallen. She looked at me and her eyes were normal... She looked a little dazed and said, ""I need to go."" It was still in a clear, and somewhat angry voice. I let her go. 

""Are you okay?"" I asked, I started to help brush her off, but still felt fearful. She looked at me and her eyes looked black again. I instantly let go of her and stepped back.

""Thanks for the help, I need to go now."" she said in that clear, and scary tone. I backed up a little more and felt fear over take me but the thing is she wasn't even looking at me now. ""We'll remember this."" is all she said. She walked away and I just stood there stupidly and watched her fucking leave. 

I walked back home that night, my head reeling. I don't know what happened to the man who had tackled me, and I never saw that girl again. I did do some research though and found that there is something called ""black eyed children"" the only thing that doesn't match up is this girl's eyes went from normal to black it looked like. I had just hit my head so maybe I was seeing things. She did ask to come to my house, but the feeling of dread was a little more calm after that dude tried to mug me. I don't know what happened that night.

Sometimes I look outside at night and see children walking down the street, which is odd for this time of night and year... Sometimes they look at the house and I have to reassure myself I didn't see black eyes... But I don't feel dread so that's a good thing? I don't know, maybe they just watch, maybe I'll let them in if they knock..and they are those black eyed children. The girl didn't attack me or anything. She just walked away. 



",I have no idea what this was.,26
cmd102,4,3,1r2xzg,20," unexplainable experiences are not completely abnormal for me. Every house or apartment that I've lived in, I've seen or heard something that would make a lot of people hide under a blanket or leave the house all together. The man at my window was one story of mine that never fails to make whoever I tell shudder, so I figured I'd share it here.

It began when I was 7 or 8 years old. We lived in an older house, but not one that would instantly stand out as ""creepy"" or ""unusual"". We didn't live in the middle of nowhere, but rather on a street lined with houses on both sides of the road. It was a fairly quiet neighborhood, the kind where the rare car that came down the street would often break up a game of football or hockey that was being played by the kids that inhabited almost every house. It wasn't perfect, but it was great. I was a very happy child. 

One night, I was plagued by a very odd, yet equally terrifying nightmare. I dreamt that I was in my bed, in the room that I shared with my older sister. I sat up and looked out of the window that was next to my bed, which sat in the one corner of my bedroom flush against the wall. The window overlooked the back yard, and in that yard stood a man. He wore a long black coat, a wide-brimmed black hat that hid his face from me, and a black suit. On his shoulder, there sat a very large black bird with red eyes. I stared at him for what seemed like forever, before he looked up at my window. The only features of his face that I could see were his eyes, which were a deep red, just like the bird's. Just as he made eye contact with me, the bird left his shoulder and flew straight at my window. When the bird got to the point where it would have inevitably smashed through the window and probably eaten me, I woke up. I was on my side, facing my sister's bed that was situated in the exact same position as mine, but on the opposite side of the room. I stared at her as she slept soundly, terrified and unable to go back to sleep. I decided that the only way I would get any rest was by looking out my window and proving to myself that the man wasn't really there, so I rolled over and sat up. My curtains were already pulled to the sides of the window, since my bedroom was on the second floor of a house in a decent neighborhood,  we didn't really worry about anyone trying to peep on my sister and me. The second I looked at the window, he was there. Even though he was impossibly directly outside my window,  close enough that he should have left fog with his breath, I still couldn't see any features of the man's face except his blood red eyes. I did what many children would do, I laid back down and threw my blankets over my head. I eventually fell back asleep, despite being scared out of my mind.

The man visited me several times a month for several years after that, always just staring at me through my window during the darkest parts of the night. When my sister moved out, I started sleeping in her bed,  across the room and away from the window. I didn't see the man anymore. 

One day, I was cleaning my room in preparation for my friend to sleep over that night. I knelt on my old bed, still there for when we had guests,  to clean the window. I pulled the curtain aside (as a teenager now, I valued my privacy), and saw a handprint on the glass. It was bigger than my own, but I didn't think anything of it. I had assumed one of my friends had left it there. I sprayed the cleaner and wiped it away with the paper towel, but the handprint remained. A little grossed out, I went over it again, a little harder to scrub the print away. It was still there. That was when I realized that, despite not seeing him anymore, I still received visits from the man with the red eyes. The hand print was on the outside of the window.",the man at my window,23
quietgrl,5,6,1qvoaz,18,"I have been experiencing some strange things for a while, including some kind of “phantom” that haunted my shower. I'm happy to report that I haven't been awaken by the sounds of running water or a man whistling in the bathroom, the past few nights. Maybe I was just imagining it, or dreaming it, like my friends and family have been suggesting.

However, I get this deep anxious feeling in the pit of my stomach that whatever is happening to me,  it's not really over and only escalating. It feels like things are just getting started, in some kind of twisted cosmic joke, set at my expense. Ever since my last post, I had this feeling that the other shoe was about to fall, and my instincts seem to be right...

Last night, I was leaving from my job at the local shopping center and heading for my car in the parking lot, when I noticed a man standing by another vehicle two rows away. It's not uncommon to see a few late-night shoppers around this time, heading home with their last minute items, but something about this guy was “off”. 

He was kind of attractive, tall with bronze skin and long dark curly hair, not overly thin nor tall. Honestly, I wouldn't have noticed him if he was within a crowd. but the thing that stood out about him was the smile that he gave me. His initial response to my eye contact with him was that of a little confusion, but then he smiled very brightly, a lot satisfied that I had noticed him standing there.

It would have been an innocent kind of situation, except his smiled seemed a lot creepy and a bit unnatural. The corners of his lips seemed to stretch a little too wide than it should for a human smile, his teeth were a lot too white and bright under the dull lighting of the street lamp nearby. His huge brown eyes were unblinking, still and lifeless, and it reminded me of the eyes of a dead fish within a market's display. He said nothing to me at all, just stared and smiled.

I didn't want to be rude, so I nodded his way in acknowledgment of his smile, and then quickly got into my car. I didn't make eye contact with him again, quickly started my car, sped out of the parking lot and on my way home. Somehow, the whole encounter caused me to feel frighten, and I wondered if I was just losing my mind or becoming paranoid.

While driving and switching to the local music station, my heart began to slowly return back to its normal pace. I had laughed at myself for being so jittery lately and vowed to cut back on my coffee intake from now on.

After ten minutes of driving, I pulled my car into the driveway of the house, which I am currently staying with my sister and mutual friend. I had a few bags within the trunk, items that I had bought at the shopping center, on my lunch break. It wasn't anything special, just a few new towels and a couple of boxes of cereal. Besides the freaky unexplained happenings, I pretty much live a boring and uneventful life.

I grabbed the two small bags from the trunk of my car, slammed it shut, then took a moment to glance towards the house across from the one I'm staying. I was hoping to get a glimpse of the handsome neighbor who I sometimes speak with, his name is Charlie. He wasn't on his front deck, as he sometimes was, and I could see no lights within the windows of his home. Maybe Charlie was still at work or possibly asleep? I would have to wait until some other time to chat with him.

As I was having this usual and mundane thought, I felt as if something was watching me from behind. I have a hard time explaining this feeling well, so please be patient with me, but it was like I felt some kind of presence or heat behind me. It was like I could feel a breath on the back of my neck or feel someone moving behind me, although my rational mind was pointing out the fact that I didn't hear footsteps on pavement. 

I turned around and gave a startled yelp, as I saw the same man from the parking lot, standing a few steps away from me. He was staring and smiling at me.

I gulped in a quick and shallow breath, regaining my composure, and replied to him lightly, “I'm sorry... you scared me, I didn't hear you walking up behind me.” The man didn't say anything, didn't blink, didn't seem to breath. He just stood there staring and smiling at me. I felt a lot uncomfortable and uneasy about this, as the air around us seemed to be a lot too still, as if we were standing within some kind of unseen bubble that locked the rest of the world out.

“Sir,” I said, trying my best to keep my voice from wavering, “May I help you? Is there something that you want?” The man didn't reply, standing there like an unmoving mannequin, staring and smiling. “Do you live here?” I asked, trying to get some kind of human response, “In this neighborhood, I mean? Are you lost?” He said nothing, his cold and lifeless dead eyes locked into a stare that seemed to be looking straight through me.  And his smile...it was stretched too far for it to be real, it almost looked like some kind of creepy Halloween mask. 

My skin crawled and I gave up on being polite. I turned without another word and promptly sprinted towards the door of my house. It's a good thing that my sister never feels the need to lock the doors in this part of town, because I didn't have to fumble with the keys in the door, as if I was within some kind of bad horror movie. I simply pushed open the door and ran inside quickly, slamming the door behind me. Once I was on the other side of the door, I did lock it, dropping my bags on the first stair of the short staircase that lead to the living room above.

I don't know why, but curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to take a look through the side window of the door. Cold... dead.... and fish-like brown eyes stared back at me. That unnatural smile stretched even more in a silent chuckle, as the man pressed his face just inches away from the glass! I screamed and fell backwards, falling on my backside with an audible thump on the floor. 

My sister overhead and came running, “What happened?” “There's a creepy man outside!” I shrieked, scrambling away from the window, “He followed me from the parking lot! He's out there and peering into the window!” My sister rushed to take a look and I reached up, tugging at her shirt sleeve, “No! Don't do that! Just call the police!” However, she ignored me and looked out there anyway. After a short pause, she smirked, “There's no one out there.”

I couldn't believe it, as I scrambled on all fours towards the window, looking out to find that the man wasn't there anymore. “But...” my voice wavered, as I shook uncontrollably, “He was there... he was right there in the window. I saw him! I'm not crazy and I'm not making it up!” “Maybe he left,” she shrugged, her tone unconvinced, “Maybe he heard us screaming inside and decided to leave before we called the cops.” “Maybe...” I said, unable to stop myself from staring out into the empty pathway for a while.

I don't know who that man was or what he wanted. I'm very scared that he may return and what he may do to me. I will no longer take night shifts at work, if I can help it. And if I have to, I will ask my sister to come drive me home from work, just in case the man with the creepy smile does return. I will also make sure that the doors and windows of the house are locked, before I sleep at night. Maybe I am going crazy...",The Man With The Creepy Smile,24
meltedroad,3,14,1qssb7,17,"This happened well over a decade ago, when I was still in junior high.  My family had moved into a new neighborhood just north of the city.  My parents chose that bungalow primarily because of the large lot.  Before we moved into the house, I recall my parents making remarks about how they wanted my brother and I to be able to have a proper backyard.

We moved in on the first of September, I was very excited about the move.  Since I could remember, my brother and I always shared a bedroom, with the new house, we would finally each get our own space.  My parents chose early September to move so the academics of my brother and I wouldn't be affected - especially for my brother as he was just entering high school.  

At first it was great, our backyard was large enough for me to practice my pitching for the upcoming little league season, and my brother and I finally got along well.  However, not long after that, I started feeling very uneasy about the house.  I would hear noises and creaks.  When I first expressed my feelings, my parents assured me that there was nothing wrong with the house, that it was just the house settling, and that I had simply been watching too many scary movies.  The kid in me though, would not believe my parents and knew something was not right. 

My parents and brother's bedroom were on one side of the hallway; my room, a converted den, was located on the other side.  I felt alone being on the other side of the house by myself, and slept in my brother's room the week after telling my parents about the noises.  My brother was annoyed, but accepted me into his room.  After that week though, I moved back into my room, and everything was fine again.  Until one night in October when I was woken up by footsteps, I could hear the old hardwood floor creaking as the footsteps got closer to my room before finally stopping.  I bolted sitting up and stared at the crack under my door.  I looked at that door for minutes even though I couldn't see anything under the door.  I felt an intense relief when I heard the creaking start again, moving away from my door.  I am not sure how, it must've been because of how young I was, but I managed to almost instantly fall back asleep.

I mentioned the incident to my brother as we started getting along better than we ever had.  He said he's heard the occasional sounds, but just like my parents insisted, it was just the house settling.  He advised me not to bring it up to our parents as my father was getting increasingly agitated with my interest in the paranormal.

I accepted my brother's recommendation to not tell my parents - but I started believing the house was haunted.  I avoided leaving my bedroom after I already turned in, I would keep a bottle of water on my nightstand in case I got thirsty, but tried my best to not use the bathroom that was down the hall.  One particular night on early December, I woke up in the middle of the night, and knew there was no avoiding the bathroom if I wanted to fall back asleep.

I had not heard any strange noises recently, so I felt brave enough to cross the hallway to the main bathroom.  On my way back, I saw something on the corner of my eye.  Imagine seeing a shadow of your hand cast against a wall, but the wall is far away, not quite a distinct shadow, but more of a subtle shade.  We had a night light in the kitchen to make it easier to use the bathroom at night - that light was what was causing the shadow.  It wasn't a clearly defined shadow of anything, but I knew it was moving because after a few seconds of staring at it, it was no longer there.  I ran back to my room, and hid under the covers until the next morning.

The next day after school, I headed to a church down the street.  My family is Christian, but we were not practicing at the time.  I asked the priest there for a vail of holy water.  Being that I was barely eleven years old, the priest was more than suspicious.  I lied and said my mother had asked for it.  I don't think he believed me, but I sprinkled the holy water everywhere - in the living room, basement, kitchen and all the bedrooms.  I read verses from the Bible as I was doing this.  I am not sure if what I was doing would work, but to my eleven year old mind, it was putting me at ease.

For a time, the noises stopped.  Then a few days before Christmas they started again.  The creaking noises originated from the other side of the hallway and continued into the living room and all over the house before finally stopping.  I was still scared of the noises but managed to fall asleep.

The next morning my parents asked me what I did with my present that was under the Christmas tree.  I had no idea what they were talking about.  They attempted to make me confess.

""Are you telling us that you didn't take the Game Boy Color that was under the tree?""  They inquired.

I didn't know they were getting me this even though I had asked numerous times.  My little mind started connecting the dots; my brother had express interest in a Game Boy for some time.  It was my older brother who was creeping around the house late at night, it was him this entire time!  There was nothing paranormal going on - my brother took my present.  

When he woke up later that day, I confronted him and tried to fight him, but he was four years older than me, and easily subdued me.  He denied everything I accused him off, and when my parents searched his room and found nothing, they reluctantly believed him.  I was grounded for the next few days until Christmas for starting the fight.

The relationship with my brother deteriorated back to where they were before we moved into the house.  My parents never gave me a replacement present, and I blamed my brother for stealing my present.  By late January I had stopped being afraid of any noises that came from the house.  As soon as I heard any creaks, I would think of my brother and got upset.  Eventually when I heard them, I just rolled over and went back to sleep.  

In the last week of January, a flu was going around my school and I eventually caught it.  I tried to shrug it off, but on Thursday, I was sent home at lunch and told not to come back until I was properly rested.  My brother and I walked to and from school together everyday, so I had to drop by my brother's highschool, they called him out of his class, and I let him know I was going home early and not to wait for me after class.

When I got home, I realized that my brother hadn't locked the door.  I took a mental note of this - anything to get my brother in trouble.  I went to the kitchen, threw my bag on the counter and started to pour myself a glass of milk.  Looking around the kitchen, I noticed it looked different.  There was a dirty plate in the sink, as well deli meats on the counter.  My brother and I were the last to leave the house in the morning.  We did not leave it like this.  None of my parents cars were in the driveway.

Suspecting the worst, I took the cordless phone, dialed 911, and ran out my home.  I reported a burglar in the house, and within a few minutes three cruisers were at my house.  The officers searched the bungalow and called my parents.  The police then locked down the neighborhood - searching everyone going in or out.  

Around 9 pm, we were finally allowed back into the house.  The police explained to us what happened.  Someone had been living in our house for the last few months.  They were hiding themselves in the crawlspace under the basement stairs.  In the crawlspace they found several magazines, packaged food, and my missing Game Boy.  The police speculate that the individual knew our daily activities and left the house when he thought we were gone.  He must have been doing this for a while as he was brazen enough to just leave a mess while he went out.  He didn't have a key, so the door was left unlocked for him to return later.  

The police say I was very lucky to not be harmed.  If the individual had returned while I was still in the house, who knows what could've happened.  I remember my mother hugging me for a very long time, my brother even hugged me too.  The creaking of the house never returned, but we never felt comfortable again in the house and moved out a year later.",Why I Can't Be Left Alone Anymore,31

You've probably heard millions of versions of stories where the protagonist has the feeling of being watched. In fact, you may have experienced it yourself. And maybe you, like me, brushed those stories and feelings off. I mean, get real. This is a world of math science and cold hard logic. If you were ever watched, it was probably a pervert, call the cops, he'll get arrested soon enough. Yet the saying that “In every story there is a grain of truth” persists, and because this is a logical world, there must be some reason for this. So maybe you, like me, got to digging. And by the time you get to that infinitesimal spec, you'll wish you had listened to the other saying. You know, that one.

Ignorance is bliss. 

Oh, and lest I forget, the other, other saying.

Curiosity killed the cat.

Now, everyone has their own methods of research, but mine began with asking questions to an all powerful entity: google. I began with myths and legends, but I soon progressed to eyewitness accounts. There were many fascinating reads, but nothing that convinced me. Still, some of the stories struck a chord within me. Tales of “the Midnight man”, “Bloody mary”, and “she found her way into my home” stirred something in me, but I forged onward, crushing those feelings of trepidation. Sadly, those stories were as good as it got for me. Soon, I lost interest and moved on with my life, namely college work. Engineering majors aren't easy. 

Yesterday, my friend came over to my dorm room to work on a programming assignment. Of course, we ended up procrastinating. It began with him showing me a series of youtube videos about creepypasta. He insisted on lights off to maximize the impact. This of course prompted a brief relapse in which I shared some of my research with him. And just like before, I soon got bored, and so did he. I decided to get started on the assignment, but he was still not in the mood, so he started fiddling with my phone. I was finally starting to make some headway in the assignment when he suddenly punches me in the arm and says, “Hey, you've got to see this. It's hilarious!” Naturally, I looked over, and my friend started cycling through my pictures.

“I don't get it,” I told him. 

“Damn it, you really are pretty oblivious huh? You've got a secret admirer! You know how in high school you would just 'happen to show up' where your crush was? Well, look here,” he replied, scrolling back to one of the earlier pictures and pointing to an obscure figure with his or her back turned in the background. 

“Jack.... that is possibly the most retarded thing that has ever come out of your mouth. 'Oh look some random person in the background of your picture! She must like you!'” I mimicked him in falsetto, as I moved to swipe my phone back, “Come on, get your act together, we need to get some work done.”

“No seriously! Look!” Jack scrolled through several more pictures in my phone, and in each one, he pointed out the same obscure figure in the background. As he progressed, I noticed more and more details. Black dress, long black hair, painted black nails, several red tattoos? And then it hit me:

“jack... does it look like she's getting closer in every picture, or is that just me?”

“Uhm... yeah, you're right! It's not much, but she's definitely getting closer! And hey, I think she's starting to turn around too! Weird huh? I guess she's just shy?” jack said, laughing. But I wasnt amused. Not in the least bit. A chill ran down my spine. No need to jump to conclusions, I told myself, there is a reasonable explanation for this.

I swiped the phone from jack and started going through the rest of the pictures as jack looked over my shoulder. And to my horror, in each picture, whoever she was was getting closer, and turning more and more of her body to face the camera. 

“Dude, I guess she most have lost interest. Sorry man,” jack said, patting me on the shoulder. 

“What in the flying fuck are you talking about?! jack, don't fuck with me, I'm not in the mood. Don't fucking fuck with me!”

“Jesus! Relax man! Are you okay? What the fuck. Did you know her or something? Have a crush on her too? I'm sorry, but I mean, she's not in the pictures later on.”

“She's right there, rightthere!” I scream at him, jabbing my finger at her location on the picture. And of course, the stupid touchscreen takes that as a “Oh hey, lets move on to the next picture”. Jacks staring at the picture in confusion, wondering if I'm high, just as I calm down. Maybe calm down isn't the right phrase. It's more like my brain just shut down. Information overload. I've gone deathly silent. Because in that next picture, I finally see a part of her face...  I can see nothing but a glimpse of teeth through her hair … but why the fuck does her smile almostreach her fucking ears?! 

“Are you really okayman?” jack asks, genuine concern in his voice as he waves his hand in front of my face, breaking my trance. “There's nothing there. Nothing. Look again, there's nothing there.”

And he was right. There was nothing there. Nothing at all. I felt relieved, more relievedthan I hadever felt in my life, so relieved that I wanted to cry. 

“Alright, I think we've stayed up too late. You're tired, I'm tired, lets get some sleep,” jack says, as he climbs off of my loft bed and into the adjacent one, recentlyvacated by my room mate who decided to live off campus. 

“Yeah, you're right,” I say, as I climb out of bed and head to my room's private bathroom. I push the door open, feeling for the light switch, when I see a pair of eyes staring at me. “Holy fucking shit!” I scream, backpedalingand crashing intosomething- or someone.

“Jesus man! What the fuck?!” It was just jack. Apparently he had comedown to take a piss too. Those eyes were his, reflected from the mirror inside. 

“Sorry jack, I must stillbe tired and seeing things,” I sayas Iget to my feetand help him up.

“Yeah, yeah, just get on with it,will you? Use the damnbathroom so I can go too and then we can sleep.” So I do. I go about my business, and he goes about his. And miraculously, probably because I really was tired as hell, I fell asleep. 

And awake an hour later to a bright light. My phone. I groggily get up and check it. Huh, no message, no call. Weird. I'm about to put it back and go back to sleep when I notice a glow from under the bathroom door. Was jack in there? I glance to my left. And swallow, one of those dry swallows where all you swallow is air and your throat is even drier than it was before. jack was still in bed. So who was inthe bathroom? No, there's noone in the bathroom, jack probably forgot to turnoff the lights before. With that thought in mind, I put my head down on my pillow and close myeyes. And I immediately hear the creaking of a door. I'm scared shitless. If I had any bodily fluids left in me, they would have all come out. But I'm guess my DNA is more similar to a cat than I thought, so I take a peek, and there she is, standing there, only thing visible id a form, two eyes, and that smile too wide for her face. 

I try to scream for jack to wake up but it comes out as a sort of strangled whisper. So I go to my last resort, something I havent done since I was a child – I ducked underthe covers. Now here I am typing away on my phone, telling you all my story in the calmst most coherent way possible, because please please please please god someonehelp me out! Anyone! Doesn't anyoneknow anything about my case?! Pleasehelpme thefuck out! I swear to god I will never ask for anything again. Please. God why thefuck amI so stupid? I just realized... no light means no reflection... so it couldn't have been jacks reflection inteh mirror. I should have known I should have known. Please, anybody out therehelp me. Please. Why am I so coherent? How am I making sense right now? Do I make sense? Someone, please help. Please.

JordanThirstExile,6,14,1r857m,17,"  It started with the roses. Ever since I was a little girl I loved them. I loved the scent of them, and the colors they came in. I loved them so much that my mother had planted a few rose bushes outside our house so when it bloomed I could sit and stare at those beautiful roses. They bloomed in shades of white, and pink, but my favorite rose was red like satin. It reminded me of my mother and the way she always drew roses on her letters. 
                                                                                                                                                         Fast forward to the time I was 14 years old. I was never a popular girl, by far, but I wasn’t unknown either. I didn’t have long blonde hair or blue eyes, but I had talent, a slim body, and an obsession for roses. All my friends knew how much I loved them. They’d buy me perfume in a rose-shaped bottle, or a dress with red roses on them for my birthday.  I made the best out of what I could in high school being a short, brown haired, green-eyed girl. 
     It was the day before homecoming when the boy I’d secretly been in love with asked me to the dance with a white rose. I swooned and he took me to the dance the next night. (I, of course, in a rose dress and him in matching colors.) He had brought me a white rose corsage to match my dress. We danced all night, and we continued to date until high school ended. After our senior year we went our separate ways and stopped talking. But this didn’t bother me, I hadn’t time to waste when I was busy with my roses.
        In college I had been taking Art classes in my third semester when I got a call one evening informing me that my mother had pasted away in the hospital. 
The following Tuesday we attended her funeral. My father had picked out the colors. We buried my loving mother in pink roses, because she was a former cancer survivor, and we were blessed to have her as long as we did.
For the months following my mother’s death I became deeply depressed. The only thing that eased the pain from losing my mother, were the roses. When they bloomed in the spring my sprits suddenly lifted. The roses were my life, and I don’t know what I’d do without them. 
         2 years go by and I ended up meeting a nice guy who joined my ecology class. His name was Dylan and we immediately hit it off. He gave me everything a girl could’ve ever wanted and treated me like a princess. I loved him more than anything in the world. We talked about moving in together and buying a house after college. We talked about getting married and having a daughter named Rose for my love of roses. His handsome blonde hair and chiseled feature would make a beautiful baby.
         We went through college and eventually graduated together and got married. We lived in a small townhouse in Vermont for a long time after that. After trying many times to have the baby I so desperately wanted, the doctor came to tell that I was infertile. Dylan tried to tell me we could always adopt, always have a child if I wanted, but I didn’t. It wasn’t fair! If I couldn’t have a child that was my own flesh blood, how would she share the love of roses like my mother did with me? 
         Again for a long time I became mute. I could not eat or sleep. Dylan became very distant and we hardly spoke. Everything we had was gone. Nothing made me happy anymore. Nothing would until I had a baby rose. I would look out at our garden and wait for them to bloom, but even then the roses did not make me happy. 
It was the next winter before I found out. I knew something had gone wrong because all of the roses had turned over black instead of falling off and dying. Dylan had come home late that night and seemed very stressed. I decided that night while he slept I’d go through his phone. 
         He had 3 missed calls and a text from a girl named “Lisa”. The text read:
“You HAVE to stay home tonight! She won’t stop crying unless you’re here! –Lisa”
         Who wouldn’t stop crying? Did someone care that much about my dear Dylan to cry when he’s not there? I remember him saying he worked at the office with a girl named Lisa, so I decided to send her a text replying, “Get her to stop crying, I can’t be that important.” 
         After that I waited for a reply for several minutes before I got a reply back.
“Of course you’re important to her love! You’re her daddy! And she needs you here! Just take off work this one night!”
WORK? SHE though HE was at WORK? He was supposed to be at work all day! And WHO’S daddy was she talking about? 
         I carefully went through his address book in his phone and found her home address. I silently walked downstairs, and out the door, grabbing a hoe from the garden before leaving in the car.
I knew the black roses meant something was wrong. 
         I returned a few hours later with his “baby” in our car. I left her there while I waited behind the house. About an hour later I see Dylan walk out the front door to leave, when he suddenly stops when he sees the child in the car with the windows up. 
He screams “ALLISON!” 
         Is THAT the things name? So it IS his! At this point I was furious! 
         As he went to unlock the door to retrieve the child, I pulled him backwards so he fell into the garden. I picked up the hoe and shouted “ALL I WANTED WERE THE RED ROSES!”
The hoe dug into his head once, and I felt all the love I’d ever had for him release, into the small, tiny bits of pieces that were once my loving husband. When I was all through I tossed his body into the cellar along with his companion’s. 
         At least now the black roses are blood red once again.
         A beautiful thing, the roses are. 
         Little rose lives with me now and she has just enrolled in preschool. She loves the roses as much as I do, but her favorite ones are the dead petals. 
“So pretty!” she said, “Even after they’re dead!” 
         I always agree with her on that. Sometimes she asks where daddy is and I must tell her, “Simple, Prim Rose, ask the petals!”

For several years now I've had this story inside me like lead shot in my gut. I've considered telling it hundreds of times over, but the sheer magnitude of it has always stopped me. With six months of therapy under my belt, I figure it's time. I know now that I won't be free of this thing until I write it out. Settle in, because I can't tell this story in ten thousand characters or less. I'll be lucky to get through it in twice or three times that. It's hard enough to sum up everyday life, and this story is anything but.

I had a recurring dream when I was really little. I would wake up in the dream, and standing beside my bed was the most beautiful lady I had ever seen. Long, straight hair and long, flowing gown, both of the purest silver like captured moonlight. She would smile at me so sincerely, so lovingly, as she sat down beside me and began to speak.

The words were comforting like a lullaby, but I couldn't understand them. Though she spoke quietly, her voice seemed to echo through the room, through the universe, backwards and forwards in time, begging to be understood by my adolescent brain.

I always tried to stay in the dream as long as I could, but eventually I would drift back off to sleep in the dream and wake up to my mom gently rousing me for breakfast.

My mom died when I was seven, and the dreams stopped. Well, I prefer to say she died. She was murdered. I hate that word. It's so cold; it falls off the tongue like shards of glass.

My mom was a health nut; protein shakes, weight lifting, yoga, the whole lot. Above all, she loved to jog. We had several acres of untamed land around the house. She always woke me up about an hour before dad went to work so she could go take a forty-minute run through the forest and along the creek; it befell dad to make me breakfast and get me ready for school.

They found her by the lake south of the house. And hanging from the old weeping willow in the middle of the pasture. And scattered across the countryside in a ten-mile radius around the house - but that was mostly after the funeral. All told, the casket had about two-thirds of a person inside when we finally buried her. They never found her head.

We used to be a close family - me, my sister, my mom and dad ... Losing mom, and losing her the way we did, splintered us. Dad lost himself in his advertising job. My sister turned inward, and fell into drugs and alcohol, when the kids our age figured out how to get ahold of it. Besides his job, dad's other mission was to keep his girls safe from all harm, and he took that one even more seriously. Leanna got it a little easier since she was four years older. I was taken out of school. Dad hired a tutor to homeschool me. I wasn't allowed out after dark. I wasn't allowed out without supervision. Unless I was being taken to town for some reason, I wasn't allowed to range out of eyesight or earshot of the house.

I started writing obsessively. Mom taught me how to keep a journal as soon as I could hold a crayon. I still have my very first one; the pages are filled with scribbles in different colors, and some pages are nearly colored solid. I guess I thought that good writing should fill as much of the page as possible. I remember how unabashedly delighted mom was to see every single entry. I guess writing is my way of honoring her memory.

I took mom's death hard, but it was a long while before I really understood what it meant that mom was killed. Dad told me that a very bad man had taken my mom from us, that she was dead, that she'd never come back. All things considered, he handled that conversation pretty well. Nothing could have softened the blow, though. My mommy was gone. I loved her and wanted her, but I'd never see her again. She was dead, and death meant people were gone forever. We weren't a religious household, so at that young age I was coming to grips with the fact that mom didn't exist anymore. There was a hole in my world. It was like that feeling when you go to grab something like a can of Coke without looking at it, and you end up swiping at the air because that can wasn't where you expected it to be.

I healed in time. For several years I was just chugging along, going through the motions, numb to the outside world. Closing myself off was easy; the outside world mainly consisted of our house and the clearing around it. My dad was mostly an authoritarian figure when he was home, always vigilant but never available. My sister babysat me when dad was gone, though she usually left me entirely to my own devices. She was homeschooled too, but she could drive; sometimes she would simply leave me at the house and go off to do Big People stuff. 

That Big People stuff, as I've written, consisted mainly of shooting up with her friends, or scoring more dope.

She had been chasing her high for ten years straight when I turned eighteen. Leanna had been living with her junkie boyfriend for a couple years. She was never able to hold down a job for very long, so she would spread her legs for a dealer until he let her move in. That was how she kept up her habit. When that didn't work out, she'd beg dad for more money and find another dealer to fuck.

It was a miserable, shady life for her, and she would have kept going until it killed her. And it did.

-------

My dad got the call at four in the morning on a Tuesday. I remember waking up, bleary-eyed, to see him looking like death warmed over. I had only seen that tortured look on his face once before, and I shot straight up, wide awake, when I saw it that night.

""Leanna,"" I said.

He nodded. My heart sank into my stomach and stopped beating. She was living in the city, a forty-minute drive away. A long, miserable forty-minute drive away. Neither dad nor I spoke a word. He sat stoically, knuckles white on the wheel, crying silently. I might as well have been dead myself. I stared at my lap, taking in nothing, thinking nothing, feeling nothing. Where my heart had been was a gaping hole.

Dad led me by the hand into the funeral home, and sat me down in a chair where I waited motionlessly as he went to identify the body. I heard his wracking sobs as he came back to get me some time later. I reflexively turned towards the sound. The funeral director and another man were practically holding him upright as he stumbled across the lobby. They took me up and walked us to a private area with a couple of couches, where we both collapsed.

I sat on the couch, mindlessly pulling at my hair, gazing at my father as he poured out his grief. He had always been a reserved man, but the dam had finally broken. We had no family but ourselves. Mom had grown up in a foster home, and had no love for the people she called her ""fake parents."" My biological grandma had a stroke and passed in her sleep. My grandpa followed not long after, as old widowers are wont to do. I never knew either of them. If we had any extended family, we never knew them.

I half-noticed the little hank of hair tangled around my hand. I hadn't felt it when I ripped it out.

Dad cried for a long time, eventually slumping sideways into his couch. When his voice was gone and his sobs came without tears, he stood up. He seemed to be carrying the weight of a thousand suns on his shoulders. At his slight nod in my direction, I stood up myself, and we walked together to the car. He pulled out a rumpled piece of paper and his phone, and dialed a number. We were at a motel fifteen minutes later. We went to sleep in our clothes.

The next few days were a blur. There were arrangements to be made, and that was dad's job. I went to town and bought us clothes and toiletries to keep us going while we stayed at the motel.

The funeral was a small affair back home. We laid her to rest in the plot next to mom's. Dad and I were the only mourners. A minister said some words, we each tossed a handful of dirt on the grave, and it was over. It was over.

-----

We stepped through the doorway and into our home. Quiet pervaded the empty space, the sort of quiet only found indoors. Clocks ticking, a gentle hum from our air conditioner, our breathing and the stecatto hitches as one or the other of us suppressed a sob.

We stood alone in an empty house, our bodies kept upright through some force of habit or instinct in the absence of warm blood flowing through our veins. My sister had imparted some vitality into this place, unbeknownst to us, even after our mother's murder. As our Leanna died, so died the house. I might have turned to see the land itself had withered, without so much as a shrug.

Dad pulled the door shut, and the click of its latch, impossibly loud against the quiet, signaled the start of our new life, or merely the end of the old.

I glanced at the clock: almost noon. The gears in my brain began turning, cast about for something to fill the time until bed, and found nothing. It then latched on to the only activity left, and my feet carried me to the stairs with sliding steps. They balked briefly, as if puzzled by a reason to lift off the ground more than half an inch, and then continued. A minute later, I fell backwards, collapsing onto my purple comforter. My toes brushed the carpet from time to time, but that didn't matter. Nothing did. Apathy sang me a lullaby, and the world faded away.

My staggered footsteps echoed through the tunnel, meshing with the steadfast crashing of many feet behind me. Searing hot agony blazed through my side. I had to keep running, I had to reach the end before -

I snapped upright, eyes unfocused, drenched in sweat. I bent forward reflexively and threw up bile into my lap. I sobbed, and choked on my own vomit. I coughed until my throat was raw, until the vessels in my eyes popped, and then collapsed sideways.

Good morning, world.

Mrreeburrito88,14,7,1r1tik,16,"I don't know if this counts as a lucid dream or not but I have been having the same time of dream for a number of years and it has always managed to freak me out. I don't know where else to post this so if I could get some insight on I would be get grateful. 
How it starts is that I am laying in my bed and I am slightly awake but I cannot move or speak. I can how ever see what is going on so there is that. While in my bed it feels like I have a huge weight on me and I cannot move. I do however, try to edge myself over to side of the bed in hopes of waking up because I don't want to feel that way anymore. 
There has been one time where I woke up several times on to be slammed back down onto my bed. That time managed to freak me out so much that I ran out of my apartment and did not return until later that day. Another time I felt as though I was dragged off my bed and dragged down a hallway that seemed like it was at an elementary school only to never reach the end. 
I thought it was a ghost, for lack of a better terms, for awhile but I could not gather enough evidence to prove it. I do not rule it out though. I have had not physical harm come to and it happens so often sometimes that I end up ignoring it and just get annoyed by it. Oh I almost forgot that this usually happens from 12-4 am if that makes any differences. I have wanted to film myself and maybe record what I might say during these happenings. That may give more insight on it.

Lyn5643,2,8,1qye72,15,"When I was 15 I moved into a house on Mill Road in EHT. Its a pretty plain colonial style 2 story home. Our family had lost our home due to disastrous financial decisions made by my parents. The house was small, too small for My parents and 3 other siblings. The top half was an apartment rented by a psychotic woman who used to terrorize our dog and hang shit stained long underwear on the clothes line. She'd frequently sleep in a tent in the backyard which was technically ours.

My parents slept upstairs in one room, my brother had the other small bedroom. My 2 sisters and I shared the cold ""finished"" basement which would have sopping wet carpets after the rain, stunk like dirt and metal and we'd wake up with slugs, spiders, and an array of bugs in our hair or on us constantly.

Needless to say we were miserable and after a blizzard kept us in for over a week my mom found herself pregnant yet again. Things started to get weird after my mom found out she was pregnant. The windows, doors, and cabinets would open by themselves, the smoke detectors would go off for no reason, once there were like 12 snakes hanging from the rafters in the garage, plus the time I thought I saw a ufo (that was funny only afterward). The phone would ring and beep loudly or have static when you picked it up and we had constant electronic disturbances. 

My mom has a brain injury from childhood, she's actually missing a part of her brain and was waking up seeing floating things in her room and in the shower. She thought something was seriously wrong but the doctors were stumped. Then they told her the baby had downs syndrome and she started having nightmares of traumatic and deadly delivery of the baby. 

My sister started dreaming the house was on fire and kept crying in her sleep. We started sleeping upstairs on the floor in the living room because the basement got too cold. We were in trouble for making noise in the kitchen and a few times the front door was wide open. We were sleeping and not to blame. No one was really scared, we just kind of accepted our home was haunted but didn't really discuss it with each other. Hey we had bigger problems why add a ghost?

One night we were telling stories at my grandmother's on Christmas or some holiday and got around to the ghost. (Side note my family is directly related to the Jersey Devil and have been on tv etc lots of weird paranormal). It was like suddenly my mom and I were in tune we were telling our opinion of the ghost and getting a motherly vibe off it. We finished each other's sentences and came down to having the same mental picture of a pretty red headed lady in the 50s in a green kitchen with rose dish towels and accents. My family isn't weirded out by things like this, we've all got a bit more than intuition.

Our landlord was getting ready to evict us when we discovered serious mold issues after a damaging storm. Turns out the entire house was infested with deadly black mold, all types of fungus going on in the crawl space and behind the drywall. Three of my siblings and my mother have asthma, debilitating asthma, the landlord agreed to not evict us and write a good recommendation letter if my dad agreed to fix the mold issue so he could sell the property.

When my dad started pulling off the paneling in the kitchen we found mint green walls and a porcelain rose knob to a drawer or cabinet. I like to think the ghost was opening the doors and windows and setting off alarms to get our attention and protect us. We found out a woman died in childbirth in the home, this was ten years ago, but her death linked up to the pretty woman from the 50s era.

Little sister is nine now, no downs syndrome but terrible asthma. There you go no sleep, a true story.",In our walls,23

**DREAMESCAPE**


I was afraid - but for the first time since all this started I wasn’t afraid for myself.  Lexi was hanging from the tower, just like Kelly was two nights ago.  She was wearing the same black tank top and underwear she had on when I left her back in the pit, and I could tell from the mascara marks streaming down her cheeks she was crying.

.

“*David!  Help me!*” she screamed.  I got up from the bench and surveyed my surroundings.  It appeared to be just us – for the moment anyway.  I was also wearing the same clothes I had on in the pit, the same clothes I’d purposely gone to bed in.  I began to run as fast as I could towards her.  At first, I rapidly closed the gap – I was only about twenty yards away now and could see the panic on her face.  

.

However, with each step I took the gravel I was running thru seemed to get thicker and thicker.  My feet started sinking into the ground deeper and deeper.  Each time I stuck my foot in the gravel, it became harder and harder to pull out.  I began to feel drained; it felt like I’d been running all night.  Finally, about twenty feet from the tower I couldn’t take another step.  I collapsed to my hands and knee in complete exhaustion –my right leg still stuck in the earth.

.

“*David, help me!  I can’t move my arms!  I’m scared David!*” For the first time in the short time I’d known Lexi she sounded like a little girl.  Her tough facade was completely gone, replaced by the terrified little child in front of me now.  “I’m stuck, Lexi.  I can’t move!” I answered back.  She began openly crying.  “I’m scared, David.  You **have** to help me!” I was at a loss.  I wanted to help, I wanted to get up – but I’d never been so tired in my life.  I could barely keep my head up.  


.

Then, in the stillness of the night, the silence was broken.  Off to my right I became aware of a familiar sound, a sound that in that moment I couldn’t quite place.  A rhythmic, metallic squeaking noise that I *knew* I should recognize.  Lexi’s eyes met mine and without exchanging words we both knew things were about to get a lot worse.  As she turned her head to her left – her expression change from fearful dread, to sheer unadulterated horror.  I could feel her scream reverberate all over my body.  

.

I turned to look - it was Kelly.  She was sitting in the middle swing of the swing set about thirty feet away.  Both her arms were wrapped around the chains that connected to either side of the seat, with her hands resting in her lap.  The open wound from her chin to her waist was clearly visible and fresh blood covered the front of her body.  Her head rested against the chain to her right, blankly starring straight ahead.  There was such sadness in her eyes.  

.

The terrible image of Kelly momentarily blinded me from what was going on.  Kelly was moving backwards in the swing, back to something behind her - it was the little black-haired girl.  When Kelly swung to where she was, the little girl gently pushed her forward again, much like a mother would a really small child - carefully forward, as not to push the child out of the swing.  

.

Lexi was screaming and crying like a little baby now.  “*God no, please god no…*” she sobbed.  Turning back to me, “*Please help me David, I don’t want to die!  Oh my god, no… please no!*”

.

The helplessness I felt with Kelly washed all over me again.  Gathering all the strength I could muster, I tried again to pull my leg out of the gravel.  It barely moved an inch.  Looking back towards the swings again, the little girl had moved next Kelly.  Reaching out, she grabbed the chain of the swing, stopping it on the next pass.  The little girl, her hair covering most of her face, bent down next to Kelly.  She lovingly brushed Kelly’s hair off her face, and then kissed her on the forehead.   Kelly never even blinked.

.

Then, the little girl started to walk towards the tower.  Lexi screamed louder, “*No!  God no!  DAVID?!  Please help me!!*” Lexi was fighting now, her arms and legs kicking against the chains, the clatter almost drowning out her screams.   The little black-haired girl was almost there now, an evil smile noticeable thru the long strands of hair dangling in front of her face.  

.

As if accepting her fate, Lexi stopped kicking and screaming – I could only hear her faintly sobbing, shaking like someone stuck outside in a freezing rainstorm without a jacket.  My heart was breaking; I couldn’t believe this was going to happen again.  I’d failed miserably – and somebody else was going to suffer for my mistakes.  

.

The black-haired girl was directly in front of Lexi now, with her back to me.  When Lexi made eye contact with her, her eyes widened and she let out another scream as all the color drained from her face.  I don’t know what she saw.  I don’t *want* to know what she saw.

.

I couldn’t let this happen – I had to make it stop.  If this was a dream, I needed to wake up – and wake up now!  I started pinching the back of my hand as hard as I could.  Nothing.  I slapped my face, again nothing.  Dropping my head, I couldn’t bear to watch anymore.  Then I saw it, the outline of my pocket knife in my pants pocket.  As quick as humanly possible, I dug it out and opened the blade.  If this didn’t wake me up, I didn’t know what would.  Looking back at the tower I could see the pale arm of the little girl extending up towards Lexi.  If I was going to do this, it had to be now.  Taking the knife, I jabbed the blade into my thigh a couple inches above my knee.  When I did, the black-haired girl snapped her head back towards me.  Before I closed my eyes in pain I could see the anger in her face, her eyes glowing red.

.

The pain was immense - I let out a loud cry and jerked upright in bed.  I’d gone to sleep with the light on, so right away I could see the little pocket knife sticking up out of my leg.  “Holy Shit!” I said aloud.  Reflexes took over.  I instantly yanked the knife out and tossed it to the floor.  When I did, blood poured from the wound and down to my sheets.  I had to stop the bleeding I thought to myself, so I grabbed my leg and began to apply pressure with my palm.  Looking around I saw some dirty shirts lying on the floor.  Rolling out of bed, I grabbed the nearest one and clamped it down on the cut and limped my way towards the bathroom down the hall.  

.

My brother was already standing in the doorway of his room as I passed.  “Dude, what the hell did you do?” I ignored him as I continued.  In the bathroom I grabbed a hand towel from the rack, wet it and replaced the shirt I’d been using.  “Mom’s gonna be pissed dude, that’s one of the good ones” he said, referring to the flowered covered towel I was using to soak up the blood.  I gave him a “what do I care” look and proceeded to dig thru the cabinets looking for something to clean the wound.  

.

My mother, being the typical hypochondriac nurse, had plenty of choices available.  I grabbed something I couldn’t pronounce, and poured it on my leg.  That didn’t help the pain one bit.   

.

“Seriously David, what did you do?  That looks terrible.”  My mind was only now beginning the catch up with events; I had to come up with something quick.  “Um, I guess I fell asleep with my knife in my bed.  I must have rolled over on it…” Ok, that sounded lame even to me.  “Holy crap!  How far did it go in?!” he asked.  “I don’t know, half inch?  Maybe more” I replied.  

.

Looking at his watch, “It’s almost seven, Mom should be home any minute.  Dude, I think you’re gonna need stitches.”  Stitches.  I think if you asked any twelve year old kid what fear number one would be, that would be it.  Before this week I would’ve agreed.  


.

By the time my mother got home, most of the bleeding had stopped.  Unfortunately my brother was right and mom didn’t even get a chance to change clothes before heading with me right back to work.       

.

Lying on the hospital gurney in a curtained off section of the hospital ER, I was finally able to think about the situation.  Sure I was able to get myself out of the dream, but I still wasn’t certain how Lexi had fared.  Remembering how angry the little black-haired girl looked, my guess would be that it’d worked.  Hopefully I was right.  

.

*************

.

Most of the time at the ER was a blur.  I think I dosed off a couple times but I couldn’t be sure.  I only vaguely remember my mom’s lecture on knife safety while getting the stitches, but I distinctly remember the shot to deaden the pain - and the other one for tetanus I got before leaving.  That one hurt the most. 

.

Mom had to help me up the carport steps and onto the living room couch.  It was still late Saturday morning so she turned on cartoons, Bugs Bunny was just ending and Scooby Doo was coming on.  “They ruined that show when they added Scrappy” I thought to myself, but since this was before the days of remote controls and a hundred different choices I had to suffer thru it.  

.

If I’d have known Emma’s phone number I could have called and asked her how things were going.  I could have discreetly asked enough about Lexi to maybe figure out if she was ok.  But I didn’t know the number, and there was no way Mom was going to let me out of the house today.  I was stuck without an answer for now.

.

Mom sat in the chair across from me for about an hour.  She pretended to be watching TV, but I think she was just so tired she was zoning out.  Finally she got up.  “What do you want for lunch?” she asked heading for the Kitchen.  But before I could answer there was a light knock at the carport door.   “If that’s Greg you’re not going anywhere” I heard Mom say as she made her way to the door.  From where I sat in the living room I had no view of the carport entry, only the section of the kitchen furthest from that door.  Our house was pretty small though, so I could hear everything clearly.

.

 “Hello ma’am, you must be David’s mom.  How are you?”  It was a girl.  “Yes I am.  I’m fine, how are you?” my mother answered.  “I’m good ma’am, thank you.  I’m a friend of David’s, my name’s Lexi.  I was wondering if he was home.”  Relief overwhelmed me, she was ok.  As quick as the feeling of relief came, it was gone.  “Oh no…” I thought to myself.  Just the appearance of Lexi would get me grounded for the rest of the summer.  

.

“Yes, he’s home but he’s had a little accident.  I don’t think he’s up to coming outside today.”  Then, what she said next completely floored me.  “He’s inside watching TV, would you like to come in and say ‘hello’?”  She’s letting Lexi inside the house?!  Lexi?!  On her best day she looked like the spawn of Satan, I could only imagine what she looked like today.

.

“Thank you Mrs. Anderson, I’d love too!” then you could hear the screen door open and Lexi step into the house.  “Lexi you said?  You must be new to the neighborhood, I don’t recall seeing you around before.”  she replied, “Yes ma’am, we moved in just last weekend.  Is David ok?”  “Oh, sure.  He’s fine, I’ll let him tell you all about it” Mom said as they stepped into view.

.

I couldn’t believe my eyes.  The girl standing in the entryway to the living room was NOT the Lexi I knew.  She was wearing a pink and white tie-dyed t-shirt with jean shorts that were rolled up just over the knee.  The heavy mascara and black nail polish were gone, and her hair was pulled back into a single pony tail behind her head – she was even wearing a gold cross necklace around her neck.  But the biggest outward change to me wasn’t any of those things, it was her smile.  There was a genuine warmth behind her eyes that wasn’t there before.

.

“Hey David, what happened to you?” she asked.  My mother was behind her and couldn’t see her face when she shot me a quick knowing look before feigning ignorance.  “Oh, nothing really.  Pretty stupid actually, I guess I rolled over onto my pocket knife while I was sleeping last night” I said.  “Ouch!” Lexi replied, “That must have hurt like a… um, really, really bad.”  

.

“Please, have a seat and make yourself at home Lexi.  Anything I can get for you?” Mom asked.  “No thank you Mrs. Anderson, I’m ok” she answered heading for the chair across from me Mom had sat previously.  “Ok then, I’ll be in the kitchen if you change your mind” and with that left the room.

.

Knowing my mom could hear, Lexi continued on sounding as nonchalant as she could yet with an extremely serious look on her face, “Funny thing, when I turned the corner onto your street it looked like there was a police car in your driveway.  It kinda scared me a bit.”  “A police car?” my mother asked from the other room.  “Yes ma’am, but it turned out it was at your neighbor’s house, not here.”  

.

Mom was instantly in the entryway, Lexi swiftly changing her serious glare back to one of indifference.  “There’s a police car next door?” she asked again with a deep look of concern on her face.  “Yes ma’am, it’s still there right now” Lexi said.  “I’m sorry, you’ll have to excuse me.  David, I’ll get your lunch in a second – I need to check on Ms. Elliott.”  She still hadn’t had a chance to change out of her nurse uniform from the previous night, but was out the door in a matter of seconds.

.

When she was sure Mom was gone, Lexi stood up and walked over to the edge of the couch.  She just looked at me for a moment before dropping to her knees and wrapping her arms around my stomach, burying her face into my chest.  I laid there with my arms in the air, not exactly knowing what to do with them.  That was until I could feel her tears soak into my shirt.  She was crying.

.

I awkwardly put my arms around her shoulders and she stayed like that for at least a minute before she finally spoke.  “I thought you were dead.”  She paused, “I was so scared and crying so hard, all I could see was the flash of the knife when you stabbed yourself.  I couldn’t tell where… then, I was back in my room.”  Rising up, she quickly wiped the tears from her eyes without looking at me, and then rested her hands on her lap.  “Then when I saw the police car… I lost it.”

.

“I sat on the curb next to the school for, I don’t know, fifteen minutes maybe – just looking at that tower thing.  I couldn’t believe it.  I finally got up the nerve to come the rest of the way, I had to see what was going on.  When I figured out it was Kelly’s house, well… Well, you know.”  She paused again to wipe her face.  Still looking down she said “Thank you… nobody’s ever, well… just thanks…”

.

I was stunned.  “Let me get this right, you’re *thanking me*?” I asked.  “Lexi, this whole thing is MY fault!  If it wasn’t for me none of this would be happening.”  She hesitated for a second then continued, “I know, I get that – but, I’m not a very good person and I’ve been nothing but mean to you.  You didn’t have to do what you did, you didn’t have to stop it – you weren’t in any danger.  I can’t say I would have done the same thing for you if the situation was different.  That’s all…”

.

“Besides, it’s not all your fault” she continued.  “If I’d of left you alone from the beginning I wouldn’t be involved either.  You warned me but I wouldn’t listen.  I shouldn’t have been hell bent on messing with you, so it’s not ALL your fault.

.

I laid there for a moment just looking at her, she looked so different.  “Nice shirt” I said trying to lighten the mood.  I barely got the words out before she punched me in the shoulder.  “Ouch!” I snapped trying to act like it didn’t hurt as bad as it really did.  “Be nice” she said.  “I took these from Emma.  I heard you telling her about your mom that day at our house.  I was upstairs eavesdropping.  I knew I wouldn’t get passed the front door looking like I did… I did this for you so don’t give me shit about it.”

I laughed.  “Well, you certainly pulled it off.  I like the necklace - nice touch.”  She laughed, “I stole it from Emma too, ironic, huh?”

Lexi stopped smiling and got serious again.  “So, now what?”

Looking at Lexi, I didn’t have any answers.  “I don’t know” I said, “let’s talk about last night…”

dazvn,7,6,1qw47f,17,"He is back again, this is the 3rd night in a row, he won’t leave me alone.

He once again is just peering through my kitchen window, looking directly at me, waiting… watching? I don’t know who he is or what he wants, he has a weird mask on, this is the best image I can find http://imgur.com/ZVOvjqz, and is wearing a long black duffel coat.

I’m going to call the police this time, I am seriously scared, going back to the first night; I was just sitting here browsing Reddit when I suddenly started hearing tapping noises getting louder and louder, I made my way into the kitchen and nearly had a heart attack when I saw him standing there, tapping the beak thing of his mask against my window - I went to grab the phone to call the police and returned to the kitchen but he was gone. I thought it was just kids.

The second time I’m pretty sure I was dreaming, I woke up during the night, it was freezing so I had the covers over my head, I pulled them down and he was standing at the foot of my bed, by blood ran cold and I was frozen solid - I’ve never been so scared in all my life. It must have been a dream, I only remember waking up in the morning normally after this - I can’t call the police because I had a dream, right?

Anyway tonight he is back, again the at the kitchen window (at the back of the house, in the garden) I have no idea how he got in as I have a locked gate, I live alone and the next nearest house is down the street.

Oh crap! he has started banging the beak on the window again, it’s getting louder and louder, I’m pretty sure the window is going to break, I’m calling the police right now…

I’m speaking to an officer, she is saying she cannot make out what I’m saying, crap, I’ll hang up and redial, stupid old phone, thats when I hear a voice come on the line, it sounds gravely and deep “don’t”, “don’t what - who is this” I say? “don’t do that - I’m coming for you” *click*

I run into the kitchen, he is gone! I try and redial the police but there is no dial tone on the phone - maybe he cut the wires? I go and look at the window, it’s starting to shatter from the tapping of the beak, I look into the garden but it’s so dark I cannot see anything.

Suddenly my whole house plummets into darkness, has he cut the power too? I scramble to try and find a flashlight, crap the batteries are flat, thats when I hear what sounds like running upstairs, heavy running, like an adult, I run out of my back door and start heading for the house down the street, I turn around and see him looking from an upstairs window, just staring at me, and then I see it up ahead in the trees, another guy dressed the same with the bird mask… There are more of these guys? Bird men

What do I do guys? I’m standing here with my iPad an no weapons (I could bash him with the iPad I suppose?)

warasd,2,5,1qvhaq,16,"Those words still plague my brain. I would've never thought that something like this would happen so close to me. Jack was lying on the floor in a pool of his own blood, not quite dead, but close to it. I was the last one he saw. And I was the only one who heard those words slip out of his cold, bluish lips.

Lets go back to the start, it was a Friday night, me and my best buddy Jack decided to go have some fun and maybe pick up some ladies at our local bar. After we had a few drinks a cute girl with light blonde hair walked into the bar, me, being more interested in brunettes, decided to let Jack pick her up. So I said to Jack ""check your six o' clock"" so, Jack turned around and looked at the girl, then turned back to me and said ""how should we play this?"". Me and Jack liked to stretch the truth a bit when it came to picking up ladies, so I said to him ""We're business partners. We co-own a sports clothing company."". So Jack agreed, and we walked over towards the girl. Little did I know, that was the biggest mistake of my life. We started out by introducing ourselves, ya know, all the usual stuff. Her name was Rebecca, but she said people called her whisper, because she could hear spirits talking. We found this quite peculiar but went with it because she was a solid 10. It got pretty late, Jack and whisper seemed to be getting to know each other quite well, so he decided to take her home. We were all pretty drunk so I decided to crash at Jacks place because it was much closer to the bar, so the cab would cost less. Good thing I did, otherwise no one would've been there to witness what happened. The cab pulled up to Jacks place, and we all went inside, I fell asleep on the couch, while Jack and whisper retired to Jack's room. I woke up about 10 minutes later to a ungodly scream, and I brushed it off because who knows, maybe the girl gets loud during the act. HUGE mistake. 5 minutes later, I still hadn't fallen back asleep. I then heard another scream, followed by a huge crash. So, I rushed into Jack's room, and I kid you not, the bed was lifted about 2 fucking feet off of the ground. Jack was clinging to the headboard facing the end of the bed, and whisper was yelling into the air. She yelled ""Put the fucking bed down right now dad!"", as soon as she said that, the bed crashed back down to the ground. The air felt eerily quiet. Then whisper shouted ""we have to get out of here, now!"" so, we all ran at the door, which then slammed shut in my face, and jammed. It wouldn't open. I tried kicking it open, but that didn't work. We were trapped. Jack then got flung against the wall, and started grabbing at his neck as if he was being choked, he started spitting up blood, everywhere. He then fell to the ground, I ran over to him, and asked him if he was okay, he was on the edge of death. I heard something behind me so I briefly turned around to find that whisper was gone, it was just me and Jack in the room. He gestured for me to come closer, he them whispered those words. He said ""I can see my mom up there, she's smiling at me. Tell my dad she's doing fine, and that we'll be waiting for him."" 
Jack then died.

I will never forget those words. ",We're waiting.,21
Kaghiti,4,10,1qtux0,18,"My dreams have always been somewhat odd. I dream about death, distortion, and decisions. Maybe it's because my life just isn't going the way it was meant to or something odd like that, but enough of the explanation and onto my dreams. Last week, Tuesday I believe, I had a dream in which I was at school, everything was normal and nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary. That WAS true until the person I hated with a burning passion walked over to me and straight out punched me in the face. The world became static and blur mixed with the noise of my classmates declaring a fight by going ""ooooh"". After regaining my vision I was no longer in the classroom but somewhere else. The ground was rough and scratched my skin as I got up. ""Sand?"" I thought ""No that's too hard to be sand. I was a bit stupid thinking it was sand although in reality it was a cave, but the texture of the stone felt sandlike. I looked around but saw nothing, until I looked a bit farther in front of me. A red light, faint but noticeable from a distance. It seemed as if the dream was planned out for me and beckoning me to walk over to the light, I did so with caution. When I got about 5 or 7 feet within the light I saw something; no someone. Glowing a now bright red in the darkness was a person, no wrong again, it was a demon. Slowly turning its head towards me it said two simple words that woke me from my slumber: EAT THEM.",Dreams,28
Myzrath,5,6,1r5zd8,15,"I came from a universe where things twisted and changed at the mercy of my infinite will. But here everything was the same. Every day I awoke encased in meat, trapped in the same skin I’d loathed for so long. I interacted with the same people I hated, and wondered why I couldn’t have been born across the ocean. My will and infinite vision was no use here: No matter how vivid my dreams were, they were meaningless and intangible. I spend endless nights staring at the mist and midnight skies, longing to revert to my true form. I dreamed of another existence that was so real, so overpowering that it choked out this disappointing joke  you call reality. Things are woven into the fabric of your world that you will never see or comprehend. And I longed to see them again.


I came from a place where I never had to question sanity, because there was no such thing. There was only the boundless infinity of thoughts. I was nothing, yet I was everything. I had no body and I had no pain. For vast, uncounted ages I soared through the bleak darkness of space, savoring the isolation and the pain it brought. My soul was seared by the fire at the hearts of stars, and my dreams were inspired by black holes sucking entire galaxies into oblivion. I wandered for eternity, but suddenly, it was over.


And I awoke in this prison of meat, wondering why the stars were so far away.


 I wondered why I had these new emotions, like hatred and longing. I was jealous of the other meat puppets for having better skins to walk around in. Or for living in a nicer house, or fucking a better looking slab of meat. Slowly I began to forget everything. And only in dreams can I remember true freedom: the boundless infinity where I once roamed as a collection of particles calls to me, and soon I will return.

I came from a dimension where my dreams, desires, and fears were nonexistent. I had no one to envy, no one to despise. I was a subatomic particle with the fury of a dying star, and now I’m trapped inside a walking corpse waiting to die.

The_Black_Apostle,2,5,1qzc5p,15,"Like many people growing up in rural Alabama, I was just above the poverity line, but that was fine because everyone else was the same way. Money was never an issue; if someone couldn't afford something, they worked for the owner until they'd made enough money to buy it. But, I suppose I'm rambling about sonething that has nothing to do with the story at hand.

Like every rural town, we had our fair share of legends, and when everyone knew everyone's business, those legends expanded every year. My experience with Black Warrior River, a murky creek that runs into the Alabama River, was woven into our towns tapestry only a few years ago. It was winter, mid-December and in the prime of hunting season, when I decided to take a brief vacation along Black Warrior's muddy banks.

The Indians who lived there told stories like you'd expect, the sort with man-eating fish and vengeful spirits, but I never paid any mind to them. Winter was a nice enough time, and Black Warrior was a nice enough creek, so I felt reasonably safe sleeping in a tent, miles from the nearest house. Still, like any hunter, I was packing, and made sure to have enough orange clothing to avoid an unfortunate accident.

It was the third morning that Rocky walked into my little campsite, and I would be lying if I said I didn't welcome the company. Rocky was some kind of mongrel dog, an attractive sort of mutt that was the favorite dog of many a country boy, and unlike most of his kind, he had a collar denoting his name. ""Yo, dawg,"" I said when I first saw him, in my usual greeting to stray dogs. I didn't expect an answer, and didn't receive one, but that suited me just fine.

He was a good boy, the sort to follow any human who felt like leading him around, the sort who was owned by neighborhoods instead of families. ""Let's go see what trouble we can stir up, boy,"" I said, uncasing my rifle as I did every morning, because I'd always been told cold air could warp a scope's settings. Rocky just cocked his head and barked, but followed like I'd spoken his language.

We hiked for what must have been three hours, by the sun, which meant it should have been about seven in the morning, given that we'd left with the sunrise. I wasn't surprised to hear a couple gunshots around me, most of which were the sort of caliber hunters liked to use. Rocky didn't mind, so I suppose I didn't, either. Hunters were normal for December, so were bloodstains and bulletholes in trees. Leaving slaughtered deer lying around wasn't, and God help me, but seeing what soemone did to that poor animal stirred more than anger in me.

I'm not exactly averse to blood and gore, but something about the way this deer was strung up irked me, and I'm not too proud to admit that I was a little scared. It was a buck, easily over two hundred pounds, and hung from a water oak by its own innards, not that much of it was in the tree. Fur, meat, and bits of bone were scattered in a twenty-yard radius from the tree, which grew alone in a clearign slightly larger than the gore field. I didn't like it, and neither did Rocky, who had raised the scruff of his neck and growled at the corpse. ""Let's move on, boy.""

So we walked, and noticed the only sound around us was our footsteps, which wasn't unusual for winter, but there should have been a gunshot here and there. Instead, we had dead silence, and I distincly remember thinking those very words. Bears, maybe mountain lions, weren't unheard of, but they weren't exactly common, so I was hesitant to believe one of them did the poor buck in. Despite the cold, I held my 30-30 with a steadiness I more expected from a statue, and looked around fast enoguh to cover everything Rocky couldn't.

We found a local landmark, a house carved into a cliff, built by the federal government for a surveyor during the eighteen hundreds, and decided to stop for a brief rest, it being about noon then. To this day, I regret going in there, maybe more than I regret anything I've ever done before or since, but my gut said everything was okay, so I didn't pay Rocky's nervousness any mind. As I stepped inside, because the house lacked doors and windows, by which I mean added structures, as it obviously had to have the holes for them to qualify as a house in my book, I noticed a few chunks were broken off the doorway, coming from the inside, and I could only tell by looking at the breakage.

I was spooked, I'll admit, but I was also tired, cold, and hungry enough to not care. In case you didn't know, December in Alabama can get pretty cold, especially on the ass-end of the mountains like Black Warrior was. I didn't smell it until I was right on it, but I suspect Rocky knew while we were still outside, and I nearly slipped on a dark puddle, half-frozen in the morning chill. Like many men of the rural persuasion, I recognized blood when I saw it.

A tangled mess of meat rested at the back of the house, at the beginning of the blood trail. At first, I didn't know what it was, but the torn bits of cloth and scattered brass casings told me it was another person, one who had been attacked by... something. A Glock rested next to the body, which I assume was male, but there wasn't much to go on at the time. Scared, backed away, and tripped on a little composition notebook.

It was a cheap thing, probably bought from Walmart, and had a few scattered words here and there, but it was mostly full of drawings. Figuring there was no sense in leaving, and possibly running into whatever had caught this guy, I sat my ass down and flipped through, and don't think my cell phone had any reception, or I would have had the game warden down there faster than I could shit myself.

Apparently, Clark, the dead guy, was studying Native American culture at UAB, and found out about my town's legends from a friend of his who'd once lived in the area. I say once, because I knew the man in general had been the local pastor, and had died four years prior. Black Warrior was apparently the site of a massacre when Jackson was president, where soldiers had killed the indegenous people when they refused to relocate.

The legend goes that they guarded the people of the valley from He Who Hungers, a spirit that supposedly drove men to killed their families and friends, before fleeing into the woods and becoming a monster that was neither man nor animal. Personally, I figured the guy was mistaken, because it sounded like a wendigo, and we were a ways away from any Inuit tribes, to put it lightly.

Rocky had gone outside to piss, or whatever it is dogs do when they  leave humans alone. I heard him yelp, then nothing. I looked outside and realized I'd been reading for the better part of an hours, so I decided to forget about getting back to camp, and get to my truck near the road. ""Rocky!"" I yelled, hoping to get him to follow me, if only to spare him the fate that befell the buck and Clark. There was a rustling that soundign like something running to me, but it stopped just beyond the scrub about thirty feet ahead of me.

I pointed my rifle at the bush and called for him again. Whatever it was, it was a bit bigger than Rocky, and a bit bigger than me, so I did the only sensible thing, and shot it. It howled like something out of a nightmare and bolted away, shrieking at the top of its lungs. I sprinted as fast as I could, and I couldn't care less about where I went, as long as it wasn't where that thing went.

I ran for, hell, I don't kniw how long, but I finally reached the highway. I barely had time to jump in truck before that thing came back, and ran across the road on two legs. It yelled at me again, something like what I imagine hell sounds like, the screaming of a thousand tortured souls. I drove off then, and didn't stop until I was at a gas station a few miles from my house, too scared to go home i case that thing followed me, but I was being silly then,  i know.

If you're looking for resolution, don't. I went to the police and reported it, but they never found any evidence of Clark or the dead deer. I checked with a relative of mine who works at UAB and found put Clark was indeed a real person who attended UAB and went missing a few months before. I still live in the area, but haven't gone hunting in years. Rocky is still around, but he's on three legs these days. Things haven't changed much, but every now and then, I flip through Clark's notebook when Rocky stops by for a visit, and read.

It gets my mind off the screaming that comes from Black Warrior during the winter.",Black Warrior River,20
Dusteratops,5,0,1r8rf4,19,"It was a long day of work, and my face was covered in oil and grease of all sorts. I suppose I looked like a coal miner or a hobo as I walked down the road. It was evening, so the crowd wasn't too large. There were groups of ladies, making their way home and spouting the latest gossip. There were solitary people making their way with their head down and their ears plugged in. There was a peculiar man walking adjacent to me with the strangest clothes and a mullet. He wore a robe with a sweater tied around his waste. Then there was Rachel, ahead in the distance. She was my ex-girlfriend who didn't know how to cope with seeing me, so it always turned out extremely awkward. I immediately turned around and talked to the first man I could start a conversation with, who just happened to be the man in the robe. 

""Hey.""

""Hey..""

""Whats up."" 

""Just walking around. So you like to read?"" He spoke in the thickest accent, and I couldn't figure out exactly what is was.

I was carrying a book, and I do like to read. ""I suppose so, I want to be a writer."" I replied, and then we jumped into the thickest conversation about all of our favorite books and the way the world works. He was able to question all of my ideas, and had a detailed answer for each and every one of my questions. Its safe to say I learned a lot from him. 

When Rachel walked by, she simply waved and smiled. I nodded back, but I couldn't help but notice that she felt like something was funny. It must have been the dirtiness of my face though this weird secret humor just continued to resonate off the face of every passerby. It was unsettling.

Mid conversation he asked me what my name was, without even breaking from the previous sentence. I told him my name and reached out my hand to shake. He left me hanging and slammed his palm into his chest and proudly proclaimed ""I am Moko."" 

Then we jumped right back into our conversation, which went on for quite some time. The sky became dark, and we were the only people in the road. I asked him where he was from and he never told me. 

A large chunk of our conversation was about sanity, and the works of the insane. He seemed to know everything about them, and it was unsettling the way his knowing black eyes drilled into my soul. Yet I learned and thought and learned some more. 

He pulled out a napkin and refused the pen that I offered him. He wrote down my number after searching for his marker for about a minute. He promised to give me a call when he got home, for he did not have a cellular. Then we went our separate ways. Oddly though, he went back the way he came. 

There were two girls laughing when we split apart, and I figured it was because of the thick accent my new friend had when he yelled his farewell. 

""He has a funny accent, doesn't he?"" I asked the two girls.

They responded by looking at each other and laughing to some secret joke, then one of them said, ""Who does?""

""You know, that man with the mullet I was just talking to.."" they gave each other another look, but it was without humor. The skin on my neck began to stand on end. They walked away.

I know he has a loud voice. I know they heard and saw him leave. I know I am not crazy. I know- My phone rang. I answered.

""Hey Brian, its Moko. I was thinking I'd come visit you this Christmas. See you then.""

funnyguy135,2,5,1r3dcj,13,"When I was younger may family moved around a lot.  One of the places that we lived in was a town in New Jersey.  We were only there for about 1 year but the events that occurred will leave a lasting mark on me for a life time.  In order to protect the identity of people names will be changed.

During the summer when I was around the age of 13 my family moved to New Jersey.  Upon moving I quickly befriended my neighbor, James.  James and I began hanging out a lot and soon he started introducing me to some of his friends.  I soon became friends with these people and joined their little friend group of 4.  Pretty soon school started up again and I began meeting fellow class mates.  I made a few new friends but I mostly stuck with James and those people.

One day during school I left class to go to the bathroom.  Upon entering I noticed that someone had clogged the sink with paper towels and turned on the water.  Luckily I got there before the water started flooding over so I turned it off, cleaned up the sink and went about with my business.  When I got back to class I told Henry (one of the people in my friend group) about what someone had did.  He began to chuckle and told me I was funny.  I asked what he meant and he turned to me looking confused.  He asked, ""Wait, you don't know?""  I said I didn't know what he was talking about and he told me he would explain after school.

At the end of the day I went to go meet Henry so that he could explain to me what he was talking about.  I walked outside and saw James, Henry and Tim (the other member of the group) waiting for me.  I asked what was going on and they said they would explain.  They told me that about 5 years after the school was built, before any of us were born, a boy had been killed in the bathroom that I had used earlier.  They told me that he was being bullied and the bullies thought it would be funny to give the kid a swirly (a swirly is where you hang a kid upside down, put his head into the toilet and then flush it).  Any way what the bullies did not expect to happen was the kid to drown.  The bullies thought he was just being a pussy so they left him on the ground.  The body was later discovered later in the day when another kid went to use the bathroom and saw that he was not breathing.  The bullies got into some huge shit and were expelled and got into some trouble with the law.  After that there had been strange occurrences of toilets or sicks being clogged, strange noises being heard, toilets flushing on their own or even for some people seeing a little boy soaking wet standing in the middle of the bathroom.  The school had been putting it off as tricksters trying to scare younger kids but people honestly believed what they saw.  At the end of the story I told my friends that they were bull shitting me but when they kept trying to convince me so I got frustrated and went home.

The next day in the school the guys were still on me about the whole murdered kid and how he haunts the bathroom.  I didn't believe a word of it and started to get really mad at them.  We got into a fight and I didn't speak with any of them for a while.  About a month after our fight Henry left to go use the bathroom.  He was gone for 20 minutes and the teacher asked me to go check up on him.  I agreed and left go see what was wrong.  I walked into the bathroom and saw no sign of Henry but only a small puddle of water on the ground.  I figured that this was just some elaborate trick that the guys had set up to try and scare me.  I started saying out loud, ""Really funny Henry but you can come out now cause what ever you're trying to do is not working.""  Thats when I heard a slight whimper coming from one of the stalls.  I opened it to find Henry curled up in a ball on the ground soaking wet.  I knelt down and started shaking him and yelling for him to get up but all he did was lay there whimpering and slightly rocking back and forth.

I ran to go get a teacher and then brought her back to the bathroom.  When we arrived Henry was no longer curled up in a ball but now standing up in front of one the mirrors just staring into it.  The teacher ran over and asked what was wrong but he just stood there staring.  She started to pull him away and he look at her and said, ""No...I need to stay...he told me to stay...that i'm going to join him.""  The teacher asked who told him to stay and then after another second of silence Henry burst into tears and said, ""The boy...the boy tolled me.""  For about the next week Henry did not show up in school and James, Tim and I got worried so we went to visit him at home.  When we got there his mother answered the door and when we asked how he was she said that all he does is stay up in his room and when ever they asked him to leave his face changed and he said he was to afraid.  We went up to see him and when we got up there all he did was look up at us and then look back down at the floor.  We asked how he was doing and he didn't answer.  After a few minutes of silence Tim blurted out, ""So what happened Henry?""  James and both gave him a nasty look and he just shrugged.  Henry looked up at us and said that he saw him.  We asked what he was talking about and he said he saw the boy.  That they had stared at each other for about 20 minutes before the boy started walking towards him saying that he had to stay with him and join him.  Henry started to back away but that only angered the boy as he lunged at Henry.  Henry said that he was all of the sudden drowning in the toilet and he heard his name called and so he sat up and then collapsed to the floor.  I then entered the stall and tried to get him and the rest we already knew.  We all sat there in silence before with out a word got up and left.

Henry stopped coming to school and after a few months we heard that he had moved away.  We stopped talking about him because we refused to believe what he had told us.  As the school year came to a close my parents informed me that we were moving again.  I was upset because I would be leaving my friends but also slightly relived.  I stayed in touch with James and Tim but over the years we grew apart and the whole long distance thing stopped working.  The last I had spoke to them they said that they hadn't seen or spoke to Henry since that day we all went to see him.  I hadn't seen Henry either but to be fare I was purposely trying to avoid him.  I grew up and one day while reading the paper I saw a story about a man who had drowned in his own home.  His name was Henry Goldmen.  I figured that this couldn't be the Henry that I knew so long ago.  But there is still apart of me that wonders that maybe Henry was telling the truth and maybe what ever tried to kill him the first time waited years before trying again but this time it succeeded.

This might have been a bad idea, but I read about Astral Projection and started trying to practice it but I've had no luck.  But since then, I've been hearing things before I sleep and when I wake up.

A few weeks ago I started hearing the sound of boiling water coming from my kitchen in the middle of the night; after that it was quiet conversation; and after that it was the sound of a light switch being turned on and off.

In the mornings I hear scratching, and speaking and I can't pinpoint where it could be coming from.

What happened last night is what made me scared enough to write about this.  My eyes were shut as I was trying to fall asleep, and out of nowhere I heard typing on my keyboard, which is only a few feet from my bed.  I was too scared to open my eyes and look, so I acted like I was asleep.  This morning I saw a new icon on my desktop, it was a jpg, eventually I opened it and it was just black.

*July 22nd: At two a.m. the home security system at 319 Dallas Street went mad; the shrill beeps of the smoke detector, the piercing wail of the burglar alarm and flat chirp of the carbon dioxide alert rising up at once in a mad chorus. The noise sent Bobby Dooley tumbling out of bed, his head aching and his heart trying to tear its way from his chest. Not a good way for a man his age and weight to be awoken. He blundered around in the dark, trying to find the wall pad that would disable the noise but just as he got his bearings in the darkened room the television blared to life. Blinded he misstepped and cracked his toe on the corner of his dresser. The sound of his agonized cursing set the dog barking downstairs.*

*And that was a real problem because Bobby Dooley didn't have a dog.*

*He grabbed the phone with one hand and a golf club with the other. When he dialed 911 he got a message that the number was not in service. The barking was getting louder. Long-nailed paws clicked on the stairs. How was there a dog in the house? Had one of the doors been left open and some stray wandered inside? Had some pet-loving thug decided to bring Rover along while doing a home invasion?*

*The barks dwindled to a long, ugly growl. A low canine shadow stretched across the floor. Bobby dropped the phone and gripped the five iron with both hands. The dog entered the room.*

*The animal was like something out of a veterinarian’s nightmare. Long-bodied but short-legged with eyes the color of milk and teeth the color of rotten wood. It had no fur, just leprous, exposed skin that crawled with bloated parasites. When it saw Bobby its growl took on a leering quality. Its tail began to wag and with each wag it sprayed rivulets of shit along the walls. The ID tag on its collar was large and instead of a name it had an engraving of a cruel-looking owl.*

*I can't be sure but I like to imagine Bobby thought something along the lines of No Fucking Way before he brought the golf club down hard onto the dog, splitting it's skull with a sound that reminded him of an overfull garbage bag splitting open.*

*Once he was sure the animal was dead Bobby ran past it and headed for the stairs. Whatever was happening around here he'd feel safer dealing with it from a distance. All his family pictures had been turned upside down. Now he was panicked and sad, this was a five bedroom house but he lived here alone. The Marines had taught Bobby Dooley that respect was more important than love but his wife and children never quite understood the lesson.*

*Things were even louder on the first floor, the blender was running, the microwave was beeping, the dishwasher door was open and water was gurgling out. He grabbed his car keys and turned to go but then he saw the TV was on in the parlor. The sight of it stopped Bobby in his tracks because somehow his copy of the Kim Kardashian sex tape was playing but impossibly at the same time so was the Barney the Dinosaur DVD he kept on hand for when his grandkids came to visit. Old Barney was really giving it to Kim, thrust after joyful purple-hued thrust.*

*A growl startled Bobby. The dog came bounding down the stairs, brains and loose teeth spilling from its head. Bobby screamed and ran, slamming the door closed behind him. His heart was pounding in his chest, his vision was marked with white dots.*

*Bobby got into his sports car. The dog came crashing through the front window of the house. (Just like I would weeks later.) Bobby gunned the engine and screeched out of his driveway.*

*The dog gave chase but quickly began to lag behind.*

*The neighborhood of Tate’s Corners was quiet and dark, Bobby hoped someone would see him and do something but everyone was probably in bed. He glanced into his rearview mirror to see that he had lost his pursuer.*

*He must have wondered if he was going crazy, he had to think that the strain of the Homeowner’s Association, the constant arguments and court orders, had driven him mad. He’d let dealing with Tom Palmer consume his time and money, was his sanity next? He decided to keep driving until he got to his ex-wife’s house. What would he say then? He didn’t know.*

*The sports car turned onto the ramp that led to the overpass that connected with the Northway. The hammering in his chest started to fade.*

*That was when the dog in the back seat started barking. Bobby Dooley swerved in panic and went right off the side of the overpass.*

*You might dismiss the fact that a trailer towing a heavy duty construction shredder had stalled out directly below the overpass as mere coincidence. You might even suggest the way the shredder turned itself on at the moment Bobby Dooley’s sports car landed in it as a mechanical failure. But how dear reader, how would you explain the dog collar the police found mixed in with the tatters of metal and flesh?*

...I know what you're thinking. You're thinking *Foster how could you know all that?* What you just read was a combination of witness interviews, traffic camera images, police and accident reports, footage stolen from Brian Dooley's own security system and in, some cases, complete and utter bullshit.

The thing is Brian Dooley's death wasn't the only one in Tate’s Corners, there had been all kinds of crazy deaths, all accidents, all gruesome and in every case a dog collar was found near the body. A dog collar with an owl engraved on it. There was one more coincidence tying all these deaths together, all the victims had been members of the local Homeowners Association.

How could I resist a story like that?

It didn't take much digging for me to find out that the five fatalities of Tate Corners had all come into conflict with one man; Tom Palmer. More research led to some even more troubling conclusions, apparently Mr. Palmer had been seen in the company of one Ashley Fowler, she of the red hair and men's suits. I only know Ms. Fowler by reputation, and the reputation is that she's beautiful, rich and she thinks she's the Devil.

Around 7:30 at night I was sitting in my car about a block from the Palmer residence; I was eating a kind of trail mix that had far too much candy in it to pass for healthy, and waiting for Jasper Moradi to show up. I know getting him involved breaks my number one rule of preternatural investigation but he asks all the damn time and truthfully I still feel guilty about punching him in the mouth. Yes, it was years ago and yes he had tried to kiss me but that's no excuse.

So, anyway I sent Jasper to Hobby Lobby to pick up some insurance for tonight but he was either taking his time or my debit card was maxed out. 

It was around about the time I was debating wasting gas and battery power so I could listen to the radio when a knock at the window startled me.

Tom Palmer was there, dressed in sweats and smiling pleasantly. He wore glasses and his hair was pulled back into an anemic looking ponytail. “Mr. Foster?” he said through the window, “I think we should talk.”

Sheepishly I got out of my car and followed him. What else could I do?

His house was a generic two story job with a big picture window in the front; the colors were tasteful and subdued, the landscaping was meticulous. It was the kind of place I was sure I would ever be able to afford. As he opened the door to lead me inside I saw he had something in his right hand. It was an empty dog collar.

“Did your pooch get away?” I asked.

He smiled thinly, “Please do come in.”

The inside of his house was as tasteful as the outside. Tom Palmer had no wife or kids, that meant the place was quiet. That also meant no witnesses if things got out of hand. He gave me a full tour of the place showing me every room and every toy he had. Then he brought me into his study; it had lots of books, a kick-ass sound system and autographed pictures of celebrities hanging on every wall. He threw the collar aside and sat down behind his wide oak desk. He gestured for me to sit down in the comfortable looking seat in front of it. We looked at each other for a moment, then I started talking, “I guess you know I'm something of a freelance reporter.”

“I know what you are,” he replied.

“*Metroland* has asked me to do an article on the pros and cons of Homeowners Associations,” I explained “and yours has been in the news a lot these days...”

“Those incidents have been blown out of proportion by a scandal hungry media,” he said.

“Are you saying you didn't fine Bobby Dooley multiple times for having a Marine Corps sticker on his car?”

He bristled, “That wasn't an ordinary sticker. It took up the entire rear window and as per the HOA bylaws it constituted an advertisement.”

I shrugged, “That seems kind of nitpicky.”

“What’s the point of rules if they’re not enforced?”

“Then of course there was the incident with Amanda Ward...”

“Her lawn statuary was in violation of the bylaws,” he threw up his hands, “I don’t see what’s so difficult to understand about this.”

I replied, “According to her she was singled out because her statuary was of a religious nature.”

“She ‘had’ a martyr complex,” Tom Palmer seemed to enjoy putting a particular emphasis on the word had. They were still trying to find out how she got caught in the gears of the pin reset machine of the Playdium Bowling Center.

“You couldn’t have been happy that she and Bobby Dooley were trying to unseat you from your position as leader of the HOA.”

“I would have abided by the vote of the committee, but it didn’t come to that did it?” He smirked.

I smirked back, “There are... Or should I say were, people that accused you of pushing an agenda.”

“My only interest is in making Tate’s Corners a thriving progressive community.”

“I thought the only thing Homeowners Associations were for was keeping the property values up.”

“I think the two go hand in hand and I am of the belief that glorifying post-modern Dominionist attitudes and the military industrial complex encourage attitudes and behaviors that attract the wrong elements. Even a lowly homeowner’s association can be a platform for change.” He stood up and crossed the room. There was a tall oak armoire against the left wall, “But enough chit chat, lets talk about you Mr. Foster. Let’s talk about your future.”

“According to my High School guidance councilor I don’t have much of one.”

He opened the doors of the armoire to reveal a little altar the centerpiece of which was a bronze statue of a cruel looking owl. “This,” he began, “is Molech.”

“OK,” I got to my feet, already making calculations about my chances to make a run for the door, “I guess that answers some suspicions of mine.”

“And we shall carry Molech our king,” he picked a dagger up off the altar, cut his palms and let the blood drip, “scorned by Solomon, bringer of the fortune and wisdom. Sacred Molech. Amen. Amen. Amen.”

“Why...” I paused, letting all this sink in, “Why are you doing all this for control of a local Homeowners Association?”

“If I change the reactionary attitudes of a single neighborhood I might in turn change the world,” he held up his bloodied hands, “Molech is a means to and end for me. A means for a better, more progressive community.”

“Aren’t you worried about Hell?” Crimson wetness was beading up on the carpet, “Damnation?”

“I don’t believe in all that claptrap,” he said, “I’m an atheist.”

“Then how can you reconcile any of this with your beliefs?”

“Molech is just another kind of life form, an alien intellect communicating and influencing humanity from afar,” Tom Palmer smiled, “he’s not some devil out of a children’s story.”

Now I was almost feeling sorry for him, “How can you be sure?”

“Because Molech told me so.”

Suddenly I didn’t feel sorry for him anymore.

“Do you believe in anything Mr. Foster?” He said, “Are you willing to forgo the joys of the here and now on the off chance there might be an afterlife?”

All I could do was shrug, “I’m not sure what I believe these days.”

“Ever since I learned you were poking around I did some investigations of my own.”

“Oh?”

“The vorvolaka has marked you. It’s only a matter of time now. I can help you,” he gestured to the altar splattering more blood, “we can help you.”

*Vorvolaka.* You can’t imagine how much I hate that ridiculous and terrible word. I felt a momentary twinge of temptation and let it pass, “Can I think about it?”

Tom Palmer sighed heavily, “I can tell you’ve already thought about it. Do you know what you are Mr. Foster?”

What I was, was out of there. I went barreling down the hallway. I wasn’t surprised to find the scurvy-ridden ruin of a dog waiting for me in the foyer. Old texts like *the Constantinople Document* called these things barghests. It was blocking my way to the door so I ran into the parlor. It snapped at me tearing at the back of my jacket. I threw myself out the picture window.

I hit the ground hard, broken glass landing all around me on the meticulous lawn. As I tried to raise myself up I heard Jasper Moradi shouting my name.

The barghest leapt out the gaping window. He would have landed right on me if not for Jasper pulling me roughly out of the way. I felt some part of my arm come loose with a pop but didn’t care. All I cared about was him getting me behind the line of statues before the monster could get me.

Yes, statues. Lawn statues to be precise. All the while I had been inside Tom Palmer’s house Jasper had been placing over three dozen statues of Jesus and the Virgin Mary in a circle around it in a display I’m sure the late Amanda Ward would have approved of.

And now I was outside that circle and the barghest was inside it. The creature paced back and forth on the front lawn but kept well away from the cheap plaster effigies.

“It’s real.” Jasper said with a kind of wonder, “It’s really real.”

I replied, “I think you really dislocated my shoulder.”

Then Tom Palmer was striding out the front door, the dagger was in his hand and there was no doubt in my mind that he meant to use it, “Oh you have got to be kidding me! Is this what you believe? That God and the angels are going to come down protect you?”

Jasper started manhandling me into the street where his car was double parked but he shouldn’t have bothered.

It all came down to a paving stone, just a single loose paving stone. Tom Palmer’s toe caught the edge of it and he landed right on his face.

And his knife.

“Karma’s a bitch.” I said to no one in particular, “That’s what I believe”...

*...there you have it. The Police found no sign of the Devil dog, just an empty leash. The crazy deaths stopped with Tom Palmer and the Tate’s Corners Homeowner’s Association voted to disband shortly afterwards.* 

*Did Tom Palmer find oblivion or Hell waiting for him when he died? Your guess is as good as mine all I can say is that in this humble blogger’s opinion he sold his soul very cheaply.*

*Hopefully, if and when the vorvolaka comes, I won’t make the same mistake.*

Pretending_To_Care,2,9,1r6wgf,12,"It was around 1am, when Steve and I stumbled upon the railroad tracks that lead out of our small village. 

""You know, about two miles down the track, there's an old church that's been abandoned. I hear it's a place for Devil worship."" Steve was grabbing a branch just off to the side of the track. 

""Fuck that."" I snapped. 

""Chicken shit?"" Steve smiled. 

""No! I just don't think it's a good idea. Rick said he'd been there during the day with Alan, and there was blood all over the place and a stick that had been used to stab something.""

""How would he know that?""

""There was blood on it.""

""Well look, I've got a stick! How's about I stab anyone if they get near. Or you, for being a pussy."" Steve began jabbing towards me like some sort of fencing opponent. 

""Fine, we can go, but you lead the way, big man."" I agreed. 

We hiked down the tracks for about an hour and a half, maybe longer if you count the couple times we stopped so Steve could smoke from his pipe. The church was in sight. 

As we got closer, we notice a faint light pouring out of the broken door at the front of the church. When we were within twenty or so feet from the side of the church when we crouched behind some trees in the woods. 

""Do you hear that!?"" Steve gasped. 

""Hear what?""

""That chanting.""

We fell silent for a few seconds, but in turn were met with more silence. Nothing. 

""Look, let's creep around front and see if we can get a look inside."" Steve was already headed toward the front before I could object. 

It's a surprise that if anyone were inside, they didn't hear us. Steve was stepping on every stick his feet could've found.

As we placed our backs against the wall of the church, we could hear shuffling against its concrete floor, then silence again. 

Steve leaned over to me ""Right, on three, we both take a quick look... One, two... three.""

We probably should have booked it as soon as we saw what was inside, but shock had totally frozen us in place. 

Upon looking inside, we were met with the dead stare of about thirty fully cloaked people. They knew we were there, and they just stared at us. Behind them was a bloodied lamb, and beside it, a man holding a stick.

Now I'm no expert, but I thought sacrifices were conducted with a blade. NOT by gouging what must have been a couple dozen holes in the body of your sacrifice. 

""Jesu- Oh my God man, fucki- RUN!""

We ran as fast as we could for about ten minutes before I pleaded Steve to wait for me. I couldn't run any more. I had to catch my breath. 

""What... the FUCK was THAT!?"" Steve gasped. 

""I, don't know. You fucking idiot. I told you we shouldn't have gone anywhere near that fu-"" I stopped abruptly.

Behind us was a mob of people carrying flashlights.

""Get down!"" I gasped. 

We laid silently in the dark of the woods for what seemed like forever. We kept our heads down, trying not to breathe. The only indication about where they were was from the lights they carried, and then the worst possible thing that could've happened, did.

In succession, all the lights that were just on, went off. We were blanketed in darkness with this group of men, no more than thirty feet away. We only heard the crackling of branches and the shuffling of leaves for the next few seconds before we heard a voice nearby, grumble a faint ""We have seen you. Come out.""

I couldn't see Steve, but I knew what had happened. Steve bolted off further into the woods, snapping their attention right at us. I could hear him sulking as he ran harder and harder, but they were catching him. I remained silently on the ground as they disappeared. 

I must have laid there, not making a noise for fifteen minutes. What just happened? I was worried sick about Steve. They got him, I just had this feeling, they got him. 

Eventually, I crept my way back home and snuck into my room without waking my parents. I contemplated waking them up to tell them what happened for a while, before I broke down and did exactly that. Sort of. 

At this point, it was around 6am, and dad was getting ready for work. I told him that Steve and I were in the woods and we got spooked by an animal and lost each other running, so I just came home. I told him I was worried Steve might have gotten hurt and that we should call to see if he was okay. My dad is a sharp man, and knew something was up, but didn't question me. He just nodded his head and said ""Okay. ""

We contacted Steve's mother, who confirmed that, surprisingly, Steve was home. After a few more minutes, my dad concluded their phone conversation and reassured me Steve was okay. 

Around noon, I drove over to Steve's house to check in on him. When I got there, he signaled me to follow him up to his room. 

""They know who we are."" He said. ""As I was running, they yelled my name at me. These people, they know who we are.""

I froze.

""If they know who we are, then they live in our village.""

""Exactly, we-..."" Steve stopped himself. ""What do we do?"" He asked.

Theresa92,5,6,1r3wvr,12,"I have been reading this subreddit for a while, so I upgraded to pro so I could post my own creepy stories. Depending on the response, I have plenty more.WARNING: sorry for the length . Rather be thorough

So a little background, I'm a First Nations female living on reserve and I was probably around 15 when this happened... As a native women I have always been very spiritual.

The house I was and am currently still living in is about 4acres in the country on reserve and the area by my house is surrounded by trees on 3 sides, with a long driveway. There's a path just off the trees line that I used to love too walk but to get to it you need to do a bit of bush whacking. 

So one day I'm out on a walk on these trails with my 3 dogs; Ginger (mix breeds of something), Maggie and Charlie ( both black labs). The trail I'm walking goes for about 1km before you reach a sort of T intersection, go south and in .5 you reach these sand dunes or head north and there's acres and acres of trails. As I'm walking with my dogs, I get to this intersection when I hear Ginger start to whimper, she's nudging me trying to get me to head back home, I think this is odd  but my other dogs are fine so I brush it off and keep walking as Ginger takes off running home with her tail between her legs. 

Feeling adventurous I go north to do some exploring. 2 dogs in tow. I get another kilometre before a coyote comes across our paths. Dogs growling , coyotes looking at us, growling. That is till it looked behind us, kinda whimpered, and took off. Still didn't think much of it. What I was paying attention to was the howling coyote close to us and close to probably 5-10 of them I can hear howling not to far in the distance. 

Decided it was time to take my growling dogs home far away from the pack of coyotes coming for us. 

Everything was going fine on the walk back, coyotes got close then they got distant. Dogs were happy, that is... Till we got to that damn T intersection. It was like a fricken flip got switched. My once happy dogs started whimpering, I felt them nudging me on both sides, they started kind of running up ahead before they would turn around, realize I wasn't with them and they would come back by my side, nudging me to go faster, whimpering, tail between their legs. I was  scared... Then I heard it .

2 claps, right behind my head. I'm I'm the fricken bush ! I turned around slowly and ... Nothing. I grab the biggest branch I could find and start walking. 
Double clap, keep walking
Double clap, maybe it's an animal, but what kind of animal makes that noise right behind your head ?!? 
Double clap, turn around.., still can't see anything !!!
Double clap, keep walking
Double clap, little people, centaurs, bad spirits ? 
Double clap, I want to run all the way home but force myself to walk because running seems like it would make the being watched and followed feeling so much worse... 
Double clap, scared me, scared dogs...ALL...THE WAY...HOME... followed me all the way to the tree line, my dogs were scared all the way home, till we hit the tree line..then they were happy...

I ran to my mom crying, warning her not to let anyone walk the trails alone anymore. I still can't, not alone. 

I don't know what followed me home, but I know that whatever it was, it was very bad..",Followed home by something while walking in the bush,18
Benlightenment,1,4,1r3pbk,14,"So, my auntie used to work for a millionaire. Not the best kind though, the kind who got the millions by being lucky in the national lottery. He only won about 6 million or so, but it was enough to get him a fancy ass house, and to hire my aunt as a housekeeper/general helper woman.
His house was a kinda half-new project. There was an old bit of land with an old house sat on it just outside the city they lived in, which he bought up, and then built his house around that one. And then his garage, and a private gym... he wasn't clever with his money (and my aunt was stealing some too, which she went to prison for eventually, but that's another story).
So in the end, the guy pretty much bankrupts himself on silly business ventures and cars. He has to sell the house. At that point, I was staying with my aunt for a week or two for a little holiday, so she asked me if I wanted to come along while she had to clear some stuff out. Me, coming from a crappy little town, jumped at the chance to have a nosy around a millionaire's mansion.

Once we got there, my aunt took off into the kitchen, which is where Mr Millions was (his name was Lee, really). They basically said I can have a wander round, play on his Dreamcast (that was a mega thing for me at the time) and just don't mess around with stuff I shouldn't. Understandable.
So I wandered off, walked through a few of the mega living rooms with leather sofas and stuff. It was all pretty old, but I think that was more just because he'd bought it to look that way. I sat down and messed around on the Dreamcast for a bit, but got bored playing Quake and decided to go have another wander. He had a swimming pool, but I didn't have my trunks, so I was kinda lost for something to do. I figured I'd just go down the other end of the house where I hadn't been and see what else he had kicking around.

So, the house itself was a pretty standard layout. You know the mansion in Resident Evil 1? The entrance hall kinda looked like that, only it was dark colours and wood rather than white. Upstairs was basically just one long landing corridor which had loads of doors off it to bedrooms and stuff. At the very end was a double-door, which I'd never been through. Given the way the doors looked, I assumed they were part of the old house which he'd kept, so I went to have a look.

Inside was a pretty tiny room, considering the house. Probably could've fit two or three double beds in there at most. One side had a couple of armchairs and a little table, and the rest was like a little library, with a couple of bookcases free standing and the opposite wall to the chairs being a full bookcase wall, which was amazing to me at the time.
I figured there had to be something in here I wanted to read, so I went up along the wall of books just having a look what was there. It was all pretty standard stuff that you'd expect to buy just to fill up a bookcase. Dickens, Austen... that kinda stuff.

Now, from where I was, I couldn't see the doors anymore, cause the bookcases were in the way. So, not paying attention, when they slammed shut, I squealed like a girl and jumped almost out of my skin. Given the size of the house, I figured it was either the wind or someone closing the doors, not realising I was in here.

It wasn't, though. To this day, I still have no idea who did it (I say who rather than what, cause what is crazy) but both the doors were shut tight. But that wasn't the odd thing.
On the doorknobs was a book that had been placed there, balancing. So yeah, my gut is already going a bit weird at this point, cause that's just odd. The cover had bright colours though, so I assumed it was someone playing a prank. As I got close enough to read, I saw what it was: a kid's book. Innocent enough. Except for the title. 

“I See You”

It was some kind've of Peekaboo book for kids, but that didn't matter at the time. As soon as I read it, my blood froze and I ran out of there like a little bitch. 
I still don't know whether it was one of his family or not. The house has been pulled down since, though from what my auntie told me, the half that he built around is now a protected building, so it's still there, in pieces. 
She said it was haunted too, but that was only after I'd told her the story. It's about 10 years on now, and I still dunno what happened that day. Given that my aunt was thieving from the guy... it's not like I can ask him either.",The millionaire's library,18
Legendslator,0,8,1qxh4x,12,"""Welcome to Portdoor Inc., sir! How may I help you?"" Everyday when I walked into the Portdoor building in downtown New Orleans I was always greeted with those friendly words. ""Oh you know, the usual."" The clerk nodded and told me to follow her.

 Now before I go on, there is something you should know about Portdoor. It is a strange and wayward business. Off on a small side alley by Bourbon Street in New Orleans, Portdoor Inc. managed to make itself a nice little store and had relative success. Not many people know about it, but those who do, such as I, are the ones who can manage to afford the prices for the ""wares"" it sells.

As we enter the usual doors to get my destination I see that the have some new merchandise. ""I see you got elation and adrenaline today! I may have to try those out afterwards!"" The clerk nods and adds to my list the feelings of elation and adrenaline. We come to my stop, the happiness door. I thank the clerk and she leaves.

Here is another thing you should know about Portdoor Inc. The doors that it ships in don't open up to what's behind the door itself. The door is actually a portal into a room, hence the name port-door. The crazy thing about these doors is that when you open one and step inside, the room you go into contains all of the things that stir up one particular emotion in your brain. In this way it is different for everyone.

The happiness door. It was clearly labeled right above the handle what emotion I was about to experience. I opened the door and put my hand inside. I always loved this part. My hand began to tingle and I saw all the wrinkles fade away as smooth, youthful skin began to overtake it. I immediately jumped into the door, unable to contain my excitement. Suddenly, the door was gone and all of the things that had made me happy were in there! Cars, computers, food! All of my wonderful experiences in past years, there to relive again! I only had an hour today. I sold my house to get it. I figured I might as well do as much as I can. I ate my favorite foods, rode my dream car and then set off on a hiking trip in Africa I had back when I was 19. When I got to the end of the trail, the door back to reality was waiting for me. I checked my watch. I still had ten minutes. It must have been an error. Although going back and enjoying the last few minutes of happiness was very excruciatingly tempting, I went though the door hoping that they would give me some sort of refund for the error. However, when I stepped through the door, no one was there to greet me and take me back to the front. That never happened. Someone, usually armed, always took me back to the front. I remembered that I had asked to experience the new emotions they got in and so I figured that a clerk was going to come and take me there within the next few minutes. No one came. After waiting for what seemed like an hour, I decided to lol around. I went down one hallway and there was a door labeled ""Serenity."" I opened it and stuck my hand in and immediately felt at ease with myself. Wanting to explore further, I trekked deeper into the endless corridors of doors. ""Knowledgeable"", ""Funny"", ""Thrilling."" All of these doors and more were at my disposal! After leaving the new ""Adrenaline"" one, I wanted to find just one more before I ended my little escapade. I went through all the halls again and stopped at a hallway that wasn't there before. It was dimly lit and only contained one door at the end. I walked down it, still filled with adrenaline and testosterone and read the word ""Terrified."" I figured since I handled all the other doors well, this one would be a breeze. I opened it up and stuck my hand in. Immediately, the skin melted off my hand and blood began to pour out until all I could see was bone. Then my bones fell to the floor of the room. I was already terrified. I turned around to leave immediately, but when I did there was only the clerk. ""You should have stayed in your room until time was up."" Without warning, she shoved me into the room and closed the door.",Portdoor Inc.,20
REALreptus,4,13,1r8gsb,11,"I was about 13 living in CA at the time and like any other 13 year old kid I was best friends with the boy that lived down the street. We often spent the night at each other's houses, but when we spent the night over at his house I would always try to get him to agree for us to sleep out in his huge treehouse, we would stay up till dawn eating candy, chips, and playing playstation until our eyeballs hurt. I always asked him if we could sleep outside because the first and only time we ever slept in his house, I saw this ghost. The ghost himself was a tall man wearing a black coat with a big black hat that sort of looked that that cool hat that Hugh Jackman wears in Van Helsing, and he didn't have a solid or not solid form, I know that sounds weird, but it was like he was there, but wasn't at the same time. I guess the best way I could describe it would be like really thick black static in the shape of a really tall dude wearing a cloak and hat. Well my best friend's little sister would always talk about this guy in the hat, I think the exact way that she referred to him was ""The guy in the hat"", but we were to busy doing our own thing to ever listen to her, to us she was just my friend's annoying little sister that wanted to follow us around and do what we were doing. Well that night while we were playing video games, I glanced down his hallway and at the very end of it there was the man in the hat, but I had only glanced, and when I did a double take, he was gone, so I just ignored it. That sort of glance and disappear thing happened like 2 more times before we went to bed. Now what happened next is what made me never want to spend the night in his house again. We fell asleep just fine, no nightmares, no spooky visions before closing our eyes, but around 3am, no, not exactly 3am, I was young and scared and didn't look at the time, so I'm just guessing it was around 3am, every single radio in his house turned on at the same time and at full volume, and it wasn't music or even just static that played, it was this really deep and low pitch rumble that came out at full blast. It didn't say anything, I don't even know if it was a voice or anything, all I remember is that it scared the living shit out of me. His mom got up and shut off all the radios and yelled at us cause she thought we did it as a joke or something, and wouldn't listen to us when we said were where both sleeping when it happend. My family moved away about 6 months or so after this and I haven't heard from my friend since, I don't know anything about the house or the land or if there was a murder there or whatever, it's just something that happened to me as a kid and something I'll never forget.",I was about 13 when this happend at a friends house.,24

I’ve never had suicidal thoughts myself, I’ve been depressed but that’s just life, you can’t be happy all the time. 

**Most** people don’t think of the repercussions that can happen when they have suicidal thoughts as they just think that no one cares about them so they assume that they don’t have a reason to live and just want to end their lives.

Isn’t it weird how one thing can change your life drastically? From good to bad? I don’t know, I can’t explain it but I’ve always found it weird how one thing in the universe can make your life go from being good to bad or vice versa.

                                                                                                                                                                                              


My dad had a great friend (no names) once who was amazing, he had a job that he enjoyed a lot which was him being a train driver.

My dads friend was driving a train to Glasgow when out of nowhere, a person jumped onto the tracks and died instantly. When this happened, my dads friends life just stopped, I can’t really explain it myself as I wasn’t the driver, he was. 

But can you just imagine driving a train, not seeing/seeing a young person jump in front of a train whilst not being able to stop the train from hitting that person? With their blood splattering the window and tracks. I mean the average speed limit of being hit by a car going 30 miles per hour can kill you, just imagine being hit by a train going like 5 times faster than that.

After that happened, my dads friend was just at a loss, he felt like it was his fault as he was the driver. Nothing my dad said, my dads other friends and his family could cheer him up and his life was just spiraling downhill and it was just one thing after another that made him even more depressed and aggressive. 

It was 3 years ago today when my dads friend committed suicide.",Trauma NSFW,27

The vomit had soaked through the covers, moistened my legs, and cooled by the time I decided to move. The clock read Too Early; I had slept for nearly sixteen hours. Whatever. Once my mouth was rinsed and the bedding had been bundled up and tossed in the laundry room, I padded into the main living room to watch infomercials.

Dad was up at six. I didn't notice him until he slumped back into the couch beside me. He was the first to speak.

""Morning,"" he said quietly.

""Mm,"" I agreed.

""How long have you been up?""

""Since four.""

""I came in to check on you several times. Looked like you were having nightmares.""

""Yeah.""

""You were crying. Tossing and turning. I tried to wake you up."" He pulled up the sleeve of his robe to show me some scratches. ""You, uh, thought I was a bad guy.""

My eyes misted up as I drew my knees up to my chest. Words began to spill out. ""I'm sorry --""

Dad cut me off. ""Shh. It's fine. I know you didn't mean it.""

His voice was so gentle. The authoritarian figure that had watched over me with a stern gaze was gone. The fierce strength behind his eyes was broken, and this man had no fire left. All at once, the protectve shell of numbness cracked and shattered. I wanted my daddy. Without a word, I crawled over and laid my head on his shoulder. Two weeks ago, this act would have been inconceivable. Two weeks ago, Leanna was alive. Some shred of rational thought in the back of my head noted with muted shock that the roles we had played every day were nothing more than an artificial construct, an act we played out every day.

Dad wrapped me up in his arms, and we cried together until I lost track of time altogether. Inevitably, the tears stopped flowing, though neither of us made a move away from the other for another hour. Who was left to prop the two of us up but each other? We sat watching infomercials, one after the other, neither of us really caring for anything but the hypnotic power of the glowing screen.

My stomach growled. I remembered that I hadn't eaten. In the same breath, I realized that my head was pounding. I clutched at my stomach.

""Eggs okay?"" my dad murmured.

I nodded, still bent over.

Dad lifted his arm from my shoulders and stood up. In the span of that motion, the weight fell on his shoulders again and he walked slowly to the kitchen.

I scarfed down the eggs unceremoniously and thanked my dad. After that, I retired to my room and spent most of the day at my writing desk, staring at a blank sheet of paper. I took regular breaks to stare out the window at the trees waving in the wind.

Eventually, the sun sank below the treeline, and I began nodding. As I did, my heart skipped a beat. Would I wake up tomorrow tangled in the sheets, fearing that unknown terror at my heels?

In the end, I told myself that it was irrelevant. Sleep is inevitable. I still couldn't shake the feeling of impending doom, that I might face that terror again. As I slipped under the covers, I cast about in my mind, looking for anything to ease my fear. A memory came, of a lady in silver. The dream I had when I was little. Suddenly I missed that lady. I couldn't recall her face, but the feeling she brought with her was clear as day when I thought about it. She made me feel safe, protected, warm.

Tears leaked from between my closed eyelids. I missed my mom. I missed my sister. I wished I could dream of that lady just one more time. Nothing was more important. I dwelt on her memory, and the aching desire for that little bit of relief spread through my body until I craved her like a starving girl that smelled pizza.

I fell asleep thinking of nothing else. And then I woke up.

She was standing at the edge of my bed, and she was beautiful, an angel wrought in the finest, purest of silver. And I did't hurt. I stared at her, and she was beautiful, and she returned my gaze, a quizzical look on her perfect face. And she was beautiful. Her hair and gown flowed behind her in slow motion, defying gravity. She opened her mouth as if to speak, then closed it and paused and lowered her gaze. Her eyes drifted back up to me, and ...

""Can you see me?"" Her voice was the choir of heaven, the sweet whispers of a thousand mothers cooing at their newborn children. It echoed through time and space, it echoed within my mind, and my heart lifted up higher, higher, until the echoes died away. I found myself smiling, tears of joy misting my vision, blurring it into a shine of silver against the darkness of my room.

I could only nod.

""You can understand me."" Her accent was stilted as though she was deaf; I got the feeling that speech was mostly unnecessary for her.

I collapsed as the sorrows, heartbreaks, and betrayals of my past bled from my soul, all at once. A moment later, I was at peace. I sat up in a fluid motion, turning to the silver lady before me.

""Yes. I was hoping I'd dream of you. I'm so glad you're here.""

""This is no dream.""

I laughed. ""How could this be anything else?""

""I do not know. But I promise. No dream.""

I considered this for a time while the lady waited, motionless save for her gown and hair. Some part of me knew that nothing this apparition would tell me would ever be a lie. Nevertheless ... ""Alright. I'll just stay up all night, then. That should make it pretty obvious."" I grew serious. ""Will you stay with me? Can anybody else see you?""

""You called me. Not sure how. Usually death calls me. But no one will die here. I don't understand. You know death. You should not see me now.""

My jaw would have been hanging open, except I seemed incapable of registering surprise that could overpower the warmth radiating from the ethereal lady in front of me. As it was, I responded, ""Hmm,"" a sound less consideration than contentedness. ""Well, what are you?"" I said, after a lengthy pause. She responded with a pause of her own, dropping her gaze and softly stroking her chin. And then, I felt a whisper in my mind, the gentlest touch of wind as something made its way inside. Her eyes lit up, and I felt her happiness. She could communicate without speaking, I suddenly knew, and this way was much faster, more precise. I tried to think back at her, and she didn't respond. A look of confusion passed across my face, and then I understood that I'd have to project myself back for two-way communication. Telepathy wasn't nearly overpowering as the sound of her voice, or maybe I didn't have anything left inside me to soothe and fix. I realized that I had a thousand questions, and we began to converse; to an observer, it would appear as though I was having half a phone conversation. I can only summarize our exchange:

She didn't seem to know what or who she was. She had no name. She simply popped into existence one day.

""What's your earliest memory?""

Dark-skinned, brutish people in caves. A woman being raped while her child watched. A fleeting moment, blurred, before her world became darkness, a state she termed sleep.

Holy shit.

She came and went, and sometimes she was in many places at once. Rarely she was everywhere. The last time that happened, she described lots of people starving or shooting at each other. Patches on shirts and overcoats: triangles and stars. The holocaust. She was everywhere then.

Holy shit!

My jaw was, in fact, hanging open now. ""You were everywhere? In the entire universe?""

No, not the entire universe. Just the earth.

""The oceans too? All the land?""

No. Only where there were people.

""Why do I feel so much better when you're around?""

She shrugged, lines of sadness creasing her face like cracks in polished diamond. The tragedy of her expression threatened to break my heart, as though I was watching a snake eat a kitten. Suddenly I saw myself as a child, myself and my mother. I knew this to be the last time I would see my mom alive. The silver lady was embracing her, weeping tears like liquid pearl. I could see a swirling darkness surrounding the two of them, there but not there. The more closely I examined the miasma with this second sight, the more sinister it became. I began to see through it, as though it was a portal to another dimension of gnashing, swirling teeth and rotting flesh. I felt a cold, alien intelligence invade my mind, and then I was a bug under a microscope. My mind was aflame with pain and disgust, pushing through the dull opiate warmth of the lady's protection. The demonic thing was plotting, yearning, and I could taste its desire with my own tongue. My vision began to fade to black, and I was immersed in inky, single-minded hatred of unfathomable depth. Time lost its meaning, and then I was back in my room, unsure if a second had passed or a century.

The lady nodded, filling my mind with her own, and I understood; I had seen the hunger in the world, a faceless, timeless entity whose only purpose is to consume and destroy. And before me stood the force of light.

Dawn broke through my window.

nisyldaed,9,7,1r6mcx,11,"Someone once said ""The greatest strengt is to know your weaknesses."" Luckily I found that out quite Early. 
You might say that I've been blessed with a keen perception, so I always tended to grasp certain concepts and situations quicker than the peope around me, which quickly lead me to thinking that I was somehow superior to others.
Letting these thoughts and thus my hubris overtake me : that was and still is my greatest weakness, but ironically the very cause of my Pride allowed me to realise this very thing, so whether it's a blessing or a curse might be your own perspective.

My story begins with something that should have been a regular day at my university, you know: attending courses, not paying attention, browsing the internet on your phone, etc.
I can't really get into detail here, 
because my memorIes of what happened are really blurry, but I remember a loud crack, a bang and loud rumbling. The next Thing I know is waking up in the local hospital.
From what I've been told, the corridor I walked through that day collapsed without any reason and buried 5 students beneath it. I was the only survivor.

NOw, that event didn't really help with the aforementioned pride, quite the contrary:  I convinced myself that somehow I subconsciously saved myself from the collapsing ceiling and that my surival once again showed that I was better than the others wo died.
Once I fully realized what I just thought I couldn't help but feel disgusted by myself, but this was only the beginning of my descent.
Of course I went back to university after a fEw days, since I only had some bruises and a boken finger, and that's when the prideful Thoughts became more frequently and more aggressive. Word of my survival got around pretty quickly, since it's a small university, so everyone I knew and some people I didn't know came up to me and talked like I was some kind of miracle survivor, or in some cases even a hero. And, needless to say, I absolutely loved that. I also began to notice that I began to be more condescending towards other people. Sure, I've always had my share of disrespectful thoughts about some persons but ever since the accident I sometimes said things aloud and I Always hit them where it hurt, it was pathetic to watch.

After a few weeks things started to go bacK to normal, people wouldn't talk to me that much anymore and this bothered me to no end. They wern't giving me attention anymore. Had they forgotten what I waS? Had they forgotten that I WAS SUPERIOR?
It couldn't go on like this, they needed to be reMinded, reminded of the greatness that was mE, no, IS ME!

Remember the quote from the beginning? I think it's bullshit. Because one of the greatest strengths is actually to be a good liar. And what a great liar I am – I've been lying to you all the time!
They still haven't figured out that I blew up the corridor. Still don't know that I indeed survived the collapsing corridor by an accurate calculation. 

And next time I'll be showing them my true greatness, it will be a lasting reminder.",Pride,18
Bodysseus,7,12,1qt0vq,12,"[Part 6](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q4yfq/i_can_turn_invisible_part_6/)

I was completely surrounded. 20 or more police and SWAT team members aiming their weapons at me, waiting for me to drop the revolver. I let out a long sigh, knowing that whatever road this was going to go down, it was finally over. No one else had to get hurt.

""**I SAID DROP THE GUN, OR WE WILL SHOOT!**""

Their lights still blinding me. I thought about making a run for it, but they would shoot me as soon as I took a step. After I shot Rose and she was nowhere to be found, I started to think that maybe this was all in my head. Maybe I was just going insane, and something triggered me to go on a killing spree and have some kind of made up justification for it, thinking that I could turn invisible and force people to kill themselves.

I hear them shifting closer. They probably thought that I was a psycho and I was just going to start shooting, like I was suicidal.

That's when it occurred to me.

I have never thought about suicide before. The act of killing was one thing, but taking your own life was something that I felt was more cowardly and weak. I've also never had a reason to kill myself, until now. If I was insane, I could end it. There wouldn't be anymore people dying at my own hands. There wouldn't be anymore of me left to take control of, or take into captivity. Everything would just go away, and that idea seemed more suitable than living in a padded room and taking crazy pills for the rest of my life. Also, I could see Alice and John again. Explain to them what was going on before they had left this world. I wasn't sure if there was a heaven or a God at this point. I figured if there was a God, he must be super pissed off at me for something. The only way to find out, was to take the easy way out, and just end it all.

Both my hands were in the air, as the police were waiting for me to drop my weapon. I brought my right hand slowly down towards my head, while closing my eyes. Finger on the trigger, I was ready to take my own life.

""**DON'T DO IT! WE CAN HELP YOU!**""

I heard one of the men yell out to me, pleading me to think about what I was about to do. He doesn't know what I have been through. He doesn't know that I have already thought about what I was going to do, and it was only for the best for everyone.

A million thoughts went through my head. I squeezed the trigger slowly and it felt like years were passing by. The years were actually memories of my entire life. It's funny, because everyone always says that your whole life flashes before your eyes right before you die. How would any of them know that it's true if they're already dead? I see visions of my mother, how sweet she looks with her long brown hair and the little smile she always had on her face. I see my brother as we're playing in the backyard where the pool used to be like we did when we were younger. I wonder what he would think of me at this moment. My father appears, telling me how weak I am for letting things come to this. He always wanted me to be a strong man, and keep my head straight. Then I see Alice. All the times we were running late for a dinner reservation only to have our table taken by someone else, and we'd have to pick up a pizza and watch movies in our apartment instead. How she would spend most of her time cleaning and scrubbing the kitchen and the bathroom because she wanted everything to be squeaky clean. I remember the times when I would be cramming for an exam and she would always come sit on my lap and help me take my mind off of all the bullshit. In my moments of clarity, Rose appears. I see her smiling that evil, deceitful smile that she always wore. Then it all goes black. And it stays black.

""Hey pal, we're closing up. Time to go home.""

I open my eyes, and I see a man standing there. He was nudging my shoulder, trying to get me to move. Immediately I knew where I was. I was at the bar, sitting in the same booth that I was sitting when I had first met Rose. Was I asleep the whole time? I picked my head up and looked around. The bar was dark and empty. The stools and chairs were all flipped upside down and placed on the bar and tables.

""Come on man. I let you sleep off the alcohol while I closed up shop, now it's time for you to go.""

It was the bartender. The one who ignored me when I asked him for a drink. I needed to be sure that this was all a dream, and Rose wasn't playing a sick joke on me, or I wasn't really dead.

""Hey man, what day is today?""

""Seriously? It's Thursday. Did someone drug you or something?""

""No, no. I don't think so. Was there a red headed woman sitting here at all tonight?""

He gave me the most confused look, like I had completely lost my mind.

""No man. It was just you. You came in, ordered a drink, left it at the bar, and came back here and passed out. You sure you didn't drink anything before you came here? Someone could have drugged you. This is a college town, that type of shit happens all the time.""

No red headed woman, meant that I actually had never met Rose. It also meant that I dreamed the entire thing, and I wasn't actually going insane. None of it actually happened. I never turned invisible, I never killed anyone, the police were never trying to find me, I never killed myself. There was only one thing that I needed to do to make sure that it wasn't real and that it was all just an extremely vivid dream. I needed to make sure Alice was still alive.

I got up and headed for the door. Right before I pushed it open, I turned to the bartender who was still standing there, watching me. For shits and giggles, I snapped my fingers and looked at him. His eyes got a little wide, and he continued to stare in my direction. I got worried, thinking that if I could still turn invisible then all of it was real.

""Can you see me?""

He still stared in my direction for a good 30 seconds.

""Yes I can still see you man. Get the fuck out of my bar!""

A sigh of relief, and I was out the door with a smile on my face. I never thought I would see the day that I would be so happy about waking up from a dream. Usually I never want to wake up, but this time was different. This wasn't a dream. It was a fucking nightmare.

I walked at a quick pace from the bar towards Alice's house. Along the way I thought about how great everything was. I appreciated things a lot more. For once in my life, I was more than thankful to be alive. I was given something that most people don't get: a second chance.

I arrived at Alice's house and the whole place was quiet. No party, no loud noises, no music. It felt a little awkward being there, since we had just broken up and I assumed the last person she wanted to see was me. I knocked on the door anyways. I knew it was super late, but as long as I knew she was ok, I would take the lashing that she would give me. The door opens, and there she was. As beautiful as when I had last seen her.

""Bo? What are you doing here? It's 4 in the morning.""

""I know, I'm really sorry. This is going to sound weird, but I just needed to make sure that you were ok. I had a really bad feeling about tonight.""

She rubbed her eyes a bit and looked up at me. Then she smiled, and it made me feel at ease.

""To be honest, I have been thinking about you all night. I'm actually really happy you showed up here. Do you want to come inside and talk?""

It felt so good to hear her say that. Not only was she still alive, but she was willing to work things out to let me back in her life. I didn't care what it was that she wanted me to change about myself. After I had watched her die, I was willing to do anything to keep her close, and never lose her again.

We walked into her living room and sat on the couch. I chuckled to myself a little, remembering the two girls that were sitting there in my dream that I dumped a beer on. We sat there and looked at each other with smiles on our faces. I think we both felt the same way about how we regret letting things go sour with our relationship. After a few small conversations about our nights, Alice gets up and heads for the kitchen to make us some hot cocoa. I lean back on the couch and stare into space as I become more and more thankful with how things are turning out. A quick gaze around the room and something catches my eye. Instantly it stopped my heart. On the mantle, next to the television on the other side of the room, was a napkin folded into a rose. I got up from the couch, walked directly to it, and picked it up. It was exactly like the rose that was on my dashboard in my dream.

""Hey, Alice. Where did you get this rose napkin from?""

She calls from the kitchen as I hear her preparing our hot chocolate.

""Oh, yeah that thing's cool, huh? My sister made it for me before she passed away a few years ago.""

As quickly as I had gotten that nervous feeling, it all went away when she told me that it was her sisters who had died. I put it back down on the mantle and sat back down on the couch.

""That's pretty neat that she was able to do that.""

She walks back into the living room and sits down next to me, handing me a warm coffee cup with hot chocolate in it.

""Yeah, she was pretty talented at a lot of things. You would have loved her. Her name was Rose.""",I Can Turn Invisible: Final Update,24
TheOthersAreComing,8,7,1qsvy3,12,"   Ever since I was a child living in my family's house, I've seen them. The skeletal hands, reaching out of my closet, somehow so visible in the darkness. And the voices whispering, telling me to come with them. Promising the fear would stop if I just went with them. At first, it would all go away if I turned on the lights, and I could convince myself it was somehow my imagination. But they didn't like that. They started laughing at me whenever I would turn on the lights to try to get them to leave. It's so humiliating when they laugh at me.

   The voices got so much louder. My parents didn't believe me until I started waking them up in the middle of the night with my screaming. The Others were still there when my parents came into my room. How did they not see them? My parents gave me pills and told me they were for my schizophrenia. I stopped taking my pills because it made the Others laugh at me. It's so humiliating when they laugh at me.

   I'm always exhausted, and I was then too, but the Others always tell me I don't need to sleep. They tell me if I come with them it'll be so much better than sleep. That's the one thing I never did for them. But I always listen to them because they're the only ones who believe me.

   I guess I got older. I don't really notice time passing. Time is meaningless. Everything is meaningless, except the Others. You'll learn that. They taught me that. They taught me so much. They tell me they'll teach me more when I go with them. I moved out of my family's house but of course, the Others moved with me, to my new closet. I'm with them now. You'll be with them soon too.

  See, I went with them finally. I waited till night and until the hands and voices came. Then I opened the closet doors and stepped inside. There are so many of them. It's such an honor to be one of them. Being there is everything they told me it would be. And they never laugh at me. It used to be so humiliating when they would do that. Now I laugh with them.

Dectrek,12,10,1qqf0w,11,"I’m bipolar. No really, I’ve been diagnosed by a doctor and show all the symptoms that any bipolar person would show. I have highs and lows which I switch into over periods of time and act accordingly to the descriptions of each. During my highs, thousands of ideas rush through my head, most of which are projects that I will begin to work on seconds after I thought of them. Some I don't finish because I will think of something new and abandon whatever I was just doing while others I finish but have no use for them. I get little sleep during these periods of time and I will talk really fast, crack jokes constantly, and be extremely friendly to everyone I meet. 

Then there are my lows. During my lows I become Depressed, Tired, and a bit bitter. I'll sleep for hours on end; I could sleep for a week and still be tired when I'm on my low. I become mean and anti-social; sometimes I'll even lose friends that I made during a high or destroy a project that I had made while on a high. I begin to think I'm worthless and have thoughts of suicide.

But there is always one friend who stays with me no matter what mood I'm in, a friend who tells me that I'm not worthless, a friend who stops any suicide attempts, a friend who is there for me, a friend who would do anything for me no matter how extreme, a friend who's name is Dan. I met Dan at a self-help group for those with mental illnesses. As soon as I meet him, he was almost as nice as the people who ran the meeting, but he was realistic. We became good friends and I asked what mental illness he had. He was a schizophrenic. Occasionally he would hear a voice in his head or see something that wasn’t there and trip on nothing, but it wasn’t really bad. In fact, it was a bit funny and tended to make me feel a bit better when on a low, even though I felt cruel for laughing at him, but he usually just smiled and carried on.

I felt like I owed him something for being such a good friend, so I invited him up to my cottage in Wisconsin. We would only go up for a weekend, and when I asked Dan if he could go, he said yes. We drove up in high spirits (My spirit probably a little higher) and began to unpack. As we unpacked, I noticed that Dan hadn’t brought any medication. I asked him where his medication was and he said, “I guess I left it at home, well that’s too bad.”

“Don’t you need the medication so you don’t have an attack?” I asked.

“My condition is minor, I can go one little weekend without it and be fine,” Dan answered. I was a bit unsure but decided that he probably knew more about his condition then I did and that I should forget about it. We spent the day going into town and going to bars, but it eventually got dark and was time to go home. This is when I sunk into a low. I noticed it when I became drowsy and lethargic. Dan was just going to have to put up with my depression for a little while.

When we got home we were setting up mattress in the main room because I was having work done on in the bedrooms. Dan was talking about how his son was doing in little league when he abruptly stopped. He stared at the corner of the room which was empty.
“What are you looking at,” I suspiciously asked.
“What… oh…nothing I just thought I saw someone in the corner,” He replied as he came out of his transfixed state. I became a little suspicious, but assumed it was an attack.

I was sleeping when it first happened. Dan’s screams woke me up and I looked at his thrashing body under the sheets. He was screaming, “He’s got me!” and “Someone help me!” I woke him up and he was in frantic state. He told me a man had come into his bed and tried to suffocate him. He described the man as having one eye and an empty bleeding socket. The man’s face was pale and dirty, and he had a crocked nose. A fedora covered his messy black hair and he was wearing a trench coat. At this time I had no patience for I was well into one of my lows and I told him to go back to bed. I reminded him that it was probably just an attack, but he pleaded that it was real and that he even felt the blood drip onto his face. I told him there was no blood on his face and that he should go back to sleep.

The second attack was worse than the first. When I heard the screams I tried to ignore them because I was tired, but then he started to choke himself. I stopped him and asked him what he thought he was doing. 

“He came back!” He nervously said, “He tried to choking me!”

“You were choking yourself!” I angrily yelled, “Now calm down! There is no man, no one tried to choke you, and I need some sleep!”

I was furious with him, but mostly because I was in a low. Looking back at the experience, I feel bad but it was part of my condition. I couldn’t help myself, and that’s all in the past now.

When the last attack came, I was too late. I woke up to find that he had choked himself to death. I looked at him, and began to sob. Why hadn’t I tried to calm him down more? Why didn’t I sit up with him until he felt better? Why did I invite him on this stupid trip? These were all questions that ran through my head as I drove to the hospital.

Now you may be wondering why I told you this. Was it so that I could bum you out, or was it to help me get over this tragic event that recently happened to me. Actually, it’s neither. The real reason I told you this story was because of what happened back at Dan’s hometown. The body had been transferred to there and they brought me in to figure out what had happened.

“I told the doctor at the hospital up in Wisconsin,” I said, “Dan choked himself to death in the middle of the night.”

“But why would he do such a thing,” the doctor questioned as if this question had been bothering him for a while.

“Because he has schizophrenia,” I told him, “He thought someone was choking him so he panicked.”
 
“Dan doesn’t have schizophrenia,” the doctor said as he looked at Dan’s files, “There’s nothing in here about him having any mental illness of any sort.”

I was confused at first, but then everything began to click. Dan was a friend who would do anything for me, no matter how extreme. Dan was almost as nice as the people who ran the meeting…. as if he did run the meeting. Dan always smiled when I laughed at him for tripping on nothing, as if he didn’t care… because they were meant to make me laugh. Dan always stopped my suicide attempts, was always there for me… as if he would do anything, anything at all, even fake an illness to make me feel better. Dan wasn’t a schizophrenic, and he didn’t imagine things.

IntricateVenom,8,4,1r2dyl,12,"I've known that I have had this ability since I was six. Actually it all started when I was six.

I can see spirits. I see them sometimes like normal people, but they have a sort of ""glimmer"" to them. In all of my encounters I have never been to speak to one, but they don't need to; their expressions tell me all I need to know.

As I said, this all started at the age of six. My mother and I moved into an old house that was built in the 1910's. There was another house next to it that was a complete mirror image of the one I lived in. The history was that the houses were built by two twins. One twin was a good man, while the other had a sadistic side. He was a murderer and he alone had killed around 6 people in his house (which was the one I lived next to). To this day, around 20 people have been murdered in that house.

Anyway one night I was in my room staring at the ceiling (I have insomnia so it's quite hard for me to sleep) when suddenly, I got this immense feeling of anger and fury. However, the feeling wasn't coming from my house, or even from myself, but the house next door. I got out of bed and looked out the window and I will never forget what I saw.

Staring out of the window across from me was a man who had to be in his late 40's. His face was contorted into a meanful scowl. He was wearing old tattered clothes. He was staring right at me; right into my very soul. Then, almost instantly, he vanished. I started to cry really loud and eventually my mom came running in. I told her what had happened but she didn't really believe me.

Fast forward to 16. I've been seeing spirits all the time but only when I'm ""tuned in"". This is the best way I can describe it. Its almost like tuning a radio to the right channel. I've found that once I ""tune in"" I can see spirits in all kinds of forms and shapes. However, one night when I was 16, I found that i can see more than spirits.

When I was 16 my friend and I were big into the paranormal and we liked to go to graveyards and such to see what we can find. On this day we decided to go to one of the most haunted graveyards in our state - Dice Roads Cemetary. There have been lots of people encountering things there so we decided to go. 

Apon arriving there, I become overwelmed with a sense of dread, sorrow, anger, sadness and everything inbetween. Besides that it looked pretty normal. We did some walking, some voice recording, normal shit, and finally we were standing outside the car talking when it happened. It was around 3 in the morning when I saw a shadow move. I clicked on the flashlight and moved it over to that spot, yet nothing was there. I decided at this point to tune in and see what I could find. When I was certain I was tuned in, I opened my eyes and immediately wished I hadn't. 

In the graveyard floating were a pair of blood red eyes and they were staring right at me. They were full of hatred, scorn, and just pure evil. Time seemed to have stopped and I just kept staring at those eyes. I couldn't look away. Then, all of a sudden, they rushed forward with lighning speed, out of the graveyard, and directly through me. What happened next is a bit fuzzy. I remember feeling all sorts of emotions and having many intricate thoughts. Then everything goes black. The next thing I know, I awake to find my friend knelt down next to me shaking me. He said that I had uttered one word before i fell. 

Destroy.

The entire ride back i was physically sick to the stomach and had a massive headache.I've never gone back to that place and never will. I'm 17 now, and Ive gotten a lot better at controlling what I see. 

These are only two of the many stories I have to share, but I felt these were thew most important. I just wish that I could forget some of the things I've seen. I also hope others are like me and see where I'm coming from. I'm going to keep working on it, and use this ability to possibly help othersw in the future. ",My Ability,16
lionelflores,4,3,1qzwqw,11,"Before I go on with the story I want to say that I was raised from a culture where Brujaria (witchcraft kind of) and superstition is big.  But I do not consider my experiences that happened to be linked to that.  Toward the latter part of the story I was working on a research paper that had research on La Santa Muerte.  

This happened a few years back (2009) at the University of Houston.  It was my first year attending the college and I had moved into brand new lofts that had just opened on campus.  Toward the middle of my first semester I had woke up one day with scratches.  I noticed the scratches when I was taking a shower.  The water would sting once it hit them.  They were in sets of 3s.  One set was on the right side of my body. I did not think too much of them though.  Later on that day my buddy had called me to hang out.  He lived a couple of floors down from me so we were talking at the lounge.  He randomly mentioned that he had woken up with scratches as well.  It was a weird coincidence, but we did not take it too serious at the time.  

School and life got really busy and it was not until another semester that we were able to hang out again.  A day before he had called me to hang out, though, I had again awaken with scratches.  They were sets of 3 scratches around my body,  One set under my left eye, one set on my right side of my body and 2 sets on the left side of my body.  I had noticed the same way I noticed my first scratches.  The water had stung while in the shower.  I had not mentioned the scratches to my friend the day we hung out.  There was a distinct scratch on his neck when I saw him.  I asked him about it and he said that he had woken up with it.  He said that it was bleeding a little bit also when he woke up.  I told him about the scratches that I woke up with a day prior and we were in shock, it seemed like too much of a coincidence but we could not think of anything that could have caused this.  

I had moved out the the following semester to another complex (the one I had moved into was previously a hospital, and the basement still had some of the original tile.  I was not aware of this when I signed the lease, but nothing weird happened the 1.5 years I was living there).  My old neighbor, of which I was good friends with at the time and knew the story, had called my one night to come over quickly.  When I got there she had shown me scratches that she had awaken with.  They were sets of 3s and had kind of made an upside down triangle on her back.  I stayed there a while with her and her roommate to talk but could never piece together the puzzle.  

I am living somewhere else now in Houston.  I have experienced a couple of things in the townhouse I live in now, not scratch related.  My buddy has contacted me a few times to hang out.  And once because he had, again, awaken with scratches, but this time it was just him.  

I am not sure what how the scratches got there or why they happened to us.  I think about it a lot",Night Scratches,14
koolgirl34,1,12,1qxq3p,10,"So, this is a kinda follow up story to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qufp4/the_shadowy_figure_in_the_field/) involving more shadows. The last story was when I was around 9 years old, and this one is from earlier this year. These shadows have popped up throughout my life, mostly at my grandparent's property. Sometimes they carried messages, strong emotions, and once or twice auditory and visual hallucinations. Yes, I have gone to psychics and spiritual people for explanations, and their answer is that my spirit (or variations of my ""spirit"") was inhumanly strong, and I had connections to the spirit world, (underworld, whatever) or whatever you want to call the place dead people go. However I've learned to just accept it, and whenever a shadow moves in the distance, and a strong wave of emotion rolls over, to just hold my breath and wait for it to be over. I know I said I was going to tell the story of the abandoned house next door, but this one is more scary, and had more of a impact on me, and I thought you'd enjoy it more.  

Now onto the story, it was a cold fall day, and I was wearing my long jacket that went to my ankles. I was quietly deciding what I wanted in a corner store. Its *very* hard to pick between brands of chocolate bars. Anyway, I felt the hairs on the back of my neck raise, as they do when a experience is about to happen. I looked to my right and a small shadow about the size of a 5 or 6 year old boy is standing there. This is one of the very few that have happened in public. He then points at the female clerk behind the counter and says, ""Thats my mommy."". Then a stream of images flood my mind. A necklace with a key that has a heart on it. A boy's room with cars scattered around it. A little boy watching TV while playing with some toys. Children running around at recess. Finally a image of a bald man appears. My chest tightens, and it gets tougher and tougher to breath. To stop myself from panicking, I remind myself that it will go away, and that its only the product of my mind. It releases and I take a *deep* breath. The boy's shadow shifts and he says, ""Daddy took that all away from me. He's a *bad* *bad* man."" He then shifts again, and points towards the clerk, ""Go say hi to mommy for me. She is very sad.""  

I walk over and put my chocolate bar and bags of milk on the counter. As she rings them up, I politely ask if she lost a son. Her hazel eyes fill with rage, and she growls, ""Yea. What about it."" I didn't want to have to explain all of my ""gifts"" right then, so I gestured towards the shadowy boy and say, ""Well, he is right here."". Her facial expression told me not to go any further. In fact every bone in my body told me not to start the conversation in the first place. I quietly ask if it had anything to do with a bald man, and suffocation. At this point I've already paid, and she leans on the counter and says,""I don't believe you. I need actual proof."" The boy shifts, and says, ""Tell her about the necklace. Its in her right pocket."" I do as he says and tell her about the necklace and that its in her right pocket. The boy quickly tells me that her name is Clara. Her beautiful name matches her body. Very petite, with long untied black hair, hazel eyes, and a tan skin colour. I'm almost the exact opposite with long brown hair, dark blue eyes, and a tall body build. She slowly reaches into her pocket and I notice the scabs on her wrist. Too straight to be accidental. They cut all the across her wrist and go all the way down her arm. She pulls out the necklace and places it on the counter. That's when I look at her face, and see her eyes are light, and almost jolly, with a wide grin spread on her face.  

At first I thought she was relieved to know that her son is happy. Then her eyes turned dark and I could tell she's already formed a plan that does not involve the keeping of my life. I instinctively take a couple steps back and the boy moves in front of the counter. Clara's head snaps forward, and she pulls out a bloody swiss army knife. The boy asks, ""Mommy, why? Why didn't you stop him? Please stop hurting yourself, because *I* *love* *you*."". At the time, the words didn't really sink in, but later that night I had to drink some alcohol to try and wash the words from my memory. I still have nightmares. A wave of helplessness washes over me, encases me like a coffin. I push the emotion aside, and say in a strong voice, ""Clara, stop. Your son **needs** you to stop it right *now*."". Her eyes peek out from the cloud of black hair. I told her word for word what the little boy told me.  

She never did cut into her wrists that day. I wouldn't call myself a hero for it, but rather the little boy for telling me to get her help. She was already getting treated for depression, and what-not but I encouraged her to get more help. The moment after I told her what her son told me, she dropped the blade and cried. She ended up calling her friend to take her to her therapist, and I never left until she was safely in the car. We still keep in touch, in case she ever needs to talk to her son, however I couldn't guarantee that her son would come every time. She is doing a lot better today.  

I had a lot of alcohol that night.",The Shadow Boy,22
Lady_rosalie,5,6,1qv5id,10,"Now, this is a second hand story, but one that always chills me. It happened to my mother, and she's telling me this as I type. But first a little background.

My mother had been an LVN for a long, long time. Before I was born, she worked at an old hospital. At the time it was known as Bathenia. It was owned by Catholic nuns until about the late 1990s or early 2000s when the city bought it and changed it to united regional. The whole place was spooky, according to my mom, but there was one night she'd never forget. 

""The second floor was the worst of the whole hospital. Since it was the ICU, many people died in that wing [the one I was working in]. Odd things always happened. There was an elevator that would go up and down and open on all the floors even though no one was in them. And I remember matinence would turn them off at night to keep down the noise. Sure they had a key you could turn, but the elevators were never on when they did this. That became common place though. At the end of the wing, it was L shaped, was rooms we almost never used. They would be used for storage. Everything in that room was turned off. We had finished our rounds when I saw a shadow figure go from one room to the other. I shivered and stared. It didn't happen again, but I knew no one would be down there. They shouldn't be anyway. My coworker hadn't seen it, but I nudged her. 

'Did you see that?'

'No. What is it?' She whispered. 

'I saw someone. You know we have to check it out.' I said. My coworker shook her head. 

'No way Nancy!' She said, staring at the spot like I was.

For a moment everything was silent. Nothing moved or anything. Suddenly the shadow crossed again, but this time my coworker saw it. She gasped and we argued about going. 

'Chris we have to go check it out. We have to.' I said, determined. I was not going to let an intruder in on my watch. We go down there together and nothing was there. No one I should say. Nothing was disturbed and I was beginning to think that I was imagining things when suddenly the tv turned on in the other room. We ran in and the tv turned off and on and off again. Chris unplugged it, but once again it turned on, as well a s the light to the room. We stared as a shadow ran past us into the other room. The call light blinked on the other room and I went in and turned it off. 

'Leave, now.' I ordered. It got quiet again, and everything turned off. We went back to work, though we were shaken up. Hours passed and eventually we recovered. I have no idea what was going on, and it never happened again after that, not that I know of.""

bebadhavefun,2,4,1r3ema,9,"Hey guys, well, I'm a new user but I've been reading NoSleep for about a year now, though I never felt like sharing my ""supernatural"" experiences until now. In time, I'll post more, but I feel the need to start with something that brings tears to my eyes to this day.

It was mid-2011 and I was on my winter break, my mother was working her night shift and I was alone in the house with my little brother (who was 7 years old at the time). 

At around 1 AM, I started to feel sleepy so I turned off the computer and headed to the bathroom to grab some toilet paper in case my flu got worse during the night. 

As soon as I get to the bathroom I notice two things: The first, outside it was raining incredibly hard and the second, the dog had followed me to the bathroom and was whining softly while he waited for me to come out. Being a recently adopted dog (We've had him for a week or so back then) I didn't think much of it, ""Maybe he's afraid of the rain"" I thought as I headed out and closed the door.

That was when I saw it. A couple of meters to my left, through the half open door that leads to the garden, something that made me question my sanity. 

It was a...creature, I guess. Taller than the door frame, covered in thick light brown hair that walked in two feet. I saw it for a split second before it hid behind the wall. I thought I was hallucinating -even though I've never been skeptical- so my first impulse was to open the door to see what the hell was that. It was the moment my dog got in the way between me and the door, shaking, whining and showing his teeth at me to keep me away. As I said, we hadn't had Morrison for too long and I didn't want to get bitten, so I backed off to the kitchen trying to wrap my head around what was going on. 

Suddenly, the sound of scratching on the walls made me jump. It seemed to come from everywhere and Morrison started barking at this. I made him shut up and, in desperation, I grabbed the biggest knife I found in a drawer and stayed there in the middle of the kitchen, shaking because of the cold and the situation I was.

The scratching faded in the rain and for a moment, I thought everything was alright. That until the door swung open and slammed back shut, making me jump and run to get the hell out of there and lock myself in my brother's room with the dog, still holding the knife tightly. 

I remember hearing soft ""bangs"" on the door outside that started to get louder and louder each time and I just covered my ears, praying to anyone who could hear me for it to stop. But it didn't.

When it became too much for me, I gained enough courage to go outside and put a couple of chairs against the door just in case. When I came back inside leaving every light in the house on, a few minutes passed by before I heard a loud bang outside the room. I knew that, whatever it was, was trying to get inside, so I opened the bedroom door and looked down the hallway: The chairs I had put against the door were knocked down and the door was wide open. I could only shake my head in disbelief as I came back to sit on the edge of my brother's bed holding the knife -that seemed to be useless by then-.

I don't know at which point I fell asleep, but my mother woke me up at around 8 in the morning and asked why wasn't I in my room and what was all the mess with the chairs in the hallway. I told her, she didn't believe me and I'm pretty sure I'll never know what the hell was that thing.

TreasureHouseofDoom,14,48,1r396v,9,"Channeling Aunt Lucia’s strength and wit, remarkable as both had always been, I felt myself fortified for what lay ahead, but that didn’t mean I was completely unafraid.  Fear and anxiety are nearly interchangeable in certain situations, and shedding them completely is not always the wisest approach.  Composure maintained, I dealt now with redirecting the bases of these emotions into something productive and controllable.  I remembered my mother’s fearlessness, the way she seized every opportunity to create and do good, the inner power she exuded. This I channeled, too.  Sisters in unison (one living and one passed on) to strengthen me, I was sure I carried now a shield of sorts.  Across the miles, as if she knew the battle I faced, I could almost hear my mother say, “Keep your head up, Julianne.  Stay focused.  Do good work.”  This was her mantra, and as far as I knew, it had never failed her.
Laughter rose from the study again, and I was about to step through the door, open myself to the onslaught, when I caught the fragrance of chocolate on the air, warm wafts from just beyond the door from the foyer to the hall.  I heard the voices of children, conversation and giggling, just beyond that, too.  Instinct told me this is where I was needed most.  Dulcie wanted me to follow her into the study, and in her realm, there was no telling what might happen, but Mary’s presence was just ahead of me, and it was possible I would have the opportunity to observe more of the events that had led to terrible schism between friends.
Doors shut and power out, the hall was dark, and the musty odor of rooms not allowed to breathe hung in the air.  I tried but couldn’t recall if I had smelled this odor the night before.  The chill and dank fragrance felt captive, too, as if I were stepping into some forgotten time and place.  It was completely possible that I was, that I had discovered some portal, that Mary had provided one.  Passing doors, I heard the sounds of the once living in other spaces, the turn of a music box in a nursery, the zip and knock of a trestle-powered sewing machine, probably a Singer like the one my mother used as a plant stand at home, the coos of a baby and the lullaby her Mama sang.  These memories, vital and vibrant, empowered me, too.  There was good energy about this place, and I allowed it to circulate now through me.  
Three doors I passed to either side, and I was just about to open the door to the kitchen, when a fourth door to the right opened slightly.  Through the slim space provided, I heard the singsong voice of Dulcie, coy and friendly, beckon, “Won’t you come play with us, Julianne?” In the background, the festive tones of a calliope rose and fell, and I found myself reminded suddenly of a wonderful memory from my childhood.  My siblings and I had been treated to a day at the North Carolina State Fair, where my mother had introduced us to a man she knew from antiques auctions.  He’d shown us the most glorious old calliope, and he’d had a real pet monkey named Clayton the Scoundrel.  
These are the old tricks of angry spirits, to tease some memory out of us, exploit and make it vile, distract good people from good works.  I knew this, but I longed, too, for simpler days, days when my sister, brothers, and I were among familiar people in a familiar place, days when we were too young and innocent to recognize the darkness in others.  
‘Julianne,” familiar voice from the kitchen prevailed, and as I reached for the cool brass doorknob, I knew immediately whom I would find on the other side.  
“Aunt Lucia,” tears stung my eyes, but joy filled my heart.  Three years she had been gone, on the other side, only her voice to guide me, so much more than most others ever had again of a loved one, but now she stood in front of me, poised, pretty, powerful.  Emanating from her in golden beams was the very energy she had radiated in life. “How can this be?”
Aunt Lucia’s smile was warm invitation into the kitchen.  ‘Forgive me, but I worried you wouldn’t get the fudge just right.’ And she laughed at me as others of our family often did.  I was neither a baker nor a cook, ‘but she is a Kook!’ my sister might have said.
‘These young ladies have just introduced me to Vassar fudge.’ And now I saw Mary at the island in Seth’s ultra swank kitchen measuring out white sugar.  Across from her stood Dulcie, her expression perplexed.
‘Miss Lucia, wouldn’t it all be better with more sugar and perhaps a little more cream,’ she asked, but Aunt Lucia only laughed sweetly.
‘Well, Sweet Dulcie,’ she began as if she had known Dulcie Moseley for years, ‘why don’t you tell me.  Isn’t it a Moseley who sent this recipe to you from Vassar, and didn’t she help to invent this sweet confection?’ Aunt Lucia had such a way with children always.  ‘Never ask a yes or no question,’ she had often told me. ‘Always engage a child.  If necessary be wrong so that they may be right.’ I remembered this as she winked at me over Dulcie’s golden head.
‘Well, no, Ma’am. My Aunt Mae did send this, but she isn’t a Moseley; she’s a Baker, on my mother’s side,’ and she and Mary burst into laughter as if her aunt’s being a Baker who sends fudge recipes was just about the funniest thing they’d ever heard.
‘Or she could be a Boiler or a Cook,’ Mary giggled.  I watched in some awe as the two girls exchanged looks of pure love, deep respect, and as my Aunt mitigated whatever memory might endanger this momentary union. 
Now she turned to me, expression earnest, voice so soft I practically had to read her lips to understand her words. ‘Mary is a pip and an angel, but there’s deep sorrow about her, and Dulcie really is a sweet girl, good and kind, but the anger that rages in her spirit is pure fire. You must handle this all very carefully, cautiously, and you mustn’t lose either your temper or your control.’
This was the way of the women in my family.  Always they’d presume that the younger women were ready for anything, too, that we could accomplish anything we set our minds to, that our minds over matters-at-hand would suffice.
“How did I get myself into this mess,” I said out loud, and Aunt Lucia raised finely sculpted eyebrows, as if to ask, ‘You mean you don’t know?’ and suddenly I was reminded of the walk through the cemetery, the prank gone too far, the Ouija board I’d promised my mother I’d never used.
‘How you came to be in the middle of this is no longer the issue. What matters is how you plan to get yourself out.’ And her insistence that I must disengage myself only after my promise to Mary was satisfied was implicit.  There really was no other way.  Now she only mouthed without even a hint of whisper, ‘Don’t bring home any hitchhikers,’ and I understood her warning.  There are people who live their lives under the shadows of dark, sad spirits, hitchhikers who will never find their paths home. To be under such shadow would be detriment not only to me but also to anyone who loved me.
“But what do I do?” I asked Aunt Lucia.  And perhaps some answer would have come if only I had been strong enough to hold this lively memory open longer.  Instead, I felt the collapse of these exhausted spirits in front of me, and in moments the vision in the kitchen they had never known had faded.  Only red and black trim against the swank white and stainless of the kitchen Seth’s mother had designed remained, or so I thought at first, but as I investigated more closely, I found the buttery print of a child’s right hand smudged where Dulcie had stood only moments before. Moving closer to it, I thought about tearing a paper towel from the roll that stood upright just beside the sink to press it down for some evidence of this impossible reality, when suddenly it combusted to tiny flames and the sizzle against the stainless island carried the salty tingle of tears.
The nature of my gift is such that I cannot press spirits to reveal themselves, and even if I could, I don’t believe I ever would.  Instinct dictates that as little engagement as possible is always the best mode, and it’s a rule by which I live my life whenever possible.  But I knew I’d have to take a more proactive stance to accomplish what we all—Mary, Dulcie, and I—needed, and for that I’d have to examine the house. 
I thought back to the night before, almost literally decades ago considering the journey along which these girls had brought me, and the things Seth had told me about the house.  I knew, for instance, that his father had discovered a secret compartment in the study, that old photos and tintypes had been stored in the tin handkerchief box found in the wardrobe that stood in his parents’ room, that the hall was part of an elaborate addition to join the kitchen to the rest of the house, and that the Ouija board was strictly taboo in the Jefferies household, just as it would have been in mine. I knew, too, that the kitchen was not built in 1870 when the house had been, and that the original kitchen must have stood just past the rock wall in the farthest portion of the back yard.  I did not, however, know where the Ouija board had come from originally, and now I wondered if it had been in the house when the Jefferies had moved in or if it had come into the house with them.
I’d have to go to the study to begin my investigation.  The notion sickened and worried me, but I gathered myself for the inevitable.  My mother had long taught me that the most direct way to gain protection from spirits that might harm you was to go to the Big Guy himself.  Some might laugh at this, but faith was and still is much more than a crutch for me, and anyone who believes in the fires of Hell must embrace the comforts of Heaven, too.  Opening the door to the study, I pushed it open so that the door knob bounced lightly against a chair just to the left of it.  Colder air pushed into the space right in front of me, and I shivered as if I were outside in a snowstorm.  Dulcie was here now, I knew, and she had been waiting for me.  

“Our Father who art in Heaven,” I began, voice bold and strong, “Hallowed be Thy name,” The chandelier above the Dr Jefferies broad mahoghany desk swayed slightly at first and then began to spin from the center, reminding me of the whirl-a-round at the park. “Thy Kingdom Come, Thy will be done—” 
And now Dulcie laughed with much more depth than a child might have, cold echo of the anger that was eating away her soul, interrupted to say, “I’m not the Devil, Julianne. I’m only a little girl, afterall.”
And I strengthened myself for the tantrum I felt welling in her, “On Earth as it is in Heaven.”
“Look at me, Julianne.” And it was all I could do to not make direct eye contact with her, but I did see that she was as pretty in what came close to flesh as she had been in the picture, innocent and sweet looking, and completely mesmerizing in her charming presentation. If I had not known what I did, if I could not recognize the hate that burned her from the inside out, I would have reached to hold her, stroked her golden ringlets, played dolls or drawn with her just as I would have my own little sister, but there was no denying the tenacious embers of her eyes, even as I avoided contact with them.
“Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us,” And now her laughter was maniacal, sad and laughing all at the same time.
“‘Forgive us our trespasses’,” she mocked, “and who is the trespasser here?” The question hovered between us and then seemed to take on an energy all its own as the accessories on Dr Jefferies desk and the loose items throughout the room rose and began to spin as if convection of Dulcie’s anger moved them.
“Lead us not into Temptation,” I continued, spirit emboldened with every word of the prayer I had known by heart ever since I had been a toddler, “but deliver us from Evil—“
And Dulcie’s angry laughter swelled to a cackle that rattled the house, but then it fell, too, as the little girl so consumed by anger became increasingly exhausted as I continued, “for Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory, Forever and Ever. Amen.”
I knew the entities that had exploited Dulcie’s sorrow and loneliness were not dormant and would not give up so easily.  Stronger now, I added, “Dear Heavenly Father, Give me strength for the challenges I face, and cast all unkind, mischievous, or evil spirits from my presence.  Wrap me in your loving arms to protect and fortify me.  I ask these things in your name. Amen.”
And now the room became silent, its energy subdued, and the objects that had spun around me lowered then settled in relative proximity to where they had been to start.  I breathed deep solace and was happy to find new warmth about the room and to detect the spicy scent of candles burned perhaps days ago in the air.  For the time being, this was a study almost like any other.  Now I set my task to discovering its every secret free from interruption for awhile.

fennelliott,0,4,1r1j2w,11,"I think the scariest number in the world is 1. Singular and individual in it's stance, only separated by 9 decimal points to 0. It's the foundation of other gathered numbers to be made stronger by the additive of another. However, if the unit remains alone it can be a reflection of myself. There are others number out there, but what are they but to be counted, added, subtracted, and divided. In a way, there's solace in being singular, but safety is not reassured.

I can count the number of steps it take me to cross the hallway into my bedroom by the measure of 12 units to create what is called a foot. 15 1/2 feet takes me from end to the other, each print of my callous sole leaving behind an echo of flesh sticking to hardwood floor. Each step is lonelier than the next.

There are portraits to the side of me of my family, filtered out by a camera lens portrayal of vintage black and white with an average border frame 9 x 12 inches protected by glass and wood. The reflection of my bedroom light shines to the side of it, 11 feet more until I reach the shimmering source. However the darkness of the picture reflects something else, more darkness than light, 6 feet behind me.

I cross a doorway that leads into an open room. Two bunk beds found belonging to my sisters, and a faded moon glow behind the blue curtains whipping gently upwards toward me by the open air flowing in. Someone forgot to close their window, and I think to step into their bedroom to close it, but then that would wake them. Also, it would subtract my distance to my bedroom, and I would be closer to the darkness lurking 5 feet now behind me. It reflects my light as well, an edge sharper than the glass that holds the photo of my loved ones intact. More intact than the pieces of my sisters hidden beneath their blankets, soaking a dark color that a small stream of moonlight shows.

I step closer now to my room, the T.V. hissing at me in white noise. I had only gotten drink of water after checking upon the noise that came down stairs. A crashing sound, not like glass but like a muffled collapse on the hardwood floor embedded all around. I would have went to check on my dad to see if he heard it too, but he's with mom in the other bedroom across from me. I know, having seen his shadow creep into bed with her, and the rustle they made to wrap around one another. My mom gave in, and I had passed by before they would noticed or I would have seen too much. She lays quiet now, drooped across her bed in slashes of romantic red, her favorite color.

Feet creak closer behind me in another gained step.

My room is in it's warm glow with the study light turned on, the T.V. static buzzing, and my phone vibrating in the pocket of my pajamas. I stop to look at the text just before my door. I stand as a silhouette with a face lit by the small framed screen fitted in the palms of my hands. I notice the text before I notice the added step, and quickly I read, ""Closet Keeper, Family Seeker. 1 by 1, piece my piece, the family fits in the closet.""

the text is disturbing, even as I step into the comfort of glow, reaching to close the door but instead find myself grabbing the hand of another. Lifeless it feels, sheltered by a thick fabric in tight grip to the something that extends into my back. I don't notice it until the withdrawal of what I thought was only a cold chill running against my spine. More and more I feel the same chill run up and down my body with gathered droplets spraying across or falling down around me and in my uncontrollable fall, I spread out flat 6 feet even. Straight and presented in that same red as my mother. That same sound as my fathers muffle down stairs. and slowly chopped piece by piece like my sibling.

Together we are gathered in the closet, one by one. However we do not form anything greater beyond the mess we contribute to my bedroom floor. Though I was not the first, I am number 1. Alone together, and singled out amongst the living as a dead soul. I am afraid of 1, for even in number there is still me and you. We are individual, and only more bodies prove that we are just that. Alone in fight, and alone in death.




...JK",Number 1,15
TreasureHouseofDoom,21,77,1qs12z,9,"Turning  to walk away, Mary headed toward the creek through the thin wooded border between Seth's house and his neighbor's, a rather standard 1940s American Dream home.  Just past that, the stretch of land that had once been a pecan orchard on a broad plantation was now acres of baseball fields and clear cut park bordered by pretty trails of cedars along ancient fence lines, some trunks scarred by  barbed wired fetters, others proving Life finds its way as they had declared themselves to swallow the barbed wire as they grew.

Mary stopped by the creek.  I wondered if she saw it only as it had been or if she saw the rock pile fountain constructed in the 1980s, the bandstand gazebo, the red fade painted trestle to our right.  Almost as soon as this curiosity formed in my mind, all these elements faded then evaporated to the background, and we were again stepping into Mary's world.  Tree growth became denser, and the clear cut field across the creek was a pecan tree studded pasture, remnants of the plantation.

Staring at the reflection cast by trees across the creek, Mary mused, ""Mama says,  ""Good enough for the kingdom of Heaven, but ain't good enough to share a table or even a wagon.""  She turned to me, took my hand, ""But me and Sweet Dulcie figure we're just about sisters on account of we got the same birthday--December 29th."" Her pearly smile caught a glare from the mid morning light.

""What year was that?"" Beth asked.  She and Seth had followed, but until now I hadn't even heard them breathe.

Mary laughed, ""We are 6; you figure it out."" Her childlike mischief prolonged mystery-- gathering the information we needed to help and to satisfy our own curiosity wasn't going to be easy.

""Right here, they dipped me in,"" Mary brought her hands to her face, gentle stroke against her cheeks and down her neck, water in her memory washing baby sins away, eyes shut and smile broad, and now she raised her hands to the sky, arms spread, ""Hallelujah! We sang."" And she held that position, that memory for a long moment before she dropped her arms to rest at her sides. ""And then they pulled me right out of it."" Now Mary collapsed to her bottom, legs turned to her left at the cool, damp bank.  Falling to my knees to hold and comfort her, I watched in gaping sorrow as the reflection on the water gave way to reveal a heartbreak picture of Mary lying face up beneath the surface, her eyes and mouth wide with shock, her body drowned. 


Her head against my shoulder, I asked, ""Mary, do you understand what it means to be dead?"" 

She turned to me.  ""Sometimes, I reckon.  I know what it means to be me.  Dead is when I can't find my parents, nor my friend, and I never got no one until I got you, at least not for long."" She smiled sadly now, ""But you'll stay with me, won't you?""  Now I shivered.  Of course I wanted to promise to be whatever she needed, but I had been warned many times about the dangers of making such promises to spirits, especially precocious children.


""I'm here now, but my biggest concern is helping you find your way home."" The ghastly image in the water rippled beneath the tiny body of a boatman bug whose rowing swim broke the surface.  'Pay attention to every detail,' I told myself.

""How did you end up in the water?"" I asked Mary, and now I felt the gush and soak of her dripping dress, the puddle her head made as if I had just lifted her from the creek in which she had once been born again and eventually died.

""Oh, Mama!"" Mary exclaimed happily, ""Me and Sweet Dulcie was just playing! Warn't no harm.  We ain't seen each other in so long! "" and in an instant Mary and I watched passively  as her mother now held her wet, lifeless body where I'd imagine I had, salty tears meeting drowning soak, Mary's body limp fall back as her mother's tensed and released in body-aching sobs.  

And there stood Dulcie across the creek, face peeking around the trunk of a cedar, hand concealing smile breaking to giggles. 

Mary stepped to the edge, clay meeting water. ""Sweet Dulcie!"" She waved, but I reached to press her hand down.  

""Tell me about this day.  The day you drowned.""

Mary stared now at Dulcie, golden shimmer around the girl across the creek.  ""She sees me, don't she?"" It was only partly a question.  ""And when I saw her the first time after she'd gone away, my Mama told me I was crazy, that I was letting guilt eat my senses away, but I knew I had.""

Now Beth and Seth came closer to us, Beth reaching to touch Mary, contact that couldn't be made, and Seth watching Dulcie curiously and cautiously.  Dulcie smiled, put her hands to her knees and threw her head back.  There was no doubt that she was aware of us, or at least of Mary, and her expression was neither friendly nor truly happy.  

""Why would your mother have thought you were crazy? Where had she gone?"" Seth asked precisely what I wondered.

And now Mary clutched her stomach in pain. ""That was a very bad day, and I knew better--I told Mama I did, but she said that accidents happen without the plans, ""that's what makes them accidents,"" and I felt what Mary remembered, her mother's arms around her little girl on a very sad day.

Thin glimpse of what anger lay between these two little girls had come, but I needed more, and they did, too.

""I like fudge--thick with cocoa and dry, not gooey, and you gotta boil that in the pot, the cream and cocoa and water and butter, 'til the water rolls with the heat and a spoonful dropped into it makes a ball without you having to shape it.""  Mary walked back now, following a little woods trail that no longer existed in my present day life. Along the way, she picked wild flowers--sunchoke, asters, white daisies most would have considered weeds.  Coming to a fork along the trail, she chose the thinner one that rose up a hill to the left.  Four great iron posts cornered a lot of about a quarter of an acre. Joined by segments of iron fencing that came to about my hip, these surrounded a cluster of graves dating back to the days when Alabama had not yet become a state.  From where I stood, I could read quiet clearly, ""Jobias Schraeder/ Husband and Father/ He made his way in the World/ And now he makes his way to Heaven,"" and the date of his death was in the year 1817, two years before Alabama's statehood had been recognized.

""You're buried here?"" Beth asked Mary, but I answered.

""No, Mary's buried in the old city cemetery, isn't that right?"" 

And Mary nodded forlornly. ""Y'all passed through the other day, and I thought to myself, 'That one there has the Shine--she'll see me.'  Every now and again someone passes through who sees me or at least notices me somehow.""  Her eyes apologetic and pleading, Mary continued, ""You don't know what it feels to never be seen.""

And she was right, but maybe I could imagine it, base that on my personal sense of always being on the periphery.

""I'm glad you saw me, too, Mary,"" I told her, ""but I need you to tell me what we're doing here.""

""The folks from the Big House, Mr and Mrs Mosely, his parents, and Sweet Dulcie, they's all buried here.  It's the family spot.""  Mary walked through the gate, headed straight to the center, and there were five graves of varied ages.  A monument rising to the sky read, ""MOSELEY,"" and to either side was a  husband and wife set bearing the family name.  And between one set of those, the one to the right, was a small stone with roses and a harp etched into it.  This stone was of Sylacauga marble, stark white with ribbons of gray to black. ""Dulcine Octavia Moseley/ Beloved Daughter Taken to Be Among the Angels/ On the 22nd Day of October, 1889.""

Mary placed the flowers atop the grave, whispered some hope or prayer, knelt.  She cleared leaves and grass from the base, piling it to the left, but now a cold breeze scattered them against the stone.  This cemetery did not bring me the comfort that many others had.  The sense of trauma and losswas palpable.  

""I think it's time you told us how Dulcie died.""

AfterYourHeart,0,9,1r7cv5,7,"This is an update from: [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1r1po8/dead_ends/)

Ok! I have a little bit of time. I’m not sure when they’ll be back so I have to be careful.

That day, the day Pugsley died, Joe and I talked about it after Sophia had gone to bed. He swore he didn’t leave the window open. He always had an encyclopedic memory, remembering the tiniest little things about just about everything, so I believed him. I know I didn’t open the window. I also know that when I left to pick up Sophia, I had to un-deadbolt the front door. Joe quickly went down to check the back door. Also locked. We decided to just drop it and we went to sleep. If I remember correctly, I didn’t sleep well that night.

I wish Joe would come visit me. They said I could have visitors occasionally if I was well behaved. It sure does get lonely in here. I mean, there are others, but man do they have issues! I’d rather just keep to myself. At least I have my art. They even let me try to sell it, well rather, they let an art gallery try to sell them, and occasionally someone buys one. I plan on putting these letters in the back of one whenever this is finished. Hey! Maybe that’s how you’re reading this. If so, thank you for buying my art. I hope you enjoy it.

I remember the day I painted my daughter’s eighth birthday portrait. I had never tried such a thing before, but she was so beautiful that I had to at least try. Her hair was blonde and getting quite long. She liked to straighten it. She had the look that screamed head cheerleader, queen bee, but I always hoped she grow up to be a scientist, or an engineer. She was so smart. With her smile, she could get away with murder. She was missing a few teeth at the time, and a few more were still growing back. That just made her even cuter. Looking at her was like looking into the heart of your childhood. She always made me feel young. I loved going on adventures with her.

The day I painted her, I needed her to sit still for a while, and I wanted to try and make it fun for her. I wanted to paint her smiling, not bored out of her mind. The first step was music. She loved music and she loved to sing. She was pretty good at it too. Then I came up with a great idea. I got her her own easel, canvas, and paints, and figured we could paint together. I’d help her figure out what she wanted to paint and get her started, and then I’dl paint her.

Just thinking about that day helps me almost remember what it’s like to be happy. We had so much fun. We listened to music, sang and danced a bit, painted (she decided to paint me back), and talked about just about everything. She told me all about her new school and the friends she was making. She was such a people person. People were drawn to her and always wanted to be around her. Looking at her, it astounded me how quickly she was growing. When did she get so tall?

At the end of the day we did our reveal. I showed her my painting and she showed me hers. I have to admit, I was pretty impressed by hers. Looks like “artist” could be added to the list of things she could be when she grew up. We decided we’d hang them together in the hallway once they had dried. I wasn’t quite ready for the day to be over, so after we cleaned up, I took her out to eat.

Joe got home after Sophia’s bedtime. I proudly took him to the spare room to show off our paintings. I turned on the light and Joe laughed. I screamed. I explained to Joe that I didn’t do this. That when Sophia and I had gone to dinner, it was just a normal portrait. That someone else must’ve come in and painted over the original painting, altering it. He stood silently, staring at me for a moment. Like he was trying to figure out if this was some kind of weird prank. He then kissed me on the forehead, told me we would figure this out later, and went to watch a movie. After he walked away I turned back to look at the painting.

Whoever had done it had blackened out her eyes. They had also paled her skin, and given her deep circles under her eyes. It reminded me of a picture I had seen when I looked up black-eyed kids. I made the mistake of looking it up at work, and the picture had stunned me so badly, that I immediately drew all the blinds and curtains in the place and covered all the windows. I am usually not that much of a chicken, but for some reason that picture had a serious effect on me, and now there I was staring at my daughter, turned into a black-eyed kid. 

I quickly destroyed the painting. I never showed it to Sophia. She had been so excited to see a painting of herself. The next few days were her scheduled days to stay at her dad’s, so I decided to try to repaint it. The duplicate was pretty good. Not quite as good as the original, but it was pretty close.

The next morning, I went to check on the duplicate and it had been ripped to shreds. I showed Joe, but he shook it off. This time he was convinced that it was some kind of joke. He swore he wasn’t falling for it. Then he went off to work. I sat and cried for a while, burned the painting, and tried one last time. This time I hid the painting, and this time the painting stayed safe.

Ok. It’s almost meds time. I better hide this again. I hate the meds they give me. They make me feel so weird. I don’t even know what day it is anymore.

I had two glasses of wine while my clothes were in the drier and fell asleep on the couch around eleven. I woke up at three-thirty with all the lights on, it was raining out. I love falling asleep to the rain. I tried to drift back to sleep despite feeling completely awake. I never felt the sleep pass over me, but eventually I began dreaming. In my dream I was giving my manager a ride home. It was dark and quiet in the city and I was jokingly pretending to be asleep while I was driving. I had my head leaning back on the head rest and my bottom jaw was slack so my mouth was open. But then I felt that I was stuck that way. So he started nudging my right shoulder to make me wake up. I felt panic in my dream. That's when I came out of that dream and back into my living room where I was asleep on the couch. My mouth still agape, my eyes still closed. I was short of breath. That is when I realized that I still felt the nudging sensation. Now, however, it was coming from behind the couch cushion against my right shoulder. I could feel and hear the cushion pushing me back and forth on my couch. It then felt like I was fully awake and the nudging stopped for a second. I took a second to let myself feel afraid. The nudging began again but now there was an orchestra of movements all around on my couch. The cushions under my feet were being pulled upward in short little beats, and the left side of my pillow was doing the same thing. I felt and heard the blanket next to my right ear moving like it was trying to tickle my face and ear. I allowed these hallucinations to feel real, and as soon as I gave in to their reality, I felt the sides of my pillow begin to curl up and over my face. My heart began racing, my breaths were shallow, and I still was unable to move or wake myself up. The pressure of the pillow on my face increased until it felt like I couldn't breath. I was sinking into my couch, the pressure was on my entire body now. I knew I had let my fear fuel this hallucination for too long. I took a giant gasp of air, and woke up. I didn't know how to prove to myself that I was truly awake, so I stayed sitting upright with the lights on and opted out of sleep for the night. ",My dreams won't let me sleep,17
OldRockingChair,11,3,1qw6z7,7,"You know how it is when you've been living with something for so long, you don't even know it's abnormal for other people? 

It was like that for me. All along, I've had ""memories"" of sensations I wasn't doing. Like, I'd be sitting at my desk, then I can suddenly ""taste"" a certain flavor of chips that I haven't had for a long time, or a drink. Sometimes I smell things that aren't there, like paint, or candles. And there are times when I feel pain where there's no one touching me at all. 

Just the other day I ""tasted"" beer. I haven't had beer in a long while, and certainly not at ten in the morning in my office cubicle. It was very weird. It went on for a while, and the memory was *strong*, you know, like I'm really tasting it at that moment. I was so intrigued that I tried to research if there was a possible name for this, but nothing came up. 

Apparently, a person can have ""olfactory"" memories-like a smell triggers a memory, but that's the closest I've gotten to finding actual facts about this. I've not even encountered any scientific facts about a ""taste"" memory. Normally, I can remember the things I ate, but that only applies for recent foods, and none of my own ""memories"" are as strong as the random taste/ smell memories. 

And, when I feel pain, it comes at a place I'm not straining- like I'd be sitting perfectly still and I'd feel a dull stab of pain on my thigh, or between my ribs. Sometimes it's so intense that I had to stop moving for a few seconds. 

I feel like a damn receptor. It's as if, somewhere out there, someone is eating the foods I taste, being exposed the scents I smell, and feeling the cause of the pain I have.  I'm not sure if there's any other explanation. ",Memory,10
Waja_Wabit,2,4,1qu5mb,9,"I am not a superstitious person by any stretch of the imagination, but this happened to me last night and I swear every word of it is true:

I was having a nightmare.  In my dream, I was walking along a street in my city, when a passing-by stranger asked me a question.  I didn't quite understand what he said, so I approached him.  But soon as I was an arm's reach from him, he stuck me with a needle and injected me with something making me pass out.  Still in my dream, I regained consciousness in a dungeon in hell, surrounded by supernatural demons and horrors.  I was stretched out on a torture rack while they flayed my skin to prepare my soul for sacrifice to the devil.  ""There is no escape,"" the demons told me as they laughed, ""There is no escape.""  I screamed and pulled on my chains to escape, but my futile efforts were only met with cackling laughter.

Ding-dong.  I awoke to the sound of my doorbell ringing.  Not in the dream.  In reality.  At 5:00 in the morning, still dark as night, in my apartment.  Horrified, I thought this couldn't possibly be the case:  I live alone, and I'm certainly not expecting somebody this late on a Saturday night / this early on a Sunday morning.  But the doorbell rang again, ding-dong.  I grabbed my flashlight, bolted out of bed, and went to the front door to investigate.  No one was there.  Not a soul on my porch.  It was still dark outside, and the street was deserted.  I looked through the large glass window of the front door, but every bone in my body was screaming at me to not open that door.  So behind the door I stayed.  I stood there for several minutes wondering what the hell just transpired, looking out onto my empty porch through the window.  It was raining slightly, cold, and generally unpleasant out, certainly not the weather nor time for ding-dong ditching.  Besides, there's no way they ran away that fast, right?  Maybe my doorbell was malfunctioning?  But it only rang those two times.  Oh well, I thought, and I walked back up the stairs and into my apartment.

As soon as I closed my apartment door behind me, the door bell rang again.  Ding-dong ding-dong ding-dong.  Three times, in rapid succession, as if someone were desperately trying to get me to come downstairs.  I raced back downstairs again in a panic, thinking, what the hell is going on?  Within 3 seconds I was back at the front door of my building again, looking at a completely silent and empty porch.  Oh fuck this, I thought, and went back upstairs, and switched off my doorbell ringer.

It was difficult to fall asleep again.",Demons and Doorbells,13
Lnzy1,6,5,1r8uds,11,"I transferred to the south dorms at the beginning of the semester and there I met my new roommate, Kaylee. I knew Kaylee purely by reputation as being violent and weird and into the occult. So as I entered the room for the first time, I was fully expecting to see a girl dressed in black with indiscriminate piercings across her body...not the bubbly pink blonde happily thumbing through a Psychology text. Kaylee was nothing like the person people made her out to be and I began to wonder just who did she piss off for that rumor mill to get so much steam.

""Well,"" Kaylee said lowly, ""I have trouble keeping roommates. I've had a lot of them. You're the seventh.""

""Why? Do you snore?"" I laughed, still not convinced Kayle was anything more than a normal girl.

Kaylee smiled thinly, but it was clear that she had a hard time making light of it. ""No, I don't snore. I have epilepsy. It runs in my family actually.""

""Oh, well...that sucks.""

""Yeah, my Aunt and Great Grandma both had it. Granny had a seizure in her sleep and accidentally strangled herself with her sheets and my Aunt died when she was a little girl.""

Almost afraid to ask, I opened her mouth. ""How?""

""She was at the kitchen table and started having a seizure. She stabbed herself in the heart with her dinner knife...""

Kaylee kept her seizures at bay with medication and restraints on her bedpost. They were nylon and Velcro straps that looped around her wrists and ankles while she slept so she would not hurt herself in her sleep should she have an epileptic seizure. The first time I witness one was the fourth week of classes. It lasted only a second but was incredibly violent. One night as we studied in our room, Kaylee abruptly slammed her wrists on the table with a shriek and flung herself back out of her chair. I flew to her side but the seizure was already over. Kaylee waved off the offer of a trip to the infirmary and settled for a dose of medication and a long swig of seltzer water.

""I have my medication,"" she said breathlessly. And that was that. Over the course of the next few weeks, the seizures grew in duration and intensity. After a trip to the ER, her medication was increased and Kayle was left in a drug induced haze. Whenever she said anything, it was unintelligible and garbled. I knew her grades were suffering.

Being unable to help my roommate, I was left to wallow in indecisiveness for a long time. The more I tried to help it seemed, the more Kaylee came to resent me. And so I simply stopped. After a seizure, I simply went back to my own devices. I stopped caring about the thundering jerks of her bedposts at night.

It was the night before midterm and I decided to take my books to the common room to study with the others girls from my biology class. As I gathered my things, I glanced over at Kaylee who was pulling up the sleeves of her nightgown and crawling into bed, looking more haggard and thinly present than ever. A spark of concern burned at me and I paused at the door.

""Are you sure you're alright? Can I get you anything?""

Kaylee's absent looking gaze abruptly sharpened and she spit back at me, ""No! I don't need anything from you. Just go already. And turn the damn light off!"" The spark of concern had been doused with a five gallon drum of water. So curling my nose in offense, I left the room but not before pointedly flicking the light switch off and slamming the door.

It was well past 3AM when I realized I had forgot my notes on biological systems in the room. So I excused myself and made my way back upstairs. I paused at the room door, hearing a muffled ruckus from behind the wood slab. Carefully, I creaked the door open and the full noise of the disturbance hit my ears.

Thump, thump, thump, creeeeek, thump, thump...gasp.

Another seizure? I instinctively reached for the light switch, but my finger paused on the acrylic plate, Kaylee's words coming back to me with sharp clarity. I considered myself a good person with good intentions and Kaylee's attitude had put me off in a bad way. So I wrinkled my noise in disgust and hurried into the dark room, fumbling around until I hit the desk. The sound of Kaylee convulsing and pulling at the nylon straps behind me became white noise. I blindly swept up all my notebooks and texts into my arms and quickly left the room. The last sound I heard was a deep gargling intake of breath and a weak cough. Then silence. I closed the door with a soft 'schnk' and was gone.

I awoke the next morning with my face planted firmly in the folds of Shakespeare's Hamlet. With several hours left before my first midterm exam, I left my books where they lay and made my way back up to my room to take a shower and change my old wrinkled clothes. As I opened the door, I smelled the metallic bite in the air and gagged on a lung full of it. My sleep filled eyes gazed towards Kaylee's side of the room and all breathe in me left and the tips of my fingers buzzed. The walls had been washed in blood, red sticky streams of it. It was splattered in streaks across the mirror and the desk, all of Kaylee's books. Kaylee...

Kaylee lay still in her bed, nightgown soaked in red. Her arms and ankles still firmly strapped in their nylon restraints. Her head tilted back, revealing the gaping hole that had been ripped into her neck, cords and all matter of things spilling out onto her chest.

I gasped for breath, choking again on the foul air and my legs gave out from under me. Falling over myself as I stumbled into the room, I uselessly called for Kaylee, reaching out as if to touch her. A single red dot appeared on my outstretched hand and I looked up. Written on the ceiling in Kaylee's blood was a message that read: ""Aren't you glad you didn't turn on the light?""
",Don't Turn On The Light.,16
blkmagick,2,2,1r8old,10,"My father was in the military, which meant that we moved around a lot as I was growing up. One of the places we moved to was Pensacola, FL. We moved there right before 8th grade started for me, and we lived in military housing so we got to live in a two story house for the very first time. I was excited; I got my own room and my own bathroom right across the hallway. 

Things were great, until after a year of living in the house when things started to get strange. I was home alone talking to my boyfriend on the phone when I heard a large crash in the kitchen. I slowly walk in to see what happened, and one of the cabinet doors were wide open and bowls were all over the floor. I quickly pick up the bowls and put them away, freaking out. I was in there just five minutes earlier and everything was closed; there was no way for the cabinet to open on its own. I ran up to my room and locked my door until my family came home. When they returned, they asked why bowls were all over the floor in the kitchen. 

A week after that incident, I woke up suddenly out of a deep sleep, gasping for breath. I looked at my doorway and I see a girl standing there. She was wearing an old white nightgown stained with blood, and she had long black hair. Her throat was slit and hastily stitched up, along with her lips being stitched together. Her eyes were gouged and missing, and her hands were chopped off. 

Thinking it was just my imagination, I closed my eyes and reopened them, only to see she had moved closer. With each blink, the closer she would get, so I threw the covers over my head and prayed that she didn't touch me. I ended up falling asleep and awoke in the morning with her nowhere to be found. 

Over the next year, she would appear every other week, just watching me. I got used to it eventually, because I thought it was just a chronic bad dream and she didn't do anything to hurt me. It wasn't until after we moved to back to Michigan did I get really scared. My sister and I were talking and sharing stories about our house in Florida, and she told me something troubling. She mentioned that if she had to use the restroom in the middle of the night, she would always use my parent's bathroom in their room instead of the one across my bedroom. I asked her why, and her response was:

""Because I would always see a girl in white standing outside of your door and it scared me.""

Knowing that I wasn't the only one that saw her terrified me, because I knew it wasn't just a dream. I still wonder if she appears for the new family that's in the house and who she is and what happened to her. I have to say though, I'm just glad to be out of that house.

",The Girl in White,12
The_John_Deere,10,11,1r800l,6,"I thought i would be safe from stuff like this, that these sorts of things wouldnt happen to me for a long time. Honestly, I didn't. Hell, I especially didnt expect it to be at school. 

I've dealt with ghosts before, more than I can count. I can normally help when people have problems with the paranormal, but now I'm the one in need of help.

I assume many of you remember u/inaaace's stories about Rose and the orange, correct? How could you not, that was one of the biggest things on this sub all year. This encounter/series of encounters is like that.

It started about a month ago. I'd have a dream that I wouldn't remember, and then at random points in the day I'd remember having that in the dream. Every day more and more instances of déjà vu would happen. This week has been the worst. I remembered my dream on Wednesday, and everything tht happened Wednesday I knew would happen, like us having a substitute in French, a pop quiz in Trigonometry, and a surprise workout at Track.

Last night, I thought I had a normal dream. Just regular stuff. Until *she* showed up.

This girl has bothered me sine freshman year. She's a bit of a weirdo, and all my friend think she likes me. The feeling is not mutual. Anyways, she popped up in my dream with the creepiest damn smile I've ever seen. And ten everything went black. I don't know if the dream ended or I just forgot the rest, but it just stopped. 

I came to school today thinking everything would be dandy, and it was, until 8th period seminar (my school has a ""free period"" that we go to every other day, and the class we go to during that block alternates every time). I walked in, and she sat next to me. Awesome. Just what I need. 

For most of the class I felt her eyes on me, and everytime I looked over she had a smile that grew gradually bigger. By the end of the period the smile resembled the one from the dream *exactly*. I was extremely freaked out, and it was probably showing, too. I looked over one more time, and then te entire dream flashed back to me. She had been holding something in the dream, some small enough to fit in her hand. As soon as I remembered this, her eyes locked with mine, an then she reached into her bag, 

And held out an orange.

I have to go back to that class in 2 hours. I don't know what to do. Nosleep, please help me. I don't think I can handle this one alone.

Edit for words. Sorry I was in a rush to write this.

EDIT 2: 15 minutes left in class, nothing really noteworthy has happened. Seems like she's backed off a bit. I still feel her eyes on the back of my head, though, so I'm bracing myself for when class is over.

EDIT 3: sorry about the delay, early track practice. The remainder of class was extremely uneventful except for the last 5 minutes, during which she got that freaky smile on her face and started slowly moving closer to me. When the bell rang, I bolted. Didn't want to stick around any longer. 

But what's really freaky is what happened around the end of practice. We had a workout today, and on our cooldown I could have sworn I saw her, behind the trees or on the other side of the road. I just ignored that though, and it's all been pretty good since. I just got home, so I should be safe. I'll keep you guys posted if anything else exciting happens.",I didn't think this would happen to me.,17
NightOfTheLlamas,4,7,1r6rmn,7,"There are few things that drive me mad. I don’t even understand why they get me so worked up in the first place. I’m not OCD or anything of the sort. It’s just that I can’t stand things such as the sliding door when it is open. It should be closed at all times. The door is just a small problem compared to my shower. It drips. 

At first I could turn the shower handle and the dripping would come to an end. It was inconvenient at times because I would stop whatever I was doing to shut up the *drip, drip, drip.* Sometimes my food would burn slightly or I would miss a phone call cause I was busy pushing around the handle to end the sound. I really don’t mind though because it ended that cursed dripping and that’s all that really matters to me. 

It got worse. When I turned the handle to end the sounds it would start up again randomly later. I would be watching Netflix or reading a good book when I hear *drip, drip, drip.* It doesn’t ever end. All through the day the shower leaks water out in a steady rhythmic beat. It drives me crazy. 

After a week or so I couldn’t handle the sounds anymore. I couldn’t handle the *drip, drip, drip.* I bought a new shower head thinking that would solve the problem. After setting it up I blew out a breath of relief. The dripping would finally end now. I ate dinner that night happy. I closed the open sliding door before settling myself on the couch with my laptop. I was on Netflix and about half way through my show I heard something. *Drip, drip, drip.* Covering my ears with my hands didn’t stop the sounds from making their way to my brain. I could still hear it. 

I tried everything I could think of. I called the plumber but that did nothing. I wrapped a rag around the shower head. That worked until the rag started to drip from all of it’s water build up. I also took the rag and placed it at the bottom of the shower hoping that it would mute the dripping sounds. This worked yet it didn’t. I could no longer hear the dripping but I could *feel* the drops of water slamming against the rag. 

In the end I just spent as little time in my own home as I could. There was no way to be bothered by the shower if I wasn’t even inside of the house. This worked until I had to go home and try to sleep. Which ended up with me not getting a wink of sleep. I would stare up at the ceiling with my eyes unblinking just listening to the shower leak. I would pray in my head that this torture would end somehow.  

I stopped sleeping in my home. I hated going to that place. Whenever my feet hit the floorboards of that house it was as if at that moment the shower started to leak again. I slept at a friend’s house. She never asked questions as to why I wished to stay with her. That was something I was dearly grateful for.

It has been a few weeks since I started to live here. I haven’t felt this much peace in a while. I was heading to the kitchen for a glass of water. It was almost midnight and the sky was pitch black. As I walk down the halls towards the kitchen I freeze. To my left was the bathroom door. Through the wood I could hear a soft *drip, drip, drip.* ","Drip, Drip, Drip",14

darkdreamers,0,6,1r4n8q,7,"Remember the old days where we used MSN as a form of communication? It was pretty sweet. We could give dancing emoticons of someone's ass and they can't do shit about it.

So back then, when they just installed this new voice note feature, I was hooked. You record a few seconds of you talking, send, and the other person can listen and reply the same way. So one day I was doing this with my friend, just voice-noting back and forth. We didn't think twice about using an actual telephone because holy shit voice notes! What a time to be alive!

So I was replying to his voice note and sent it. After sending it though, I always press play to listen back to my own note, but this time, there was nothing there. I paused, pressed play again, nothing. Quiet. As if I recorded a normal room. Then I heard a humming, not a machine hum but a woman's hum. I was around 13 or so at the time, and my voice still resembled that of a 13 year-old girl. But this voice was older and it was humming a song, really slowly. Really creepily, as if she was right next to me as I hit the record button previously. I paused it and ran out of the fucking room.

Up until today, I still don't know what that was. I quit the chat and refused to do voice notes ever again. The fuck was that?! ",Voice notes...but not my voice,13
AfterYourHeart,2,5,1r1po8,7,"You ever have one of those days, one that changes your life so drastically that looking back you can’t help but wonder where you’d be if it never happened? I know I have. I also know that without that day, I would never be here. I apologize if this is a little blurred. They only let me have “soft” writing utensils. No pens. No pencils. So I’m writing this in artist’s charcoal. I don’t know why they think I’m so dangerous. I swear I’ve never hurt anyone in my life, nor would I! That’s why I’m writing this. I’m hoping that if I write it all down someone, anyone, will read it and understand my side of the story. The biggest problem there is that not even I understand my side of the story. Everything is so messed up in my head; events are out of order, somethings are blurry, others are just plain missing. Who knows, maybe I’m just writing this all down to help myself understand, but where do I even begin? Well, I supposed I already mentioned the day everything changed, so I may as well start there.

Sadly, for a day that sent my life into a quick downward spiral to hell, I don’t really remember much about it. Not the date. Not the weather. I could barely tell you the month. I can tell you this. It was night; well, I guess it could have been really early morning. I was working third shift at the time and I know I was at work. I was cleaning. I was cleaning the bathrooms more specifically. I had just gotten done with the upstairs bathroom and was getting ready to clean the downstairs bathroom.

Before I go on, I should mention that at the time I was working in a foster home for teens with mental and physical disabilities. Since I mainly worked nights, my main tasks were light housework, some dinner prep for the next day, and mainly, stay awake and make sure nothing happened to the boys during the night. It was a pretty easy job as there were only two boys at the time; one 16 and one 18, who for the most part, slept through the night. 

Anyway, where was I? Oh  yes. That night. I had finished cleaning the upstairs bathroom and was about to go clean the downstairs bathroom when I noticed the light in the garage was on. That’s weird. I knew when I got there at the beginning of my shift, that I walked up the driveway, and as it was already dark out, I would have noticed if it were on and it would have bugged me until I turned it off. I’m a stickler for not leaving the lights on. I know that I was deep in thought as I walked up. Maybe I was so distracted that I didn’t notice. I have been known to wander off in my own little world from time to time. Then again, maybe my boss left it on after I had already gotten there.

I decided that I better go check it out. After all, protector to the boys was also part of my job, and the phone was on the way to the door. I grabbed the phone, dialed 911 and put my finger on talk, ready to push it if something went wrong. Since it’s a landline, if I do call and can’t talk, heaven forbid, dispatch will still be able to know the address and send a car out to check. I crept slowly to the garage door. I’ll admit, I was terrified. I probably should have called anyway, just to be on the safe side. I made it to the garage, slowly opened the door, and peeked my head out. Empty. I gasped as I released the breath I didn’t know I was holding. Still holding the phone, just in case, I checked the back garage door. Locked. I let out a small chuckle as I started to relax and I headed back into the house, making sure to lock the garage door, and turn off the light on my way back in.

Crap. I noticed when I walked back in that in my stupid terror I had left the bathroom light on. *Sigh.* At least I could use the exercise, I joked with myself on the way back down the hall. I think I was still feeling really foolish for how worked up I let myself get. When I turned into the bathroom, a scream of terror got trapped in my throat so hard that I passed out.

I came to on the bathroom floor. I was a little achey in a few spots, but considering how hard I must’ve fallen on bare tile, it could have been way worse. Lucky for me, my head landed on the bath rug next to the shower; although, there was a bit of a ringing sound in my ears. It either went away or I got used to it quickly , because after a moment I didn’t even notice it. I slowly got up and checked out what startled me into fainting for the first time in my life. 

The mirror had writing on it. I looked closer. The writing was orange. Orange marker. Washable. Weird. Why would someone choose orange marker. That just seems like an usual choice. I mean, I know there were markers in the linen closet next to the bathroom, but who would look in a linen closet for writing utensils? I mean, it’s just not what I would expect writing on the mirror to be written with.

Wow. I can’t believe I can get so side-tracked, even at a time like this. Focus. Mirror. Orange marker (weird). Writing. Maybe one of the boys did it. Well, of the two, only one of them was verbal and literate. His bedroom was just down the hall. The other boy had his room in the basement. It was a fully finished basement that was remodeled specifically for him. He had pretty severe Autism and didn’t speak or write. I checked my phone. Not that much time had passed while I was on the floor. I decided to go down the hall and check to see if Gabe was still awake. I knew that if he had written it, he’d be giggling in his room, waiting for a reaction.

I opened his door and turned on his light. He was sound asleep. Even though he was face-up he didn’t even flinch when I turned on the overhead light. Now trust me, as the person who took care of him most nights and got him up and ready for school in the morning, I could tell when he was faking sleep. I also knew, in general, how long it took him to fall asleep. There was no way he wrote that.

I walked back to the bathroom. After looking again I couldn’t help but think, it couldn’t have been Gabe. His hand writing is atrocious. The handwriting on the mirror was fairly neat, feminine almost, and slightly familiar. Again, I couldn’t help but shake off a weird feeling, and again I should have called 911. I guess I didn’t want to be the one that had to call the cops while working, which I found stupidly embarrassing. So, after a quick yet terrifying search of the house revealed no one else and all the doors and windows locked, I cleaned off the mirror, first reading it one last time:

*“Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb.
Mary had a little lamb and she threw it out the window
The window, the second story window.”*

	
I couldn’t help but say it in the sing-songy way that my grandpa had originally taught it to me. It was a silly twist you could put on the right part of any nursery rhyme to make it even sillier. He taught it to my sisters, cousins, and I to keep us entertained on long car rides. Sometimes we’d pass it along to any friends who happened to have come with; although we quit doing it by time I was 12 or 13, so I don’t think I was friends with anyone any longer that would have learned the song with us.

I watched TV in the living room for the rest of that shift, trying to distract myself. It didn’t work at all and I jumped out of my skin at every noise. When my boss got there I blamed illness on my incomplete chore list. She believed me as I had never before not finished them, and she wished me better as I hurried off.

When I got home I curled up with my fiance and somehow managed sleep. Then again, I always felt safe in his arms. When he got up to leave, he quietly kissed me goodbye. As he slipped out the door, I slipped back to sleep.

I remember I woke up before my alarm. For some reason I was cold. I peeked one eye open and noticed Pugsley was gone. Oh well. He sleeps when daddy sleeps, I can’t expect him to sleep when I sleep too. I also noticed that Joe had left the window open again. Man, I hate it when he does that. Now I get to lay here and debate whether or not it’s worth getting up and closing the window before my alarm goes off. I decide quickly that if I close the window now, I can still jump back in bed and snooze for a little bit longer before the alarm, but when I got to the window, sleep was the last thing on my mind.

There on the sidewalk below, was Pugsley. The dog Joe, Sophia my daughter, and I had gotten together upon getting this new apartment. Joe had been so happy about having our bedroom on the second story. As I looked down, many thoughts flooded my head. One more than the rest. *“the window, the window, the second story window…”*

I put the dog in a small box, then double bagged the box with plastic bags, and put it in the garage freezer. After all, I still had to pick up Sophia from school. I would try to figure out what to tell Joe and Sophia on the way there.

They’re coming! Crap! They’re coming to check on me! I have to hide this. I don’t want them to find it. If I’m never able to continue, just know one thing. I AM NOT CRAZY!


Update:
I was able to get out at least one more entry. [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1r7cv5/dead_ends/)",Dead Ends,12
sangarji,1,3,1r1huu,8,"I bought a camera last week and snapped pictures of my four year old daughter. I was excited about showing her those pictures as that would be the first time she would be seeing herself in a photograph.

When I laid the photos in front of her, she held them in her tiny beautiful hands and looked at me with a hint of confusion.

Who is this Daddy?

Its you of course, my darling. Don't you see?

No. Its not me.

Of course it is. Its my beautiful little angel.

But daddy, I don't look like this in glass ( She calls the mirror a glass ) I have blue eyes. This girl has black eyes. I have a mole on the cheek. And my hair is black. This girl has brown hair. This is not me. 

She was not lying. I know her play face. She was being earnest. 

And she was describing Sarah, my little sister who had suffocated to death in the attic 28 years ago.

While playing hide and seek with me. 

When she was four years old.

We don't have any pictures of Sarah and there is no way my daughter would've known how she looked. Unless...

Right now I see my daughter standing in front of the mirror and talking to her reflection in her sweet voice. I don't have the guts to see what she sees in the mirror. I'm scared. For her. For myself.",The Reflection,11
00WELVAERT,5,7,1r17ja,9,"EDIT: Some spelling mistakes

Hey guys, I'm going to tell three real and inexplicable occurrences that have happened to me so far in my short life (Still a teenager) These occurrences involve a sound, or a sight being there that wasn't really there.
I can't really explain anything that has happened here, but I would like to share. Here it is...

The first time this had happened to me I was very young, around 7 years old. I was a confident little fellow, and after a day of playing with my brother and such I decided to sleep, in my sleeping bag, on the 3rd floor of my dads house alone...

So as I am about ready to start dreaming, with the moon out far and it being past my bedtime, I suddenly hear a man whisper to me.

The first time I had no idea what it said, completely unclear. So I freeze in pure horror, until again he whispers to me.

It still didn't say anything understandable, but at this point I was calling out for help from anyone in the form of some weird exhale of a loud shriek (That is really the best way to describe what I was doing). I was afraid if I called ""Dad!"" it would know I was trying to get away and it would hurt me.

So then it whispers to me, a little louder ""Noo no, it's okay"" ""shh shh"" as I scream for my dad as I remain frozen still from fear of moving a muscle.

Moments later my Dad rushes in to comfort me, as there was nothing there. I tell him what I heard, and even having it being the breakfast table conversation the next morning, my Dad was sure it was just my silly little child's mind playing games.

I slept in his bed that night. I knew what happened was real, it was so vivid and I still remember it all of these years later.

That was my first time experiencing something so inexpiable and supernatural, the second time was during the middle of last Summer.

So me being a stupid little fellow, me and a friend of mine decided to stay up for 2 entire days straight.

It was terrible in the first day, we could barley keep our eyes open. But coffee and monster pulled us through until the 48 hours were near over...

Nearing the end , as we are in the last hours of sleeplessness I had walked in to my room and closed the door to do something that I don't recall. It may have been to change clothes

As I'm changing, I started to hear the moaning and groaning of a person outside my window.

I took a good look outside, and saw no source of sound. It didn't get louder when I had opened the window either.

I had then started to hear my shower turn on, but when I opened my door to try and confirm someone was showering the noise stopped. I had opened and closed my door a few times and the noise stopped and started along with the door.

So I finished whatever I was doing, went in to the hallway and told my friend what happened  and that it was time to sleep. I was exhausted and confused as hell, maybe too tired to completely understand the fear I maybe should have been condoning. But, who knows.

So now comes for the most real and recent occurrence, this only happened 2 weeks ago.

So it was a Monday night, with school being off for Tuesday I managed to get my dad to drop me off to meet up with some girl to meet up with (Around 7:00 at night when he dropped me off).

The night played through, and it was eventually time for me to go (Around midnight when I left) . But luckily for me my ride fell asleep on me (Mom -.-) [More of my fault for staying with her so late]

So I didn't want to make her parents take me home, or make this anyone else's problem other than mine. So me being very tired thought ""Eh, I'll just walk, it wont take THAT long""

So I started off on my little (long as fuck ) adventure! I walked, and walked, and about 90 minutes in around 1:30 AM I'm walking by an elementary school in my neighborhood.

Everyone I have told this to has not believed me. So if you want to talk shit in the comments please don't waste your own time.

There was a leaf bag at the end of the street that connects with an intersection, but I swear to my life the leaf bag had limbs, was moving, and was on a bike.

I stared directly at it for moments at a time and it continued to ride the bike. It rode the bike, moving it's limbs but it was not going anywhere.

So, I just kept walking. Now pretty freaked out I start seeing black figures fly across my field of vision.

I just fucking ran because of that, past the elementary school, until I came across a giant parking lot for the church nearby.

So I took a breath for a moment or two, then I saw someone maybe 15 feet away. It was a pretty normal sized person, but it was wearing a full black coat, I could see nothing but black on it.

That just horrified me, I ran even more because of the adrenaline rush seeing that thing gave me. When I stopped running I could feel my pulse beat like drums. It was so irregular and strange, it would thump a few times, stop for a few seconds, and thump a few times again. I never saw that someone again.

I was very close to home at this moment, so I finished my 2 hour walk that lasted from 12AM-2AM within the next 15 minutes or so. The moment I finally made it home was amazing.

I can't say I know what was going on that night, or any of those times. But I can ensure to you that these things all really happened. I just can't explain how.",It has happened 3 times.,16
Cremewagon,1,4,1r15us,9,"I'm 26 years old and I have been suffering from chronic sleep paralysis for about 9 years now.  I figured this would be a good place to recount some of the experiences I've had.

**Chicago** -  I was living with my girlfriend in a very tiny basement apartment.  The apartment was dirty and had low ceilings.  In our bedroom we had a bed and what was probably meant to be a closet in the corner of the room, only there was no door on it and no light fixture.  This corner of the room was always dark.  

My sleep paralysis dreams have always been vivid in the extreme.  Every detail is captured exactly how it would be as if I was awake.  It truly is impossible to tell the difference. 

My first incident at the apartment was one night when I fell asleep to my girlfriend watching Bridezillas in the other room.  I could see the light from the TV flashing under the doorway and hear the audio.  

Something was very wrong.  I could sense a presence and I knew it was in the dark closet/corner of my room.  It had not revealed itself, but it was there.  There is no fight or flight response in my very worst experiences.  It is just distilled terror.  I cannot move, cannot breathe, cannot scream.  That's when it comes out of the corner.  It moves very quickly.  Skittering almost.  I can see flashes of pale skin and long dark hair.  It is on the bed in seconds, I can feel the weight of it tugging on the covers.  Then it is on top of me.  I cannot breathe and I am face to face with something so evil that it is seared into my memory.  It is a woman, only she has a tiny face, her eyes are lambent green and she has draped her hair over me, trapping me right next to her face.  I can feel tiny puffs of stale breath on my cheek and the weight becomes unbearable.  I scream and wake up.  

This happened a few times, always the same woman.  Sometimes she would crawl out of the corner and across the ceiling before dropping onto my bed.  Sometimes she would just morph out of the shadows and appear on me.  This happened numerous times at this location and then she just stopped showing up.  

After a year we moved to a slightly larger apartment a few blocks away from the Belmont stop.  Sleep paralysis was very rare for me at this point.  We had lived at this place for about two months when I had another episode.

**Second Incident-**  I had just finished watching ""The Pixar Story"" on Netflix and had paused it on the credits and fell asleep with the lamp on beside me.  I had fallen asleep on my recliner so I was sitting up, which is strange because all of my other experiences I had been on my back.

When I wake up I see a massive being sitting next to me.  To put him into scale, I am sitting in the recliner and he is sitting on the ground.  The top of his head is level with my chin.  This would put him around 7-9 feet tall standing up.  Not only that but there was an aura of power that was palpable and just emanated from it.  He/it is resting there, it is the color of black marble.  I can see beads of perspiration on the skin.  Whatever it is, it is absurdly muscled and well defined.  Every possible muscle is nearly bursting out of the black marble flesh.  I can see the jugular vein in its neck beating with the pulse, black blood pumping through the spiderweb of veins under its skin.  I know now that it is a male.  His eyes are closed but I know they are completely yellow if they were to open.  I know that if I wake him I will die.  I sit there and watch him, he does nothing but breathe in and out as the perspiration rolls off his body.  This goes on for fifteen minutes or so.

When I woke up from this one I had a deep sense that I had encountered something from another realm.  That is really the only way to describe it.  It was too real.  Nothing in my room had changed, ""The Pixar Story"" was still paused and my lamp was still on.  But the presence of whatever I had just seen lingered for a long time.  

Another interesting thing about this one that sticks out.  I've never seen him again.  He just showed up once.  Which I thought was odd, because something as vivid and unique as this entity seems like a perfect thing for the mind to hold onto and conjure up again.  But it's been close to four years now and I have not seen him a second time.  I hope he never comes back, honestly.

**Third Incident-**  And now my last one.  This one happened three days ago.  I live in an apartment in Licoln, NE now and this is the first time it has happened here.  

I was laying on my side when I woke up, for some reason my phone was on and the clock is showing 2:01 a.m.  I live in the basement unit and there are orange sodium lights that shine into my room through the blinds.  One of the blinds is slightly lifted because my room-mate set her coffee there while she crocheted a scarf earlier.  Her knitting stuff is still on the chair.  At this point I start panicking because I cannot move and I know what is happening.  

There is a tapping on the window.  Really quick, light taps, followed by some scratching.  Like a cat is trying to get inside.  The orange lights start casting some strange shadows on the floor and I can see something moving outside the window.  It is moving with intelligence, trying to figure out a way in.  There are tiny puffs of humidity on the window too, so I know something is breathing on it.  At this point, I'm seriously trying to wake up because this is going to get very bad.  It moves over to the far right part of the window and starts tapping and scratching again.  Then it unlatches the window and opens it.  A frail looking arm slips in.  The skin is either dark, dark green or black and slimy.  The rest of it slips and it looks strangely cat-like, only minus the fur, and it glistens in the orange of the sodium lamps.  It just kind of sits there and stares at me with large pure black eyes.  Then it runs at me, only it moves without grace, like stop motion gone wrong.  I manage to turn my head and scream.  When I wake up I am moaning quietly.  

What bothered me about this one though is that my phone was on, and showing 2:04 a.m. when I woke up.  My phone had no reason to be on, the only thing I can figure is that I bumped into it during the episode.  

So, yup, those are my stories and yes, having these experiences have made it difficult to fall asleep some nights.  I've got a lot more of these experiences and I'll probably share them later, but this is enough for now.",I suffer from chronic sleep paralysis.,13

How delightful it is to talk to you all. 

Oh, I do so enjoy you humans, with all your neuroses and doubts and shames and all that beautiful, sublime pain you all lock so far away inside yourselves. After all, if it weren't for those negative emotions, my kind wouldn't be able to survive.

But I digress.

I have no name. My kind do not have names. We are all and all are one. The vessel I am currently inhabiting was named Jack, so think of me as such. But I am not Jack. I am something else, entirely. I am Legion, and we are many. We are what you might call demons, or ghouls, or spirits, or just nightmares if you prefer. Yes, we are nightmares.

We have existed for aeons, as long as your kind has. We feed off your misery and hatred, and we consume like locusts drawn to crops. We have no bodies, and our true forms are so far removed your existence that you would not even be able to comprehend us. That is why we choose your forms to inhabit. Flimsy as they may be, your forms are the most equipped to handle us. They give us armour to wage our war of attrition on your pitiful race.

Jack was not the first I have inhabited, nor will he be the last. But it is his form I use to confirm to your kind that the dark things they have feared since time began are very, very real. We are as real as you, and we wish you nothing but suffering. We are suffering, in it's purest form. We are darkness, we are fear and we are death. You fear hell as a place, but hell is not somewhere you arrive at. Hell is something you carry within you. We are hell.

This is no invasion we are planning. Our invasion began since the first of us took it's first host from your tribe. And we will continue to do so. We will not stop. Our kind will carry on until yours cannot. We will consume this world and all it's energy until we are the ones who sit atop it, not you. 

You most likely ask yourself why we do this. We have no motive, beyond sustaining ourselves with your sorrow. Your anguish is our lifeblood. We are creatures of evil, who exist to inflict our malice and ill-will upon you because we can. This is not merely ambition; this is our sport. 

And there is nothing you can do. We cannot be stopped. Your gods and science have failed you in the end. All you can do is sit back and await the tide of darkness that will eventually swallow you whole.

We are Legion.

We are many.

You cannot hide.

You cannot escape.",We Have Come To Scare You To Death.,29
2398412039419023,0,5,1qyqag,7,"I was in a dark place, I was 18, lonely, tired of going to school and even more tired of having to follow the route my father laid out for me. If I knew better, I’d have stuck to the path, I’d have gone to college that year. Anyways, it only took a sudden and intense realization to convince me I wanted a calm, sure and safe life.

I had saved a few thousand dollars over my high school life, I told my psychiatrist father I was going to travel the US and meet people and find myself. He told me that he would wait here for me, he was supportive, and I left that night with a backpack and mind filled with new hope. 

I hitchhiked for a few months from the west to the east coast, I met new people like I hoped, and met a girl names Karen. Karen was like me, and unlike me, she left her home in Nevada to find herself also, but she was very dismissive of authority, I could tell she came from a rough background. Nevertheless, I fell in love with Karen. We ended up making in to West Virginia, I wasn’t used to the cold, coming from California, but we weathered through, and our common interest in the great outdoors brought us to the forests of Appalachia.  

We slept in a makeshift tent we made and traversed deeper into the forest, together we felt safe and I became lost in her beauty. Of course we didn’t shower often, and when we did we had to huddle for warmth after the cold river bath, but I didn’t mind. Against my wishes we left the trails and traveled into the untouched wilderness, we even saw a few old camps what looked to be moonshine stills. 

I often woke up to the sound of birds chirping, and the rushing of the river we followed deeper into the wilderness. That morning however, was silent, and Karen was nowhere to be found, my money was gone, and so was most of my food, all that was left was my ID and some clothes. Our camp  looked like a bear had gone through it, and the space blanket we used to sleep under was shredded everywhere. I was freaked out, and even more so that the scattered gear was leading in a general direction. 

I followed the trail of detritus, gathering my food and water, my money and even Karen’s belongings. I thought she had made out with my stuff and ran off, leaving me in the wilderness, but now it seemed like she was taken against her own will. 

Well, I followed the trail to a clearing, surrounded by a rusted, holed fence that looked about fifty years old. The clearing was probably a hundred meters in diameter. No roads led to it, and in the middle of the clearing was a concrete cube with a rusty and half open metal door. The gray cube was cracked, with rebar sticking out and covered in ivy. 

For a few minutes in contemplated leaving, I had the items I needed to leave, with my wits and my health, but without my dignity. I didn’t think I loved her enough to go into the door, let alone go farther into what I assumed was darkness. I tested my flashlight and opened the door. 

Immediately the smell of mold and basement was overwhelming, I didn’t think I could handle it so I wrapped a t-shirt around my nose and mouth. I looked around and into a concrete room about the size of a waiting room, and a hallway leading to rock and cave. 

I traveled further down the cave, and it dripped with moisture and the walls were fungal. I saw blood on the walls, and a handprint that was recent and bloody, Karen’s size. I ran out of the cave, I swore I heard the sounds of screaming as I ran out, but it might have been mine. I left the concrete rooms and closed the door. 

I ran out of the forest, taking catnaps where I could and called my father, I couldn’t be happier to use a payphone, and I was flown home, dirt and sores and all. I cried in my father’s shoulders, finally un-numb from the events that played out the day before. I realized I didn’t want adventure, I didn’t want excitement. I never old anyone about what happened, I went to college, went to med school and became a surgeon. I still have nightmares to this day, Karen, I assume survives only in my memories. 

There’s one thing I saw though that will stay to me, it will probably be my last memory before I die, that’s the creature I saw, looking me dead in the eyes as I glanced from Karen’s bloody handprint to the dark path ahead. Pale, firmly attached to the ceiling of the cave, with white eyes and black teeth, shiny with sweat and glaring. A primal beast, it brought out primal fear within me, and I ran the fastest I had. I don’t regret my cowardice, I would probably be dead or worse if I went deeper into the cave.

J_Milton,0,7,1qxvz0,8,"Take a moment to forget you're human.

Forget that you were raised by these monsters, eat meals with them, sleep in the buildings they built.

Take a moment to consider all the terrible, vicious, beasts that flee in terror before these creatures. The most terrifying specters that we read about here are only ever shadows of them at most.

Think of how they swept across this planet in a frenzy. Killing and devouring everything that was worth their time. Hunting to extinction or overwhelming all other predators until they remained the last monster on this planet.

Think of the madness that this mammoth race has endured since it killed off it's last nemesis. The anger that used to push at the borders of their territory with no other channel left except back at itself.

Consider the most blood thirsty monster ever born of the primordial ooze with nothing left to fear, nothing left to fight, nothing left to conquer, nothing left at all but to sit alone on it planet and pick at itself.

Now that you have a clear picture in your head, remember the horror in the wake of these creatures the next time you leave your house. Think of all the suffering and blood behind them when they approach you. Think of all that wrath with no outlet when it shakes your hand and bares its teeth at you.

creativedoo,1,6,1qvngm,7,"My reflection didn’t start talking to me until one night as I was finishing up some research paper for English. As I typed away, I heard a barely audible sound of somebody hitting their knuckles on a glass surface. I turned away from my unfinished paper and looked towards where I thought it might have come from. The living room outside my bedroom was empty, last time I remembered, I lived in this apartment by myself. After a few seconds of hearing nothing but the hum of my laptop and the sound of my own heartbeat, I dismissed the noise and turned back to my paper.

An hour into my homework, I heard again a distinct sound of something tapping on glass. Annoyed, I get up and walk out of my room and into the living room.

Alright, I think to myself. What the hell is that sound?

I heard it again, as I scanned the surroundings, checking the coffee table to see if anything had fallen off. The air in the living room was still and the ceiling fan was turned off, so it wasn’t the wind moving things around. As I looked around, my attention was caught on my reflection in a large mirror that covered about a quarter of my living room wall. There was a man standing there, however as I stared at him for a long time, I saw his arm rise up and fall on the mirror. The noise made me jump. The man’s lips quivered, his chest heaving, as though trying hard to contain his emotions. 

As I stared, the man’s lips moved.

“Get me out!” He cried. “I want my body back, I want my life-“. He stopped to take a deep breath.

“Please, for God’s sake let me out”. His body shook as he spoke, staring directly at me.

I walked towards the mirror, close enough to now see trails of wet lines running down his cheeks. His brown curly hair was a mess, in contrast to mine which I had combed this morning before heading to college. I stared at his white, tears stained t-shirt, which unlike mine looked as though it was never washed. 

My lips widened to a grin. “This customer is very satisfied with his stay, unfortunately. No trade backs”. I said before making my way back to hi- I mean my room. “And keep the tapping down, I’m inviting yo- sorry my girlfriend over. Wouldn’t want to scare her away now, would you?”.

Chibler1964,5,1,1qve4k,6,"Hunters say that there are two main causes for accidents in the field. Stupidity, and not wearing enough blaze. But I'll tell you what, all the blaze orange in the world couldn't have saved Mick, a Cornell graduate, expert marksman, and my best friend. Sometimes when I look back I think stupidity would have saved me.

I used to love the fall, the leaves changed, the weather mercifully became pleasantly brisk and provided relief from the sweltering Midwest summers. Autumn meant bonfires and apple cider. Beer and highschool football games from a school we had long since left behind. In a sense we all felt young again. We got rid of business clothes, said fuck it to having a clean car, tried to meld ourselves into the outdoors, and tuned the radio to a country station. Every fall weekend it was like this except for one special week which was the best of all. Deer season. We all took our vacations that week. On Friday night before the season opened at sunrise we would all load up into the trucks and drive out to our buddy Chuck's farm out in the country. Prime buck territory with no one around. It used to be a big ordeal, but over the years the numbers had dwindled. 

Pointer's wife wouldn't let him go because I was there, she thought I was trying to steal him. It was sad, the way she kept his balls in a vice. And then there was Ricky, he had a bad back; Marty, Joey, Huston, all the guys just kind of dwindled away. That left me and Mick, Chuck's brother Damion was MIA, and Chuck had to be away on business but was kind enough to let us use his land still. 

So there we were, Mick and I; we had been best friends since kindergarten when he stood up on the bus an announced ""I'm gonna marry Lauren Hoff."" I cried to my mom as soon as I got home, my life was ruined. She responded by setting up a play date, we were friends for life after that. We grew up together, I told him when his girlfriends were being bitches, he beat the shit out of a guy who hit me. We took care of each other, sometimes I think back and wish we had gotten married, maybe this wouldn't have happened then.

We had cracked the first beer the second we were out of the truck, that was about 10 AM on Friday, I don't know how young we thought we were. The whole night was pretty calm. Finnally we decided to liven it up and go explore the hay loft we used to jump out of as kids. We went into the barn and breathed in the musty smell of hay and old wood. It was calming and pleasant. We hung around in the stable for a while until Mick suddenly started running toward the ladder to the hay loft. It was a foot race, and one I couldn't miss, I took off after him and started clambering up the ladder. I was half way up when I realized that Mick had stopped. ""Whoa, creepy"" he said. ""What!? I was dying to know what he was seeing. ""Looks like Chuck's got a squatter"" Mick said. We went up and poked around, nothing too sinister just some old beer cans and food wrappers with a makeshift bed of straw. ""Homeless baby Jesus in the manger?"" Mick quipped, I socked his arm playfully. 

We cleaned up the garbage and got out of there, not worried at all; things like this weren't uncommon in the rural area. It was getting cold out so we went back to the newer tin barn we were staying in. We fired up Chuck's wood burning furnace and settled in. The place looked like a thin shack from the outside but inside it was decked out. TV, DVD player, a small kitchen, and even a real toilet. So we spent most of that night hanging out in the shed talking and watching a movie or two. We were a little drunk, so when Mick asked me ""Why didn't we ever date?"" I wasn't able to respond with anything witty or quick, or even minority socially acceptable. I just tried to get a few extra moments to think by chugging my beer which I needed up spilling down my front. ""You're cute when you do that"" he said, and started to lean in. 

BANG! BANG! BANG! Somthing was beating on the outside of the shed behind us. We both froze and slowly turned toward the rear wall when it happened again. BANG BANG this time. Mick let out a nervous giggle before we both jumped up simultaneously to grab our rifles. The thing kept banging on the shed. We didn't need to speak to communicate, we both knew the building was secure, we would just stay in here until the banging went away and come out in the morning. We turned the TV down so no one could hear it.

After a few minutes, the banging stopped. We started to calm down, but we kept our firearms loaded. We eventually dozed off around 2, only to be rudely awoken by my alarm at 5:30. It was time to go out and get in The stands. Walking to the stands was a mess, they were deep in the woods, but it was worth it to be able to hunt in such pristine wilderness our stands were about a mile apart, but for the first five we walked together. I wish we had owned an ATV but we were all purists at that time, and we thought that was cheating. 

Around mile three Mick suddenly stopped. He paused and picked up his foot and looked at the bottom, ""Son of a bitch"" he said looking at the mass of grey fur and entrails adhered to his boot by the aid of coagulated blood. ""Looks like there's bobcats out"" I said as I looked at the mass of dead coyote on his boot treads. 

The rest of the walk as uneventful, I got to my stand, saw Mick off and wished him luck. I kept my eyes peeled for a couple hours before my eyelids began to droop. I was almost at the point of dozing off when I was startled by a gunshot ringing in the distance. Mick must have bagged one, we wer pe the only ones out there. Then again, three successive shots. That's when I knew somthing was wrong. Part two: http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qzu3b/hunting_accident_part_2/",Hunting Accident Part 1,7

Part 8. June 15. Friday night.
	
My memories of what happened after getting caught in the avalanche are blurry at best. I slipped in and out of consciousness multiple times. When I was conscious, I was only vaguely aware of what was going on around me. I was unable to process things logically, so the few memories I do have are nonsensical. Over time, however, things became more and more clear. I became aware that I was lying down, with my leg propped upward, supported by something. I became aware of shapes moving in and out of my vision, and I could hear voices over me, saying things I couldn’t completely understand.
	
I don’t know how long I was in that state, passing from unconsciousness to semi-consciousness. All I know is that after a while, once things became clear again, I found myself lying in a hospital bed, with my left leg set in a cast and held above my head. There was a very dim light coming through the window, which indicated that it was late. I tried to prop myself up to see my surroundings better, but was met with a sharp pain in my ribs. I winced, and slowly lowered myself back onto the bed, when I heard a voice come from the side of the room.
	
“You took a lot of damage from that fall. You should probably rest a bit before you try to move around.”
	
I turned my head toward the direction of the voice. I saw a man standing a ways from my bed, looking at me in concern. He was tall and black, with short black hair, and a goatee. He wore black clothing, with a white clerical collar around his neck. There must have still been some pain-killers in my system, as I needed to look at him for a long while before I could recognize the man.
	
“Michael?” I asked.
	
He smiled and walked up closer to my bed. “I see you’re more or less normal again. You were really out of it for a while there. Every once in a while you’d wake up and start muttering gibberish before you passed out again. Honestly, I was worried that you might have hit your head on the way down.”
	
“I imagine that those were just the effects of whatever drugs they put me on” I responded. “How did I survive that fall?”
	
“After the mountain stopped shaking, and the snow had settled, I called the ambulance, and told them to meet us at the base of the mountain. I used the mountain climbing equipment you had me pack to climb off the trail and get you. I pulled you back up to the trail, and then carried you down to them.”
	
“I see” I said. “I suppose I owe you a thank you, then.”
 	
“Well I’m glad you feel that way, because I have a few questions I’d like answered” he responded. 
	
“Such as?” I asked.
	
He sighed. “Where to begin?” He stayed silent for a long time, before saying, “Let’s start simple. You told me that religious artifacts repel entities in whatever form they’ve taken. And yet in that cavern, the man simply swatted yours out of your hand. Why is that?”
	
“Ah...that” I responded. “That was a tactical error on my part. Remember how I told you that the entity was controlling the mountain, not the man? Akhetamet was *speaking through* the man, but was not actually *possessing* him. The man was probably being influenced by Akhetamet in the same way that Pastor Richard was, but he seemed to have a more significant connection to Akhetamet than Richard. So, when I held up the vial of holy water, I was holding it up in front of a regular man, not in front of the entity, which is why it had no effect.”
	
“So the man was acting of his own free-will?” Michael asked.
	
“To an extent, yes. I imagine that Akhetamet was giving him orders, but he was not being made to follow them. I was not fighting the entity in that cavern, just a man that the entity was influencing. Which reminds me, were either of the other men found?”
	
Pastor Michael shook his head gravely. “I told the authorities that there were two other men up there somewhere, but as far as I’m aware, they’ve yet to be found. I imagine they were lost in the avalanche.” 
	
“I see” I said. “It is a shame that we couldn’t save them. They may have been acting somewhat of their own accord, but in the end, they were only pawns.” There was a long silence after that, before I asked, “Is there anything else that you want explained?”
	
“Oh, I’m just getting started” he replied. “Why didn’t he kill us in that cave? I mean, he waited until after we were done with the exorcism to start the avalanche. If he could have done that the entire time, why wait until then?”
	
“I think the most likely reason is that he had not taken us as a serious threat. Doing what he did must have taken an incredibly large amount of energy. He wouldn’t have wanted to waste that much energy if he thought he could kill us just as easily by throwing his follower at us. Or perhaps he had some ulterior motive. I can only guess at his reasoning.”
	
“Pride before a fall” he muttered to himself. There was another, shorter silence, before Michael asked, “Who is ‘HE’?”
	
I responded with complete honesty. “I have absolutely no idea.”
	
“You said you’d heard of HIM before?” Michael asked.
	
“Only once. Another entity had mentioned HIM  many years back. If I had to guess, I would say that HE is simply another entity. One whom the other entities hold in high regard. Almost like their own Messiah. But other than that, I can conclude nothing.”
	
“And do you think that Akhetamet’s threat is something we should take seriously? That HE really is coming?” 
 
“I don’t know, but from what I’ve heard, the entities certainly seem to *think* that HE is coming. Whether HE is a real threat or not, I do not know. I will have to report this incident to my agency. If there is any genuine threat, we will look into it.”

I could tell that he was dissatisfied with that answer, but he seemed to understand that this was the best answer he was going to get. He leaned back against the wall to my right side. 

“What exactly is your agency?” he asked. “Do you all work for the government?”

“My *branch* of the agency works *with* the United States government. We provide protection from entities, and in turn, the United States government offers us its support when it is needed. We are, however, an international group, with no ties to any one government.  Having full governmental support is useful when we need to keep certain matters under the rug. Or when I need to bully uncooperative police officers into assisting me.”

“If what you’re saying is true, then why don’t more people know about this? Why isn’t this information about entities public?” he asked.

“My agency is of the opinion that any information involving the existence of entities should be kept on a need-to-know basis. I personally believe that we should make our information public, but I do not rank high enough for my opinion to be worth anything.”

“This is a lot to take in” he said. “Although, I suppose that, based off of everything I’ve seen, I can’t really doubt your word.”

“There’s something else you should be aware of” I said. “You also are not at liberty to share this information with anyone. I’m going to have to report to my agency that you’re aware of the reality of entities now. Because of that, they’re going to be watching you carefully. If you say the wrong thing to the wrong person, I’m afraid you may face some…consequences. I do apologize.”

Michael sighed, and glanced out the window. It was dark now, and was probably very late. He looked at his watch, and then he began putting on his coat. “The doctors say that if you think you feel well enough, you can leave tomorrow afternoon.”

“Tomorrow? There’s nothing more they need to do?” I asked

“They said that the injuries weren’t as bad as they could have 
been, and apparently the procedures for patching you up were simple enough. If you want, I can come by when they release you and drive you back to your motel.” 

“I’ll take your offer. Except for one thing: don’t take me to the motel. I would like you to drive me to the bus station.”

“What? You’re leaving already?” he asked.

“My job here is done. I have no further reason to delay. Plus, the sooner I report to the council about HIM, the sooner they can begin looking into it.”

Michael nodded. “If you say so. I’ll stop by the motel tomorrow morning and gather your stuff for you.”

“That would be very helpful. Thank you.”

Without any further words, Michael walked out the door and left.

I woke up early the next morning. The sun’s morning rays were shining through my window, illuminating the room with their dull light. I tried to sit up before remembering that my leg was still propped up above my head. Realizing that the endeavor would be fruitless, I again laid my head down on my bed. I had not been awake for two minutes before a nurse walked into my room.

“Mr. Sloan, you have a visitor. I informed them that it was early and that you might not be awake, but if you feel up to it, I can show them in.”

“It’s alright with me” I responded, curious as to who would be visiting me at this hour. Michael would be coming later, so it seemed unlikely that it would be him. When the nurse went to 
open the door, I was surprised to see Nancy walk into the room.

“Why Mr. Sloan! You’re quite a wreck. I had heard that you were hurt, but I hadn’t expected you to be in this bad of a condition. Are you feeling okay?” 

She seemed different. For the first time since I had arrived, her hair was clean and neatly combed. There were no longer heavy bags under her eyes, and from what I could tell, her eyes were no longer red from her constant crying. But there was something else about her still. She no longer looked as fragile as she had before. In all of my previous conversations with her, she looked as if the wrong word could cause her to burst into hysterics. Now, though, that aspect of frailty was nowhere to be seen. 

“Yes, I’m feeling fine, Nancy” I responded.

“I’m very glad. I heard about the avalanche last night, and I came as soon as I could. Is there anything I can do for you?” she asked.

“No, I should be alright” I responded.

There was a brief silence, before she asked, hesitantly, “What were you and Pastor Michael doing up on that mountain anyway?” I knew from the way she asked that she partially expected the answer I was going to give her.

“We were looking for Joshua.”

“Oh, I see” she said. She hesitated again, before asking, “And…and did you find anything?”

In my line of work, I have had to tell many people, too many people, that their loved ones had died. It is not something you can ever get used to, and it is not something that ever becomes easier. I knew that now was the time to tell her, but the words caught in my throat. I had already caused her so much pain, led her on to believe that Joshua was still alive, and now I had to take all the hopes I had given her, and crush them. 

I had not said anything yet. I couldn’t bring myself to. There was a brief silence, before Nancy finally said, “Please, Mr. Sloan. I’m ready.”
 
“He’s dead, Nancy. Joshua Auburn is dead.”

I turned away from her then. I expected sobs, the same hysterical weeping I had heard from her before. Instead, I heard a voice.

“It’s not…it’s not your fault, Mr. Sloan. Sometimes…sometimes things like this just…happen, and there’s…” Her voice broke as she said this last part, “There’s just nothing you can do about it.” 
It was at that moment that she wept. She covered her mouth with her hand, and quietly sobbed at my bedside.

How long she remained there, I do not know. After a time, though, the tears stopped. She sniffed a few times, and pulled out a tissue to wipe her eyes. I turned to face her then. Her mascara had run down her face, and her eyes were red, but there was something in her face now that I hadn’t seen before.

When I looked into her eyes, I saw pain, grief, sorrow, but I also saw courage. I have seen many families who have had to deal with the loss of a loved one, but have never experienced such tragedy myself. I have always assumed that accepting something like that, understanding that you would have to live the rest of your life without that person, and then doing so, is an act that requires the utmost courage. It was that courage that I saw in 
Nancy’s eyes now.

It was then that I discovered the other part of Akhetamet’s influence. The part I had not considered before. Perhaps he was right when he said that people had made their own idols, but he had made it impossible to let go of those idols. When Akhetamet had been in power, Nancy would never have been able to accept Joshua’s death. She would never have been able to live her own life without him. But now she could move on.

*“Do you honestly believe that your actions will make a difference if they succeed?”* Akhetamet had asked.

As I looked up at Nancy, finally able to truly accept her loved one’s death, and finally able to move on, I knew that I truly had made a difference in at least one person’s life. And in the end, isn’t that enough?

She stood up after that, and apologized for taking up my time. We exchanged a few more words, before she started heading for the door. Before she left, she turned and looked at me one last time. “Mr. Sloan.”

I looked up at her.

“Thank you. For everything.”

Without another word, she walked out the door, and closed it behind her.

Shortly after Nancy’s departure, the nurses began preparing me for *my* departure. I put on the clothes I had worn yesterday, and was given crutches to use for getting out the door. 

Just as he had promised, Michael was waiting outside in his car. I thanked the nurses and the doctors for their services, and made my way out.

By the time we reached the station, we had not said a single word to each other. I got out of the car, and he carried my luggage for me to the bus. We said our goodbyes to each other, but before I left, there was one more thing to do.

I handed him an envelope, and told him to take it to the police station for me.

“What’s inside?” he asked

“It’s simply a statement by my agency, stating that Joshua Auburn and Pastor Richard Smith are to be considered dead, and there is to be no further investigation into their disappearances.”

“The full support of the United States government comes in handy now and then, doesn’t it?” he asked.

“You have no idea.”

I boarded the bus with my luggage, and took a seat near the back. The bus left the station after a few more minutes. I spent most of the trip thinking about one thing that Akhetamet had said.

*“HE is going to rise, and tear this world apart. We are all going to cross from our hellish world, and kill every living thing that walks in this worthless universe, until there is nothing left alive!”*

As a field worker, my job is generally to react to supernatural scenarios. When entities cross over, it is my job to deal with them. But the problem that often arises is that by the time I can react, somebody will have gotten hurt. In this case, it was Joshua Auburn, and countless others who had suffered because of my agency’s reaction time. 

But now we knew of the threat beforehand. Now we knew that something was coming, and we could act to stop it before it arrived. As the bus drove away from the small town, one thought crossed through my mind:

The time for reacting was over. Now the hunt had begun.

This is the final part of ""The Disappearance of Joshua Auburn"". I tried to explain everything as best I could, but if there is something that I mentioned in this account that any of you still have questions on, please ask me in the comments. I would be more than willing to answer them to the best of my abilities.",The Disappearance of Joshua Auburn (Part 8),19
DistortedColours,7,8,1qt656,7,"Alright. I've never used this thing before. Hell, I made an account just to share this with you guys. Let's hop right into it. I started to date this girl named Eowyn. I'm a total Lord Of The Rings fan, of course. So her name was the first thing that caught my attention. Now, her appearance.. Was interesting. She looked like a walking doll of sorts. Pale skin, long, almost unnaturally black hair with bangs that cut just right above her eyes. Small lips. She always wore bright red lipstick, so she looked like she was pouting 99% of the time. Eowyn had a dainty figure I guess we could call it. Everything about her was.. petite. Now, her eyes. They were beautiful but terrifying. Those things are gonna haunt my dreams for the rest of my life. She had large, almond shaped eyes topped of with thick eyelashes. One eye was impossibly blue. The other? Grey. Almost silver. 

This story of what happened is going to seem rushed. I know it is. But guys. I'm seriously terrified. I **need** your help. Eowyn. Damn. She was the definition of perfect. Absolutely adorable.. Or so I thought. Let me catch you up.

 I met her at some cheap wanna-be Starbucks here in my hometown. I go in there every day before work and order the exact same thing. New girl. Now, I live in a pretty small town. I think it would've been pretty safe to say I knew everybody's name. And if someone moved in, news would've spread around pretty fast. That smirk she gave me when I stuttered with my usually-automatic order.. Damn it.. I wish I wouldn't have become so used to it. I got my drink, though. And headed to work. I didn't get anything important done and boss-man was pissed. What can I say? I was smitten.

The story is pretty boring for a little while. I go back, use my smooth words and pick up Eowyn's number. Cool. We texted for a little while and started dating. Everything was normal, right? It was a month or so when I asked her to move her stuff to my place. She refused my help when I offered. She wouldn't even tell me her address. I thought it was odd, but hell. This girl was perfect. Who was I to question it? As a male living off of minimum wage in his mid-twenties, I was *not* the one to be turning away girls. She had.. a few things. She brought in maybe.. three boxes? All with clothes. Well. With the exception of one. It was a medium sized velvet box with a lock on it. I haven't seen a key for it. And right now.. I don't know if I want to know what's inside.  We lived happily for a little while. I got a promotion and was making more money.

 To celebrate, I took Eowyn out for a little something special. I bought her the nicest engagement ring I could afford with an emerald on the center. She wasn't a girl for diamonds. And she loved anything green. Anyways. I took her out to dinner, then outside of the coffee shop which we met at. I did the whole romantic ""Look over there.""  got down on one knee and proposed. She said yes. And what happened then isn't something I'd like to share with reddit. That's bedroom business.

Now we're at three months in. Everything was going great. Right here is when I began something I should never have done. I was thinking too much. And I noticed something. This girl.. had no imperfections. At all. From her flawless skin to her personality. She never got mad. I've never seen her mad. The more I thought about it, the crazier it drove me. Her perfection was beginning to terrify me. I've spent too much time thinking about it and I began to try to push my limits with her. 

Drinking more often, staying out later, talking about my exes. Nothing seemed to phase her. Hell. She spoiled me when I had terrible hangovers and worked extra hours and over her weekends to make up for the money I was losing by staying home. Despite her working more, she continued to seem.. so full of energy. As I think back on it.. I don't think I've ever seen her sleep. Even when we lay down to go to sleep at night together. I'm always the first asleep. Maybe she just fell asleep after I did and woke up before me.. I don't know. 

Now we're at a week ago. It was around.. midnight, I think. I was sitting at the dining room table with a cold glass of beer. Eowyn was at work on a night she was supposed to have stayed home. I couldn't stop thinking about her. The more and more I thought about it.. The less she seemed human to me. At first I passed it off as reading too many scary stories. I snapped. I felt something inside finally break.

 And I'm beginning to think it was my sanity. When you're going crazy you can *feel* it. I knew what I had to do when she lay down for bed that night. I waited. I stayed up and waited. She came home around three; when her shift ended. 3:24AM I think was the exact time I made the biggest mistake of my life.. I thought it was about time to find out for sure if she was human.

I grabbed the biggest most sharp knife I could find in our kitchen and snuck into our bedroom. She looked asleep. I gently crawled onto our bed and found myself staring at her face. The moonlight flooding in from the open window was enough to light up her face. She seemed to glow. I grinned like a madman. This is the part I grew to regret. I raised the knife above my head, both hands clasped around the handle as I plunged it into her chest. Her eyes shot open. Her gaze flickered between curiosity and betrayal before rolling into the back of her head, showing only the whites. 

Blood spurted out instantly, a red stream of it pouring out of her chest and over her dress. I was sure to have hit her heart at least three times. I rose the knife and plunged *again* and *again* and *again* countless times I plunged the knife into her chest.. I laughed like a mad man the whole time as blood spurted from her lifeless body. I stopped for just a moment, looking at her blood soaked dress. I smiled. I felt like I had overcome something that had been weighing me down. I leaned down, placing a kiss on her still warm lips. I lay the knife down on our nightstand before lowering myself onto the bed, falling asleep next to her.

I could finally be normal again.

Damn, I could not have been anymore wrong..

I woke up around ten in the morning to the smell of breakfast. Remembering what I had done the previous night, I shot up, staring at the space next to me where Eowyn's body *should* have been. The only thing in her spot were the bloody sheets. I jumped out of bed and ran into the kitchen. I stood there, dumbfounded. Eowyn was at the stove, functioning perfectly, making breakfast just as she usually does. 

I flinched as she went to turn around, expecting multiple gashes in her chest. There were no marks there. As if she'd never been hurt. She smiled at me, holding out a plate of food. I stared at her, not sure what to do. I waited just a moment before reaching out and taking the plate. I ate my food hesitantly, not being able to tear my gaze away from her chest. Not because I'm a pervert, but because there should be cuts there. We went about our day as normal.. As normal as I could considering she should be dead.

I lay down that night with her by my side. I was terrified to be by her, but grateful at the same time. I fell asleep quickly. I was rudely awaken some time in the middle of the night by a nasty *crack* noise that echoed in the room. I groaned and rolled over, checking the time by habit. I watched the clock turn to 3:24. I rolled back over, moving my arm to wrap around Eowyn to hopefully get back to sleep. My heart starting racing immediately when I realized she wasn't there. By instinct I turned my gaze to the door of our bedroom, which was cracked open for some reason. The hallway light was on, which was abnormal because Eowyn liked to sleep in the house as dark as we could get it. I squinted, seeing my fiance's figure in the doorway.

 It reeked of dried blood and rot. I suppressed a gag as I pretended to be asleep. She was wearing the same gown as the night I tried to kill her. Even in the small amount of light I could see her torn dress and the gashes in her chest. I slowly brought my hand over to our nightstand, only rubbing my fingers against the drying blood where the knife had been. I looked from my hand to her, noticing her small hands were wielding the weapon. She just stayed in that position and I watched her silently.

 I must've passed out, because the next thing I knew is it was around eleven in the morning, the sun was out, and the smell had disappeared. I jumped out of bed and looked out the window. Our car was gone. I looked on the nightstand and picked up a neatly folded letter. It was just like her to leave me notes when she had to run unexpected errands. I didn't know what I was supposed to do. I couldn't call the cops. Either I would get sent to jail for attempted murder, or I would get sent to a nuthouse. 

I fucked around on the internet all day that day and went to sleep before she came home. I woke up at the same time I did the night before, to the same noise. I instantly knew what had to be happening. The smell of rust and rot were stronger than they were before. I looked at the door to our room, it was closed this time. I let out a breath of relief too soon. Then something told me to turn my gaze toward our closet. 

The light was on, illuminating the room. Eowyn stood there, her head cocked to the side at impossible angles. She had.. a sinister grin on her face. I was happy to see that her hair was covering her face, I didn't want to look at those eyes.. Her dress seemed to be stained with fresh blood, and the red liquid was dripping off of the knife on to the floor. Something about this told me this blood was not her own. I was terrified but paralyzed with that fear.

 Just like what happened before; I passed out eventually has she had not moved from her spot. She was gone that morning too. I picked up the paper that day, reading that my ex[the one I talked about most frequently.] had been murdered in her sleep around 3:00AM that night. Something inside of me told me I knew who did this..

Now we're at yesterday night.. I lay down.. as usual.. I woke up again, but the smell was unbearably strong. My stomach churned. I instantly realized that my bedroom door and my closet door were both open and both lights were on. I slowly turned my head to the side the best I could, trying to seem like I were still asleep. My eyes trailed down to the foot of my bed and what I saw..

 I bit back a scream. There was Eowyn. Something about the moonlight from the window reflecting off of her skin made her face seem eerily beautiful. What I saw is something I will never forget. Eowyn was there.. knife in one hand.. leaning over the edge of our bed just slightly. Her head was cocked to the other side, a proud grin on her face. She looked like a child who had just won something at the fair. In her other hand, she held up the head of my ex. 

Pure terror seemed to be frozen on Samantha's face.. 
Where her head should have been connected to her neck, blood was dripping from the inside, onto the covers. Needless to say, I didn't sleep that night. I know I didn't. I blinked.. And Eowyn was gone. And the smell had faded into something much more dull.. I didn't move from my spot until the sun had come up. I looked on the nightstand to see that Eowyn left me another note telling me work had called her in and she wouldn't be home until very late tonight. 

I jumped up and ran into the bathroom, puking numerous times. Right after, I threw our sheets in our cheap washer and got online. I'm flinching at every noise the house makes. I don't know what to do. I'm at a loss, reddit. Please help me.","Dolly Girl. I need your help, reddit.",15
sineating,3,1,1r72fb,8,"So I'm very drunk right now and I'm sorry if this isn't super coherent.

My friend killed herself last year, in a park. An hour before they found her body another friend called me asking if I had seen her, cause she'd gone missing, and I started calling in-town friends to keep an eye out for her.

He called me again, an hour later, and said ""they found her"" and I didn't understand at first and he said ""what the fuck do you think happened?"" and, well. I hung up and curled up in the corner and cried for a little while. I thought she had hung herself.

I called another friend and she ran over to my place, and hugged me, and bought me a pack of smokes and told me we should walk. It was late, and it was dark out, and I swear to god I saw her hanging from every tree we went past, and she was staring right at me. She was waving around because the wind was fast and her feet were kicking, but she was staring right at me, I swear. She looked so angry.

We went over to a guys house to break the news, cause he's a really emotional guy and he'd need someone to hug while we told him. He cried. I stared at the wall and saw her feet kicking. 

We left, and it must have been 1am and my phone was going off but I didn't want to hear it because I kept seeing her up in the trees, except now she was crouching on top of the branches and looking at me, and there was no rope around her neck and no gun (she took half her face off, and my friend's dad was the paramedic who took her away so I know this)and she was watching me? She was creeping along the branches and moving her hands and watching me.

I went home and cried some more and I was afraid and confused and I smoked a few cigarettes to calm down (I want to go buy a pack right now but)but I could still hear her, creeping along the branches. So angry. I didn't sleep but when I did, I heard the branches creaking under her, the crying in the woods, and the rope creaking. There was no rope, but I don't think it knows.

I visited her grave at night, and the branch of the tree above it (there was no tree I am afraid) creaked and snapped and touched my neck.

I keep hearing tapping on my window at night, and when I work night shift I won't look at the trees, because suicides turn into restless spirits, don't they?

Is she even still there?

Noonners,2,9,1qz9or,6,"I'm on my phone, saw this sub somewhere on the frontpage awhile back. I don't know if any of you can help but I want to vent, it's my right on the internet. I can't sleep, I have not slept all together for 24 hours now and I haven't had a good night of sleep for the past week. My uncle went missing around the time I started having trouble. Well, I say missing but everyone knows what happened.

 This country is going through a homophobic pedophilia craze right now, especially this little town. My uncle came out as gay a year but he's not a childfucker, I've known him for all my life, he has never done anything to me, it's not locked up somewhere in my brain. I know my head and I know my uncle. 

My parents don't care, they disowned him when he came out. Now he's missing, probably dead because of a lynch mob. It made me angry, I lashed out at them today. I came out as being bisexual right in front of them, I swear I saw my mom gag. Later my dad came to my room, he hugged me and said he was so sorry what had happened to me, he was crying, he thinks my uncle fucking raped me. I was so disgusted I had to  get out of the house. I want to get out of this spec of a country, worth fucking nothing. I think I can't sleep because I'm scared, scared of what happened to my uncle. I'm scared for my own safety. Wwetggjh

Edit: i think im being chased, someone tried to run me over, i called the police. I ran in the woods

Edt: my dad isnt picking up, my mom isnt either. I think im fucked, i think im dead. I think my dad told someone, i fucked up. I dont think any police is going to come, I'm behind a tree, i cant be here. Can someone please help, i live in abvastu parisj, edstonia.

Edit: There's this abandoned building, an unfinished flat, found it in the middle of the woods. I'm going to spend the night here, and then I'm going as far away from this shit hole as I can. Sweden is probably nicer, yeah Sweden. The police never called back, this town is fucked. 

They found this place. Small lights are surrounding this building, I hid myself in a closet.

Lulu5556,4,2,1qtp63,7,"I was told to submit my own sleep paralysis story, so here it is. Excuse any spelling mistakes as I'm typing on my phone from work.

First, some background: I work for a family as a Nurses Aide and take care of an elderly lady in her home. It's normally just her and I there, and she suffers from Dementia so I was told you have to take what she says with a grain of salt sometimes. The house I take care of her in was built in 1901 and has always given me the creeps, especially the basement. I've always felt something down there. Occasionally she'll ask of the visitors have left, even though no one visited her. I just figured she's remembering past events, no big deal. Turns out she might actually be seeing stuff I can't.

Since I normally get all my chores done relatively early, I take a nap mid afternoon while she naps as well because there's nothing to do, no wifi, no cable. I try not to fall into a deep sleep incase she needs me, so I can be easily woken up. Yesterday I did what I normally do, I put her in her chair, gave her some blankets and she passed right out. I went and laid down on the couch and laid down, drifting off as I watched the news. I woke up a few times not able to move, but snapped out of it quickly and brushed it off as exhaustion as I work long days. Then I woke up again, or I thought I did. My body wouldn't move and my eyes would barely open. There was a black figure across the room from me, near the lady I take care of. I couldn't make out any features since my eyes wouldn't open. I knew something was going on and tried to reach for my phone to set off an alarm to ""wake"" myself up. I still couldn't move and the figure whispered ""no pictures"". It must have thought I was trying to take a picture of it. The next thing I knew it was next to me, holding me down. I I was scared, it could tell. I finally was able to move and thrust out my arms pushing the figure over. Then it was gone. I immediately messaged my friend who deals with the supernatural, saying what happened. Another one of my friends told me it was sleep paralysis, which makes sense. Except for one thing, when I pushed it over I *felt* it. I could feel the thing against my skin, and felt the force when I pushed it.

I want to say it's sleep paralysis but something is in this house, and I don't think it's happy with me. ",Something is here.,9
17minutes,5,8,1r6us7,5,"I'm... concerned.  
I was sick last night. Bedridden. It wasn't as bad as it sounds though.. I had a terrible fever, and it caused aching in all of my bones and terrible pain in my eyes and head. I wasn't sneezing though. My throat didn't hurt, my nose wasn't running, it was just the fever. I thought it was strange.  
I tried to stay optimistic, laughed it off. ""Hey, I don't have to go to class tomorrow!"" ""What if I'm going to be the first zombie? I'll have to type a story like that up for /r/nosleep.""  
Sleeping was difficult. The heat was unbearable but simultaneously, being outside of the blanket was far too cold even with my space heater on. I kept falling in and out, I'm not even sure if I got a wink of actual sleep. I'm beating around the bush.  
I woke up at 12:19. It's a curious case, I'm sure: How I recall such a vague moment in time. I'm sure the reason that number is burned into my head is because, well, it didn't change.  
I managed to force myself out of bed and grab a bite to eat, hoping a little bit of nutrition would help me feel better. Well, what's a better way to combat sickness than some leftover pizza at midnight? I grabbed the remaining pizza, threw it on a plate, and went to chuck it into the microwave. It still said 12:19, which I considered odd. I was positive that what I'd done since I woke up long extended the time period of a minute. I disregarded it, shit happens. I punched in two minutes and pressed start, but nothing happened.  
I was far too sick and far too tired to deal with a broken microwave, so I decided to just eat it cold.
I went to the living room where it was cooler and sat by the window. I love looking out the window at night. It's always so calm and serene, and no, I'm not afraid of something jumping out at me. There is a traffic signal within view from the window which always mesmerizes me. I don't know what it is, but the reds and greens stand out in the otherwise gray Massachusetts scenery.  
I had finished the pizza. I thought I'd eaten it fast, considering the light never changed. I threw my plate away and went back to my bedroom, only to see the clock staring right at me.  
12:19.  
I would think it was a weird dream. I have those a lot and they're always vivid. Dreaming vividly is sort of an ""unconscious talent"" of mine. The only thing is, when I opened the fridge in the morning, there was no pizza left.  
  
UPDATE (1 day later): I didn't have any odd experiences last night. Although I was scared to sleep in the dark due to my spending all night on nosleep, I slept well. I'm going to try to recreate the scenario tonight. I want to see if what happened was really something that happened or my mind playing tricks on me.",Pause,13

DaFunktapus1,0,4,1r0t4e,4,"I was visiting my grandparents house with my dog the other day. They live in the middle of no where and the house has its eerie moments. I pulled up to the house. No one was home and they weren't expect to be there for another thirty minutes or so. I got the spare key and walked inside. The immediate sense of pooping my pants hit me as soon as I walked in the door. I ran to the restroom and my dog followed me in. I slammed the door, sat down, and felt heaven. Then I started surfing reddit. I was on this golden throne for about ten minutes when I heard the voices of my grandmother and grandfather talking to their cats. My dog's ears perked up, he stared at the door, then he started whining. I immediately assumed they had gotten home early. I walked out of the bathroom expecting to tell about my glorious victory of the gods. I was very surprised to see that no one was there. I wandered the house, checked upstairs, no one. I checked outside, and there was no other vehicle besides mine. They arrived home ten minutes later. I still haven't told them.

Bakaflocka,1,5,1qyq9p,4,"Before I begin, I want to make it a point that this is my first time posting in /Nosleep. I have been an avid lurker and strive to write half as well as the majority of you, so I apologize for run-on sentences,  any grammatical errors and mistakes (typo's).  **This is unintentionally very long and I will try to defuse any confusion with horizontal breaks as I am not very ""format"" savvy**! I have had a few paranormal instances, but this one is a mixture of paranormal and just creepycreepycreepy! I don't know how else to explain it, so I'll start with my story:    


***

I have never been fond of moving, though I doubt anyone ever truly is.   Still, getting a new place meant the next step for my boyfriend and I in our then three year relationship, and I should have been happier, or at least a bit more enthusiastic about the situation; but we were constantly together anyways, so perhaps I didn't consider it a huge deal in the first place. And while I despised the thought of moving and having to buy any additional furniture, I was looking forward to the house-hunting process.    




We met Jenny, a mid-forty-something-year-old  woman, who had been in the real-estate business for ""as long as she could remember"", in the middle of November 2010; there were leaves sprinkled in the front lawns of all the potential residents that never seemed to meet any of our requirements. By this point, the thrill of house-hunting  was starting to fade away from my short list of interests and lose all its fun in the process. Admittedly, this was also around the time that my boyfriend and I began to argue near constantly - usually, he'd leave in a huff (up until then, I was only twenty and living with my parents), and I started to doubt even wanting to move in with him. We couldn't even agree on a place together, how was this ever going to work?! Apparently I was ""too"" picky and ""unrealistic"", but then again, he's always been the sort of guy that doesn't heed warnings or care all too much about the  aesthetics of things (I guess most guys are like that, though!) ▬ so when we found #13100, he had already settled, and I was less than content.    


***

 #13100 was small and blue, two things which I dislike as is, but immediately came to despise because of the combination. Aside from being aesthetically displeasing, it looked worn down and isolated. The house itself was built fairly recently, or at least it was ""recent enough"", according to my boyfriend, and located at the corner of a narrow street that seemed to wind down a small hill and lead to a series of speed humps before it was met by a stop sign and a few other homes that were maybe about seventy feet away. The area was quiet, but showed a slight resemblance to the neighborhood in ""Halloween!"" There was one tree, inconveniently placed right besides the garage-less driveway, so you had to be super careful not to open your car door too far or else you'd have to pay out the ass for vehicle damages on your insurance.    


 Now the layout of the house was pretty odd and overwhelming in itself; overwhelming in the sense that once you opened the front door, you were greeted by an individual-only  hallway that took a  sharp right turn to the master bedroom, which had a large window facing the front-yard, cold hardwood floors and blue painted walls. There was a bathroom connected to the back of the master bedroom, and it was the only newly renovated  part of the structure ▬ the reason behind this would be soon revealed months later by  our realtor, Jenny. It looked as if a bathtub had been there once before  but had been removed in the re-construction, replaced by a glass-panel shower. Jenny looked down at the file and #13100's blueprints, rubbing her chin with her free-hand and stifling an hardly audible, ""Hm!"" in a tone I found quite suspicious. At this point, I was ready to leave, completely unsold by everything I had seen so far and finding myself very cold (despite the three layers and University hoodie I had thrown on to protect myself against the strong winds), but I couldn't tame my curiosity so I spoke up and asked her what she had been so suddenly vocal about. ""There wasn't always marble in this bathroom!"" So? ""I thought you said the bathroom was redone?"", my boyfriend seemed to read my mind and speak up this time, beating me to the punch. I didn't really find anything odd about Jenny's point from her comment, giving a roll of my shoulders as I listened to my heeled boots clank against the floor. ""I like the marble. It's probably the only thing I like about this place,"" I was clearly agitated and not very amused and when I'm hungry, there's no taming the beast! ▬ It showed in my tone. My boyfriend was quick to snap back, ""We haven't even seen all of it yet!"" The tension in the air was rising, and Jenny had probably picked up on that and how restless I was getting, so before my boyfriend and I could begin arguing right  in front of her, she led us out of the master bedroom and back into that one-person-at-a-time hallway, where we followed her down another sharp turn (this time it was to the left, five feet away from the master bedroom) onto the kitchen. The kitchen was blue, and where the paint didn't cover the walls, mirrors did! ""Big Blue Nation, y'all!"", I chirped, clearly amused by my own idiotic joke; it's a saying that my university's rival loves to throw around constantly.    

""Wow, [Bakaflocka],"" my boyfriend  stifled a chuckle, but not before scoping out the room. It was tiny, like the rest of the house, and there was a bar that was just big enough for two chairs. The appliances were up to date, but I was getting really tired of all the blue. Jenny must have too, because she led us back down the hall ▬ there were three doors remaining; one that opened to an airplane-sized bathroom, one to a closet where the owners or guests could hang up their coats, and another that looked like a closet but took you down to the basement. The basement was essentially the living room, since the first floor only offered the master bedroom, master bath, kitchen, guest bathroom and closet. Here is where things become very fuzzy. First, I remember the ceiling of the living room was very low and there was only one switch ▬ there was no lighting, but rather a plug where they had put a lamp. And again, the walls were blue. I wanted to puke. Either the previous owners thought the color was really calming, or they decorated every room with Wildcats gear. Only a small sofa and big screen TV was required to fill up the entire room in the limited space in the basement. I remember I had a hard time breathing, and could hear every little sound in the house.


***

What caught my attention next is what I hated the most about that place! The stairs that led to the basement were steep and narrow, and I had to wait a few minutes before following my boyfriend and our realtor down, or else my sense of claustrophobia would kick in ▬ once at the bottom of the stairs, we found ourselves in another hallway, though this one was wide enough so that my boyfriend and I could stand by one another, and it led either straight ahead or immediately to the left where the living room was. Straight ahead was the unfinished parts of the basement. Now I'm sure you all know what unfinished basements look like, but if you don't, let me be the first to tell you that they are most always really creepy! (Hell, my finished basement at my parent's creeped me out and it was really  nice!) There was no switch to flip on any lights, but there were two porcelain sockets with pull-strings (one as soon as you walked in, and one in the far back), that Jenny tested; neither turned on. ""Does anyone have a flashlight?"", she'd ask quizzically, and while I didn't have a flashlight per se, I was quick to yank out my Samsung Galaxy and tap my flashlight app on. Immediately, I saw something that I wish I never had. 




Unlike every other room in the house,  the walls were stone but there was red. A lot of red mixed with orange and yellow and black. At one point, there was green and that was alright - but the red! There was so much, almost as much as all the blue they had on the walls. I held my phone over my head and made my way down the room. There were drawings. Doodles from what appeared to be a child anywhere between the ages of 3 to 12. But the more I scoped down the room, the more the images in the drawings became increasingly darker; the only green there was was used for your generic 'field of grass'. There were butterflies and smiling faces underneath a very bright yellow sun with sunglasses on! Like a chain of events or a series of comics, the images changed. The sun in the next image had no sunglasses, but a content look on its face. It started off pretty happy! Then the sun had wide eyes, outlined in black, with  red veins, like he had been up all night and was waiting for the moon to cover his shift and let him rest. Eventually, his eyes were outlined and filled with black. Inevitably, the sun became entirely black in itself. Then there were figures. Creepy figures in black, who wore ""red clothes"". But they weren't clothes. They were blood. ""Someone was really high,"" my boyfriend seemed un-phased but I was petrified. There were a few  poems about love and some were, of course, expectantly depressing. I saw something that creeped me out more than the rest, ""Wash away the blues! Don't you know everyone looks better in red?"" And there was an hand-print, smeared in a very odd shade of crimson.




I swallowed hard, looking at my boyfriend who had been standing besides me at this point. Again, he didn't look very bothered. The odd thing was, Jenny never made it past the entrance of the unfinished basement, standing by the washing machine and dryer. ""These will be here,"" she pointed out, before I stopped dead in my tracks. There had only been the three of us, but I heard a knock on the door. No one spoke up. There was another knock. Still nothing. ""Who's at the door?"", I finally asked, turning to the others, but they both gave me a look like, ""We didn't hear anything."" I was starting to lose my fucking mind, so instead, I opted for, ""I guess we've covered everything.""


***

After we made our way back upstairs, my boyfriend decided to check out the master bedroom one more time. I told him I would warm up the car and wait there, to which he  hesitantly agreed to. I knew he was going to ask if I wanted to check it out one more time before making my decision, but my decision on that place was already made up. I hugged Jenny goodbye and offered my thanks, watching her pull out of the driveway so we wouldn't be blocked, and go on her way (there was a lockbox on the door so we didn't need to worry about locking up after ourselves, she already did so!) I saw the lights turn on into the master bedroom, and while it was hard to see because of the obscured vision of that inconveniently planted tree, I figured it was my boyfriend looking out the large window and waving at me. ""God, he's such a nerd!"", I thought to myself as I waved back with a cheesy grin. Afterwards, I beckoned him to come on out so we could leave and sighed in relief as he dropped the blinds and shut off the light. FINALLY! I assumed he'd come right out - it  took no more than a minute to go from the master bedroom to the front door, but five minutes had already passed. I finally decided to call him, something didn't feel right; it felt like the phone was beeping forever before he answered. ""Where are you? I'm starving"", I was fighting back my urge to yell. ""I thought I heard you walking around upstairs so I called you to come back down and check this out, but you never did,"" He was at the passenger door, and I grunted. ""I didn't come back inside. I thought I told you to come on out when you opened the blinds and waved at me,"" I huffed. ""I didn't open the blinds and wave at you,"" I felt my stomach drop like I was coming out of my seat on Space Mountain in Disney World. ""What?""




The phone rang just as I turned my head over my shoulder to pull out of the driveway, it was starting to rain and my eyesight isn't as acute as I would like it to be during bad weather. ""What is it now?"", I muttered, looking to my boyfriend as he picked up. I saw his lips mouth Jenny's name, and then a look of pure horror come over his facials. It was a short conversation, but I remember itching for him to end it sooner so I could turn on the radio and listen to some music to calm my nerves about the weird chain of events. ""Apparently the bathroom was renovated because the previous owner committed suicide. They were a schizophrenic patient, and lived by themselves."" All of this was too much. ""I don't want to talk about it,"" I immediately blurted. ""I feel sick and I just want to listen to music and drive,"" I can't believe he didn't lecture me for going so fast on the road but I literally felt like pulling over every five seconds to vomit. I remember telling him to touch the knob to the radio and turn it on, and he blindly agreed, knowing just how upset I had been. Music is a remedy to some, right? 




The radio gave off an odd static sound before blaring, ""I'm Blue"" by Eiffel 65.

**In short:** Looking to purchase a house together with my boyfriend. While I'm picky, he's not! He's sold on a tiny and ugly blue house. All the walls are blue, except for the ones in the unfinished basement; there are very weird doodles from an adult - images ranging from PG to completely deranged.

Grindhorse,0,2,1qwpyx,5,"These really happened.  Like, not NoSleep ""really happened.""  And not ""not NoSleep 'really happened'"".  But this is 100% true.  And these dreams felt real and insane.

Dream I:

It's a bit hazy since it's been a couple days.  But I was on my block.  I THINK I had crashed my car, which decided to explode.  As I'm walking along the edge of the road at night (at least I think it was night; the entire sky felt artificial, and the lighting seemed to be from spotlights in some rafters) a small, gokart-like thing buzzes up to me.  No one's driving.  I don't remember why, but I was terrified.  I start to run, and I finally lose the cart, but just as I make it to my house, it reappears.  Finally, in an act of intense rage, I pick up the cart while screaming, and smash it in two over my knee.  This is followed by me looking out from the back of a car, as I drive away from my house.  I'm yelling that we can't go in there as some children's trucks and toys barrel through the front door as if it's a malevolent home invasion.

Dream II:

Now this is the one that caused me to wake up in a cold sweat, shaking, breathing heavy, and my heart was clocked at around 180 bpm.  Yeah.  Fuckin' really.  I remember this one a lot better, and I've been terrified to sleep because I fear continuity.

So, I'm in my girlfriend's room, sleeping in her bed.  It wasn't her room exactly though, it was much brighter.  It was like a beach house, but old Victorian-style and rundown.  The door's locked.  (By the way, while having this dream I WAS sleeping in my girlfriend's bed with her in real life.)  Outside the door, I hear slamming, and I begin to fear what could be out there.  During this time, I wake up.  I think I'm in the real world, but the fuckin' cart is there in my girlfriend's room or something that reminded me of it was there.  I don't realize I'm still asleep, but I inception back into this dream-within-a-dream (I'm prone to that type of thing).

I'm back in the beach room with the slamming.  My girlfriend's calm.  She says ""it's just Henry.""  Henry is a dog.  My girlfriend doesn't have a dog, but my buddy does.  I recently played with my buddy's dog at his house, and I've known the dog for years, so okay.  It's Henry.  Cool.  So I go back to ""sleep.""

The slamming continues, and I tell myself it's just Henry.  I look towards the door.  There's Henry on the floor.  He gets up to happily greet me.  So, now I'm horrified.  The slamming continues, and I see boots in the space underneath the door.  Huge, heavy boots.  My girlfriend's freaking out now.  So I get up, grab a bowie knife off of a surgical tray by the door (it IS still a dream), and position myself by the frame.  I'm ready to open the door and strike, but the slamming stops and the thing outside stomps away saying in a high-pitched, mocking voice ""goodnight!""  It was repeated 3 or 4 times, and as I reached for the door handle...I woke up for real.",Nightmares in Bunches.,7
snerualtrepelol,9,17,1qw83e,7,"This story takes place over some period of time.
It starts when i was about 8 years old (i'm 28 now). The whole family was gathered at my grandparents' place. My grandfather, who was a policeman in the Netherlands, and a loving (grand)father and husband, liked to go to the Indonesian islands. He had many friends there. The one day we were gathered at his house he told us he had gotten a knife. Or rather, some kind of ceremonial dagger, named a Keris. This is a special kind of knife, it is said that a spirit lives in every one of these knives and they can be either good or bad spirits. My grandfather told us, that when he died, the knife had to go back to the man that he got it from, because it belonged to that Indonesian man's family.

Twenty-two years later, my grandfather died. We made plans for going to Indonesia, to bring back the knife. The family couldn't come to an agreement of who would go and how, so no plans were made in the end. The knife ended up in a box in a closet at my parents house, and was forgotten.

I lived together with my girlfriend at the time. My mom called me, told me that there was strange stuff happening in the house. Clocks stopped working, the alarm clocks of my parents were set to different times, one small clock that never worked started working all of a sudden. All the 'usual' paranormal stuff. I come from a police family (my dad is a high ranking dude with the police as well, as is my brother and my sister) so we are very sceptic about all the paranormal stuff.

Until my mom woke up one night, from the sound of a piece of paper being wrapped to a ball, asif someone wanted to throw it in a bin. She listened, but there was no other sound, and she went back to sleep.

The next day she opened her closet, and was shocked to see that all her clothes that were on coathangers had been moved to the sides. Only one jacket, that was on a hanger, was turned to face my mom, and there was a wrinkled piece of paper on the clotheshanger that wasn't there before. She recognised it; it was an A5 size piece of paper with a certain smell that would repel moths; she had put some of these papers between the clothes in the closet.

But not on this jacket. And she had not wrinkled it.

When she told me this story on the phone, she told me that she wanted to get a house-clearer. A person who cleans the house of all the spirits that might be there. But i have a friend (i will use the name Margaret for her), who is very sensitive and can communicate with spirits. I said maybe we should get her into the house first, to see who or what the spirit is. My mom agreed.

Margaret came by a couple of days later. She felt a weird presence but couldn't quite put her finger on it; she couldn't identify it. Then i remembered the knife. It had been in a box in the same closet. I got the knife from the box and handed it to her. She strongly felt the energy that came from the knife. But there was also another energy in the house, and connected to the knife. Maybe it was my grandfather, who wanted to let us know that we had to get the knife back to where it belonged!

She told us the person who gave the knife to my grandfather did not have long to live. I thought this was a cliché thing to say, sceptic as i was. Ofcourse i did not say that out loud. I did question out loud though, because the person who gave my grandfather the knife was around 40 years old. We had read correspondence between him and my grandfather so we knew a little bit about him.

All in all, we decided that we shoud at least send this man in Indonesia a letter, telling about the passing of my grandfather and to ask about the knife.

Two weeks later, we got a reply. He thanked us for sending the letter and was sad that my grandfather died. He told us that my grandfather did not get the knife from him, but from *his* grandfather. And that he was extra sad, because the day he got our letter, his grandfather died. This was a strange coincidence to me. He also said that the knife was a gift, and you should not give back gifts. Unless we really wanted to. But the knife was ours. The spirit inside the knife was a good one.

I decided to keep the knife. Not in a box, but on a small altar in my sleeping room. The hauntings in the house of my parents have stopped after this.

Then the strange stuff with the knife happened. The altar was on a side of my room behind my bed, so it was a part where i never walked or whatever. So i couldn't have knocked it or touched it whatever. Very often, when i would enter my room, the knife would be in a different position on the altar. Sometimes i could even see the former place where it had been in the small layer of dust that was on the altar. It even stood upright against the wall one time.

Now i have moved, and have deciced to hang the knife on the wall. It hangs there with other knives. It has not moved since. But i know for sure that i will never put it back in to a box. This knife will be part of the rest of my life, and is part of our family history. My mom keeps the wrinkled piece of paper, as 'evidence' or just as a reminder.

EngulfedByDarkness,10,5,1qviq3,4,"  One day my brother came home and began to tell me of his crazy night. He said that he had fiddled with a Ouija Board! I told him to tell me more and this is what happened. Him and his buddies went down to the graveyard and contacted spirits for an innocent conversation. One of his friends began to panic after getting some morbid responses and suggested the group go somewhere else. 

  The others agreed and got into my brothers car and drove off. The group pulled up at a stop sign, the car's headlights glared upon two figures sitting on the curb of the sidewalk. One was a boy and one was a girl, both appeared to be very pale with a blank facial expression. They cocked their heads up and stared directly at my brother and his friends. Everyone froze and didn't say a word, some even looked over at each other to see if they could see what the other was seeing. 


  After a good wait at the stop sign my brother sped off and they all talked about what they had saw. After hearing this story from my brother I became very interested in the fact of contacting spirits through the Ouija Board. The following day my brother promised to show me it and how it works. After the day of school went by I came home and did my homework as usual..the day went by pretty quickly, and before I knew it it was 12:00 AM. 


  My brother texted me and we had our rendezvous downstairs. We took the board out of its case and sat it down on the floor. The Planchette sat on top of the board. It's rubber stoppers held it firmly against its surface. With a courageous tone I asked a question ""Is anyone there?""


  We both waited a couple seconds and got no reply. He gave it a go and asked ""Is there anyone there who would like to make contact with us?"" After about 5 minutes of waiting we got no answer. I thought it was a hoax but he suggested we try it in a different room. We walked back upstairs and tried the board in his room, same scenario played out and after about 5-10 minutes we received no reply.


  At this point I knew it was all smoke and mirrors but he suggested we try it in my room, and if we got no reply we could call it quits. We both sat on my bed with the board on our knees, I asked a question ""Is there anyone here with us?"" In about 1-2 minutes we got a reply saying ""Yes"" I immediately said to my brother that he was moving it. His finger tips were barely touching the planchette and I was completely in awe. I could not believe it, we were actually talking to something that was along the Astral Plane. 


  Most of the spirits we talked to that night could never say their name. We'd usually get responses such as ""myjda"" or ""nonojh."" We had no idea what these names meant so we assumed they were just confused or had a lack of energy communicating with us. We called it a night and my mind was awake and full of wonder. My chest was tight from the whole experience and I felt as if I had a presence with me, I blamed it on anxiety and went to bed.


  I awoke at 6:00 AM for another day of school and the tightness was gone. On the bus I immediately told both of my friends about the experience and how incredible it was. My one friend Tyler was somewhat intrigued, but wanted to see it to believe it. My other friend Sam wanted nothing to do with it. At the end of the day I asked Sam and Tyler if they wanted to come over so I could show them the board, both of them agreed and came over around 3:00 PM.


  We all sat on my bed and I put the board between me and Tyler's knees. Sam only wanted to watch due to the fact she thought something would follow her (In simpler terms she was afraid) We began to move the planchette in a circular motion to make a portal. I then asked the question ""Is anyone here with us?"" After asking if anyone was there we got an immediate response saying ""Yes"" We asked extremely personal questions, such as ""Do you know you're dead?"" ""Are you an evil spirit?"" ""Can you touch my arm?"" 



 Of course at this time I never knew that asking these questions could be taken as either a threat or open a gateway from their world into ours. Thankfully the spirit said ""No"" to all three questions and we ended the session. Sam spouted out ""You guys are moving it!"" I decided to up the ante ""Why don't you try it then? See for yourself."" She took me up on my offer and I sat the board on our laps; we both put our hands on the planchette and as usual we began to make a circle to open the portal. Once again I asked the general question “Is there anyone here with us?”


  I made sure my fingertips were light on the Planchette, doing this let the spirit put more energy into it thus showing Sam it couldn’t of been me. As expected we got an immediate response of “Yes.” We asked questions about ourselves, such as our sexual orientations and how many dates we’ve had. The spirit’s answers were dead on accurate and it really shut us up. We asked for a name but the spirit seemed to be shy and refused to tell us. 


  I asked if we could just call the spirit “Buddy” and it replied “Yes.” Little did we know is that this spirit was a one of a kind. After chatting with the spirit for over an hour we figured out she was an angel named Caroline. She promised to watch over us and protect us from evil spirits. She proved she was an angel due to the fact I asked if she was able to make it very sunny outside, moments after requesting it shined a warm sunny ray through my window.


  It was one of the best experiences I’ve ever had in my entire life. At the very end of the session Sam was still on edge about if it was real or not. So she told me to ask “What’s her name.” (Referring to Sam) Without hesitation it immediately spelled out S-A-M. The look on her face was mortified. 


  Caroline said goodbye and we ended the session. After that I haven’t touched it since and I honestly don’t intend to. I promised Caroline we’d talk to her from time to time and she promised she would always be available to talk. I’ve had many encounters with evil spirits when using the board, in some occasions I would have to flip the board. Strange occurrences also happen throughout my house within different time durations.


  Today I was in the shower and I heard a loud bang on the door, this was about 2 hours ago. I hopped out of the shower and checked if anyone was there, as usual.. no one. I will continue to update everyone on the strange occurrences. 
      

  Also if you want to use the Ouija Board do not be afraid too! It is very safe just make sure you read up on it first before doing so. Never challenge the spirits and always ask before each session that you wish to communicate with good spirits and good spirits only. This is a TRUE story and I hope you all enjoyed.. My First Ouija Board Experience.

MissGhost,2,9,1quu66,7,"Wales is known to be a strange country and having grown up there, I can vouch for that. When I was 17, the village where I grew up was still pretty isolated...the access wasn't as good as it is today and as a result it was  a pretty tight community. Everyone knew everyone and their business...if you didn't speak Welsh then you'd get ignored in the pub. I was seeing a guy whose Dad ran the local taxi firm...less of a taxi firm and more of a one man band. He had a car and if you needed to get somewhere, he was who you called. Anyway...my boyfriend was called Rhys and he had this older brother, Tomas...now everything Rhys was, Tomas wasn't. Rhys was a great rugby player...Tomas was a lumbering fool...Rhys was bright and Tomas was...not slow but definitely nowhere near as intelligent. Both of them were of ""good Welsh stock"" which means big and dark and basic.

Tomas had a bad habit of playing too rough; because he hadn't the social skills of his brother, he'd plunge in and just maul people. He threw me in a hedge once with no warning. We were walking back from the pub late one night a gang of us all fooling about and he just picked me up and launched me into this hedgerow..I still have a tiny chip on my tooth today.

 Rhys was protective of him though and while he did have words with him for that, he never really got angry...it was all a bit close to the edge though. Anyway...one night in late summer we'd all been hanging around at The Castle...which was quite literally a castle...but ruined. It was where we went when nights were warm enough, we'd hang around, have beers and just talk and fool about. There wasn't much of the castle left really, just the shell of it but it was a cool place to be and we'd talk about the battles that must have gone on there and the history of the place.

 There were 4 of us there this night, Rhys, me, Tomas and this streak of a lad called Mike... it was getting towards midnight and we'd all been drinking. The night air had cooled down and the wooded area surrounding us was starting to look even blacker than usual to me. I had a feeling...ominous. Perhaps it was due to Rhys's behaviour, he was acting up a lot...showing off and being generally unpredictable...he and Tomas were also very drunk which annoyed me a bit as Rhys wasn't properly on the ball then as far as Tomas's behaviour went. 

Anyway...I was starting to make noises about going home when Rhys decided to scale one of these crumbling walls which made up the shell of the castle. Of course, almost at the top he fell off and we could see right off that he was hurt. He couldn't walk and someone had to go for help. 

None of us had mobile phones back then...it wasn't the norm and Mike was drunk and whinging and wouldn't walk down the lane...I was properly annoyed by then and wanted to get away from the lot of them... so I said I'd go on my own and get the taxi driving dad. 

I set off feeling a little angry and a bit scared for Rhys...half way down the lane that ran down the hill away from the castle, I heard thudding, heavy footsteps. It was I already knew, Tomas. I was immediately on high alert not only because I didn't trust him as far as I could throw him and always avoided being alone with him but also because he was a genuinely scary lad. 

He caught up with me and I always remember what he said ""Rhys sent me"" and it came over as a pathetic, childish lie...I knew Rhys would do no such thing...so I felt even worse about it because it was like he knew I was scared of him and this was his clumsy attempt to set my mind at rest.

 We walked along through this dark lane in silence for a few minutes, my heart was going like crazy the whole time just waiting for what he would do. I didn't have to wait long because he suddenly clapped this big ham of a hand on my face and sort of dragged me towards him. It was truly terrifying and made worse by the fact that I couldn't see whereabouts we were exactly. 

I couldn't seem to make a noise above a squeak and all the time, this big ape is trying to get a hold of me and pull me down to the ground. We were there in this terrible sort of silent grapple when the light changed...my first thought was that it was a torch but it wasn't the ""right"" light for a torch...and there, about fifty feet away from us and visible through the trees was a glowing man....that's all I can say it was. 

It was the shape and size of a man, with no real features to it...the ends of the limbs were rounded off and there was a head but no features. It glowed in the same way the moon does...white. He...or it...was standing poised as if he was about to run AT us...his arms were in that runners pose. I screamed and Tomas dropped me and ran off down the lane. 

As I looked, the figure also ran...at lightening speed in the direction we'd come from. I ran too then...back to the village and to Rhys and Tomas's Dad's cottage. 

I never told Rhys what Tomas did. Looking back I came very close to being hurt that night and I shrugged it off...partly because of the thing we saw and partly because I was 17 and resilient. I split with Rhys though...I didn't want to hang around with him since his weird brother was part of the package. I have never heard of anyone else seeing the figure we saw and always wondered what it was. Did it come to protect me or was it something that was simply there when we were?",Strange Happening in a Welsh Village,16
z0mb13s4tt4ck,1,5,1qsxin,6,"I had a neighbor when I lived in Louisiana, an old, sweet lady who lived alone in a too-large, too-old house next door. She was a nice woman, always told me that I reminded her of herself when she was young. She used to give me those gross dry mints that are too large, too chalky to really be thought of as candy. She was so nice, and a bit of a lush, had a martini everyday, that kind of woman. She would throw lavish parties during the holidays and invite the whole neighborhood. I think it was because she was lonely, her husband had been dead many, many years. Well before I was born or moved the house next door. As I got older, the parties became less frequent, less attended, and she spent most of her days alone at home. It wasn't until hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana that I stepped a foot in her house again. She was older, frailer, I was a freshman in highschool. She was so scared, recovering from hip surgery, alone in the big empty house. She told me I could pick any room upstairs and sleep, she couldn't climb the stairs anymore and hadn't been up there in a long time. The second floor was a time capsule, probably unchanged from when her kids had moved out and moved on, beds carefully made and their belongings on the shelves. Dolls, bears, books. I picked the master bedroom to spend the night, wouldn't you? Biggest bed, bookshelf chock full of books and magazines. It was around midnight when I finally fell asleep, wind and rain wreaking havoc outside, but the lights were still on. I don't really know what woke me up, maybe it was the storm, maybe it was the power going out. It was dark, dark enough to know that even if I had tried the lights it would have been fruitless. It was annoying but, it wasn't the first hurricane I'd been through, the drill was pretty standard. I had the flashlight, I had the candles. Better to burn the candles first, always better to save the batteries. I stumbled around, looking for the matches in the unfamiliar bedroom. I remember it being warm. Everyone ran their air conditioners 24/7 before a hurricane, it got hot so quickly. It was getting humid, fast. It was like that with the big storms. I was groping through the dark, finally finding the matches and candles, lighting the wick, regretting that the heat from the flame would doubtlessly raise the temperature in the room significantly. I went back to bed, tossing and turning. I woke up and it was still dark, it couldn't have been more than an hour or so since I had last been up. It was different, it was cold. I was excited, maybe the power was back on. I reached for the lamp, but no light turned on. I realized then that it was still dark, too dark for the power to be back on. Why was it cold? It was actually freezing. I looked out the window, to see if the streetlights were on. It was then I heard the thump. I knew my elderly neighbor couldn't climb the stairs, bum hip and all. Maybe a raccoon had gotten in. Animals find wierd hiding spots in hurricanes, that's probably what woke me. The candle was out, but I had the flashlight. I turned it on, but no light. Just a dim flicker and then darkness. The thump came again, and the cold was starting to make me shiver. The sound was repeating, a constant thump now. Getting closer. It occured to me that if my neighbor was hurt or had fallen in the dark she might need help, and I jumped out of the bed to run downstairs. Some people talk about the feeling you get when you know you're being watched, the hairs on the back of your neck stand up, you get goosebumps on your arms. I didn't experience that, I just felt that I should look at the window. There was just enough light from the moon to see something, and what I saw has changed my life. Was it a man? I don't know. Was it a ghost? I would have told you not to be ridiculous. What I do know, was that something stood there. Something was standing next to the bed, and something was watching me. I don't remember being so frightened before then, and I can't remember ever having run so fast. I was out of the room and down the stairs before I had time to make a sound, jumping the last few. Not knowing how but being certain that if I turned around it would be behind me. At the bottom I turned, glancing up the stairs. It was there, standing on the landing. No sound, no movement. Lightening flashed from the storm. Just enough to see It was wearing a shirt. A red plaid shirt. Why, why, why, why. No one was supposed to be in the house, just me and the old lady. Just us, no nurse, no people, and certainly no one in a red plaid shirt. I remember throwing up in my mouth. Now that I was downstairs, I could hear my neighbor snoring. Sound asleep, in a drunken martini stupor. When I looked back up the stairs, the shape was gone. It was gone. I slept on the couch for the rest of the night. I never mentioned the incident to anyone, even now that I'm grown. It wasn't even the last time I saw a man in a red plaid shirt. I saw him on my porch outside my living room, in my backyard when I was in the pool. He was always gone when I went to look for him. It wasn't until years later, after my neighbor died, that my mom told me that her husband had died in that creepy old house. He had fallen off the roof of the house next door, my house. He died shortly after. The house is gone now, torn down. A new house is there now. I'm married, and have a son. I don't even live in Louisiana anymore. Still, when I'm home for the holidays I get a feeling, the kind you get when you know if you turn around someone will be staring. Sometimes, there's a man in a red plaid shirt. Sometimes, he's on the porch. Sometimes, he's in the yard. He's always staring, though. When I go and look, he's always gone.

 I'll be in Louisiana this week, and I know that someone will be watching me. What does he want? Why does he stare? And why doesn't he have a face?",Neighbors,11
BrainChicken,2,8,1qscvx,6,"I don’t know what to think anymore.  I can’t tell if I’ve gone mad, or if there really is a supernatural force at work here.  I guess it all started with this dream. This damn dream has been running my life for a month now. I’m afraid to go to sleep because I already know what I’m going to see. 

I’m walking down the street with a girl. She doesn’t look familiar, but somehow I know her. We’re walking down a street I’ve been on before. Maybe? Or maybe it’s just starting to seem like I have from the amount of times I’ve seen it at night. We’re laughing and having fun. But then the darkness started creeping up from behind us. I don’t know how I know it’s there, but we both turn around. It’s like the kind of pitch black you see if you close your eyes in your closet in the middle of the night. Just…nothing. It stops about 10 feet from us and a figure emerges. It kind of looked like a dog, but it wasn’t…solid? I’m not sure how to explain this. It’s kind of like the dog wasn’t a solid thing, but more like smoke.  He lunges at me, but dissipates before making it to my face. I hear a voice say “You’re mine.”, and then I wake up.

This alone wouldn’t be so bad. Except now I’ve started seeing this dog outside my dreams as well. I was going to the petrol station today after work when I saw the dog in the window of the store. Obviously I decided I would get petrol elsewhere.  When I got home, I turned the tv on, as per the usual, and saw that the petrol station was robbed. 3 people were injured and the thief stole a car. I couldn’t believe it. 

And I honestly can’t tell if this thing is protecting me, or wanting me for itself.

kailey16,0,1,1r8ylh,5,"So, about a year and a half ago my family moved into an old farm house that was built near the end of the 1800's. My whole family absolutely hated it there but I was oddly drawn to it and loved it, I have no idea why. 

On the first night we stayed there my best friend stayed the night with me, because the first night is always creepy no matter what. Now, supernatural things were drawn to my best friend. She could sense them and they always came to her. Once she stepped foot in that house she wanted to leave. But of course she refrained from telling me until after I moved out. She also didn't tell me about what happened while I was asleep. 

Before we went to bed, we decided to watch a movie. Then we just left it on the main menu and went to bed. I guess around 3:00 AM, she woke up to a bang in my room. From where, she couldn't exactly tell. But it was definitely my room. Then the tv went out to that gray and black fuzz and really loud for about 30 seconds, then went back to the main menu. She said she was shaking from fear. She refused to come over anytime I invited her after that.

Again, she didn't tell me about any feelings or anything until after I moved out.

I've always been interested with the supernatural, but nothing of the sort is drawn to me. I'm kind of happy about that, kind of sad. But I must've been the most interesting for whatever was in that house because it was drawn to me and it made it clear.

This house had two bedrooms upstairs, two bedrooms downstairs. It also had a living room that was recently built onto it so it had separate air condition and furnace.

It was mid-winter and the furnace on the original part of the house wouldn't work. At all. We got it checked out probably 4 or 5 times and they couldn't figure out why it wasn't working. 

My sister and I had the rooms upstairs but she couldn't handle the cold so she ended up sleeping in the living room with the separate furnace, so I was alone on that floor. 

Around the second week we were there, I was getting into bed with my 4 blankets and multiple pants and sweatshirts because of how freezing it was when suddenly I heard a huge BANG on my door. This freaked me out so I just grabbed my bible and prayed for whatever it was to go away until I felt better. Then it started happening every single night when I got into bed. Eventually it didn't bother me. Like whatever was out there was just wishing me goodnight or something.

In my room, I had a guitar and keyboard. One night, around 2:30 I woke up to the sound my guitar strumming. Assuming it had fallen over, I got up to pick it up then when I got there it was still exactly where I left it. Confused and a little freaked out, I just decided to go back to bed. Then, the next night I woke up to light. I sat up and saw my keyboard lighting up like it was being played. Then I got even more freaked out.

The bangs along with this demon ghost thing playing with my instruments happened almost every night.

During the four months I lived in the house, I went into a depression. Which is really only weird because I never have before or after. I didn't do anything, I slept all day, I didn't eat, I was mean to everyone, I really hated myself, and I contemplated suicide. Also, I had a migraine. Not multiple migraines. A migraine that literally never went away the entire time I lived there. I tried multiple different prescribed medicines and all of them just made it worse.

The weird thing is practically the day I moved out, it all stopped. I wasn't depressed anymore. My migraine went away. I was just happy again.

After realizing the coincidence, I looked up some stuff knowing that there was something in that house. Depression can be form of possession. Not as bad as all the stuff you see in movies with them becoming demons and doing back bends and crap. But I'm positive that whatever was in there attached itself to me. And by the way it made me feel, it seems like it wanted me to hurt myself. 

This story might not send chills down your spin like some others do, but I can't even think about it without being terrified. 

And the weird part is I have to pass that house everyday, and I'm still drawn to it. It feels like home. ",It feels like home,6
TheeMikeG,2,1,1r8w1k,5,"Let me introduce myself. My name is Mike Gordan and I exorcise demons for a living. Yeah, work is hard to find, but I get by. I was born into a normal, loving family, but everyone kind of went their separate ways a while ago. I have an older brother who joined the military, and my mother and father are both pilots, so they obviously travel a lot. After I graduated highschool and was in college for a few years I tried my hand at law. But after I failed the LSAT I got pretty down and didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life. I dropped out of school and found myself struggling to get a job and even more so struggling to pay rent. 


Then I found Jesus. And by that I mean I was dumpster diving and found a KJV little orange bible inbetween a moldy sandwhich and a spent tube of toothpaste. When I got to the part about the end of the world and that 666 stuff I got interested, really interested. I’d go to the library and do hours upon hours of research. I learned about the Devil’s crossroads and the Grimorium Verum and the Lesser Key of Solomon and demonic sigils and how to summong them. I watched all eight seasons of Supernatural in two months and got a license online to be a priest. With my trusty orange bible in my pocket I scowered Craigslist for people who needed saving.


At first all I found were people that wanted their homes blessed, their babies baptised, or someone to perform a homosexual marriage. But I had a wealth of knowledge of demons and I wanted to do something a lot more meaningful. Then I found her. Her post was desperate. She claimed to be waking up with bruises and in different rooms or even places than where she had fallen asleep. I messaged her explaining that I was a priest who specialized in demon removal and that I would be happy to exorcise her home. For a modest fee of course. 


She replied immediately that she would pay me whatever I wanted, she just wanted to get rid of whatever was doing this to her. When I got to her house I didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. No weird smeel, no demonic symbols or texts, nothing. And the girl looked fine aside from some minor scratches and bruises. But she cried and cried and begged me to help her. It was pretty awkward because I’d never done this before, but I played confidence and expertise. I had her sit down in one of her wooden kitchen chairs and I bound her arms and legs to it. I took out my bible and began to read from a page I randomly flipped to. 


“All nations whom You have made Shall come and worship before You, O Lord, And shall glorify Your name, For You are great, and do wondrous things; You alone are God.""


And then she started to scream. Not a normal scream though, a deep, dark sounding scream. I dropped the bible. Mustering up my strength, confident in my knowledge, I snapped out of my state of shock and fiddled in my deep pocket for the plastic bottle of holy water I had purchsed online. I splashed some on her face and was horrified. Her face sizzled and burned. I’m talking like third degree. And that smell, my God that smell; like sulfur. By now she was thrashing wildly in the chair. I bent down and quickly retrieved the bible, then started again.


“And He changes the times and the seasons; He removes kings and raises up kings; He gives wisdom to the wise And knowledge to those who have understanding, He reveals deep and secret things; He knows what is in the darkness, And light dwells with Him” 


By now shit was falling off shelves, furniture was sliding around, the whole shabang. It was awesome. In my element now, and comfortable, I improvised.


“Jesus I ask that you cast out any and all evil spirits in, around or attached to this woman! Lord,  sanctify this follower of your word, and help me to command all demons to leave at once! I bless this woman, and damn you back to hell!” 


Then she vomited and passed out. Everything stopped moving and all was quiet. When she woke up, she had no memory of what had happened but said she felt much better. The color returned to her face and I knew it was gone. After I untied her she went to her purse and handed me a blank check.


Since that day I’ve been performing exorcisms, and I’ve done so many that things have slowed down almost entirely. I haven’t had a job in months, and rent is getting hard to pay again. So, I used my knowledge to make a deal where everyone wins. I’ve actually got a new customer right now. She’s struggling against the straps, but it’s useless. Once I put the demon in her, she’ll pay me anything to take it out.

dws7rf,1,3,1r8d9t,6,"I was reading posts today and was reminded of something that happened to me when I was a kid.  

It was an average summer day and I was somewhere in my mid to low teens (couldn't drive yet).  Since it was summertime school was out and like most kids I spent it with friends doing whatever seemed like a good idea at the time.  Usually we would go play in the woods or ride our bikes around.  

That day I decided to call up one of my friends and see if he wanted to hang out.  So I picked up the phone and to my astonishment the line was dead.  I didn't think much of it because I figured maybe they were working on the lines around my house or something.  His house wasn't very far from mine (only a mile or two) so I decided to just ride my bike over and see him.

When leaving my house the first thing that surprised me was that I didn't see any people or cars around.  It was summer in a residential neighborhood so there should have been kids out playing and people going about their daily lives.  Again it seemed like a coincidence.  As I was riding I remember thinking it was eerily quiet.  There was no wind that day which is odd enough in and of itself but the air seemed almost stagnant.

Being a kid it didn't seem like much of a problem and at the time it just seemed like a small thing.  What I remember most now is that not only were there no people going about their daily business but there was not a single sound from nature.  I could hear my bike tires on the road and the sound of the crank and my own breathing but there were no other sounds.  No birds, no dogs, no chirping or buzzing of insects.

I got to my friends house and knocked on the door. 

Nothing.  

I knocked again.  

Nothing.

That was just plain odd.  He had several other siblings and even though his parents worked, I remember thinking that there should have been at least one of them there.  At that point I decided that something was definitely off.  I rode my bike back to my house as quickly as I could and went up to my room and shut the door.  Several hours later my sister came home from work and I went down to talk to her.  She asked how my day was and I couldn't bring myself to tell her about the strange events of the afternoon because I figured that it must have all been a coincidence and I was reading too much into it.  I went outside and everything seemed normal.  Wind blowing, kids playing, dogs barking.  To this day I never figured out what was going on but it was like someone turned a switch and turned off everything but me and then flipped it back and everything was back to normal.  Never though much about it until I started reading /nosleep.  Maybe someone else has an idea of what went on.",The day with no sounds.,9
RayAllenLovecraft2,0,5,1r7jhu,4,"A rather peculiar incident happened not too long ago on a cold, rainy night.  It was a little past 2 a.m. when I left my friend's house.  Its a old Victorian house in a once thriving town.  As I was driving down the empty road, I saw a taxi cab in a left turn lane.  I was able to see it's lights from about a mile away.  The green glow shined through the mist and created this aura on the surprisingly empty street.  This is not uncommon in a large town such as this, but the thing that puzzled me is where it was turning into.  The taxi was turning into a mental institution for the criminally insane.  This event happened to startle me because it was so early in the morning.  I continued to drive home wondering why someone was being released so early.  The next day, I went to school.  My school is only a stone's throw away from the mental hospital.  As I walked out of my last class I saw a familiar glow.  It was that green taxi again.  I didn't think much of it, being a college. I see taxis picking up people all the time.  As I hiked across the parking lot and got into my car I noticed it was still there.  I didn't really pay much attention to it because classes can run pretty late, maybe someone was taking there time walking through the campus.  As I tore out of the parking lot I noticed it wasn't there.  Maybe the driver got pissed and left.  I met up with some friends from class at a Mexican restaurant down the street.  As we were waiting for our food I told them about the coincidence that happened the night before and what just happened in the parking lot.  My friend, whose family had lived in the area for a long time, told me more about the mental institution.  He told me about how they once tested drugs on the patients and preformed lobotomies up until the 1950's.  The room was dead silent.  Luckily, our food came out shortly after the disturbing conversation.  When we finished eating, we talked more about it.  I was becoming obsessed with it.  Why was it there so late? Who where they picking up?  Was it the same taxi? Our conversation was cut short when the bill came to the table.  We were too busy counting our singles and change (we are college students!) to be talking about the mental hospital.  We stepped outside and had a cigarette before we would part ways.  We were standing in a empty parking lot at around 10:30 p.m. when we noticed something out of the ordinary.  We saw the green taxi picking someone up at the restaurant across the street.  It was just parked there.  We abruptly said goodbye and got into our cars.  I drove home without stopping.  The next night at dinner, I told my parents what has been going on.  They didn't believe that a green taxi has been following me around.  Days and days passed and I continued to see the taxi again.  I was getting really paranoid.  I started to take days off of school to avoid seeing it.  My parents were deeply concerned with my behavior and suggested that I see a psychologist.  I mustered up the courage and drove there myself, after all, I am a college student.  I couldn't concentrate on the road.  I was afraid that I would see it again.  I was so bent out of shape, I accidentally ran through a red light while making a right turn.  I heard somebody laying on their horn.  I was shocked to see who I pulled out in front of.  It was the green taxi!  I raced to the psychologist.  I ran as fast as I could into the office.  The councilor was frightened by my actions.  She took me into her office to hide me from the other patients.  I told her everything. She was gravely concerned with my state.  She suggested that I be admitted.  My heart dropped. I started to break out in a cold sweat.  She left the room to make a phone call.  I assumed that she was notifying my parents that I was being taken in.  She talked to me for a few more minutes until she got a call.  Once she hung up, she told me my ride was here.  I was puzzled.  She walked me out of the building and told me she called a cab.  I froze.  I looked out the glass doors and saw the green taxi parked in front of the exit.  I broke out into a violent fit, thrashing and resisting.  I was not getting in there.  Two security guards restrained me and started to drag me in the cab.  We were driving down the same street that I first saw it on.  We got into the left turn lane and entered through the opened gates.  I gotta cut this short.  My computer time is up.  The hospital only gives you an hour a day. I hope you enjoyed the story.

I picked up the box and looked at it. It had ornate windows chiseled into it's sides and a door with a pentagram on one side with a small handle.

I opened the door and smoke came out.

Sneezing, I dropped the box. 

I looked around.

Quickly.

The door is opening.

TheRagerr,6,3,1r6d98,4,"   Just locked all of my windows, doors, and let down the blinds. Shit just got fucking creepy. I was on Youtube, listening to some music, when all of a sudden the LCD screen on my printer lights up. *printing...* was the only text on the screen. I hadn't been printing anything, wtf is going on? I remembered I had wifi printing; anyone that can connect to my printer via laptop, iPhones, ect. can print on my printer. I waited. I heard the loud grinding noise as it tried to print the mysterious document. **CCHRRRTT** *paperjam, please remove any obstructions and try again...* read the printer. I popped the lid up, and yanked the crumpled paper out. It was a photo. A photo of four little children, no older than 7, naked, blindfolded, and gutted. My heart aches. I have to lie down.

_butterflykisses,2,5,1r2p73,5,"There was this one time I was having trouble sleeping one night. Anxiety or something, so all I could do was toss and turn without really falling sleep. And on top of that I heard my roommate humming and singing loudly to herself from the bathroom around the corner. 

Annoyed, I turned over in my bed to get up and tell her to be quiet, only to see her in her bed fast asleep...

Darrenshan66,1,1,1r0xps,5,"I ran through the cornfield, I wanted to get out of there before the storm reached the field. I had just gotten into my truck when I remembered I had left the hose hooked up to the irrigator. I got out and ran, the wind was picking up and the sky was becoming dark. I had just reached the hose and was about to turn off the water when I noticed something move out of the corner of my eye. I quickly turned to look at whatever was there, but all I could see was the wind violently shaking the cornstalks. I shrugged and disconnected the hose. I was right about to return to my truck when I noticed something... The sky was now pitch black. The only things I had to light my path were the tiny flashlight on my truck keys, and the occasional lightning strike. I ran in the direction I thought my truck was in, I stopped running when I realized that thanks to the dark, I was completely lost in the field. I noticed a dark shape sticking out of the corn in front of me. I stuck out my hands and slowly walked toward it. It felt like it was made out of metal, so I turned on my flashlight to get a better view. What I saw made my blood run cold. The huge object that was buried in the dirt was my truck! It looked like it had been torn apart and thrown! ""Who the hell?"", I said, looking at the destroyed vehicle. Suddenly, I heard a voice whisper in my ear... ""Dont you mean WHAT the hell?"" 
I jumped at the sound of the voice, I turned around and shined the flashlight in the direction the voice came from but nothing was there. ""Who ARE YOU?"", I screamed ""YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY?!?!"" I stood, waiting for an anwser, when the flashlight went out, then some unseen foe with tremendous strength wrenched it from my hand. I took off running into the rows of corn, the storm had picked up and I was being drenched with the now falling rain. I ran until I slammed into a wooden object in front of me. I dropped to the ground, the pain in my nose and the warm and sticky feeling in my mouth told me my nose was broken. I looked up at what I had hit, a flash of lightning revealed that I was staring at a cross. It was made out of crude wood and was held together using an old, crumbling rope. I slumped to my knees and stared at the sky, my eyes burning from the rain. ""God!!! What is doing this?!?!"" I received no reply.
I looked around wildly and shouted ""Where are you?!?? What do you want?!???"" I shuddered as a familier voice whispered back ""YOU""
Suddenly, I was picked up and thrown into the cross. It snapped as I barrled into it. I rolled into a nearby row of corn and stood up. My leg was in horrible pain. Lightning flashed again and I saw the splintered remains of the cross sticking out of my leg. I limped as fast as I could, my leg was killing me. I felt something quickly aproaching my back. I told myself ""Don't look back just keep running!"" I burst out of the field and dropped to the ground. I ran my hands along the ground and was overjoyed to feel asphalt. I stood up and limped down the road. The clouds parted above me and the moon shined down on the field. I came to an awful realization. Although I could see the corn whipping back and forth, I couldn't hear any wind. A dark, large mass burst out the the field and landed on the road. The clouds covered the moon again as the creature unfolded to show its decrepid features. It was completly covered in a black, whispy cloth that was torn and reaked of decay. It had two red glowing eyes burning in the center of its dark face. I turned and tried to run, but I dropped. The creature took massive strides toward me, It was at least eight feet tall and I noticed it wore a hood. I got up and sprinted down the road, pain ruptured from my leg but I ignored it, I ran inside a barn and locked the door. I sat on a stack of hay bails and listened. I heard silence. Then, as if it were a faint whisper, I heard my name being called outside the barn. Cameron... Cameron... I covered my ears. I saw the door fly open but nothing entered the barn. I slowly took my hands away from my ears, tears rolled down my face. I lost all control and yelled ""Why did you leave?!??!!"" All the hairs on the back of my neck stood up as something right behind me whispered ""I didn't.""",The Storm,6
TreasureHouseofDoom,14,67,1r01v0,2,"Mary waited, caught her breath, mulled over the facts.  Such a little girl who had been through too much, she may have seen it all as if it had only happened moments ago or she may have felt the distance well over a century had made to fact and memory.

""Sweet Dulcie was a nice girl, 'the lil golden angel,' Mama called her, and she liked sweets, too,"" Mary's eyes twinkled as she remembered her friend, but almost as quickly they grew dark, troubled, pensive.  ""And when she started wanting something, well, she usually got it on account of she was a lady of the house.""  

Mary looked from grave to grave.  ""Mister Moseley was hardly ever around, but Mrs Moseley was a force to reckon with, nice, too, but high and mighty.  She left that day with my Mama and Big Roy, her driver.  They took the hay wagon to the store.  And that meant they'd be gone a long while.""

In the distance, we heard the hitching of a wagon, the call of a man, robust, and then--as if she were right here with us--the insistent tone of a cultured southern lady, ""Mary Rose,  Sweet Dulcie may stay here if you will keep watch over her.  She mustn't go to the creek; it's much too dangerous when no one can hear your shouts.  Stay by or in  the house.  No mischief."" And I felt rather than heard what Mary's Mama thought, 'Who is here to watch my baby girl?'

Mary smiled memories.  ""We played marbles, these ones my Daddy made with clay from the creek,"" and now she presented balls of red clay as if she'd had them all the time, palm up, then turned her hand to push them into mine.  ""But Sweet Dulcie, well, she wanted some other distraction.""

""Mary Rose, let's be the grown ups.  I'm the Lady and you're my Girl.""

And Sweet Dulcie stepped from Mary's memories straight into the scene.  Standing at the foot of her own grave, she didn't turn to see her name in stone. Sweet Dulcie stepped toward Mary, held her hands out, childlike facsimile of a saint, beatific expression and approachability.  Mary took her hands, her joy spreading from this contact along her arms to her face, until Mary's smile beamed with the same golden luster. Then, Mary's right hand clasping Sweet Dulcie's left, the two girls turned to run from the cemetery, down the hill, and along the path again.

For just a moment, my living friends and I watched in some confusion.  Beth was the first to speak, ""I don't get it, Julianne.  Are they friends or enemies?""

Mind still turning through the details, I did the best I could with the information I had. ""In Mary's heart, she and Dulcie have always been friends,"" I began as Seth took the initiative to follow the girls down the path, ""but it certainly doesn't seem the same to Dulcie.  There's real animosity in her spirit.  Last night and when she watched from across the creek.""

Seth breathed deeply, ""Two things: First, I think the path's turned cold. Second, I wonder if the Dulcie we just witnessed isn't just a projection of Mary's memories."" Looking past Seth, who was two or three yards ahead, and then around us, I saw that he was right.  Coming through the brush and privet shielding the trail, we discovered a softball game in full swing at the second field.   Girls in still bright, clean uniforms--some burgundy and some sky blue--cheered their teammates on, kept their field positions, warmed up their batting arms.  A girl at the plate focused all her energy on the bat, zoomed in to watch the ball.  Thin tendrils of light rose from her head and chest; she was doing what she loved.  Reading auras isn't something I do for fun or can even control, but I realized long ago that people who speak or act passionately often have actual halos or even rays about them.  Perhaps I'd become lost in this thought because now Beth nudge me along.  She and Seth were exhausted.  More than just assessing this from how they looked, I could feel it.  They'd been up all night watching me, and now, too, they'd spent their morning in circumstances completely outside their realm of contemplation 12 hours ago.

Seth took a seat on the merry-go-round a few yards left of the field fence.  A city-made wooden plank sign next to it read, ""Whirl-A-Round."" I wondered if that was attempt at rising above the norm, fancifying as some folks said down here, or if it was a brand name.  

""Maybe a brand forty years ago,"" Seth responded, ""it's been here decades.  I've seen it in pics taken from the back of the house as the land was cleared to widen the park.""

I didn't mention what seemed obvious to me, but watched him instead.  Seth looked down at his hands, clasped then rubbed them together against Fall chill. ""I think I've always been able to do it. Or, well, I always thought I could do it, but then I'd convince myself it was just my imagination,"" he turned back to smile at me, ""but you think real loud.""  His smile was broad by reflex, but then he and it grew shy.  ""And, yes, I've heard some things that may be better left private, but it wasn't on purpose.  I can't control it really.""

My expression was slack, resolved, guarded, but inside I was both excited and enlightened.  It was no wonder I was so drawn to him.  Seth began again, ""Some of those private thoughts I'm really glad to know."" He would have kept talking, but my kiss to his cheek halted him.

""I guess you didn't see that coming."" And I slipped from the bleachers to the ground, little scrape to my back as I did but no matter, and traipsed over to Beth.  Throwing my arms around her shoulders from the back, I hugged her tightly.  

""I'm only pretending to watch the game. I totally saw that and was afraid of what you might do next.""  Beth's deadpan made me laugh.  As practiced as she was with boys, that kiss to Seth's cheek was the farthest I'd ever gone.  ""Totally first base, well, for you.  Pace yourself,"" Beth added, trying not to laugh.  But it wasn't bad advice--I had a way of becoming consumed by new things.

And now we gathered ourselves. Beth and I walking hand-in-hand back to where Seth sat facing his house, and then the three of us together.  It occurred to me that Beth's parents must be worried sick.  ""Oh, man,Beth, what about your folks?""

""I called them last night, told them you'd OD'd on sugar and spice and everything nice."" Cute. Another goody-goody joke.  ""Mom totally believed me.  She thinks you were drunk. Nursing a hang over now.  I ran with it."" And now I laughed fairly hard.  A rumor or two, not that Beth's mother would pass them, could only help my street cred.  

""I wouldn't worry much about that. I have a feeling folks are talking about what happened last night, already.""  Seth pointed toward the street just past his house.  A police car was parked on the curb, and Chief Hillard ambled up the front walk.  


A deep sigh coursing through us all, collection, we made our way to meet him.

Chief Hillard was at the front door when we came around.  ""Why, there you busy kids are! I would have expected you to sleep in after such a riotous night.""

Seth spoke first, ""I'm not sure what you're talking about,"" he began but Chief Hillard cut him off shortly.

""Listen, Seth,believe me, it doesn't thrill me to be the one to have to talk to your father about this, but you might as well know we've got three girls crying their eyes out because they think they've had a death threat, five kids down at the station giving us all the names, and people all over the town who'd like to see you hanging by the toilet paper you trailed.""

Seth lowered his eyes, resignation filling his expression.  ""I'll need you and Beth to come with me as soon as I speak to your parents.""

Now, Beth and Seth looked surprised.  ""Chief Hillard, I should come, too,"" I said embarrassedly.  

The Chief regarded me only a moment before he began laughing.  ""You can come down if you want, but it isn't necessary. I know very well that you wouldn't be involved in anything like this.""  

""It was my idea,"" I said to his deeper laughter.  There was no convincing him, and I wondered if no one had turned my name in with the others.   

""Shawn Cornett's parents were the first to call, and he gave us the lot of you,"" Chief
Hillard was speaking to Seth again. ""I've got 20 names .""

Shawn.  We'd gotten his house pretty good while he led the rolling at the covered bridge.

Turning to Beth sheepishly, I was glad when she reached to hug my neck.  ""Don't worry, Julianne.  You'll pay your dues.  Why don't you call our parents for us?""  Her smile was impish, but I knew she must be deeply troubled to imagine their reactions.  The mix of punishment with disappointment was a foregone conclusion, and Beth hated to disappoint her parents.  ""Buy Marsha some Kleenex, and hand Kyle my car keys.  We'll be bussing or hoofing it to school for awhile. But don't tell them you're guilty.  I might be able to speak to one friend for the rest of senior year if they keep their PollyAnna view of you.""

Seth was explaining to Chief Hillard that his folks were away for the weekend when I put my hand to his elbow.  ""It's okay, Julianne."" He turned to me, his expression tense but not unkind. ""We had a good time at others' expenses--we'll all pay our dues somehow.""  It had crossed my mind to wonder what my dues might be after all was said and done if I was the only person not brought into the station.  I couldn't quite understand why no one had given me up, but I was sure they would all be angry with me. 

""You hold the fort down.  Call my folks if you don't mind.  The number's by the phone in the foyer."" And now he turned to Chief Hillard. ""Are we being arrested, Sir?""

And the Chief laughed hard.  ""I could have you all on theft and  criminal mischief or destruction of public property or a few other vandalism charges, but I'm hoping we can take care of this through some friendly mediation.  If I had to arrest every kid who'd rolled a house last night, they might as well close the middle and high schools for a week.""

Seth kissed my cheek as they turned to leave, and Beth nudged with her elbow, ""From now on, I'm calling y'all Bonnie and Clyde,"" and I cringed. I'd seen the movie with Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway when I was a kid, and I still hadn't gotten over the trauma of their big death scene.

Now I had Seth's house to myself for awhile, but I couldn't stay long.  Once news of our transgressions traveled through the town, my parents would call Beth's to fetch me, and I didn't expect they'd be pleased to find I had spent the night someplace for which I didn't have permission, a boy's house no less.  Taking the receiver from the hook, I steeled myself to call the Drs Jefferies, but suddenly I was reminded that alone in this house was only a matter of illusion.  The phone buzzed pure energy, and I felt--rather than saw--the danger it represented.  

Always sensitive to electricity in the air, I was overwhelmed by sense that everything electrical surged in the house. I heard the boom and sizzle of a transformer bursting outside, and then the lights went out.  In many houses, an electrical outage at noon wouldn't have been a big deal, but I knew heavy drapes in all the windows would block the light fairly well, and the only light to the foyer came through geometric panels of stained glass--mostly amber, purple, and crimson--that created a design in the heavy oak front door.  I hadn't examined the image carefully before, but now, as light through the panes projected dancing stereoscope around me,  I realized the glass depicted a raging fire.  A shiver rose through me, just as a scream came from some place in the back yard.  I was about to step out the front to run around to the back, when laughter from the study interrupted me.  

""Julianne, Mary Rose's new friend, don't you want to play with us? I'm the lady of the house, and she's the girl, and you can be,"" the voice trailed off but I heard breath at the door, imagined her fingers reaching for the knob, and now she screamed pitifully, ""the doctor!""

There are moments in our lives when we are too afraid to move, or--at least--dreams would lead us to believe such is true. I braced myself for that fear, fought the impulse to cower in a corner, reminded myself of the promise I had made Mary. And I felt Aunt Lucia's presence, heard her sweet voice reassure, ""The truest power is in life.  She will not prevail so long as you maintain your strength.""

In all the years since Aunt Lucia had passed, I had never been glad that she was no longer among the living, but now I realized blessings in that. Her voice, this spiritual presence, had guided me well so far.

	Kyle, I love you so much. Don’t ever forget that. It can’t ever hurt you again. At least I hope.

- *Recording left by the corpse of my brother 21 years ago.*

Hi, my name is Kyle and I’m in denial. I feel like my world is falling apart and it's obvious why. I can’t cope with this. 25 year old men shouldn’t have nightmares like I do. I see Dan every night….trapped. By what I don’t know but it ends the same way every time. He tells me to run. When I refuse he points to the darkness, but I always see nothing. He tells me if the darkness ever stares back, don’t be afraid. I never understand what he means when he whispers, “The secret is never acknowledging its presence, it is egomaniacal.” The look on his face is always grave, his body emaciated. His eyes bleach white, as if he was blind as a bat. Yet he always seems happy I’m there, like I was visiting him. How do I still remember him? I was four when he was murdered. He was always much older than me. I can feel a beading pressure on the back of my neck….. Whose there?

It helps to write. To organize my thoughts. Maybe it has something to do with the tape. My parents never let me listen to it as a kid. They thought it would traumatize me. Only recently after my graduation they thought I was ready. They aren’t believers in the paranormal but after Dan’s body was found in our basement they reevaluated. It wouldn’t be strange if they hadn’t found him without his eyes or ears, with no trace of blood. Omnia Mors Aequat, in Latin this means “Death Makes All Things Equal”. The voice repeats that in the tape. I’m scared. I’m so scared. 

The last time I called my mom she told me that prior to Dan’s death I started to act strange. I would huddle in the corner of my room, staring at the dark corner where the light from the lamp couldn’t reach. I never cried but was almost catatonic, my skin pale from head to toe. The last time she saw Dan alive he told her he was going to fix this mess. 

Its here again. And it knows I know. Dan...It didn’t work. But thank you. Thank you so much. I will follow your advice. I will run.

There is no hope.

Jaysta99,0,1,1qxwez,4,"I was 17 and I was a complete moron. Let me just clear that up right now. My friends were just as bad, and that is why we decided that breaking into an abandoned rest home would be the coolest shit ever. We planned our little venture for the following Friday night. We picked up some flashlights, a cheap camera, etc., in preparation for our night. I'll just skip to Friday night to save myself some time.

Alright, so Friday night came and my friends and I hopped into my car, 3 of us in all. We arrived at the rest home, which was on the outskirts of my small town, in about 10 minutes. We got out our gear and approached the front door. To our utter surprise, it was unlocked. I was somewhat disappointed as I wanted the satisfaction of actually breaking in to something. Nonetheless, we forged ahead, pulling out our flashlights to fend off the darkness. We walked around, joking around with each other about ghosts, demon old people, and the like. It was relatively uneventful, so uneventful, in fact, that I put the camera back in my bag. We continued to walk around until we were about to quit due to boredom. Sure there was obscene graffiti on the walls to admire, but that only entertains a teenager for so long. Right as we approached the front door to leave, I took a glance down one of the three hallways that stretched away from the entrance. A light. A light was faintly coming from around the corner of the hallway. I stopped dead in my tracks. I grabbed one of my friends' shoulder and pointed. He looked over and lost the color in his face. The three of us warily approached the corner, two of us in the front, one watching the rear. We neared the corner and the light flicked off. I let out a short scream. My friends snickered and, although my first instinct was to run, I decided that I needed to prove my manliness and round that damn corner. I slowly approached, with my friends trailing behind. I jumped around the corner and pointed my flashlight with a yell, but my voice was cut off in my throat. Maybe 50 or 60 feet down the hallway, a wheelchair was moving in the opposite direction of my group. My friends came around to see what had frightened me and they stopped cold. The wheelchair stopped. I shuddered. Slowly, it turned around to face my flashlight, which I was holding with wobbly hands. Then, to my complete dismay, it slowly began coming back towards us. ""What the *fuck* is that?"" one of my friends whispered. I had no reply. I had a sudden realization and fumbled with my bag while my friends kept their flashlights trained on the slowly approaching wheelchair. I pulled out the camera and hit ""record"". ""Insert tape"". Shit. Of course, in my infinite teenage wisdom, I hadn't even checked to see if the camera had any tape when I bought it at a thrift store. My anger combined with my fear, and I hurled the camera down the hallway at the wheelchair, which was now maybe 30 feet away. The camera flew over it and was swallowed up by the darkness behind the wheelchair. It stopped. The wheelchair stopped. My friends and I watched in paralyzed fear. Then all of a sudden, as if whatever had been pushing it began *running*, it began to approach us incredibly quickly. We all let out screams and took off for the door. I grabbed for the handle, but it wouldn't budge. I looked over to the corner we had just came around and saw the wheelchair round it, maybe 15 feet away. I screamed and threw all my weight into the door, sending it crashing open. My friends and I ran in terror. We flew into my car, and I jumbled with the keys before finally managing to ignite the engine. I floored it as my friends waited for the wheelchair to roll out of the swinging door. It never did.",Rest Home,5
becomingthem,0,3,1qvppy,3,"When I was a little girl, about 6 or 7, I had these nightmares.  They weren’t your average childhood nightmares, they’re almost unexplainable.  It was like I was in a world in which everything was bigger than me and could crush me with the slightest amount of effort.  The details are foggy now, but I will never forget waking up crying and still feeling that strange ache in my stomach.  I am now almost 15, and I haven’t felt that gut wrenching feeling until recently.


I went on with my life after those years as if it was nothing and put it off as silly nightmares from watching too many horror films. (Yes, I was watching horror movies at age 6.)  I have always believed in the paranormal but I never thought I would witness it for myself.  I’ve been reading r/nosleep for almost two years now because I have a fascination with supernatural things of all kinds.  I almost regret getting so involved with it.


Two weeks ago I had another nightmare.  I was stuck in a small room with tile covering every inch of the walls, floor, and even ceiling.  I was trying to find a door when I saw a silhouette of… something, standing behind my own.  I starred for a while before I turned around to find nothing.  Just then, I looked up and realized there was a shower head. It almost immediately turned on and I thought I saw something on the ceiling, just above it.  I closed my eyes in reaction to the water.  I rubbed them until I got a rushed feeling that I needed to look up at whatever I thought I saw.  In fear, I opened them and looked up to feel the weight of the ceiling crashing down on me.  I woke up, soaking wet, with that familiar feeling.  My stomach felt like it was being pushed on from the inside.  I instantly checked the ceiling to be sure that I was back in reality.  But there was nothing there.  I felt the weight lift off of me.


I had almost forgotten about that nightmare, that is until I was in my shower, last night, rinsing my face when I felt the sudden urge to get my eyes open to check on what was behind me.  Just so you know, in my shower I have a mirror on the wall facing the shower head (for when I’m taking my makeup off and such.)  I was facing the wall the shower head was on.  I thought about it, and then opened my eyes to see a dark shadow that wasn’t my own.  I turned around and saw nothing, not even in the mirror.  I would be relieved but… my own reflection wasn’t even there.  I decided to wash my hair so I could get out of there because I was starting to feel insane.  I leaned back into the water to rinse when the water got cold.  I continued rinsing when soap ran down my forehead and into my eyes.  I opened my eyes (stupid thing to do when you have soap in your eyes) and in my mirror I saw this… thing behind me.  It was very tall and dark from what I could tell. I felt my heart drop.  I reluctantly started to fall, fainting from the fear, and hit the bathroom floor.  As I regained my consciousness I felt that familiar strange feeling in my stomach… I closed my eyes and I heard a distorted voice.  It told me, “We have always been here…on the inside.”",On the Inside,6
YesFoodOfCourse,1,0,1qvo34,4,"A few years back, I used to live with my father, step-mum, and 3 of my now 7 brothers. At the time, my little brother had been 2 1/2. It was my step-mother's birthday, March 3rd. She had been very interested in ghosts, and ghost hunting ever since I showed her a popular show that we all know and love.

For her birthday, my dad and myself had pitched in money to buy her a proper ghost hunting kit. Camera, cases, ranged thermometers, the works. Little did we know that it would come back to bite us in the ass. More so me than anyone else.

Some time later, my father thought it would be a great idea to test out the gear in his bedroom, that in turn was shared by his wife and my little brother. We sat there for about an hour, asking questions, but got no response. We quit after the hour was up and decided that there were no spirits in the house.

Fast forward about a month and I had got home from a loooong day at school. I was tired, and home alone. I kept hearing noises around the house, but being tired and paranoid, I figured my mind was playing tricks on me. I finished my chores and decided to lay down to take a cat nap. Tossing and turning, I could not find a comfortable place no matter what position I was in. And that's when I felt it; An extremely cold, almost ice-like hand slither around my waist. I didn't move, I didn't do anything except wish that it would go away. But it didn't, the grip around me only tightened. At this point, I did try to get up, but I was held in place by this arm. After struggling for a minute or so, I gave up and just decided to sleep. Which I did.

I woke up a few hours later to the grip no longer pinning me to my bed, and my father was home from work, along with my step-mum and my little brother. Greeting him with a hug as I always do, he didn't seem right. He wasn't as focused, didn't want to eat and refused to come out of my father's bedroom. We turned on Toy Story and let him watch it as it is his favourite movie, and also mine. 

I left the room and began to eat dinner with my family. My little brother began giggling uncontrollably. He's watched this movie countless times before and never laughed like that. I checked on him and saw him just staring at the ceiling, laughing his little ass off. I shrugged an left the room to return to my food when his giggling became louder, so loud I couldn't hear my father complaining about his day at work.

At this point, my father was irritated and told my little brother to hush for a little while. His giggling dispersed for about 5 minutes before it once again started.My dad also noticed that my brother was off, and as a joke he thought he might catch what was making my brother laugh. He set up the audio recorder and left. We ate dinner and then stopped the recorder.

We reviewed the audio and didn't hear anything, we were about to give up. Then we heard it. I don't know if you guys ever watched Toy Story, but there is a certain part when Buzz, a toy, got stolen and is now being forced to a tea party with the neighbor's daughter. Th young girl on the movie said, 

""More tea, Mrs. Nezbith?''

Right after, was a deep, husky voice, that of a male in his early 20's whispered,

""Shh, darling. They might hear us again.'' 

Then the constant giggling stopped, the movie continuing on. We listened to the movie, over and over again, hearing no male voice. We were freaked out. I did the dishes and we all went to bed. At exactly 3:00 AM, my little brother woke up, screaming, kicking, crying. We thought it was a nightmare. I calmed him down and laid him back down.

The next night, it happened again. Exactly 3:00 AM. This happened consecutively for about a month before my father called in a priest to bless the house. I'm not a religious person, in fact, I am an Atheist. But I was all for it. 

It never happened again, the midnight screaming, or the giggling.

I now live with my grandmother as her husband recently died, and she cannot pay the bills alone. My mother also lives here, helping out as well. A few nights ago, she rang me from the porch, panicking.

""Are you in your room?''

""Yes.""

""Are you sure?""

""I'm pretty sure, I'm in my bed.""

""I just saw a shadow in the hallway.''

I hung up and grabbed my hunter's knife, and inspected the hallway. Nothing was there, and I figured she was just seeing things.

It was 10:30 PM and my grandmother was getting for work. She works 3rd shift, so it starts at 12:00 AM. We were standing in the kitchen, talking about what we would have for dinner tomorrow when there was a bang from the hallway. We both walked to see what it was, and all of the papers, towels and such were strewn about, off of the desk in the hallway. My heart started pounding. She didn't know about the shadows, and I didn't plan on telling her.

We have three cats, so she blamed it on them. I agreed, my stomach settling for the time being. She went to go get a shower when it hit me; All three cats were outside. They like playing outside at night so we let them out. 

To get my mind off the incident in the hallway, I went to get a shower. I stripped down, looking in the mirror, and saw a single scratch going along the length of my side. All of my cats are declawed, so it couldn't have been them. I'm scared. I hopped in the shower, washed my hair and body faster than a teenage boy's first time having sex.

I got dressed in my pajamas after drying my hair and went to bed. I was curled up, watching a few video on my phone, my mind focused on that. Suddenly I felt a certain icy hand creep up my back, and onto my waist, sending a stinging feeling through the scratch. I'm not alone. He never left.

I've been followed. ",Followed,4
The_Realest_Ninja,0,1,1qt5u3,4,"There’s an overgrown meadow near my house. It’s about where my bus stop used to be before I changed schools.

Right there, an old mailbox stands crooked next to rigid concrete steps. The steps lead to nothing. 

My folks tell me there was not one, but two abandoned houses beside each other. One burned down in the middle of the night, long before we moved there.

The other just collapsed to the ground one day, probably from the termites. 

The city sent some workers to clean up the wreck.

Nothing remains but those steps. 

When I was younger, we’d stand there and throw Frisbee.

One day, my cousin had a heck of an arm, and he showed off. The disc sailed through the air into a grove at the end of the meadow, scaring off some Canadian geese.

He’d grabbed the last errant one, so it was my turn. However, he decided he was done for the day, so he went back to my house and walked inside.

A bit annoyed, I still went for my Frisbee. Looking around the immediate trees and bushes, I didn’t see it. 

I didn’t want to walk too deep into the woods, lest I find a copperhead. 
But, ever so faint, I started to hear this splashing noise. I followed the tall grass down a hill toward some white pines.  Ducking through the briers and branches, I surpassed the thicket.

There was a small creek, no wider than a yard. Fallen limbs loomed in its reflection. For some reason, the water had a frothy, amber tint.

As I approached the bank, there was a picnic blanket with a blue lunch box. I opened it, but was immediately repulsed by the smell. Two moldy sandwiches were in it. I tossed the box down. Clang! 

I walked closer to the creek. Just next to the surface was a large boulder.

Scrawled on it was one word:

“AMELIA.”

The letters were a bit faded. No doubt many rains had washed over them.

Behind me, up the hill, I heard some rustling. Thinking it was more geese, I started back. 

Next to the grass, made out of pine cones was an arrow, pointed back the way I came. My Frisbee was laid beside it.

BensonHedges1,0,2,1r8sq9,3,"Upon arriving home last night, the first thing I did was drag my boyfriend into the room. I was happy he finally had a night off and could witness what I've been stressing out about. Seriously, you should see me. I look like a crack head - no sleep - wrinkled clothes - everything..I have to run in and out of the room to get clothes for the next day. Thank god I haven't had to go into the office.

Anyways, I've spent most of my time in the spare room and kept the door shut. My cat has been incredibly cautious, he's looking around every corner, and just sits on a chair in the kitchen that faces the hallway to the bedroom. He is normally very cuddly, he welcomes me at the door, headbutts me for attention. This has all stopped. The hair on his tail is at a constant stand-up position. I took him to the vet this morning - she says anxiety seems to be the cause. I've got some kitty-prozac, maybe I should take it? 

Anyways - we went out for dinner last night and came home and fell asleep on the couch. Around midnight we got up and went into the room, and there was no chill. The windows were closed, and there was seriously no activity. He thinks I'm nuts, but I swear this keeps getting worse! The only thing I had to show was the dark spot on the carpet...it's grown more of an amber color, looks like rust, and it smells if you get close to it. Not nearly as rancid as yesterday. He thinks maybe there was a leak in the roof or something, but I don't know...

He left for a detail this morning at 5, so I figured I'd get up and moving, I actually felt good about things. Maybe it was just some weird series of events...I will tell you though, I had some really crazy dreams last night. I don't remember them scene for scene, but there were some people who I'm sure I know, but can't put my finger on. All dead - a bunch of dead corpses laying outside all these spots of this new town I've moved to. Outside the barbershop I visited yesterday. Outside the clock tower that I thought looked so beautiful at sundown last night. Dead people laying outside a warehouse - which is where my gym resides now...it felt so vivid. I remember just walking around, and I could literally feel myself bumping up against spirits. It was so vivid that I literally sighed with relief when I woke up and noticed myself wrapped in my boyfriends arms. I felt safe. 

I digress...

The weirdness has crept back though. I showered, had breakfast, and made some coffee...though I've been using the espresso machine because the drip on the coffee pot kind of freaks me out. During my coffee making process, I heard some tapping coming from the bedroom - up against the door. The cat was sitting in front of the door, but not close enough to be causing the tapping. As I approached, it sounded more like scraping, but was really faint. 

I opened the doors, and the windows are cracked open. I didn't do this. The bed looked slept in - we had made it so nicely before he went off to work. And the floor of the shower in the bedroom was SOAKED. I did not shower in there - I used the one in the main bathroom. Someone's sleeping in this bed, someone is showering. Someone is opening the drawers in our dresser. 

I walked into the room, and there was that feeling - the feeling from my dream. It felt like I had to push through dozens of bodies to walk through the door. SO MUCH PRESSURE. You know those days when it's windy as hell out and you're leaving a department store? They have those heat lamps right before an exit and you walk outside into the freezing cold - it's such a pressure change. That was this exact feeling. I felt like I entered a totally different place - it didn't feel like my home. There was so much negative energy...I could feel it. My mind start racing with flashback of that dream I had. I was walking around this town, everything was much grey-er than normal...I felt like I was warped somewhere. It was nuts - it felt like a movie, but I know it wasn't. I know none of this was happening, but I could feel it happen. The next thing I knew - I was gasping for air with my back on the bed. I looked at the clock and it was 8am...somehow I had lost track of about 2 hours. 

I regained composure, walked to the hallway, and my cat just hissed at me. He wouldn't let me pet him, pick him up, anything. Just hisses...and I felt dizzy. I noticed some hairballs and some piles of puke from my cat, which was definitely out of normal. I lucked out, my cat produces very limited hairballs...

I immediately called the vet...

And now I'm home, freaked out again, and the door is shut. There's a pretty constant knocking, scratching, and I'm sure that I've heard the shower turn on. At one point I heard the door open and close immediately, as if someone was peeking out see if I was still here.

Nosleep0,1,8,1r7bh8,4,"
Jonathon and Katie, both 22 years old, broke up two weeks ago. ""Boredom,"" as Katie would put it, is the reason for her diminishing interest in Jonathon.

Jonathon still loves Katie.  Jonathon misses Katie; he didn't want to break-up.  He still looks at her with the same eyes he had when they started dating at the age of sixteen. Jonathon is struggling with the break-up. He's depressed and has called in sick at work four days in the last two weeks. Today is one of his sick days.

He lies in his bed, it's 11:57am.  He stares at the ceiling, wondering what Katie is doing.  Wondering when, or if she will take him back.  He loves Katie, but he can't help but feel anger towards her too.  How could she do this to him?  After all they have been through together, she ends it... because she is bored?  There must be another reason.  

*She must be seeing someone else.*

Jonathon snaps out of his internal back-and-forth and sits up in his bed.  He sighs and turns his head to look in the mirror. 

*I haven't shaved in a week.  Katie doesn't like it when I neglect shaving.*  

He slowly steps out of bed, stands, and looks blankly at his bedroom wall.  His attention is captured the moment he receives a text-message.  Reluctantly thinking it could be Katie, he quickly grabs his phone.  

*It's Katie!*

""We need to talk.  1:30 this afternoon at McAlister's Coffee?  It's important.""

 *This might be my last real opportunity to convince Katie that the break-up was a bad idea. Not too eager though...* 

He slows his thumbs from tapping like an Irish river-dancer, and slyly replies, ""Sure. Sounds good.""  He looks in the mirror once again and smiles. His first genuine smile in two weeks.  

*Now to shave.*

Jonathon shaves, showers, puts on his most decent clothes and decides it would be a worthy gesture to stop by the supermarket for flowers before meeting Katie.  

*Katie always loved it when I bought her flowers.  This will remind her of the good times.*

It's 1:15pm and Jonathon is driving to McAlister's Coffee.  He is nervous and excited.  He hasn't seen Katie in nine days.  

He pulls up to the coffee shop five minutes early and decides to sit in his car until 1:32pm. 

*Not too eager.* 

At 1:29pm, Katie comes out of the coffee shop looking emotionally distraught.  She sits on a bench located in front of the coffee shop.  She notices Jonathon's car and perks up, wondering why he is just sitting.

*Shit.  Now she thinks I am being flaky.*

A whole three minutes too early, he reaches for his flowers and gets out of his car.  He smiles at Katie and makes his way across the parking lot.  Katie gets up from the bench and meets Jonathon halfway.  

""I don't really want coffee.""  Katie admits to Jonathon.

With his most charming smile he replies, ""Oh? Why are we here then?  What did what you need to tell me that is so important?"" 

""I... went on a date last night.""

Jonathon's charming smile slowly turned into a subtle frown. ""You did...?  With who?""

""That's... not important.""  Katie's eyes began to swell as she looked into Jonathon and hugged him.
""I made a mistake. My night made me realize what a fool I have been. How can you ever forgive me?"" 

Katie pulls away to look into Jonathon's eyes once more.  Jonathon wipes her tears away and with the truest smile says, ""Katie, I love you.  Of course I forg...""

The noise begins...

**BAHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON**

...

...

...

**BAHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON**


Jonathon, Katie and everyone around them grimace, grab their ears for cover and look to the sky.


**BAHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON**

...

...

...

**BAHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON**

Cars in the street stop dead in place and their operators look out of their windows, wondering where the sound is coming from.

Katie looks at Jonathon with a fear he has never seen in her. ""Jon! What is that!?""

Jon's knees give out.  As he falls to the parking lot, the loud ambient chatter goes silent. The only noise he hears is the sound of the rustling wind and the brushing of leaves on the ground.  He tries to stand up but he can't.  He tries to comfort Katie from the ground, but he can't make a sound.  Katie is standing completely still in place, as though a mannequin.

*What the fuck is going on? KATIE! KATIE! CAN YOU HEAR ME?*

**BAHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON**

...

...

...

**BAHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON**

Jonathon, locked in an upward looking position, sees it.

He sees where the noise is coming from.

He notices a wet stain overwhelm the outside of Katie's jeans.  

*She must see it too.*

Everyone around him is paralyzed, but he feels their fear. He feels their need to run, but they can't.

He realizes these are his final moments, he tries one last time to speak.  Though only thoughts are allowed.

*I love you Katie... I love you.*

He sees the first person launch violently into the air, then the second, the third.  It's his turn.  He's jerked in the air in the direction of the anomaly.  The last thing he sees is Katie.  She is the last thing he wants to see.

Gone-Postal-Narwhal,0,4,1r6nbm,5,"I believe in the paranormal but I've never actually witnessed anything until a few days ago. 

I've lived in my house for almost 14 years. It's a new build. It's never felt haunted or scary. It's always felt empty or normal until about two days ago. 
My fiancé and I went to bed as usual. In the morning my dog always wakes me up around 6. When I first woke I assumed my dog was the reason but no I could still feel her at my feet. When I went to open my eyes and glance down. A tall human figure outlined in gold was reaching out to me. The inside was ripple and distorted everything behind it. I slammed my eyes shut, pulled the covers over my head and rolled over to be closer to my fiancé. All I could think was please let it leave and don't touch me. Eventually, I drifted off again. My dog never woke me up that morning, which I thought was odd.

Ever since then I've felt like there's been something in my house. I could use some help figuring out what it is and if it's harmful and how I got here.

Allycat662,2,5,1r67oh,2,"Have you ever ran into *those* type of people that just fucking grate you the wrong way; the arrogant ones who get away with tons of shit and know they can get away with it?  Not the instances where you rise above it and claim your stake... but the more helpless cases.

You just want karma to intervene and give that little prick what's coming to them.

Energy work is something that I've been doing for over half my life, and there are ways to speed karma up on certain individuals who you feel have done grievous injustices to yourself and others.  There are definitely other ways to handle things of course, but I'd rather not have to kill people.  There are important lessons to be learned of karma and the desire to do harm to others.  There's a creed out there stating that whatever energy you put out into the world, you will get the same energy back threefold.


The first time I used energy against a person was when I was 14.  I did a stupid harmless love spell to get a crush of mine on a date.  He did agree on the date, but of course he got back with his ex.  Total energy backfire.

The second time I used energy against a person was a year later as a sophomore.  There was a really cute upperclassman I talked to all the time.  He told me that his long term relationship was crumbling and he just didn't feel it anymore.

His girl at the time was a likeable person, but she had an air of snottery about her I found irritating.  One day she walked by me while I was at my locker, and I threw my energy at her aggressively.  I didn't wish anything specifically, but the following Monday she walked into school with a broken leg in full cast.  Holy fucking shit.

Now, this may be just me, but I felt horrible about it.  And I got hurt too in return that same day in gym class.  I didn't break anything but it was an embarrassing situation since the cute upperclassman happened to share that class.

At this point I stopped using my energy against people.  I can do without the concequences. Until recently of course.  

I happened to stumble across a jerk-ass individual who was offensive in so many ways, it made my blood boil.  I don't use my energy against people anymore, so I did the next best thing:  I invoked the power of karma on their ass.

I collected the energy around me and made a silent plea to karma to give this asshole the karma coming to them.  I made the same plea another 12 times or so for good measure.  And karma answered in the form of physical pain against the offender.

Fml, what a frightening gift to have.  At first I gave in to karma and did nothing, but eventually I made another plea to karma that this person has had their karmic obligation fulfilled and to cease all further efforts (with a polite thank you).

The pain did subside, but gradual and slowly.

Now, I'm not going to say that this will work for all of you, and I'm sure it won't have much affect on situations much bigger than yourself, but I know that there's got to be some redditors out there that have done similar things.",Karma can be purposful. Can you use it?,7

We have these French doors that we hung stain glass pictures and animals on. My dog started growling under her breath looking at the door. I walked over to check it out. The only one rattling was a stained glass picture of Jesus. As soon as I got to the door the picture fell to the floor at my feet. I jumped back and a chill ran through me. The picture did not break. I put the stained glass back up and tried shaking the door in different ways but I could not even get it to rattle an inch.

Darrenshan66,0,7,1r3u6m,3,"I walked up to the old elementry school with caution. It hadn't been used in years, and the gym had parts of a tree growing through the planks, and an entire section of it had to be torn down for having asbestos in the walls. I got to the entrance and what do ya know? It was locked. I cursed and kicked the door. I was supposed to be able to get in so I could do my project for history class. I was to one of the oldest buildings and town and right a report on it, so I thought it would be cool to get first hand experience inside the building. I had even told the groundskeeper I was going to visit the school! But alas, the door was locked. I was right about to leave when I noticed something shining in the grass. Being curious, I walked over and picked it up. It was an old key. ""Could it really-"", I asked myself, turning towards the door. I walked up and stuck the key in and IT WORKED. Excited about my new found courage I ran into the building. The old concession stand for the gym was the first sight to greet me. Its old countertops covered in ancient dust. I pushed open the doors and entered the gym. Holes were broken in the wooden planks of the court where a tree had pushed through. I pulled out my camera and snapped a few pictures. As I looked over the newly taken photos I noticed what looked like a person standing on the stage in the background. ""Hello?"", I asked, hoping that whoever I had seen was kind enough to respond. I got no reply and decided to take a closer look at the picture. ""Must be the light"", I told myself, shrugging away the fear of whomever I had seen. Then I came to realize that there were no lights on. I decided to correct this error and walked to the back of the gym. I flipped the lightswitch and the lights burst into life. The gym became so bright that I had to cover my eyes. I walked into the middle of the gym. I was about to snap some more pictures with the flash off when the lights cut out. ""Stupid old fuse"", I said walking up to the switch. I flipped it off and on again, the lights came back on and I walked to the middle of the gym again. Then the lights turned off again! ""What the hell?"", I asked, walking up to the switch. My jaw dropped when I noticed that the switch was missing. All that was left was torn wires and twisted metal. I ran for the front door but it was sealed shut. I pulled the key out of my pocket and stuck it in the door. I yelped as the key turned red hot in my hand like a live coal. I dropped it as the metal liquified into a puddle on the floor. Just then, the lights in the gym came on again. I walked out onto the court and what I saw made me shiver. Something had left footprints in the dust. They looked like a cross between a skeletal foot and hooves. I gasped and ran to the exit at the back of the gym. I opened the door and ran down a corridor to the door to the outside. I tried the handle but it was locked. I cursed and shook the handle in anger, when I heard something and fell silent. Something was coming down the corridor. It moved on heavy feet, making clicking noises with each slow step. It made shallow breaths, almost as if it was struggling to breath. I covered my nose as the scent of rotting flesh hit me. I stared down at a puddle on the floor and got a veiw of the creature. It was wrapped in a red cloak, with tears in the seams and stains all over it. It's face was the skull of a cow, and it had long arms that touched the floor, the claws on its hands scraping the floor as it walked. I flew into a panic, i kicked at the door until the lock broke. I burst into the night and ran until I was numb, then I blacked out...

xDrAlpakax,0,4,1r3mwk,5,"If it were any other day I would've just walked by, completely unaware and uncaring of what would happen if I approached this, what I percieved as a man. The simple chain of events that occured that day were miniscule and unnoticeable to the naked eye, but differentiated the outcome of my life. If you can call this life, it's a prison. My personal holocaust. Hell. Whatever you call it can not be descriptive enough to effectively describe the torture inflicted every day.
Let me start by saying I was just a normal kid from the suburbs. Imagine a white kid and you had me. 15 years old, 139 pounds, 5""9, need I get more descriptive? I was unnoticeable from the crowd of what seems like millions of other identities that were more important, more athletic, and more human. Not that I'm some alien in disguise, that's not what this story is about. Im just saying that.. well I didn't play nice with others. I'd always get into fights at school and in trouble at home. But I had a single core group of friends that I could rely on: Andy, Sam, and Marcus. 
That just happens to be where the real story begins, when all of us planned a trip up to a cemetery a few miles up the road from my house that had an infamous reputation around my neighborhood. Legend had it that there were a few unmarked graves placed in rediculous formations that no one could identify. No one knew if they were human corpses or not. So I guess thats why we were going up there, to solve the mystery; solve the puzzle. Why and what were these graves? When did they get there? 
We left on Friday evening and started walking north to the graveyard. The walk there involved the normal teenager conversations you'd expect from a couple of rejected kids with no one else to talk to. No weird signs, chills, premonitions, nothing. Just like we were walking to school. Completely normal. Normal... tell me again what that is? I havent caught a glimpse of normal in years. Help me..
We were nearly there and, of course, Andy has to stop to piss. Like we didnt just leave the house an hour ago. Why couldnt you hold it.. damn it Andy there was probably a public bathroom near the cemetery, we were ALMOST THERE. As he walked to the woods, the rest of us realized that we could see the cemetery from where we were, so we yelled at him and told him to catch up to us when he was done. As we approached the gates, some ravens flew away. Actually, they didn't fly away, necessarily. They flew towards us like we weren't as dangerous as what lied ahead of us. Of course, none of us thought anything of it, they were just startled birds right? Maybe they were, I don't know anymore. For all I know we all imagined it. An illusion created by some other being, form, your guess is as good as mine. 
We entered the cemetery and walked through the aisles, internally mourning for their familys' losses. Not that we knew the people six feet deep or anything but it was weird, its like I was dealing with the deal of a family member or close friend; they werent my emotions to bear but they were given to me regardless. After we seperately collected ourselves, we made our way the the main attraction, per say.  It was a giant stone monument in the middle of the open area we were stading in. It was an angel that was kneeling over a grave, and quite honestly it was creepy.  We walked up to it and inspected it. It's faded color, rain stained tears on its face, and sheer size were intimidating to say the least, but we set up our stuff in front of it because there were no other places to stay. 
After we got done, we decided to look for the unmarked graves we walked all this way for. We went left first and planned on walking counter clockwisr around the entire place until we found it. Left. Why left.. every choice was the wrong choice.. why not right.. 
We started walking past countless graves, and once we were walking for a good 5 minutes and couldnt find anything, I felt a hand on my shoulder. I looked at Sam and Marcus and they had the same ghostly shocked face as I did. They both felt it too. We all whipped around to find a man in normal black clothing: jeans, a black t-shirt and jacket, and a black hat. We came to the conclusion that he was an undertaker or groundskeeper or something, and we calmed down a bit.
""What do you kids think you're doing?"" said the man.
Sam replied, ""I.. err, we apologize sir. We were just looking around to find some weird stuff I guess.""
""Well you shouldn't be here, you're not safe at night. No one is."" 
""I think we'll be fine, there's just a bunch of dead people. What's the worst that could happen?"" Sam said
""You're looking for the unmarked graves aren't you?""
I said, ""How did you know?""
""Follow me.""
We all thought this guy was weird, but weird at most. He was scrawny and greasy. Not the kind of person you would normally carry a conversation on with. But we were all curious and had no idea where we were going. At that point something came to my mind; where's Andy? I told the man that we had to wait for my friend, but he said that he found him earlier and he was taking us to him so we can regroup. We hadn't seen him walk back in.. but we followed nonetheless.  
He led us to a secluded spot in the woods where we couldn't see the rest of the graves, where I surprisingly saw Andy standing unharmed, it seemed. As we approached him he murmured something which was undecypherable from the distance we were. We stepped closer, sensing a disturbance as if we were being pushed back mentally, but physically we were moving forward like a magnet. We got closer and closer and realized that his feet weren't... feet anymore. They were what can only be described as roots, binding him to the earth and not letting go. His eyes had turned to complete blackness, reflecting the darkness that now described his soul. 
There was nothing we could do, we tried and tried to get him out of the ground, but we couldnt do anything.  He was rooted too deep. What happened to him? We turned around to get help from the groundskeeper, but he was gone. Andy started to make noises from behind us.. we thought it was Andy. We turned around.. there was nothing. I mean nothing. Arid, dry, barren ground in the dark night. Andy was gone, the trees were gone, graves, everything. Just nothing. I turned to find Sam and Marcus and they were gone. Just me, alone. 
I began to walk to find some sort of shelter or safehaven or some sort to get out of this place. My shoes began to fall apart about an hour into the journey, forcing me to take them off and walk barefooted. I then walked for a few more hours on my raw, bloody feet just hoping for water, even a drop. So thirsty.. but I found nothing. The last thing I remember from the desert was laying on the earth, praying to whoever to get me out.  Then I passed out. 
I have no idea how long I was unconcious, but I woke up in a small grey room that had a single window on one of the walls. I mustered up all the strength that I had to somehow crawl over to it. I had will to find out where I was, and I did. I looked through the window, and there was.. me. On a medical table. Tubes running from my arms, some red, some clear, some green. All alone in this cold metallic room. A man walked into the room from a deadbolted door on the right side of the room. It was the same man I had seen in the cemetery. He walked up to my body and started inspecting me from head to toe, looking for something.. I dont know what. After he finished his search, he looked up and turned around. And stared at me. Through the window. 
""I am real. You will never be again. This is the reality, and you are trapped inside of your own mind, able to go wherever you wish, do whatever you want. But you will only feel when, or what I allow you to. Your flesh is mine. If I prick out your eyes, I may still allow you to see. But you will feel the empty, cringing pain constantly. If I cut off your leg, you can still walk. But you have to deal with the torture. Forever. Until I end your pathetic little life, which is what it has always been. Pathetic.  You should thank me, actually, for now I've given your life some purpose. You serve me now.""
And this is when I looked back at when I was at the cemetery. Me, Marcus, and Sam. This man touched us on our shoulders, we had all the opportunity to get away, but we didn't.  And by the way, how many arms do YOU have? Two? Or three...",My New Beginning,9

I wake up in a cold sweat, my skin tingling with goosebumps. There is someone standing at the foot of my bed. I try to scream but the sound is stifled by a hand tightly over my mouth. I try to move, but I am being pinned down with a near crushing force. All I feel is pure terror and confusion. There are foreign thoughts in my mind. Reality seems vivid and dark.

The figure at the end of the bed comes into focus. It leans in, the featureless face right in front of mine. I try to scream again. The unseen hand clamps tighter. The being speaks in a slow, whispered voice. I cannot understand a word it's saying, but I can feel what it is trying to convey. Snippets of phrases come into my mind and emotions wash over me. I can feel the creature's disappointment and rage. I can hear the phrase repeated over and over again, ""You will die someday and it will mean nothing.""
It tells me that every soul is horribly alone after death. It tells me that hell is real. It tells me not to waste my existence, because someday I will not even have that.

It reaches a hand towards my face and presses on my forehead with its finger. The pain is unbearable. It feels like my head is shrinking and expanding at the same time. There is a sound louder than I have ever heard and then a silence more pure than in the vacuum of space. The finger presses harder for a split second. I catch a glimpse of the being's face. A lump appears in my throat as a realize who's face I'm looking at. Tears well up in my eyes. It's me. I'm wrinkled and my hair is gray. I look... dead. For a moment I realize something horrible which I cannot quite remember. Then I plunge into unconsciousness.

I wake up at around 11 am. I have experienced sleep paralysis before, but it has never been so disturbing. I am shaken. I write down what I told me. I get some breakfast and play some DOTA, forgetting about the whole thing.

My brother wakes up a few hours after me, and comes into my room to show my a new model he rendered on his laptop. While we're talking, he asks me what's on my face. I'm confused, and go to look in the mirror. What I see chills me to the core and arises bile in my stomach. I am speechless and my eyes water. What I see permanently changes my view of reality.

LittleMM,0,8,1r2ocz,2,"This story happened when I was in college.





My school is in another town so I had to live in student suites by myself.
My family is not rich and since I have a mild heart defect, I always feel weak and don't have enough energy to take a job after class. So in order to release at least some of my parent's financial burden, even though I'm a girl, I always chose the cheapest dorms to live in.





I've been living in four different dorms during my college days, all very old and small, one of them might even be actually haunted, but this story is not about any of them, at least not fully related. It's about something else.





On my way to school there's a juice stand, I always stopped by and buy a big cup of freshly squeezed juice after class. (Oh I forgot to mention, I went to night school and school ends at 10:00 pm.)
Since I buy juice from them almost every day even on my off days, I became quite familiar with the owner and will chit-chat with him while he's making juice for me.





One day when I was waiting for my juice as usual, I noticed that there's something on the ground at the corner of the road not very far from the juice stand.
It's a glass milk bottle with one single yellow flower in it. A five-petal flower with a very short stem and no leaves.
I was curious and asked the juice stand owner: "" Did someone died there? ""
He answered: "" I had the same question but, not that I know of. ""
Since it's not such an unusual thing, I didn't give it too much thought.





But after about two weeks I started to notice something odd.
The milk bottle was still there and the flower kept staying fresh!
But there's not even water in the bottle! It should dry out pretty quick without water.
I took a closer look and confirmed that the flower is not an artificial one.
That means someone's been changing the flowers frequently if not daily!
I got more curious and asked the juice stand owner if he saw anyone came to change the flowers, his answer was no.





It's actually quite sad to really think of it. It's probably someone very dear to the person who brought the flowers that accidentally died there. Maybe by a car crash, or maybe even a murder!
I talked about these wild assumptions carelessly and then I said goodbye to the owner with my fresh juice in hand. 





I went back to the dorm, my room is the first one on second floor, when I was stepping upstairs I could hear two girls chatting and giggling, they're my classmates, we took different classes so we didn't meet at school today, we were supposed to watch horror video in my dorm today and I totally forgot about it! When I reached the second floor I saw them standing in front of my door. The guy living next to me saw them at the entrance and let them in. They love watching horror videos at my place because the creepy environment offers an extra "" ambience.""




"" We were just talking about how creepy your dorm is! "" one of them said with a cheerful tongue.
"" Even this hallway seems haunted, why is it so dim? "" Added by the other.
"" Thanks guys for trashing my lair for me, like it's not a dump already. ""
I smiled.
Then we watched the video together, it's overall just another eventless night.





The next day after school, when I went for my daily juice, to my surprise I found that the bottle of yellow flower was gone. It was still there on my way to school!





"" Did you see who took the flower? "" I asked the owner.
"" That's odd, I didn't notice that it's gone! "" He answered.





I couldn't stop thinking about the yellow flowers on my way back to the dorm, I couldn't explain why I was so obsessed by it, I was so curious about the mysterious person who brought the flowers and why nobody ever saw him/her even when obviously the flowers have been changed so frequently? I was walking carelessly with my mind wandering somewhere else and the next moment a scene stroke me.





The yellow flower! It's there! Near the entrance of the park!
Someone moved it there, but why?
It's not likely that someone died there too, is it?
It's been curiouser and curiouser, but I couldn't think of it anymore.
The mid-term is approaching and I'm only half way done!
Can't waste my parent's money for a bad exam result.
( Yes, some of my classes still give exams. )
Thinking of it, I walked faster across the park.





There's no one in the part except me, and the street lights are so dim, they seemed dimmer than usual. One street light flashed when I walked pass it, I swore towards it: "" Great, now even you're trying to scare me, you asshole! ""
Then I turned back to the road,





That's when I noticed something near the bench about 20 feet ahead of me..... suddenly I felt a chill down to the bone..... the bottle of yellow flower..... why is it there???
Did someone put a bunch of flowers here and there on random spots? Or.....
I had to find out, so I backtracked to the park entrance..... no flower there..... that one was gone. So what does it mean? Someone's moving the bottle around .....for what? And most of all, how did I miss him/her? There's only one way in this small park!





It's not like I could do anything about it so I eventually carried on.
This time, the same bottle of flower appeared again in front of the convenient store right across the street of my dorm.
People were passing by , no one seemed to care, and I thought: "" Why should I? "" It's obviously none of my business.





So I entered the dorm building and went upstairs, but started to think how the bottle of flower seemed to "" followed "" me..... the chills came back, I almost reached the second floor, but I froze at the staircase. My body went all stiff I couldn't move, my pupils probably dilated like a panicking cat!





It's there.





The bottle of yellow flower, sitting there in front of my door.
A hundred thoughts flashed by, "" maybe someone's playing a prank on me, maybe it's a joke, but it's not funny. and by Whom and How??? 
I don't wanna know anymore, I'm moving out of this place! I know it's nothing to do with my dorm, my dorm is fine, it's not haunted, it's not the issue, but whatever!!!"" 





Before I realized, I already ran out of the dorm building and was on the way to my friend's house, and I didn't even remember how I got downstairs.





I couldn't stop mumbling to myself:
""I don't know if it's a prank or not, I don't care, I know there's nothing wrong with my dorm, it's the cheapest but nothing's wrong with it! and what kind of sicko would do such thing to me? Who would it be? Who could have known?
It's not possible 'cause I was pretty sure the dorm was empty that day, it's Saturday and everyone else went home except me! 
.....That cat..... it was an accident, I didn't mean it..... but it's not possible! No one could ever know! 
I don't care, I'm moving out right away. I'm moving out tomorrow!""

Motleigh,1,6,1r09ur,2,"I was about 12 or 13, living in a ranch style house in Southern California, when I had one of the creepiest experiences of my life. I was sleeping in my bedroom with the door slightly ajar. My bed was tucked into one corner of the room. The head of the bed was against the same wall as my closet door. The closet door was a large, sliding mirror. The door to my bedroom, which was an average door, was at the end of my bed. When entering the bedroom, one would have to walk past the end of the bed.

Some time in the night I woke up. I don't know why I woke up and I don't remember anything in particular waking me. The room was lit enough for me to see my bedroom door swing open about a foot. I did not see a person open the door. I did notice something crawl around the end of the bed and crawl up the side of the bed towards the head of the bed.

My first thought was that a dog was coming in, but when the thing reached the closet and slid open the closet door, I was certain it was not a dog. My best description of what I saw is a person crawling on all fours. I saw a dark silhouette, from the corner of my eye, crawl past where I was laying in bed. After the closet door slid open, the mysterious being crawled into the closet and closed the closet door behind itself. I was so terrified that I could not move. I laid frozen from fear on my back, in my bed, until I feel asleep. I was too scared to move or scream. I was awake for about an hour, unable to move, before I dozed off.

The next morning I woke up slightly confused, but I immediately slid open the closet door. I was not as afraid because the sun was shining outside and I felt that if it were going to harm me, it would have done it already. Inside the closet was my usual mess of clothes piled up on the floor. There was no monster or animal in there anymore. I did forget to check under the bed though...

oliviaclaire,0,4,1r09ds,4,"I apologize in advance for the length of this post.

The clock read 12:00. Not unusual for me to be up this late. I sat in my bed watching television and reading my usual horror novels. I, like many of you, are quite into horror and the paranormal. I began to feel hungry, so I sat down my book and began to descend down the stairs to the kitchen. I reached the kitchen and began to search for food. I felt quite uneasy with my back turned to the rest of the room. The feeling of someone watching me soon became overpowering and I had to turn around. That's when I heard it. Tap... Tap... Tap... It sounded like a finger tapping ever so lightly against the window in my kitchen. I was frozen at the sound. Though it was a light noise, compared to the deafening silence of the night, it might as well have been the loudest noise in the world. I shifted my glance to the window only to find... Nothing. I brushed it off and returned to my bedroom. As the night continued to drag on, I felt a growing unease in the pit of my stomach. Like something wasn't just right. I noticed my phone was dying, and reached for the charger plugged into the outlet next to my bed. I then heard something that chilled me to the very bone. Laughter. Very quiet. Very faint. But there none the less. I leaped from my bed and ran downstairs. I reached the living room and turned on the television, struggling to catch my breath and regain rational thought. It could have been anything, right? Eventually, I let the sound of the television push the experience to the back of my mind. Then it came again. Tap.. Tap.. Tap.. Louder this time. I was stricken with panic. I refused to let myself look at the window. 
""Just ignore it and it will go away""
Tap.. Tap.. Tap..
""Ignore it.""
TapTapTap
This went on for 30 minutes at least. It began to drive me crazy. The tapping became incessant. I then did something I haven't done since I was a child. Retreated to my mother's room. I walked in with tears of complete and utter terror streaming down my face. Reluctantly, even though not much of an explanation was given, she allowed me to stay the night in her room. 
I climbed into the bed and began to let sleep take me. I felt safer in the comfort of my mother's room. Then, just as my eyes began to feel too heavy to keep open, I heard it once again. Closer this time.

LittleMM,6,12,1qzq8k,3,"Hi everyone! :)

I'm from Taiwan and I'm new to this community, I want to share with you a small event that happened to me just a few days ago.

Some might say it's not scary at all, but since it's 100% real and it really is kind of odd, (at least to me! ) I decided to share it with you anyway.

So here it is:

I was surfing the internet trying to find some information as reference for a game I'm making, one thing leads to another, somehow I ended up on a topic: "" School Shooting.""

I have an impression in mind that these incidents happened a lot the last few years, mostly in the US, but I know very little about them because they're mostly only short news on TV. ( I live in Taiwan. )
I decided to find out a little more, thinking there could be interesting stuff I can put into my game, so I looked it up on Wiki.
I found a list of the incidents there, information of Name, Location, Date... etc.

Then, something caught my eyes. 
I noticed that there are two incidents took place in Finland.
Since I always have the best impression for this country, maybe even a little overrated, it surprised me that anyone who lives there could commit such crime... ( Guess shit happens EVERYWHERE after all lol )
It also mentioned how one of the killers uploaded a Youtube video predicting the crime he's about to commit the day after.

Being curious, I decided to take a look at that video. Surprised that it's still on the website, shouldn't they take it down?
Anyway, I tuned in and it's about to start, but suddenly a thought crossed my mind..... "" Should I really watch this? "" because there's no doubt that it contains some evil intention in it, do I really want to get in touch with that? It's just a thought within a second and I quickly decided to close the tab, I placed the cursor on the "" cross "" but before I had the chance to close it, the screen flashed and turned dark all of a sudden---

My computer just rebooted itself!

I hopped up a little from my chair, literally "" jump scared, "" thinking about how my computer NEVER, EVER rebooted itself like this before, not once! and I've had it for a long time!

So what happened?

I don't know, maybe there's a virus attached to that video and my anti-virus program shut the system down to protect it, ( I don't even know if it works this way, I have no idea! lol )
Or maybe my computer is just so loyal to me it protects me from anything evil lol

I would probably never know the reason, but I'm quite sure about one thing - I'd never try to get contact with an evil mind EVER AGAIN!

If you have read this far, thank you for bearing with me my non-perfect English.

I wish you all well and safe! :)

willbo360,2,4,1qvttm,3,"First post: [My memory](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qixjf/demonic_glass_head/)

I have heard the advice in the comments of my first post, and I simply don't know exactly what to do except avoid the head. I wish I could throw it in a fucking volcano. I will update this file every once in a while, and post the document when I have gotten rid of the head or written enough. This is **monday**.
___

This is **Tuesday**. I approached the head to take some pictures. They turned out alright, but won't upload to my computer. It says they are corrupted. I will try to find another way to photograph it. The head stayed still today.
___

This is **Wednesday**. I picked the head up. I could feel electricity and heard the buzz of static. I put the head down. I thought I saw it move, and I stared for 10 minutes. It shifted once, and I instantly felt sick. I ran upstairs to my room but could feel something ominous following me. I think it's still here.
___
This is Wednesday night/thursday morning, around 3 am. I woke up about an hour ago with sleep paralysis. There was something in my bed with me. Although that's just the usual sleep paralysis symptom, it seemed different this time. I could move again after 15 minutes or so.
What I think woke me up were the knocks on my wall in clusters of 3. They happen sometimes and I wasn't usually scared until tonight, when I realized they may be linked to the head in some way. The knocks persisted after I got up, so I put on some Jefferson Airplane. That always calms me down. There were strange noises at my window. I am not sleeping until the sun rises.
___

This is **Thursday**. I have not slept. I have not gone downstairs. But I will soon. I am hungry. The sun is up and I feel less creeped out, anyways. I have to pass the head when I go down there. I am scared out of my mind about what I'm about to do, but I've got to try *something*...

I brought it into my basement and put it near my water heater. The electricity tickled my hands as I carried it, even though I used oven mitts. I brought a clove of garlic with me, and placed the head over it (that's supposed to weaken demons I guess). When I put the garlic in it, I immediately heard a crackle and saw sparks shoot to the metal of my water heater. Then the room started to smell REALLY bad, like sulfur. I heard a high pitched hiss, almost a scream. Sparks hit the garlic. I don't really know how to describe what happened next. The garlic was just gone. The smell stopped. The hissing stopped. All of this happened in a split second. I had half expected nothing to happen, and was so startled that I ran into the wall. The panic that had overcome me had also apparently rendered me retarded. I hit my face hard against brick, blood splattering everywhere. My fucking nose is broken now. I went upstairs after that, leaving a trail of blood and presumably fear-piss. I feel like I'm shivering and I'm filled with adrenaline. I'm crying (in a manly way). I need a to lie down. I'll try and do something to break Glasshead tomorrow.
___

This is **Friday**. I am blank. I think it's shock. It has been a long day. I woke up and realized my bed smelled like garlic. The clove was under my pillow, soaked in my own blood. I freaked out and went to the basement with a hefty crowbar. All of my bloodstains were gone, except for a circle of blood where the rim of the head had previously rested. It looked like a vampire had forgotten to use a coaster. I think the head collected my blood inside of it somehow. That seems impossible. So is teleporting garlic. And teleporting glass demon heads.
I drifted through my day in fear of the head showing up. It finally did around 4.
I have a 10 week old kitten named Indie. I love Indie more than anything. I walked into my room, and Indie was on the table, barely moving, suffocating inside the glass head. I was consumed with rage and disgust at the evil thing. I brought Indie to safety and threw the head out of my third story window. I never heard it hit the ground. Luckily, indie is fine. On the other hand, I don't know when the head will show up again and now I know that it wants to hurt the things I love.
___
This is late friday night. I heard my windows all smash at once, right after I closed my eyes to go to sleep. I panicked and hid under my covers like most of you would totally do. I finally got up after convincing myself to not be such a pussy. I checked, and my windows were somehow fine. But I really know that I heard it. A cacophonous crash, glass flying everywhere, tinkling to the ground in my room. But nothing to show. One of my storm windows is missing, however. I am going back to sleep as the only other strange thing happening is the knocking on my ceiling.
___

This is **Saturday** morning. I went out to check where I threw the glass head, and found my storm window shattered on the ground, with a few drops of blood. Hopefully my blood. My father yelled at me for breaking the window and told me to try my best to fix it. I never tell my dad about the head or anything because I don't like to see him look scared. So I just went in the carriage house (garage, I guess. Hasn't been used for carriages for almost 100 years) and went to work piecing it back together. It wasn't too badly shattered, just a few pieces. But when I put them all back in place, there was a piece missing. The empty space formed a very specific looking shape, like an X or a cross. That creeped my out.
___

This is **Sunday**. Nothing has happened today. I hope to god this is over. I will post this soon.
 
p.s.
I fear that I may encounter Glasshead in the future as it doesn't seem to stay broken. Does anyone know a sure way to destroy something like this? Or just to make it feel a LOT of pain? It hurt my cat. I want Glasshead to suffer.

MischievousPasta,0,5,1qvcx1,2,"“I just can’t anymore, I am nothing, I am too far gone.”. My crude goodbye was interrupted by the hitch in my breath from the building pressure in my index finger.
“One more squeeze and you’re free. You can even be romantic and shoot your poor broken heart you pathetic piece of shit”
… Blast
There is only black, not just closing your eyes and having a little bit of light peeking through your thin delicate eyelids, but pure darkness. Just darkness… Hours and hours of darkness. My body was just numb and it really wasn’t bad. You may think it was just terrifying being like that but oddly enough, I enjoyed my time being dead. Time is hard to understand when you don’t see the sun rise and set, or a conveniently placed clock that was in your room is not in your sight. So those hours become days, and eventually it felt like a century of just floating there in darkness, until I felt a thump. My whole body felt like it had fallen out of the sky and landed on the ground, strange though there were bars surrounding the sides of my body. Then, my back was raised and I was propped up. Very uncomfortably of course.
“What the hell is going on?”
I could never forget that feeling, my eyelids… opening. I was blinded. White light seeped into my eyes and eventually into the back of my head. There was this woman who stood in front of me. My body was still positioned awkwardly but I could only see her. She was beautiful… everything about her really. She had that strange super light brown hair that seemed blonde that I was cursed with. It didn’t really fit me well so I always dyed it. Her eyes were muddy brown and showed a grief-stricken face. Her petite mouth showed a scar on her bottom lip that her lipstick failed to cover up.
“Who are you?”
“That isn’t what matters right now, but listen to me you have to pull through.”
“What are you talking a-”
“Listen god damnit wake up, you don’t want to do this!”
“Do what?” I was getting angry getting screamed at by this bitch.
“Die!”
I can’t really describe what happened next but I felt my body, every-single-inch. I was shaking and literally flailing things I didn’t even think was possible. I was soon gasping, it felt like I was drowning. Soon, I felt air sweep into me.
Light… even brighter than before. Everything was blurry, there was… beeping?
Christ...
I saw my disgusting step mother, sobbing in the most ridiculous and fake way. Bitch never gave me a break about my grades, my shitty friends, my drinking, pretty much everything I did. There were three doctors standing over me, one holding a defibrillator, the other putting pressure on my bottom rib.
Wow I fucking missed? I need to fix my shot.
The last doctor was trying to calm down that piece of shit woman who actually didn’t give a damn about me. I chose a good time to try to off myself, my dad was out of town on business. I would hate to see him in the ambulance with us.
“The bullet just skimmed passed the liver, She has lost a lot of blood but if she gets a transfusion in time we can probably stitch her up and fix up the internal bleeding as well. She is a very lucky girl Mrs. Scott, never seen any attempted suicide like this.”
“Thank you doctor! She is blessed to have you guys helping her.”
If I could just vomit right now I would, fed up with all of her shit…
Then it hit me… I looked at the gurnee and I was propped up just like before, I grabbed the stainless steel plate next to me and held it up to my face. My reflection spoke for itself, Damn I was a mess. I saw blood running down my bottom lip, I had to ask.
“How did I cut my lip?”
The doctor holding gauze on my wound looked at me with the most hilariously confused face ever.
“There is a giant bleeding wound in your gut and you are worried about your lip?”
“I know what happened to my gut but I don’t know what happened to my lip.”
“Well if you must  know, you were a pain to get on the gurnee because your lip was caught on a nail that kept the floor boards in your room still. I don’t mean to ruin your night, but it may leave a scar. So will your stomach but that doesn’t matter right? Oh and I wiped a bit of your lipstick off there when ripping it off the nail. It’s a very nice color, It’s sexy on you” He smiled and rubbed my leg with his free hand.

With every gush of wind, it guided them on their path, in swirls and steady patterns, across the warm, Spring sky.


Five year old Eilah skipped and bounced at the door in excitement.
“Daddy, we’re going to be late, Daddy! Let’s go, lets go, lets go!” She urged, dancing around. She was already immaculately dressed and clean with the sudden incentive of impending fun. Eilah grew impatient at the sheer inconvenience of the rest of her “slow-poke” family. Couldn’t they just get it together? It’s the carnival today, she thought.
EIlah’s father, Elliot, carried her little brother down the stairs while juggling a pair of socks, clothes and a frothing toothbrush still clenched between his pearly whites.


“I’m cmmoming!” He spluttered, tripping over some musical toys that were strewn across the floor directly in his path below the stairs.
Popping Casper down in the colourful play centre, he jogged across to the kitchen sink of their small, open plan apartment and washed out the paste from his now minty-clean mouth.
“Have patience Eilah,” he mentioned, sternly, “The show doesn’t start for an hour, sweetheart.”


Eventually, through a midst of dressing, brushing, tieing laces and combing hair. The small family trio were packed into the car and on their way.


Eilah propped herself up eagerly at the window and watched in awe as they slowly left the bustle of the city traffic. Before long, she could see the lush, blossoming trees and green hilly fields fly by as they continued on their journey to the big day. She’d been so excited for this, more than she’d been in a long time. Happier than she’d been since her mother had left them.


Elliot glanced back at his smiling cherub and wriggling baby in the back. The two sweetest things in his life. They meant everything to him. How Casper had grown from the day they’d first met.
As they drifted along the country roads, meditative and calming in nature, Elliot thought back to when it had all spiralled down.
Eilah had been in nothing but a bulging, wet nappy, toddling around in the mud of the backyard unattended. Casper, being barely eight months old was screaming frantically in his cot. Elliot couldn’t tell how long it had been, but Casper was soiled and distraight, with a rash beginning to form on his small, fair bottom.


“Where the H*** are you, Lara!!!” He screamed, choking on his own words and stabbing hurt from what he’d just found. There was no answer. Nothing. So he searched the house.
She lay unconcious, naked in a cold bathtub. Next to the tub, a smashed bottle of tequila sat dormant on the muddy tiles. Lara was barely breathing.


Elliot peered back into his small little girls innocent eyes as she gazed out of the window at the passing meadows. Today, for once, It was almost as if it had never happened.
“We’re nearly there!” He chirped as her eyes grew wide with anticipation.


Casper babbled and waggled his feet as they pulled into the dirt car park of the carnival by the lake. Colourful rides swung, spun and bounced with lights and children with fluffy fairy floss giggling around them in glee and fascination. Eilah jumped against the window, bursting to run out to the crowds and see everything at once. So much excitement. So little time in one day.


“Stay by my side, OK?” Elliot warned her as he held the wriggly little girls hand tightly and pulled her small brother out of his car seat.
“Ok Daddy!” She squeaked as she danced on the spot, impatiently waiting to get a move on to the swirling, musical games rides and stalls.


Off they went together, for a day full of fun. To forget their worries and make nice memories as a loving, happy family.
If only they knew what Eilah were to dicover that very day. A surreal surprise waited to be found, slowly drifting in the lake by the golden carousel.


Part two will be put up on my blog shortly :)

psychopathic_rhino,1,4,1qun8p,3,"I woke up Saturday morning to the sun hitting my face through the blinds like I always do on the weekends. I moved down in my bed to get my eyes out of the sun and reached for my cell phone. It was 8:45 AM and there was only one text message from my cell phone company informing me that all my data and minutes had been used up. Perfect. My family has an everything shared plan and I knew that it was my mom and brother that used everything up. I went to browse reddit when I remembered an email last week from my dorm managers saying they were working on the WiFi this weekend. Guess I wasn't using my phone at all then. 

After a disgruntled sigh, I rolled out of bed and grabbed my towel. I usually grab my clothes for the day so I can get dressed in the bathroom, but this weekend my roommate had gone home so I took the opportunity of freedom and didn't bother. After I showered I walked into my dorm and got dressed. The time was 9:15, which was odd. One of my suitemates (the people my roommate and I share a bathroom with) always comes back from working out at 9:00 and takes a shower immediately and if it's being used he knocks and demands that you hurry up. Every single morning. He's kind of a dick. Anyway, I just assumed he had slept in or took a longer work out even if it was out of his character.

My stomach started churning with hunger so I grabbed my wallet and decided to head down to the cafeteria and grab a breakfast burrito before starting on writing my music. I consider myself an amateur composer for symphonic bands and I was working on a piece. As I walked down the hall of my dorm, I noticed that it was completely silent and not a single person was in sight. It was an ominous feeling at first but then I recalled that it was the first weekend that we didn't have a home football game, so everyone was probably just visiting their families. Nothing out of the ordinary. But, when I arrived at the cafeteria, there was absolutely no one. ""I guess everyone really did leave for the weekend"" I thought to myself. Our dorm had a new automated food dispensing system so I wasn't surprised that there were no workers either. They were only there if the computer or conveyor belt crashed.

I got my breakfast burrito and a pint of whole milk and began to walk back to my dorm room. My appetite was killing me so I opened up the burrito and took a bite on my way back. Just my luck. The school was too cheap to cook fresh meal all the time so I was used to leftover food, but this tasted like it had sat out all night without being reheated at all. That seemed low even for them. I decided to cut my losses and toss the burrito and just eat some of the oatmeal I had in my room. I walked up the stairs to the 4th floor and I looked out the window that oversees the entire campus. When I looked out my stomach dropped into my feet. Where were the guards?

Where were the guards?

I should explain. Our school has a military program similar to ROTC and it's a big part of our school. In the center of campus we have a statue that holds the heart of our school. All through the school year two cadets from the military program are always guarding the statue from vandals. Always. They rotate frequently but there are always guards there. 

Always. 

Where were the guards?

My heart began to race as I started running to my room. I don't know what I would do once I got there, but I felt like I needed to be there. As I turned the corner, I stared down the hall and I saw a man. He was a short man, maybe 5'5"", for some reason I couldn't make out any other features, almost like they were always changing. He was wearing a black suit and stood at the end of the hall. Whistling. He was whistling my piece that I was composing, except in a really flat and eerie key. I panicked and shouted ""Who are you? Where is everyone?"" He grinned and started laughing hysterically and looked me in the eyes. ""Gone,"" He stated with a hellish smile. And he began to laugh again. This time harder and raspier. I ran into my room and locked myself in. 

That was last Saturday, I still remain in my room. I've run out of water but I still have enough food for a week so I don’t know how much longer I can live. I found a WiFi router somewhere in the dorm so I am able to get on the internet to post this to try to find an explanation. Not for me, but for the world. I've tried contacting friends near my school to come help even though they have never heard of the school and think I'm crazy. A few have come to help but after they message me that they are here, I never hear from them again. I looked on news sites trying to see if anyone has noticed anything strange. I was reported missing but it appears that my university and anyone who was here just never existed to the outside world. All day and all night I hear the man whistling and laughing 24/7. And whenever I look through my peephole I see his face smiling and looking into the innards of my eyes.",Dorm Life,7
AzraelsRose,1,1,1qt4fa,4,"Just a normal day. Just like any other.

   I had a nice breakfast, just like every other day. Nothing special. I let my dog out after I fed him so that he could do his business; just like I always do. I waited for the 7 O’clock bus at the shitty bus stop near my house. The gum under the seat stirs a certain paranoia in my mind everyday that I’ll find myself with someones chewing residue on my ass. 


  When I finally got to school, I found myself bored as usual. We’re reading The Giver in English which seems rather like an eighth grade project. Anyway, just a normal school day. Nothing special, not even a single new announcement on the P.A.
 

  At least... It was “normal”... Everything happened in the blink of an eye. Like lightning, thundering booms filled the halls. Nobody moved, the whole cafeteria went silent. Nobody knew what to do. Fear swelled in my chest, a horrible gut-wrenching fear. I didn’t recognize these noises, but the screams from outside were clear as day. Hot tears filled my eyes.
 

  In a horrid flash of thunderous clashing, we all realized the morbid reality of the situation. Any curiosity we had was quickly put to rest as bullets shattered the internally-wired windows on the doors of the cafeteria. Glass flew across the closest rows, slicing the poor victims in range. Some dropped unmoving to the ground. Bullets and glass ripped at any exposed flesh it could find, freeing the warm blood from the suffering persons in the immediate range. 
 

  At least their pain ended quickly. The friends surrounding had to watch as they were coated in a thick film of the red, unforgiving liquid which once held the life of those they loved. The suffered expressions on their faces screamed silently, but spoke much louder than their deafening cries.
 

  You’d think we would have run to the doors to escape from the madness inside. Maybe it could have been like a movie where the guys teamwork to save the day. Instead, warm tears tickled our cheeks and debilitated our eye sight.
 

  We all sat quietly in shock, unsure of what to do. Sharp foot steps echoed through the dead air. I waited for something to direct me. I wanted to see some kind of authority figure enter and tell us everything will be okay. I wished desperately to be able to blindly follow something and succumb to the beautiful lies of safety.
 

  Instead, I greeted by a terribly placid face of the twisted and broken man who reaped the souls of the newly deceased before me. A serious yet indifferent face worn by someone who I recognized as the football teams former patsy. I saw him being beaten yesterday on the hood of a car. I saw him most days in period 4. I even saw him in period four yesterday, but he left and didn’t come back.


  There seemed to be something different, a certain hate filled his glossy eyes. Not particularly new, just intense. Those hateful eyes swept across the room, followed by the muzzle of his machine pistol, until he found the senior football teams captain.
 
  He commanded him to get on his knees, look at the ground and beg for forgiveness. When he’d heard enough, he planted a single, unforgiving piece of lead in his skull. He didn’t seem to feel anything. He killed as casually as one might spread peanut butter over their bread.
 

  He calmly walked over the bodies, his shoes making sickening noises in the blood. He resembled someone who might break at any minute, we were in the eye of the storm. The lethally calming silence was broken only by the grotesque sloshing of the scarlet pool. 


  He sat on a table, drawing a snub nosed pistol, and started reading to himself. He occasionally looked up if someone made a noise. If they didn’t find silence immediately, they lost their life. It became apparent that if we broke silence, if we took took away the quiet, he took away our lives.
 

  I noticed how he seemed to be armed to the teeth with ammo and weapons. He had one fragmentation grenade as well, seemingly home made. I can’t help but think that one is scarier than multiple. All I knew is that one group was going to die, and it could include me. Then again, perhaps it wouldn’t be I who accepted the bittersweet embrace of the ferry man of the dead. There was no way of telling.
 

  We sat for around forty minutes before anything happened. I wonder if he simply enjoyed having something else bend to his will for once, instead of the other way around. He must have planned everything out very well, for I assumed he hit the office first. Taking out communication would certainly help; but surely someone would make it there to call for help.
 
  When the sirens started wailing, he took great pleasure in offing someone to the beat of the wail. Casually changing the magazine of his gun, he chose different targets. Chests, knees, shins, shoulders, whatever was exposed that could cause intense pain.
 

  He suddenly stopped moving beside a popular groups table; a group of the easy girls and horny, stupid guys. Moving his muzzle from person to person until he found a pregnant girl. Lacking any remorse, he promptly shot her in the stomach. Her blood covered the floor, as well as her fragmented organs. Hell, it could have been bits of her fucking baby. Nothing was left intact, just bits and pieces. It’s amazing how much blood our bodies hold.
 

 More echoing footsteps filled the hallways. Christ, seemed like years since I’d last heard that. A good number of body armor clad police officers stormed into the giant coffin; they pointed their weapons at the twisted man who stood among the crowd. He calmy placed his weapons on the table, hid his hands behind and moved towards the  center of the room. The police told him to bring his hands up, and he did. So why was he wearing such a mischievous smile? 
 

  As soon as I noticed the pin around his middle finger, I pulled the nearest person in front of me. So unfortunate that it happened to be my dearest friend, Andrew. The explosion killed anyone in the immediate range, and the shrapnel eviscerated many of the unfortunate surrounding. Too bad Andrew had to be one of them; how could I be so selfish?
 

They found this note on the killer:
 

*One day I will make everyone pay for what they did, mocking me day after day and making my life a living HELL, their screams will fill these empty halls along with the sound of gunfire and my name will become a household name just like Eric and Dylan. I will finally be known for something, I WILL have a purpose! I won’t just be that awkward kid who you mock anymore. I will die with a smile on my face, knowing I will be remembered! My name will be burned into the hearts of those who hear my story. They will remember me, Richard DePute.*
 
 
 If only someone had just taken the time to care for this guy. Hell, I could have been there for him, a simple friend might have prevented this horrid event. The only thing that will be burned into our hearts is the grotesque sound of the dying, the ear-splitting screams and the memories of the ones we’ve lost. ",A Purpose,5
Dayinisdope,2,4,1qstwq,3,"I work at a small locally owned restaurant, we close at 11pm, on weekends we have 2 people closing the restaurant. Its probably around 10:30 maybe 11:00pm, It was super slow that night, so all I really had to do was lock the door. My co-worker was my ride home so he was still there with me. I turned off all the lights and locked the door. I had to use the bathroom quick. You need to know the history behind the building first. It was built in the early 1900's, it housed a meat market, a hotel (we are pretty sure there was a secret brothel run out of the hotel), a pawn shop, a coin shop, our restaurant open in 1921 and is the oldest continuously running restaurant in my city, needless to say there is a lot of history in the building. Today the building houses an amazing coffee shop, an old fashioned candy shop, a lawn care business, 2 apartments, 3 offices, and a conference room. We all share bathrooms. The bathroom is in the back, connected to all the business by a hall way and/ or stairs. I run to the bathroom, yes I literally ran to the bathroom, I get creeped out when I'm there at night. I'm in the middle of doing my business in the bathroom, when the stall door next to me slams shut. I ran out of the bathroom, down the hall, back to the restaurant. My co-worker was also flipping out. He asked ""WHAT WAS THAT?!?!?!?!?"" I yelled at him ""I HAVE NO IDEA! The stall door slammed shut!!"". My co-worker finds ghost absolutely fascinating. He asked me if I thought it was a ghost, I told him I had no idea, i just wanted to get out of here. ""Wait"" he said ""I want to check something"". He started to take pictures randomly, all over the restaurant. He stating flipping out ""LOOK AT THIS!!!"" He had taken a picture standing in the kitchen door way, facing our grill. In this picture was a clear as day (Mind you all the lighting we had was the flash from his camera phone.) was a face on the wall behind the grill. My co-worker asked the face in the picture ""If your really there show us a physical sign. Do something to make me believe you are real!"". Nothing happened, I figured it was just some weird flash reflection. I told him I had to get home cause I had to work early in the morning. We left the restaurant, he dropped me off at home. I did not really think to much about it, after I got home. Then, My co-worker sent me a picture, that his roommate took of his back. There were HUGE scratches on it, he said ""I totally do not remember getting hurt! This is super weird!!!!, I think that when i asked for physical evidence that it was there, it showed me... it showed me real good."". I was scared.. I had to open up the place tomorrow!! I did not want to be there alone, I'm a cook in the morning, so the kitchen (where the scary picture was taken, and where my co-worker got scratched!!). Like a champ, I toughed it out and opened the kitchen. Every thing was fine and has been since it happened last Friday.",I was at work when....,7
Captain_Ross,2,2,1qsrl9,3,"I don’t live at home anymore. 


I’m from a small town -- nothing really happens there. Except rape. I moved out to go to university recently. God, I really needed to. I would have gone insane otherwise. Every couple of weeks I come back home. See the family; see some friends. I do miss them. 


Anyway, I was invited to a party the night I was back.


I got there. It was nice. Got pissed on some Jager with some old friends. Standard. It was all fairly normal until about 11:30. 


Four of us walked this girl home. Halfway there, the other girl who was with us wanted to return to the party. (We’ll call her Rose for anonymity’s sake) She just turned around and started walking the other way. I mean, who does that? We were two minutes away. 


I felt like I should go back with her. Honestly, I did. But at the same time, I didn’t. I stood there ripped between the two. My good friend stepped up. He said he’d go back with her. 


Good. Thanks, man. At least she’ll get back safe…


My friend returned a few minutes later. Rose didn’t want anyone with her. She kept shouting at him so he left. We dropped the girl off at her home and proceeded to walk back to the party. 


We were a few minutes away when my friend decided to phone someone there. He asked if Rose got back okay. 


Rose wasn’t there.


I checked my phone:

1 Missed call: Rose  
 
Shit.


I phoned her. It began to rain heavily. Like, really heavy. It came on in an instant, the sky spitting down on me. 


“Rose, where are you?” 

Fucking rain. I couldn’t hear her. 

“Where the fuck are you?!”

“Woods.” 

She hung up.


Shit! This confused me. Woods? There aren’t any woods around here. 

Before that phone call, I don’t think I’d ever heard genuine fear in someone’s voice.


One of my friends needed to return to the party, the other stayed. He called her this time. She answered.  

I stood there listening to everything my friend said. The rain continued to spit on me. 

My friend asked her where she was... Tesco now.

Then he said the thing that I will never forget:

“Three guys are following you?”


I ran so fucking fast.  

Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck FUCK! 

She was about to be raped. 

FUUUUUUUUUCK


I ran past a lady walking her dog. She looked frightened. Not as frightened as I was.


I turned the corner into Tesco. There was a figure standing hunched over, weeping. They were alone. They turned around, revealing their face. It was Rose. 


I asked what happened. She didn’t say anything, but I saw her arm. She had a deep bite mark in her left wrist.  She said they had corned her; she said they had touched her; she said they had bit her. They ran away when she began to scream. 


Fuck. I was angry. Fuck. My friend caught up and we walked her back to the party. The things she said on the way, I cannot repeat. About her dad… that she was used to it. Fuck. Why did she have to say that?


We walked back in near silence. 


We returned. She drank herself to death. She told her friends what happened and they didn’t believe it. Literally… they didn’t believe it. 


They said she had done this before. They said to look at the bite mark again; the front teeth were on the outside as if she had bitten herself. They said she was a liar.


I defended her the whole night. No one would lie about that. No one. 


At about 3 o’ clock, she wanted to leave, to walk to Tesco where her sister was picking her up. Alone. As if the rest of the night hadn’t happened. I wouldn’t let her. I tried to walk with her but she shouted abuse at me. Just like she had done with my friend. I understood why he left. But I couldn’t leave. After pretending to go back, I followed her from about 30 metres behind.


I felt like a rapist. 


She saw me still following and, in an instant, changed her manner. She became sweet. She said sorry. We walked to Tesco, waiting for her sister. 


We saw the car. Rose looked at me, waited till the car was close, and whispered in my ear “I’m such a bad person.” She tried to kiss me.


What the fuck? Really? In front of your SISTER?  Tonight?


Her sister gave me an awkward lift back to the party. I returned to a party that was passed out. Everyone was on 
a down. This wasn’t the end though…


My friend passed me his phone. He had received a text. Look at this:


“Haha totally love making stuff up… it's my favourite past time” – Rose

I understand this isn’t the conventional nosleep story – no paranormal, no ghosts, nothing even scary. But this frightened me; in more ways than one. Please, if anything, take away this: 


Never let your friend walk home alone. All of this could have been avoided if I had the strength to go back with her in the first place. Regardless of whether she lied, I couldn't live with myself if she had been raped.

Blue_falcon19,3,1,1qsg2b,4,"My reoccurring figure started when I was three. I had a mom that would always tuck me in. One night I woke up &amp; found myself under my bed. Three year old me thought nothing of it &amp; got back in my bed. Ever since then I would see black hands coming up from my bed. Always felt like I was being chased when I walked out of my room to go to the kitchen. So not creepy stuff. Just a lot of nightmares. Creepy and dark nightmares. Again, nothing special about my story yet. It all changed though when I hit my freshman year of high school. The dream was seventh grade me on my bed talking to a black smoke on my ceiling. ""What do we do now?"" All of a sudden there was a force holding my down, I couldn't breathe. These big yellow eyes (not talking yellow iris') was all I could see and the most demonic voice I've ever heard ""what needed to be did is done."" I was fighting to breathe &amp; just kept staring into its eyes. Finally woke up and was stiff &amp; in a cold sweat. That night was the start of my sleep paralysis. Every nightmare was me being attacked. And it was the same black figure. Except it got bigger &amp; bigger. Stronger too. One dream when it attacked me-it was HUGE and I actually heard it growl as it lashed at me. Recently, my dream was a man and his two dogs. He was talking to me and then he stopped and said, ""oh oh oh no."" And then it went dark. Him &amp; the dogs closed their eyes. They didn't want to see what was behind me. I kept asking, ""What? What?"" My heart pounded asking him.
Reason why I'm telling you all this is because I want opinions. People say its just sleep paralysis and some people say I may have a demon. Or it's symbolism. But, this thing has tormented my head. This thing has also tried to rape me (woke up scared and found my hands covering my crotch; remember feeling like I was being violated before I woke up).

ChainerSummons,0,6,1r79o3,2,"First, allow me to assure you that I am certain of my sanity and of my cognitive abilities. My name is Zachary Wilhelm.

My logic- whether it is flawed or otherwise, leads me to believe that each person knows fear. Viewing these fears in those I observe shows that it is safe to say that each person has rooted, elemental fears.

More accurately, we are afraid of the unknown within the dark, or more commonly the uncertainty of the future or that of death and what lies beyond.

It is said by some that at one point such irrational fear was more than a leftover disposition from the dawn of mankind. I believe that this collection of fears served our ancestors well, and that they continue to serve us.

I assure you, this phobia is not some obsolete racial trigger. We need this now as much as ever.

There are some of us, maybe even a few of you reading this, who are aware of the presence of the unseen. Aware that existence continues in darkness and that it is possible for that existence to expand beyond our initial perception. Maybe, like me, you feel a pressure in your head and hear a light, squeaking ring just barely audible to you, whispering that the world has changed around you. Others I have met and spoken to say that their first sign of these dangers is a smell of ozone, as if a massive electrical charge had been displaced nearby, rending the air.

I would speculate that we all feel these things from time to time in some form or another, but that it does not register on our conscious level. For those of us that have this sense, that unease may be keeping us intact and connected to the world we know. 

Ask yourself how it is possible in such a modern age of technology and advancement to simply disappear when we interact with so many people on a daily basis. Every day, more people just seem to cease to be. Sure, some... Hell, I'll be generous- MOST of the missing are eventually found either dead, alive, or however they may be found. We'll give it a nice big optimistic percentage of 80%. These pretenses seem solid, even hopeful. Four of five isn't bad at all, right?

What about the other one in five who blinks out of existence, never to return? Every town has that ""One in five"" disappearance that is just... gone- simply gone. It's as if the mist just swallowed them right up, isn't it?

This is just so. That is exactly what is happening. All these obscuring veils appear naturally throughout the world, with no exception. Every continent, nation, town, village... And they are created under predictable and natural conditions. Certainly there is no harm in the morning mists, but have you ever seen fog when the air was too dry and cool to hold it aloft and reason dictates it should simply not be? 

Within these otherworldly variations of nature, the world around you may slip away, and everything outside your vision ceases to be. Sound and light fall away, and you stand utterly isolated in your waning bubble of perception. You may have felt this, as I have. I would prefer to think we all have, but may have suppressed our  fearful senses.

These veils are like the curtains of a stage; heavy and thick and not meant to be crossed by us, the audience. Behind them lies the workings of our world and what may lie further beyond them still- into the epitome of our concept of the unknown or unknowable.

This is a hard truth to understand, but I will the help of keys and locks alike. I have Trackin, Trace, Sapphire, Teraha, and multiple Opal keys, but we need more power to rid of the forbidden lock.

dylan96r,7,2,1r10o8,3,"This all happened about 8 or 9 years ago. I was probably around 9 years old. This was when I still somewhat believed in Santa Clause. I'm not saying I believed it, but I didn't not believe in him either. I think I liked the idea of Santa Clause more than the fact that some guy came into my house in the middle of the night.  I grew up in a pretty cool family. They wanted my brother and I to stay 'innocent' as long as they could so they always told us they believed in all that stuff as well. Anyway, every Christmas Eve, we went outside and looked up into the sky to see if we could see Santa. We usually saw nothing, but this one Christmas was different. We had been outside for about ten minutes, seeing nothing but stars. We were getting ready to go inside when I noticed something. It seemed like nothing at first, but then I noticed it was moving. It looked like an illuminated line flying in a zig zag pattern through the night sky. At the time, I figured it was proof that Santa was real. But now that I'm older, I'm starting to wonder what the actual fuck that was. Do shooting stars move in a zig zag pattern? I'll never know.

Well, we had that but our ritual before bedtime wasn't as complicated. He worked late, so I would always be in bed before him.  I would doze off as he came in from working night shifts to have him put his hands over my eyes and whisper, ""Just close your eyes.""

The sun is setting, there's a lens flareish atmosphere, if you will. I'm playing catch with my 10 year old cousin in the backyard. We're throwing the ball back and forth while my dog is desperately trying to jump high enough to reach it, visibly frustrated by now.


""Enough of this."", I think to myself. As I look up and catch the ball for one last time, the setting sun blinds me for a split second. I look back towards my cousin. He's standing there, gazing at me with his finger pointing towards me... through me, rather. The dog is standing next to him, all mouth watery and with his fangs out.


Thump! I fall unconscious to the ground.


I open my eyes ever so slowly. Darkness around me. 


""It's night already. What the hell happened?!"" 


I stand up from the moist ground with an incapacitating headache. Stumbling to the garage door, I open it. As it's opening I see my dog lying on the ground, blood all around it, mutilated. The door slowly rises higher and higher and I see more of it. More of them. More dogs of the same breed equally decimated and the blood and guts are everywhere. I stand there stunned, unable to move.


Panic finally restarts my body and mind.


""Matt! Where are you?! Matt!!!!"", I call for my cousin.


Instead, my brother comes running out of the house through the front door. Stands next to me, equally perplexed as he looks at the horror scene.


Suddenly, Matt comes walking out of the nearby bushes. Wet, dirty, bloody clothes, his chin down to his chest.


""WHAT THE FUCK?! MATT, ARE YOU OK?""


He raises his head, mumbling, to reveal his face. Hundreds of little holes all over it with blood tearing out of them.


A screechy scream behind us as we turn around and see a figure of a bald man with a hat hiding his face and a cape on his back running- no, gliding - towards us in these weird long strides as if he's floating above ground ever so slightly, still screaming and holding a long, thin needle (or pick) in his right hand.


My brother and I start running in separate directions while Matt is just standing where we were, still mumbling something to himself. As I was running away faster than ever before I see the shadowy figure catch up to my brother as he fell down in the little alleyway behind our house, violently and ferociously thrusting the needle into his face.


I stop and turn and run towards him, thinking what I should do to stop the attacker. I run even faster than while running away, tears flowing down my cheeks as I jump and hit the villain with the soles of both of my feet. He stumbles over my brother, who is clearly unconscious by now, before standing up and gliding away with the same long strides down the alleyway. I'm sitting with my legs stretched on the ground pointing towards the blood covered body of my lifeless brother.


""Andy?"", a childs voice behind me says my name.


I turn around. It's Matt.

[My Stalker: Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qibsv/my_stalker/)

So, a part of me thinks I should really start to worry… A picture of this girl showed up on the windshield of my car this past week. No proof it was the same guy I’ve been seeing around town… but I can’t be too sure.

It showed up two days ago, creepy writing on the back and all. She’s cute really, those adorable dimples and deep brown eyes I can only dream my little girl will have one day. I was leaving work and noticed it just before I got in the car. Scribbled on the back was my own little note. ‘Remember her?’ A part of me thought it was the wrong car because this little girl wasn’t one I’d ever seen before, or at least had any reason to remember. I was sure I’d remember full brown eyes like hers. My first instinct was I was the wrong girl, obviously. Until I got the e-mail. I don't often check my e-mail so this was sitting in my inbox for the past month.. 

Same girl, different picture. This time it contained her with a wide smile and a loving mother to hold her up. Her chubby cheeks were as cute as cute could be.The little girl looked so much like the woman I could only assume it was her mother, they looked so happy. Like a vintage hallmark card. 

No message this time, just a picture. 

Odd? Yes. Although nothing has changed with the man, although I haven’t seen him today… haven’t left my house much lately. I took your guys advice and got myself some pepper spray… although I can’t bring myself to alert anyone… I’ve got this sick feeling in my stomach it could only escalate. For now I continue to wait, just wanted to update you guys with the weird shit. Pictures… nothing at my home yet. The e-mail though… I dunno. You guys have any idea what's going on ? I'll upload the picture when I figure out how ! Promise !",My Stalker (Part 2),6
sneakyazn88,0,3,1qw31c,2,"Hey guys dunno how to start this so here goes.

I'm a data tech that works for Optus and i do occasional out of hours call out work where i go to Telstra exchanges and swap faulty dslam cards. 
So, these exchanges are unmanned and everywhere but there are a few that just give me the creeps... like the one in the city on Pier st. 

So one night i get a call out to this particular exchange. It's massive, something like 10 story's high and unmanned.
I go out there park my caddy in the laneway (it's only got one entrance and stretches for like 25 metres.) get my backpack and equipment and enter the building.

Somewhat like ""Get Smart"" i swipe a card and several doors open giving me access, (obviously not on a grand scale as get smart but you get the idea) i sign into the register and swipe myself through the ground floor lift doors and push the button for the lift to level 7.
As i'm waiting for the lift i call up nmcdsl NOC fault teams just to let em know i'm on site and one of the testers answers... he says hi, and i reply hey what's up how've yah been?! All happy chappy like.

I'm in the lift and just got to lvl 7, doors open up and basically as you exit the lifts you enter a massive square lobby about 7 metres wide and something like 4 metres long. 
Double doors on the left side for another room and double doors at the other end of the lobby down a long hallway that spans 3mtrs wide and is about 10 mtrs long. 

It's pitch black and hard to see a thing and all ive got is lighting from my itorch app whilst still on the phone with headphones in one ear.
i walk to the light switches at the back of the lobby just before the hallway/corridor, i flick em on and nothing... so i flick em off an on again in quick succession like i'd get some sort of different result. 
Still nothing and i think nothing of it, but feeling a little weary i tell the tester i'll head to lvl 4 and check that end out first before going back to lvl7. 

I go to lvl 4 check out some equipment (took about 15min) and everything seems to be legit so unfortunately i had to head back up to lvl 7 and so I get into the lift and head for lvl 7. 
As the door opens up to the lobby i notice immediately that the lights are on and i'm like telling the tester everything that's happened thus far... Of course he's pissing himself laughing while i'm just, well... pissing myself.

Being cautious i look around the lobby... nobody in sight...""ok... i think to myself, i should be right..."" i cautiously walk to the light switch at the back of the lobby flicking them off and on again, ""oh yeah now you work!"". 
Making light of what i see i laugh it off with the tester on the phone and make way to the double doors at the end of the hallway. 
So i'm walking and having a yarn with this guy on the phone when i'm almost at the end of the hallway, Swipe card in one hand and ready to buzz in through the doors when for some unknown weird reason... call it intuition, i felt like someone was staring at me from behind. 
I Spin around on my heel only to stare at this black face staring right back at me! it was from the left side of the entrance of the hallway, my heart jumps into my Throat and i'm thinking holy crapbaskets!

So as i stare at this black face staring back at me it pokes further out from the side of the hallway revealing a green collar, and only then did i realize i was holding my breath.
I take another breath and this guy walk out into the hallway, seeing as he was a normal guy i relaxed and laugh and said to him ""man you scarred the bajeebus outa me!"", He replies ""so did you!"" and i'm like ""how?!"" and he says he heard weird voices outa no where and doors opening and closing and lights flickering and stuff and that when he came to look that no one was there.

I said to him i thought he was a ghost! He laughed and he said ""i may not be one but i'm sure there are some around... i hear things and just talk aloud"". 
Just to be sure i asked if there was anyone else in here, however he said that i was the only person here... 
i dunno if he was pulling my leg but that left me thinking uughhh yeahh.... ok i'm gonna do my work... he mentioned he was finished and parted ways.

I swapped the dslam card and everything was up and running after something like 30 min, deciding it'd be an idea to empty my bowls i went took a dump.
As i exit the toilets on level 7 i notice the lights were all off... i wasn't even in the toilets for that long... it was a power s**** and i had left all the lights on... and i knew the other dude was long gone by now 

Thinking on one hand ""man... should have bailed, rather then going to the toilet"" but at the same time i'm glad i did because i'd have soiled myself by now. I grabbed my bag and swiftly got to the elevator an pressed the button.
With my Back to the elevator watching everything about me, senses all keen, I get in the lift and get to the ground floor, signed out, headed for the caddy in the ally way and bailed like no tomorrow.

Driving home i was constantly thinking about what happened and i remember that when i got to site that the place was empty... no other cars, nothing. I also remember that this guy had nothing with him... who goes to an exchange without any tools or equipment at this time of day? Or at least leave whilst holding them on his person. I then remember that i was the only one that had signed into that log book during those hours.

I dunno what to speculate here but i'm just thinking that ain't normal.
I just know i get the tingles up my neck when i go into places like that and i hope i won't have to go back any time soon at something like 1am.",Telstra Exchanges - SFW,5

PapaFedorasSnowden,3,1,1qu464,2,"All I altered was mine and my neighbour's name; here is the story of how I stopped being a skeptic.

And there I was, with my routine mocking of horror movies, watching them for comedy. This week was different, rain poured down from the heavens, flooding the streets, the winds blew swiftly like a falcon, diving from amidst the clouds to catch its prey. All lights were out on that cold night, the coldest of my South Brazilian winter, the glowing blaze from the stone fireplace was the only source of warmth in the whole house, and the last breath of modernity available, my laptop, was used solely for the movie. It was funny, being the skeptic I am, seeing all those daemons, the actors’ eyes, wide open, shivering, not of cold as I was, but of pure ghastliness—the sheer thought of that being real gave me the chuckles—but I will say it, it doesn’t anymore.

I must remark that I was alone, mum was at her boyfriend’s, younger brother, at his friend’s, they had no prospect of coming back until noon of the following day, which for a teenager, meant freedom. Everything was quiet, except for the odd plank gritting, contracting and expanding from the contact of the cold winter air, and the warmth of a fire, tiny sparks threatening to burn everything down, but cowering whenever the chance to  spread a fire was had. A sound could be heard, coming from the large wooden door, at the front of the brick covered house we inhabited, it was our new neighbour, Mortimer. Mort, as he insisted I called him, was a tall, dark, almost blue, man of Egyptian descent, to where could easily confuse him for Anubis, however, on that gloom all that could be seen from him was his eyes and bright teeth. “Sorry to bother you, but you don’t happen to have a candle, do you?” His deep voice scratched my ear. His voice matched his body and face perfectly, but it made it impossible for him to sound friendly. “I think I might have one or two,” I replied, reluctant, “come in while I get it; should take just one minute,” I continued, still not sure if that was the case. Mort had this thing, where he’d follow you around, and while he barely fit through the door, his steps, like his breathing, were impossible to perceive. 

I went through the living room, took a left past my old grandpa’s clock, now marking 12:07a.m. followed by a right, careful not to hit the chinaware, into the kitchen. As I always do, I reached for the light, and when I switched it, a strong white light shone in front of me; I saw a jackal, staring into my eyes, and I stared into his, those dark eyes, whatever went in there, never came out, it looked like the passageway to another life. “It can’t be that, I thought, none of this exists, I am just tired,” was my last thought, until the shadows took over the light, Mortimer stood there, while my stupor self watched the dark kitchen blankly. I shook my head, “I’m such a clever boy,” I uttered  while I flipped the switch back off. Going further in the kitchen, I find the drawer where we stored candles for this typo of occasion, I reached for one, grabbed it and turned to what appeared to be floating eyes and smile, saying “here you go, wanna light it already?”  I grabbed a match scratched the box and took it to the wick. As soon as the candle was lit, I heard a loud crack, followed by a scream; the man who once stood in front of me was nowhere to be seen. I called for him, while a ghastly shiver went from the tip of my toes to the last of my hairs. Now out of the kitchen, I looked at the clock, 2a.m. “what had I been doing for so long?” I thought. With my heart up my throat, being as silent as possible, I creep around the corner, I see the same jackal, now behind the fire, with a grin. As the fire fades I see Mort asleep in the couch, I go to wake him up, but he is not there. A tingling sensation climbs my right leg, I turn around, nothing to be seen. The tingle is up my waistline now, I am nervous as I had never been, looking frantically for a visual cue, all dark. I decide that I should relight the fire, as I walk towards it, with candle in hand, I trip on a body; I get up and kneel by the body, upon touching it, I realise it is cold, I faint.

“Frank, Frank, wake up,” A soothing feminine voice could be heard saying, as I opened my eyes, confused, people tell me I was in a coma for 5 hours, that I had hit my head or something. I mention Mortimer, “where is he? ouch, my head.” The lady replies “I do not know who you are talking about,” I go on to ask about him. I remember everything so lucidly, but nobody knows what I am saying. They claim to have found me laying on the ground, using a street dog, Jack, as the neighbours called him, as a pillow. To this date I do not know whether I was hallucinating, dreaming, or if something paranormal happened, and to be honest, I am too afraid to find out.

LadyDevastation,2,5,1qsg2e,2,"I would just like to start this off by letting you know I don’t tend to share things too often, but this.. this I couldn’t keep to myself. 

Ever since I was little I've loved anything that was warm to the touch. To this day the comfort of a blanket seems as if it can fend off any danger. Adult me is well aware my flannel sheets won't vanquish intruders or keep away the things that go bump in the night, yet a part of me still clings to the comfort the warmth brings. 

It started about a year ago, the nightmares. I'd wake up in hot sweats with the covers tossed about my queen size bed, my only protection twisted up around me instead of on me. Whenever I woke up I could never remember my dream, merely the mixture of terror and helplessness that came with waking up. Only nightmares could make my stomach churn in such a manner. 

They came suddenly, lacking a reason but seeking a place in my dull life. Being a young woman in the working world gave me very little time to build an interesting life around the mountains of work I was always assigned. 

They'd wake me up and the warmth would lull me back to sleep, they weren't too troubling in the beginning. Until one day I realized I hadn't truly slept in a very long while. 

Falling asleep was never a problem, it was staying asleep. The nightmares were stealing away my slumber. I was a wreck at work, my career was suffering, and I couldn't let that happen. So I started to see a therapist, after I'd worn out all my at home options. 

Trust me, a therapist was my last possible option. I wasn't one to talk about my feelings after all. The first session was a bit awkward, my therapist was a woman in her fifties, speckled greys that were obviously left there to give you the impression she was a wise woman. 

The muted colors and odd paintings didn't add to the negative attitude I had going into it. 

She asked the stereotypical questions, until time was up. Week after week I skidded around the real problem, the nightmares, the feelings I'd wake up to. Until finally I couldn't avoid it, I wanted it fixed... I just wasn't sure sharing would help. Anyways, I finally fessed up to the woman. Something in her face seemed to change, like things finally clicked. 

She started these exercises, sometimes she'd have me close my eyes and imagine things. Or try deep breathing, techniques to get my heart rate down when I did wake up. After that she really started to focus on the nightmares. Since I couldn't remember a damn thing about them we started slow. She had had me close my eyes, hands resting on my neatly crossed legs. She talked to me, slipping me into a state close to sleep. Asking me to let my mind lead me. She started to have me describe what I saw.

Mistake. This was the first mistake

However, I followed her direction and slowly began to describe the darkness around me. That sort of darkness that feels like it could last forever, but a part of you knows it won’t. The kind you’re not sure is hiding the danger from you, or hiding you from it. Still, the uneasiness sets in and all you can do is wait for the light. So I described the thickening darkness and uneasiness that seemed to consume me. That’s when she reminded me to focus on what I could see, not what I was feeling.

So I stopped and took in a slow breath before continuing. Darkness, describing every inch of it. Black. Solid. Slowly it faded and I was staring myself in the face. Pale blue eyes holding a surprised expression, glistening back at me in the mirror that sat in the all consuming darkness. I noticed my neatly placed dark locks and normally ivory skin before even getting the the grotesque creature that hung at my shoulder.

Behind my fairly average image stood a female like creature. I described her to my therapist in great detail, assuming this image was one of my imaginations own design. No part of me alarmed by the odd image that seemed to have been haunting me.

Mistake number two. 

So we ended the session and I left with the knowledge that perhaps my past was haunting me, or at least that’s what my therapist told me. That night I pulled myself under my cover, comforted by it’s warmth in hope that I wouldn’t wake up. But I did. 

I woke up in hot sweats, as usual, the feelings all the same… only I remembered and the memory terrified me. Night after night I remembered, and night after night I kept myself from the peaceful sleep I used to know.

For weeks it consumed me, the image of the woman haunting me. 

Until one night… one night where I found sleep. Or so I thought. 

The morning light was close to breaking the dark morning, but I was up. It was odd, I hadn’t remembered my alarm jolting my slim body awake… yet I was up. I drudged past my bed, foggy vision leading me to my bathroom. I stopped and yawned before my eyes met the image that I refused to believe belonged to me. No longer standing over my shoulder, but staring in me face was the woman that had haunted me. Matted dark locks that slid over my,its, shoulder, cold soulless eyes that lacked the emotion my eyes always held. But the skin was the worse, pale as moonlight and splattered with blood I knew didn’t belong to me.

It was then I broke into tears, my nightmare had no longer stayed covered by slumber but had crawled it’s way into my real life. The dark desires I thought that lived in my head had become my reality. Staring at me was the proof, hands dripping with the blood of another. It covered most of my body, warm and sticky to the touch as my salty tears mixed with the deep color that stained my cheeks.

The disappointment was worse than I had remembered waking up to. I was staring at the face of a murderer, and one who truly enjoyed. The image had belonged to me, there wasn’t a doubt in my mind. With each blink the memories flooded me, overwhelmed me. The screaming pierced my ears through the silence of my bathroom. I cringed as I remembered the face of my less than qualified boss, begging as my hands slid the knife through her still beating chest. The mist across my shirt suggested she had pleaded long after her lungs had flooded with the liquid that was meant to course through her body. Why her? Why not someone without a husband, or two gifted children? I had chosen to kill someone who I knew would be missed, it wasn’t enough to take a life.. I had to ruin some too. 

That twisted mindset crept back as the memories had begun to haunt me.

Remorse, that was the feeling I was missing. While I felt disappointed, I wasn’t convinced it was for my actions… or for my lack of inventiveness. Months of planning in the night had erupted into merely one pool of blood on suburban vinyl flooring. 

Those feelings still haunt me, even here with my orange clad uniform they consume me. Yet, I yearn to hear the screams fill my ear, I ache to hold that knife in my hand. 

But don’t worry, here I stay. One more heartless soul put away, one less person to harm you or your pretty little family. 

They let us use the computers once a week, free time. It’s nice really, gives me the chance to warn you.

Don’t seek to unlock the monsters, let them hide in the dark. Because if you let them out, you might become the nightmare you fear. ",My Own Nightmare,7

JustAnotherLondoner,0,2,1r8zg3,2,"Last year, my brother Steve fell ill and took himself to hospital. He wasn't insanely ill, but due to the fact that he kept fainting and falling into things, he felt the hospital was the safest place for himself to be. After an examination, he was told that an ear infection was causing his balance to be off and him to faint. They kept him in for observation until he stopped fainting and would be safe at home alone. 

He told me that the first night he couldn't sleep. The man in the bed next to him would groan throughout the night in agony. He didn't know what was wrong with him, but it was too late for a nice chat, so he remained silent. 

The second night wasn't much different, but Steve managed to sleep for a few hours, from about 3am until around 10am. He hadn't fainted for a while and felt he was getting a lot better, hoping that he would be able to go home soon.

Later that day, the man in the bed next to him awoke. 

""Hi, I'm Jim."" He introduced himself. ""What are you in for?"". My brother explained his ear infection and that he had fainted and fallen into things, and asked why Jim was here.

""Well..."" He began. ""I don't really know. I was only in here for a broken leg initially. Then I fell ill. I think they're keeping me here.""

""What? How?"" Steve asked. 

""When I was close to recovery, I told the nurses that I felt ready to go home. Later that night, I woke up to see a nurse leaving my bed. She didn't see me, but I noticed that my leg felt funny. I think she did something to it. I don't know what... but the next day I fell terribly ill with pneumonia. This was nearly a week ago, and i'm still here, not getting much better. Don't tell them when you're ready to go home... just go."" His face was dead serious. 

Steve was a bit worried about Jim's story, but assumed he was a bit crazy and paranoid about the nurses. He ignored Steve's advice and told the nurse that he was ready to go home. He felt the disappointed gaze of Jim fall upon him as the nurse walked away.

""Well... Good luck."" Jim sighed. ""I hope they let you out."" 

""Thanks."" Steve replied. The nurse later returned and confirmed that the doctor would look at his ears the following day. 

That night, Steve had another restless night. Jim was groaning again, but Steve was beginning to grow used to that. 

Suddenly the groaning stopped. The silence of the night was instead met with the screams of Jim.

""AARGHH. STOP. GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME. DONT YOU DARE PUT THAT NEEDLE NEAR ME. FUCK OFF!"" the curtain was closed around him. Steve couldn't see what was going on. He was too scared to speak. 

The curtain swiped open. Steve pretended to be asleep, his eyes slightly open. He saw a nurse leave Jim's bed. Jim was laying in his bed, holding his legs. 

""A..Are you okay?"" Steve whispered. ""What the fuck just happened?"" 

""I told you, man. The nurses are keeping me here. They saw that I was getting better again and she just stuck a fucking needle in my leg again. I'm not getting out of here any time soon."" Jim replied. He revealed his leg to Steve - there was a small hole with blood dripping out of it. He had indeed been injected with something. 

Steve laid down in shock. Jim decided that now the attack was over, it was safe to sleep. 

When Steve awoke the following morning, Jim was gone. Steve asked a nurse where Jim was, and the nurse apologetically replied 

""Mr Morris passed away late last night"". How could that be? He was well enough to hold a conversation with Steve just hours earlier to his apparent death. The injection. It must have been the injection. 

I visited Steve later that day and he told me of the events. He begged me to sign him out and get him home that day. He was desperate. He was not in safe hands there, after all. I tried to sign him out, but the doctor assured me that it was in the best interest to stay one more night to ensure the infection had completely cleared. I reluctantly agreed. 

I visited again the next day and Steve was in a terrible state. He was pale, his face was sweaty. He even had a temperature... he was in a much worse state to what I had seen him like the day before. The doctor told me it was just a side affect of the medicine they had given him. Steve told me otherwise. 

""They attacked me, Kate. That's the only way i can describe it... I was pretending to sleep late last night and a nurse came in. She rolled me over, and prepared my leg for an injection. You know what they do, they wipe it with some sort of liquid. I startled her when I asked her what she was doing. She told me it was 'just procedure'. I asked her to stop and said that i'd rather not have the treatment. She got aggressive. Called another nurse. One held me down while she injected me. I screamed but nobody came. Now all of a sudden I'm ill. I'm not getting out of here, Kate. I'm going to die in this bed. Just like Jim."" He began rocking back and forth as I tried to comfort him. He was soaked with sweat. 

I asked his doctor what was wrong with him, and the doctor told me it was pneumonia. My heart sunk. It was just like Jim. Steve was right - he wasn't safe here. I needed to get him out. 

""I'll be back tomorrow to get you out of here"" I told Steve. ""They won't let me today... and now that they have a clue that I want to get you out, they're all watching me. I was almost escorted out when I shouted at the doctor. Tomorrow I can do it quietly, when i'm not being watched so closely."" Steve agreed. 

The following day I returned to the hospital. Steve told me the nurse had not returned that night. I put him in a wheelchair and took him to the toilets. I gave him some clothes that I had collected from his apartment and he changed. I asked a nurse to bring me any belongings he had left with the desk, stating that he had asked me to take them home for him. The nurse agreed and brought me his things without a word. We escaped and I took him home. Before leaving, we slyly stole the 'sign out' clip board, and Steve was able to sign it. He was legally free. 

Three days later Steve was found dead in his apartment. The pneumonia had gotten worse and, without treatment, took his life. He left a note. It read: 

""I was taken into the hospital with an ear infection. I left without said ear infection, but with bigger problems. I was abused. I have made a realization; either the secret injections being given are procedures to keep population down, or, they are ways to make medicine companies money. After all, they make money through our illness - they don't really want us to recover. I would not advise anyone who is not dying to stay in a hospital - definitely not alone. There, you will never truly be in safe hands.""

",In safe hands,4
ephique,0,1,1r8wrl,2,"It was Friday and myself being unemployed at the time, was up for something to do. You see, my girlfriend was invited to a party by her new friends from her drama-crew she recently joined and she wanted me to join her. This party took place on the other side of our suburban ruin of a town and it made common sense for her to message me the location whenever she knew the exact address; again, she didn't know these people that well.

Around 9 pm I left our apartment to head to the party, still not knowing the exact location I figured I could at least walk to the bus-station that had buses taking me to that part of town. Luckily I got a message from one of her new friends on the way there. Describing how to get to the destination. My girlfriend hadn't paid her phone bill and had to use a friend’s phone to message me, she has done this before. She hates her network company.

I took the bus, taking me as far as I could bus-wise. After that I had to get a taxi, the only taxi driver I ended up finding had never driven anyone to that location before apparently; I'm guessing the drama-people pretended they had taxi's whenever they needed one. Good practice.

The taxi driver, who I believe was Mexican dropped me off at the address and headed back for the city shortly after. I had no idea her friends was throwing a party out in the middle of nowhere, and it was getting really chilly so I didn't spend too much time figuring out the mysteries of the universe out there; I ran up to the door.

My first impression was that this must have been the most quiet party in the history of parties. I heard no music, no laughing, no tapping. Nothing. Before I knew it I was banging on that door, it had no ringer or anything, I had to pound that thing. No one opened.

I felt pretty confused at this point, I did still have my phone though. Although calling my girlfriend was no use 'cause I already knew her network always shut off inbound and outbound calls and texts whenever she hadn't paid. Out of desperation I phoned her friends number, but no one answered. I assumed they were partying too hard to hear the phone ringing and I found myself mislead by a tired taxi driver who took me to the wrong house. That's the only explanation that made any sense to me what so ever.

Now, I was out of options. I couldn't walk back into town 'cause not only would I not know the exact roads out there; but it was also ridiculously freezing outside. I tried banging on the door again and again, maybe an old couple lived there or something and they would wake up if I hit that door hard enough.

I ended up smashing the lever on the door accidentally, the door wasn't even locked. I looked around to make sure that no one was watching me because I did realize that being desperate or cold wouldn't really vouch well in court. I couldn't see anyone so I sneaked into the house. Whenever I had made sure no one was in the first room of the house I closed the door behind me. Not being sure what I was looking for, I walked around aimlessly trying to figure out if anyone was home or not; my mind started to wander off into finding explanations. I remember one being that they were playing a prank on me, which wasn't a bad theory since the door was after all left unlocked.

I didn't check much of the first level of the house before I started walking up a great set of stairs leading me in a spiral upwards. It was very creaky so if anyone was awake in this house they'd easily hear me at this point. I figured no one was 'cause the entire house was dead silent with the exception of the noise I brought into it myself.

Upstairs I found a bedroom just across the hall from where the spiral staircase ended. It seemed to belong to a girl, a small girl. It was an empty bed in it and paintings on the walls, you know the type kids do in pre-school that parents end up pretending are works of genius to make the kid feel better and gain confidence? Yeah, those kind of paintings.

I got shocked by my own text-message signal that I stupidly left on way too loud, it was from an unknown number; I was hoping it was my girlfriend or her friend explaining the mix-up or something. The text said:
""Alright, we are all set! I hope you haven't fallen asleep my little unemployed darling. Make your way to 24th Radcliffe Street, it's not too far from the super market by the bus-station. Oh, and this is Jessie's phone... sorry, forgot to pay my fascist phone bill again. Sorry that it took me so long to message! Love you :)""",Take Me Out,3
chocate,2,4,1r5o4c,2,"Cold nights, always cold.It gets really hot and you can actually feel the sun burn your skin but always always cold during the night. I was 10-11 years old at the time. I never met my father and my Mother left me and my brother with my Grandparents so she could work and give us a better future. Cold always cold. Constantly reminding myself that i was alone felt really cold. I had began to do bad in school, my grades were not the best. My mother had worked so hard for us, and all i could ever think was about how lonely i felt. I had my brother at my side but it always fell lonely. My heart had become a cold hard rock, always wanting to be loved but unable to.  10 years had already pass and i still remember how it felt, cold and yet so comforting. It felt like it understood me, and yet it felt so cold. 

I had always being a rebellious kid, always speaking my mind out. Never accepting what others thought is the right thing. I had developed my own acceptance of reality, i had to grow up fast and i was surprised at how childish the decisions of other kids were. i laugh at them, i saw them as lowly living creature. But those were my supposed friends. Always lonely no matter where i went, i was always fell left out. That feeling trigger my hated, and made me realized how superior i was to them. My heart was cold and i didn't care anymore. i just want to grow up fast and become something worthy of someone's live. 

i had done something real bad that night. Me and my brother were locked up in my old house. It was a flat with 3 rooms, it was old and falling to the ground, there were cracks all around. the windows were holding up somehow. My ant was really angry at me and my brother, she had always threaten us, saying that she would lock as up in that place. The place was were i was born, it was the place where i had grown up, it was the place where i saw my mother cry every day. Since the new house was built there was no need for me to go to the old house. There was nothing there after all. All empty and always so cold.  This night was no different everything was so dark, the only light you could see was the moon light. i could feel a chill going down my spine, i could feel my heart feeling been comforted, i felt like i belonged. Since we moved to the new house i couple of years ago, that place always scared me. Every time i went there i always left running,i always felt like something was always looking at me from behind, calling me, wanting me to stay there. There was always this malevolent presence, it didn't feel right. 

This night somehow was different, there was no presence, i couldn't feel anything. It was just cold. My brother was everything i had, a year younger independent as me, always looking strong as if nothing could ever hurt him. GET ME OUT OF HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!! i heard him scream, his screams hold so much fear and so much loneliness, it sent chills down my spine. Every time he screamed i felt like if someone was patting on my back, rubbing his hand on my back. Cold, cold as my heart. I couldn't bear to see my brother so vulnerable, GET US OUT OF HERE!!!!! i could hear my self screaming. So much anger, it felt so good to scream my lungs out. It felt so good to finally scream my lungs out with no restrain. we scream for hours with no stop. 

I had some matches in my pocket, we lit up a fire with it which didn't last long. We had a metal bucket and some old would that had stay there. The fire didn't last long, as if there was not enough oxygen around. Even the burning fire felt so cold. we kept scream, asking to get us out of there. We been locked up for hours, it was already past midnight. You could see the moon and the starts, thousands of them. yet it was so dark and as always so cold. 

We screamed so much we felt as if our energy was being sucked in my something.  I felt week and light headed.  It suddenly got colder and colder, it was past midnight after all, it only gets colder. Suddenly we hear something scratching the door, as if it wanted to get in, and couldn't. It fell desperate, my aunt had the key and only her could open the door. There was no other way of opening it. There was no key sound, nothing everything fell as if space had been altered somehow. No key sound and the door just opened. No words, nothing, no one said anything. Me and my bother was left the room as if nothing had happened, as if it was something we been used to seeing. 

We were walking side by side and he stayed behind. I cold had touched my shoulder, i touched its had and i felt a cold metal around his finger. I never got to hear his voice, but i new that he told us to just go and he will come later after he closes the door. 
The night was cold and my heart didn't feel cold anymore, i just fell so much sadness, i no longer felt lonely, although i always kept wishing to have someone who would love me for who i am. 
We walked down to the new house, it was two story house, the biggest house in the whole town. It had big windows. As we saw walked down, we looked at the window a shadow rush upstairs, the night was quiet and we never heard doors being opened or close. I didn't fell scared, it was as if i knew who it was, and i knew nothing wrong or bad would happen to be or my little brother. 

Me and my brother were the only guys living in that house, and my aunt was staying there that night, it was her turn to sleep over. her sister and her used to take turns everyday to take care of me and my bother. There were no men living there. and there never was. I never gave it much thought. All the entrance doors in the house were locked, he had to climb our way up to the second floor to get in the house. When we went into the room where my aunt was, she was sound sleep and didn't wake up till the next day. 

After 5 years i finally met my mom, and finally met my dad. I told them what had happened that night. I told them about the ring, i told them about him.  At first they told me that it was probably my aunt trying to teach us a lesson, but she wasn't that tall, no one can be that cold, and no one in my family wore a ring.  later on i asked my mom again, and she finally told me that, i while ago my one of my uncles used to sleep there, when he was drunk. He was tall man, was married and never had any kids of his own. One day, i still remember hearing that they had found him death in his room. He had hanged him self living everyone of his family wondering why he had done it. No one knows till now. Without knowing me and my brother had called him, had woken him up from his sleep, and by taking our energy was able to take his human form and free us from that room. He said that he would come back, i had never stopped waiting. ",Cold Shadow,6
molly-is-sleeping,6,4,1r5kz2,0,"The first time I saw Him, I was entering my friend’s house as He darted quickly in front of me, then as silently as He had come, disappeared into the garage. He was completely black, tall and slim, and as smooth as death. He was at the bottom of the stairs, directly in front of me as I entered the house, having just taken my friend’s dog for a quick walk. This was around a month ago. I call him the Shadow Man, and He took 2 long strides and vanished. The dog, which is often very yappy, ran up the stairs, unaware of the other being in the house. But the cat was walking beside the Shadow Man and looking up at Him, as if he was His follower. After the shadow man disappeared, the cat rubbed against the garage door and mewed at me questioningly. He was as curious as I was. I didn't get a bad feeling from this man, but it was unexpected. I was kind of creeped out so I ran up the stairs. I told my friend in all seriousness what I had seen, and I’m not sure if she believed me. I barely believed myself. 

Honestly, I thought I had imagined it. It was dark, I was already scared from being outside at 10 o’clock at night by myself, and at first tried to convince myself that I had seen my own shadow. But the way it moved… the way He moved… I couldn’t lie to myself. 

I just keep thinking about Him. It’s hard to forget someone when you see them everywhere you look. I see Him in my dad’s room, standing in the corner. I see Him disappearing behind the curtain in the living room. I see Him staring at the TV in the basement. And when I drove by my mom’s house, where I spend half my time, He was watching me from the window. I can’t see His face, but I could feel Him watching me. He doesn’t scare me. He gives me a sense of myself in some weird way. I’m waiting for the moment that He decides to make a real entrance and step fully into my world. I dream about Him. I need Him.

So, a little over a year ago, I posted a couple of different things that happened to me back in 2005. There were a couple of things that happened between here and there, that I never got around to posting too. Anyway, here I am. Over a year later in the hopes that someone can help me, because something similar has recently happened.

So, while the other stories took place in NC, this all happened in MD. It happened about a week or two before Halloween. And all of this was very close together, and it all happened at my girlfriends house in Baltimore, Arbutus area for the locals. Her mom and younger brother have been living with her for almost a year now, until her mom can get back on her feet due to some unrelated, personal issues. I'm only bringing this particular thing up, in case someone may find it relevant. Her brother is 14. Mom, she's over 50, if not right at 50. Now...
After dinner one night, we were all sitting around the table talking. I excused myself to go shower. I have to get up at 4:30 in the morning, and generally just shower the night before work so I'm not in a groggy rush. So, I'm in the shower and they're, doing whatever it is they do as far as I know. I remember, and never will forget probably, the feeling of something tap me on the shoulder. It didn't necessarily feel like a finger. I pushed it out of my head almost immediately thinking I had brushed the wall or a towel or something. And that was it. That was all that happened in there. I got out, dried off and put on some clothes and left the bathroom. It was quiet in the house. No chatter, no tv and no video games. I just assumed everyone went to bed and headed upstairs to the attic bedroom my girlfriend sleeps in. It was dark, minus the flickery light that turned out to be a bunch of candles in the middle of the floor. My girlfriend, and her mother, playing with a Ouija board. They asked if I wanted to play, and I simply refused. Part of me wanted to leave because those things make me uncomfortable as it is. But I just layed down on the bed and tried to sleep. Mostly watching them. Mostly feeling uncomfortable whenever one of them giggled about it, or laughed and said it was stupid, which bothered me quite a bit. They were done when, after the second or third try, mom turned the disc, or whatever it's called, upside down and said she was done. They put it away and that was that. It dawned on me later that whatever I felt in the shower, would have happened about the time they started with their ouija seances...

So, a few nights later, I'm back at her house. I haven't heard of anything and honestly put the whole thing out of my head. That night, I woke up, at almost the exact same time she did. I looked at her, while she looked forward to the head of the bed, and immediately screamed. And not like a jumpy, something at the movies jumped out at me scream. Pure terror. I pulled her close and cradled her, and didn't see or notice anything. I turned on the light. Nothing was there. What she described to me was so horrifyingly familiar. She said, at the head of the bed, not 3 feet away, stood a figure. Not actually standing though. More like, bending over and reaching out for her. She told me two days later what actually woke her up was she heard something talking in the room, that said in a whisper ""what should we do with her?"" That's when she looked up and everything happen. I did make a mental note that it was after 3 o'clock. The only reason I noted it is because after calming her down, realizing I had less than an hour until I had to go to work. She got up and left when I left. The reason I say this one in particular is horrifyingly familiar, and wanted me to come to you with this in the hopes someone may be able to help me figure something out, is if you'll read the story at the top ""2005"", it's almost the same thing.

Now, I'm an atheist. I haven't prayed in years. And my girlfriend knows this. I'm not against it. I'll pray along to be respectful if the family is praying at dinner, or at a funeral. But one night, she woke me up shaking. Telling me that the room didn't feel right. And she was scared. She asked me to pray with her. Like, she wanted me to say a prayer for protection. I didn't know how to react, but this was extremely out of the ordinary for her. So I went with it. And after a minute of reaching into the back of my head for things to say, she started breathing slower. Calmer. She let me finish, then thanked me and said ""I think it worked"". She laid down and eventually, we both fell asleep.

The only things other than little squeaks and creaks, which could honestly just be the house being a house and making house noises, was when she was downstairs trying to sleep I guess. She didn't sleep in her room for a while unless I was there, and as I just recently moved to night shift, that's been a lot. Anyway, she said she heard her brother upstairs leaning in the chair, which he does while he plays on his laptop. So she sends him a text. A simple ""stop leaning"". Not a minute later, the text comes back and says ""I'm in bed"".
That's all I know or have heard for right now. I've spent fewer nights there since all that happened. Her mom burned sage in the room, or whatever the cleansing plant is (sage right?). Said some prayers. And I'm hoping that's it.",So this recently started happening again,1
JohnFrostNeruda,0,3,1r1agn,1,"I stalked my prey carefully from a distance.  He was large, and somewhat clumsy, the perfect target. The fact that he was a bully made this even sweeter.

I had just moved to a new city after my sister's ""tragic"" suicide.  Adjusting was tough for all of us, especially for me since I had a hard time connecting with people.  Hell back then I didn't even want to. I preferred to be solitary.  Back then was tough because I felt empty inside. Nothing I did seemed to fulfill me. I was my own abyss. 

This kid started to pick on me one day. Don't even know why, he just did. I never took the time to learn his name. He walked passed me in the courtyard during lunch and casually referred to me as a faggot to his friends. They snickered and kept walking.  I couldn't tell you why that made me so angry. Perhaps I...how would you say it...snapped. A small voice told me in the back of my head to extinguish him. It was minuscule at first, like a small piece of gravel in my shoe.

The next day it got louder.

And louder.

And louder.

The voice didn't bother me that much. I was intrigued by it. I wondered what would happen if I carried out its request. I acquired one of my mother's kitchen knives. A small one, as I didn't want to overdue it, and sharpened it a little. I then put on a black hoodie and began the hunt.

When I found my target, he was enjoying a smoke against a wall next to the school.  He was alone. I made careful strides towards him, listening to the voice inside my head grow louder with anticipation. I firmly gripped the knife handle, and as my target was walking to his car, plunged it into his side. I felt the blade slowly drive into the kid's soft flesh and his blood came oozing out onto my knuckles. He wheezed and gasped for air as blood filled his mouth. I stabbed him again, and he fell to the ground watching me watch him die. It took a couple of minutes but he finally stopped moving. I will admit that the rush of euphoria I received after the kill still makes the hair on my head stand up. For the first time, I had actually felt something. My legs quaked as I walked back home and cleaned of my mom's knife.  I grinned stupidly as I put it back on the rack. Ah, what a rush.

But then the feeling was gone,and I was back to my familiar emptiness.  There was only one solution to that. The voice agreed.

I saw a man in a hood, I couldn't see his face but it looked liked he was focused on me. I went home and I saw my dog Oscar. He crawled up to me as usual but then I close my eyes and I see him with no fur, no skin and no visible pupils. He barked at me in such a monstrous way I screamed in pure panic and when I opened my eyes again he was normal again and he was confused by my scream.

I decided to go to sleep. I dreamed I was in a desert. The man in the hood was faraway from me but he was coming closer. As he was walking towards me I saw images that horrified me. I saw my family sitting on a bench smiling, but then the hooded man came from behind them and shot them all in the head.

I woke up. I was sweating and then I remembered the doctor said the pills would cause hallucinations so I tried not to think of it. I heard my High school reunion was tomorrow so I got ready.

Mmwheat,0,1,1qykot,1,"Let me just start off by saying this is going to be a small amount of writing well cause there's no back story to this.
I live alone with my dog in a small house in the LA area he's a normal dog well he was and still playfull and all cute until the darker hours (8 p.m - midnight) when I'm trying to sleep he does these human like laughs at first I thought it was my next door neighbor watching some horror movies but I turned on the light and my dog had his mouth open (this was last friday) I thought it was unusual because I've never seen my dog have his mouth open only when he yawns he would have it open.
Now instead of letting him sleep on my bed with me I keep my dog in a little dog house in the closet but that only makes the silent laughters of his creepier.
And when I do fall asleep I wake up around 3 hearing these laughters, I just try to not look toward the closet in fear of seeing someone there.

CityofEvil,2,4,1qy5xr,1,"Some back story, I'm 15 now, so this only happened about 8 years ago circa 2005 around the time I was ~7 and my brother was ~4, so my recollection is hazy and his is nonexistent (although he was sleeping during the incident, and I've never inquired). During this time we slept in the same room together, myself in a separate bed with about 5ft in between the foot of mine and the foot of his. Our beds are pressed against parallel walls with our heads on them. We had one window in the room in a niche, and the following happened sometime in the very early hours of the morning, say 1-3am. No lights are on and the window can't produce any large shadows onto my bed nor my brother's. Anyway, on with the story itself:

I have always been a pretty heavy sleeper, even as a young child I never awoke in the middle of the night for anything short of an explosion (I exaggerate maybe a little), and I was not prone to night terrors of any short. On the contrary, I am fairly good at lucid dreams, but I digress. On this particular night, nothing to my knowledge was different. I hadn't witnessed or had some traumatising event occur to me, I was just sleeping waiting for day to come. At some point (I can't remember the time, but it was pitch outside), I woke up to my brother whispering the words: 
  
*""&lt;My name&gt;, I hate you.""*

Why this woke me up itself is strange, maybe it's because I heard my name being called and it's instinct. I was drowsy, didn't look up straight away, and said something along the lines of

*""&lt;My brother's name&gt;, what did you just say?""*

No response. 

*""Did you say you hated me?""*

I looked up, and at the side of my brother's bed next to his head-board, on the wall itself, I saw a very dark figure, that looked like a short man. The room was dark, but there was always enough light to vaguely make out the other sibling. This was different. It was pure black, like a room with four walls and no exit. As Spongebob would say, [advanced darkness.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjtkWZ1uCXo) I don't know how it was possible, but I could clearly make out his arm and hand, outstretched, with his fists clenched like he was choking someone. I did the cliché kid-thing, and hid under my covers. I counted to some number, and emerged. He was still there. I can clearly, very vividly, remember choking on my own words. I meant to yell *""Moooommy!""*, but what I let out was barely audible. I went back under the covers, and I can remember shoving myself between my mattress and the wall, getting as close to it as possible. I eventually fell asleep, and in the morning I looked at the spot where it was standing. There was nothing there. Just air. My brother was still asleep, the door was still shut, no one could have moved something that was there in the time frame. I named it *The Shadow Thing*, and still think about it from time-to-time, but its never happened again, so why worry about it, right?

My theories: What I believe happened was I was young, exhausted, and imagined it. I know you probably think it was a dream, but it was so vivid, I remember it, and I *felt* it. I felt the fear, it was definitely real. I *felt* it in the room with me, and I definitely heard my brother say that one phrase. I'm adamantly atheist, I don't believe in ghosts, spirits, messages from *the other side*, and have never had anything like this occur to me before or after.",The Shadow Thing,5
Lady_rosalie,0,1,1qy4nl,1,"When I was little, about thirteen years old or so, my grandma came to live with us. She slept in the room my sister and I slept in, and so we got a bunk bed. I slept on top, my sister on bottom. My grandma slept across the room, in her own bed.

One night, it was winter, I woke up suddenly and turned over to look at my grandma. It was dark, with only a faint light from the hallway, yet I could see so clearly. Like it was day or something. I saw what looked like a shadow enter the room. It walked to my grandmas bed, which was near the door. As it walked closer to the bed, it turned from a shadow to a what looked like a mummy figure. I not mean bandages.

It looked more burned. It's skin, if that's what you want to call it, was very wrinkled, but tight to its body. It had no clothes on, and was black, and various shades of brown. It walked with its back bent, like an old man. But I could sense it wasn't human. There was no way.

I couldn't look away. I just stared as it reached my grandma. It stopped and turned to look at me. I wanted to scream, but I couldn't. I felt like I couldn't breathe. It didn't have eyes. It was black, socket like, yet it glowed at the same time. It opened its mouth, also black, like nothing was there. It let out a croaking noise, inhuman sounding. I don't even have the right words to describe it, I don think there is words to describe it.

It took a small step towards me and I passed out. I woke up the next morning, my grandma was already up and making breakfast. I could t eat though, not that I usually did anyway. I couldn't remember if it was a dream or not. I'm still not sure what I saw to this day. I don't believe it was death. My grandma is still very alive and well, as is my sister. Maybe it was just a dream. If not, the thing might still be in my house. Watching. Waiting. For what, I don't want to know.",Maybe it was Just a Dream,2
Zevonni,4,3,1qxe8k,2,"I am 25 years old and I am currently married. I was employed and my hours were from 10 PM until 6 AM. My husband's job was sometime in the morning. I cherish my husband and would give him anything he wanted. But it has all changed.
   One day, my boss had told me to go home on hour earlier then usual. I had left and went straight to my house, not wanting to waste a precious moment without my husband. I sneaked in through the back of the house to surprise him. I know everyone will think of this as silly, but I had a scary Halloween costume. It took a bit of time to put on, but I managed to put it on soundlessly. I went up the stairs, careful not to make a sound. As I walked up, I heard this grunting and a sudden "" THIS IS MUCH, MUCH BETTER,"" Coming from my room. I thought it was just my husband watching shows, because that what he would do at this time, while waiting for me. He slept during the day just for me, and I knew that. But, there seemed to be this knot tightening in my stomach. I have no idea why that was. I went to our room, and found that the door was slightly open. I looked inside, and I saw a women on top of my husband. I couldn't believe it. From there, the knot it my stomach loosened and I knew what I had to do. I quickly made my way back down the stairs. Knowing that if they heard a sound, they would immediately disengage and hide. I didn't bother taking care of the small noises I made, since they would be too engrossed to notice. I grabbed the deadliest knife I could find and went back up. From here, there would be no point in trying to keep my presence a secret. I walked in the room and said, "" Hello there Mack, and who do we have here?"" I hid the knife in my pocket, and since they couldn't see it, it was better to keep that a secret. ""Why, your back an hour early. Julianna, meet our neighbor, Megan. Megan, meet my wife, Juli."" I couldn't believe my ears. Did he just say that was our neighbor. I know she wasn't. I have been at where my husband works before and saw her there. We made small talk and I found out that she lives a whole 20 miles from us. But still, I made it sound like I believed him. She probably would have forgotten that conversation anyways."" Hello Julianna, and may I ask why you are dressed like that?"" I had just noticed that she was wearing a suit and skirt, both black. It seemed pretty easy and quick to put on though."" I was just discussing some work with your husband Juli."" That did it. First she stole my husband from me, now she dares try and lie? I could not help but take the knife out and start stabbing and stabbing. I continued to stab until my heart seemed content and all my anger has been unleashed. Curiosity then took the better of me. I just had to see what they were actually doing, and saw something that made me regret my handiwork. I took a look at the t.v. and it seemed that porn was on. I had looked at the wall when peeking in and saw the reflection of the t.v. on the wall. And, in fact, they were actually doing work today. I continued by making them each a grave. There was already a large hole that reeked if decomposing flesh. I dug up the hole and, after giving them both a proper burial, left them together in that same huge wall. Well then, time to look for my 24th husband.

uw0tkp,3,10,1qwfxx,0," I have work in just two more hours, but I'm not going to go because there isn't really a point anymore. There was no point to anything really. Waking up, sleeping, working, eating, and relaxing all bored me now. Nothing was the same since my wife left. She was a beautiful woman and talented beyond anything I have ever seen. But, she was too good for me and I knew it. She achieved everything, became a doctor, made tons of money, and could do anything she wanted. I, however am a washed up architect. As with many others down on their luck, I took a job at a local fast food place and worked nights. I started seeing less and less of my wife and more and more of work. I could work 70 hours a week and still not see near as much as she makes in just a few days. Resentment spread across the house like a virus.

I was worthless and I knew it. That's why she left me. If only I could take it all back and just talk to her and the kids and explain why I was working more. I loved her so much and wanted to provide more for her. But she didn't see it that way. She found a new guy and started seeing him while I was at work. One night I came home early and found the two of them together in our bed. I should have attacked the guy and put a stop to it right then and there, but I've always been a bit of a bitch. Instead, I sat in the living room waiting for them to finish. The dick had the audacity to actually walk out of MY ROOM and pat me on the head as he walked by. I confronted my wife about this after he left, but she is much more willful than I am, and I eventually just went for a walk. When I came back, she had locked the bedroom door and I slept on the couch.

She broke up with me the next morning. I have never felt so empty in my entire life. I did everything I could think of to try to win her back. I would stand outside the apartment late at night tossing rocks at the window and yelling how much I loved her. I waited for her at her car at work, because I just knew it would prove to her how much I loved her. After some time, I grew depressed and tired. I did everything I could for my family. I still sent her money, picked up the kids, played with the kids, and tried to come home every night. Eventually she told me not to come back and that there was a restraining order on me. It wasn't fair. All I was doing was trying to be a good husband and father.

As you two know, something terrible happened last night. I came by, as I usually do every night to check in on you kids through the window. However, I saw something so disturbing I knew I had to intervene. I saw you, Tim, call the dick ""dad"". He is NOT YOUR DAD! I AM! I had to come in and tell you that. and when that bastard tried to stop me from coming in, I had to stab him. Don't you see that? I tried to save your mom, I really did. I love...d her and I miss her so much. But I don't know what happened. She tried to wrestle the knife away and it just slipped... I'm sorry kids. But when I light this gas on fire, we can all be together again. I'm sorry I had to tie you up, but I can't let you leave and miss our reunion. Everything is going to be so good now. I love you both.",How I Lost and Found My Family,10
Christianjohnm,1,2,1qtdub,1,"This is a collections of sightings of a man who visited our town about a decade ago. This man was called 'Gaabigguwat' which in our native language means 'The Big Haired One'. This man was said to be a survivalist sent out to live in the woods for a few months near our community.

As a kid, I had a lot of friends' parents say to stay in at nights and to not go out because of these sightings. I didn't really believe them at first, I always thought that these were stories they told just to get us kids not to go out.
Ever since I experienced seeing this big haired person, I've collected a bunch of stories of other people seeing this guy.

My sighting was when I was 10, I stayed late over at a friend's place when we looked out the window and noticed something rustling through the garbage. And my friend lived in the area where this guy was sighted the most. We wondered what it was, we don't know anyone who could've been searching that aggressively in the garbage, especially at the time of night it was.

Another sighting made big news in our community a few weeks later. This family, that lived near where my sighting occurred, was out of town for a few days, and when they returned home, there was food and other stuff every where on the kitchen floor. They also noticed that something was living beneath their trailer. When the cops investigated it, there was pots and pans, cereal boxes, a mat where something was sleeping and fire supplies. By this time, the person was long gone, he probably stayed there for a night or two and left.

When I told my gf's mother these stories last year, she told me a sighting she experienced around the same time my sightings happened. My gf's mother lives in the same area where these sightings happened. She told me that one day, while she was standing outside her place smoking a cigarette, she noticed a big bearded white guy in tattered clothes and big rubber boots walking behind the houses and looking into the windows. He looked into the window where my gf's little brother was sleeping, who was a baby at the time. She said she didn't recognize who the guy was. It's a small town, almost entirely natives.
There are more sightings of this guy, but these are the most significant to me. Other stories I've heard was that there was more than one of these guys wandering around our little town.

I'm not sure if this would be related but around the same time, my sisters boyfriend brought us out to camp, which is an hour away from our community, and we went to the near garbage dump and he showed me a bunch of little huts that he found just outside the garbage dump. There was three of these little huts, almost in the shape of tipis. And inside them were little mats, big jugs full of dirty water, dead crows and squirrels and wood for fire. Being there really creeped me out, because no one would drink water that dirty or eat those birds, the squirrels maybe, but not crows. Our people tend to eat only certain animals.

A big break through in finding out who this person is was just a few years ago, when police investigated a cave just a few kilometres out of town. The cave looked like someone was trying to build a little shack inside it or something. Our local news reporter also visited the site and found a receipt and traced it back to a person in the US. The person in the US told him that he was sent out on a survivalist program or something.

What bugs me is why this guy was being so creepy and wandering towns at night, looking scary and what not.

Some of the other stories I've heard of this guy just seemed too unbelievable or just straight up absurd like as if they were made up just to add to the hype. 
If you want to hear them anyway, let me know. ",Gah-Big-wad : The Big Haired One,3
waitingsilence,0,3,1qqahe,1,"The reason we grow out of our childhood innocence and out of our childlike fears is because we eventually realize that reality is much bigger than us. Childhood fears are not always based in this reality, they are manifested only in the dark corners of our homes and our minds. It was this reason the person in our closet or under our bed was there to scare us and only us. The figures hidden in the shadows of your basement were only there if your mom or dad weren't around. Our fears were not objective realities, they were figments of our imagination.

The thing I fear now doesn't care if I am around to see it, or that I don't have an imagination. It exists within and outside of my mind. It permeates my reality, it leaves its mark everywhere I am. It is the darkness in the moment I blink, it is the blur in my peripherals, the ache behind my tired eyes, it is the evil in my home.

There are things I've seen, felt maybe? I might have only dreamt of them or imagined their horror in a passing thought. These things are real though, they create real emotions within me, they make me sweat and they deeply disturb my mental state. You know that feeling you get when you come across something on the internet so dark that it leaves a lump in your throat for the rest of the day? My home is alive with that feeling.

Deep down, I know the lump in my throat is there not because I can't control my emotions, but because my emotions are completely justified. Whether I am taking a night walk to clear my head, or staring at the ceiling above my bed until morning comes, this lump feels defensive in its existence, as if my body is reacting to something very real and threatening.

I've had a hard time sleeping recently. I can never get comfortable, every position feels heavy, my body feels like it is under stress, and there is a very real pressure in my throat. 

I will often spend nights on the couch in the basement living room that sits right outside my bedroom. The television's lone glow burns its images into my head, my eyes become bloodshot as I stare at the screen until I begin to feel tired and am forced to close them. This is the only way I can fall asleep and I feel it has begun to take a toll on my sanity. Sometimes I will find myself on the couch staring at the television at seven in the morning. Other times, I will randomly become aware, still sitting in front of the turned off television, my eyes strained, staring into the dark nothingness of it. Sometimes I will come to, sitting quite upright in my bed, staring forward as if to be watching television, eyes strained and aching, staring off into the darkness of my bedroom. One night after a day where I believed I would die if I stayed awake any longer, I told myself I would try to sleep in my own bed by relaxing and focusing on some of my thoughts.

I woke up on the couch in the living room, quite upright and aware. I was drawn through the corner of my eye to my open bedroom. 

The tall figure stretched from the roof to my bed, not sure if it was standing or hanging. Its back was to me, its head sunk low, staring down over my sleeping body in the bed.

I saw my body wake up and sit upright as the figure fixed its gaze down on it. My body in the bed sheepishly jerked ever so slightly, the figure with it, and I felt that same ache behind my eyes as both my body in the bed and the tall figure glared at me from the darkness of the bedroom.

I research biological warfare. December 20th: I have thought of an idea to make a strain of influenza that instead of killing the body it will actually improve it to make a stronger German fleet.


December 21st: I have heard of a substance that can make the body stronger and more in rage but it is all the way in South America I will have to call a superior officer to request for it. December 22nd: I am so eager to start maybe the Fuhrer will recognize my genius and I will be known across Germany. January 6th: I have now just got the substance but strangely the officer who delivered it to my quarters told me when he got it a man from the village begged him not to use it that it was horrible. January 9th: I have finish mixing the strains all I need now is a test subject. January 10th: A officer presented me with a American spy who was held captive in a concentration camp. He handed me him and helped me sedate him. Before he walked out the door he told me: ""Make mighty Germany proud.""




 January 11th: I have strapped the subject on a operating table, I have filled a syringe with the substance and injected it in his right arm. January 12th: The subject is not moving as if he is deceased. Maybe he is in a coma but when I touch him he makes no reflexes or reactions.
January 13th: I woke up in the middle of the night in horror as I heard a great scream. It was the subject struggling to get off the table. A officer came to my quarters hearing the noise. I told him what had happened. I tried to sedate the subject with a sedative drug and injecting it into his arm but it didn't work. The officer hit the subject on the head with a baton and even that did not work so we moved him into the closet and locked it. I bribed him not to tell anyone. January 14th: I saw through the window of the door the subjects eyes were getting darker and his skin paler. January 15th: The subject keeps making these horrifying screams that is eating away at me. January 16th: I heard the strap of the table finally snap and I quickly covered the door with a shelf.



January 17th: I have had it, I grabbed a revolver to kill the subject, I opened the door and when I did he lashed out at me and scratched me on the arm. I dropped the gun and the subject got on top of me. I noticed one of my surgical tools and I stabbed him in the eye killing him. I didn't think of getting medical help after all it was just a scratch.
January 18th: I feel ill, I am coughing and I cannot see straight. January 19th: My skin is getting paler and my eyes are getting darker. January 20th: I am starting to get sores on my body like a allergic reaction of some type. January 21st: I started to cough up what appears to be blood but it was black. January 22nd: My body is starting to take a more skeletal appearance. I feel too weak to call for help. January 23rd:My mind is starting to deteriorate and it is hard to think even now as I write I am having trouble focusing. January 24th: Why don't I just end it? I have the revolver I would not have to worry becoming what the subject became and I will be free. January 25th: I am going to end this now and make sure no one experiences what has happened again.

TreasureHouseofDoom,3,35,1r7ztj,0,"Dr Jefferies study lay before me, energy cleared and house relatively empty, but delving into other people's personal space isn't as easy for me as it may be for others.  Always, my parents have cautioned me and my siblings about the dangers of disrupting others' heirlooms, cherishables, and privacy.  I knew for instance that each of us has deep connection to those things he or she treasures, even if we are not personally aware of any sort of psychic ability and that some items carry with them certain protections.  A locket passed from mother to daughter, for instance, may have compound energies susceptible to unleash if disrespected.  Bring into this potential release of energy against an interloper a variable such as a holy relic or other spiritually imbued item and forces not easily rectified are to be expected.  But more profound than these fears of conflict beyond my control was the deep seated notion in me that all people, those among us and those just beyond, ever beyond, are entitled to their privacy, respect beyond measure, peace.  I'd done a pretty good job of jeopardizing such peace, and now it was time for me to make things right, but maybe, too, I would be able to bring more than satisfactory comfort.  Perhaps this predicament would be remedied with two little girls finding their way to Bliss.

""Whatever Bliss is."" I heard someone say over my shoulder.  Just to my left was a door that I presumed opened into the first room to the right of the hall.  Foreboding consumed my thoughts only a moment before I pushed it out of my mind and far from my heart.  Mama and Aunt Lucia would have called the voice ""Naysayer,"" and I knew far more than I needed about its powers.  

'The only power Naysayers have is anti-power,' I remembered my mother saying. 'They're the weakest link on a dark, rusted chain.  When all else fails, Naysayers speak to hinder what must be done for Good.' I must have been very young when I heard her say this, and I wasn't even sure she had said it to me.  Truth was, respect for privacy aside, I was a bit of an ease dropper by nature, and as far as I knew, she had been speaking to a friend or relative.   But the information, this reminder over time, was powerful strength to me.  I pushed the Naysayer from my mind.

There are two very important techniques to remember as one sets her mind to investigating scene and history.  First, proceed in an orderly and logical manner as often and well as possible.  Turn over every clue for deeper consideration, but remember to return every item examined to its proper place whenever feasible.  Second, follow instinct and revelation as each presents itself.  Order and Logic have their places, but in highly energized situations, short cuts sometimes arise.  Consult your inner voice in regards to each, and if that voice is true and strong in most situations, trust it now.

Having been involved in vintage house restoration through my mother's real estate dealings, I knew a thing or two about the sorts of places used as secret compartments.  Knobs on banisters, loose boards, trim and façade might function as easily concealed opening for places to hide cash or jewels, even the sorts of things others might never suspect had any value at all.  

Quick inspection of the study revealed a few components that might serve in such a fashion.  Among them were medallions at the corners of the door and window frames, along the elaborate built-in bookcases, and to the left and right of the fireplace, attached just beneath the mantle shelf. I presumed such opening would reveal a deep but narrow space.  Two doors, three windows, and an entire wall of shelving equalled 28 medallions.  There wasn't time to waste, so I decided the best method was to eyeball each for lopsidedness or failure to sit flush in place.  Any looseness might indicate wear and tear surpassing stationary use. Using the chair instrumental in bringing the ouija board to our attention to begin with as stool, I set myself to this task but came up short when I discovered each of the medallions at the windows and the doors paint sealed.  And the medallions along the shelves were all flush.  

Glad not to have wasted too much time in this pursuit, I set about removing books from shelves, five at a time, flipping through each carefully, feeling the plank of the shelf beneath and the wood behind to detect any anomaly.  This was time consuming but revealed nothing out of the ordinary.  By now I was becoming dejected and increasingly worried.  The sun lower in the sky, I saw beams of it peeking past the drapes at the center of three tall windows.  Now I pulled each to its corresponding side, let mid-afternoon light push through.  At first I only warmed myself in this, wondering why I hadn't bothered to bring more light into the room to start, but now I noticed something I hadn't before.  With my back to the door, it would have been virtually impossible to detect.    

From the outside of the study, the door was virtually mundane--heavy oak painted white, thick framework, medallions at the corners, nothing more. But from the inside, a fretwork panel of heavy design was fitted to meet the top of the door from corner to corner as if a transom window were hidden behind it.  And now, light pouring into graze the top of the desk in the center of the room hit a finely polished desk set, ricocheting to the fret work and passing through.  From behind, tiny glows of red and ember were cast against the white paint gingerbread.

Excitedly, I carried the chair across the room, stood on top of it hoping to budge the fretwork.  There was no such luck at this height.  I looked for something sturdy  to make me taller, but there wasn't anything else in here suitable for that. I'd have to grab a stool I'd seen in the kitchen earlier.  It troubled me to leave the study unattended, and I was not unafraid to travel the hall to the kitchen again.  The energy pushed from this room might have concentrated along that dark corridor, and--tired as I was--I worried that my resolve might be weaker now.   The best path, I decided, was through the front door and around the side of the house, and besides, 'I could use the fresh air,' I thought.

Opening the front door, surprise of warm air pressed against me.  For the better part of the last twenty-four hours, chill had held me in its grip, and now I basked in the warm mugginess of a typical Alabama fall day.  'Storms on the way,' someone said from the front walk, and when I looked down from my place on the porch, the broad smile of a tall man greeted me.  It didn't occur to me to wonder what he was doing here, and perhaps I already knew who he was.
'Miss Lucia, she's a fine woman, she told me you might need a few things,' and I walked to meet him with a firm, thankful handshake. His grasp was strong, and for a moment I pondered whether or not he might be just some local with a keen sense of what most couldn't see, some bright energy my aunt had detected from the other side, but his overalls and flannel shirt were old-fashioned even by farm standards, and the glow emanating from him spoke of peace and tranquility not found here on Earth.

'Name's Big Roy, Miss Julianne. And I'll help however I can. You got to know I love both those little girls.  Not one of them's an angel, but neither is they a devil.' And I was glad to find his grip strong now, if only for a moment.  He must've been a real force in life to bring such energy to me now.

""I've found a fret panel above the door in the study, Big Roy,"" I said.  ""And I need a ladder and maybe a hammer to remove it.""

Big Roy looked down for a moment, considered the peace of Heaven against the Hell of Life perhaps, then spoke.  'No, Ma'am.  What you need is a No.2 Goodell Brothers screwdriver.' Reaching into a pocket at his hip, he pulled out a relic to share with me.   'I made that fretwork for Mrs Moseley, put it up to hide a few things.' 

His dark marble eyes clouded, and he looked past the house to the back yard.  I followed the path his thoughts traveled, and suddenly we weren't in the front yard anymore.  Ahead of us stood the original kitchen, rock wall reminder of the boundaries between two converging worlds.  Within, two little girls working on some secret danced across the windows in silhouette.  The smell of fudge was heavy again, and laughter wafted, too, on convected breeze.

'That'll be Vassar Fudge,' Big Roy said.  'Never could stand the taste of it.  Mrs Moseley won't like it in the house, not since the fire.  But I swear, this place always smelled of barbecue and chocolate after that.' He shivered, tear at his eye, and I placed my left hand to his right arm, felt the sinew hard work makes, the strength of spirit hard life breeds, the exhaustion such projection brought from him. His memories were clues I could not cast away, but feeling the drain it made on his soul saddened me.

""Is this the only way, Big Roy?"" I asked sincerely, but he only smiled sadly back at me.

'Whatever it takes to bring peace, Ma'am.' Such is the nature of love and sacrifice, and now I committed the lessons Big Roy taught to memory, heart, spirit.

His pulse quickening at my fingertips, I felt the rush of energy course through me, inflate my heart.  Now was the time to prepare myself for the sort of vision that could drive some to madness, and just as I realized this, heat burst against my face like revelation of Armageddon.  Closing my eyes for only a moment, I turned now to see the pretty kitchen erupting in flames.  The shrieks of little girls trapped inside overwhelmed me, and now Big Roy ran toward the house as he had that day so many years ago, relived horrible moments, to break a window.  And there was Mary falling through to fall into his strong arms, but she reached back, scrambled to retrieve her sweet friend, the girl who might have been her sister always.  Big Roy pulled her more tightly to his chest, held her against the struggle she made, and ran from the porch, the pop and sizzle of pine planks harmonizing backdrop against the excruciating, rising melody of Sweet Dulcie's screams. 

Puddle of sweat and tears, I prayed for strength to continue as wails echoed through me.  And now I felt the whistling brush of silk against one cheek and the coarse scrape of wool against the other as two mothers ran to collect babies, only one to have her arms filled with a bundle of love ever again.  Big Roy passed Mary to her Mama's arms, and now he rushed to pull Mrs Moseley from the porch, just as the pretty gingerbreaded roof above it collapsed in spark and flame.  

Salt of sweat and tears at my lips, I wretched as the fragrances Big Roy had described--barbecue and chocolate engulfed me.

lifecmcs,0,3,1r635e,0,"Here is the previous story: http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qynx5/happened_to_me/[1]
     
Basically, this is a very scary apartment. Shortly after I saw the girl, things got quiet. I stopped watching TV alone in the house and started going to church more. When my mom, who didn't have a job, would leave the house, I would often tag along or go in my room where my sister and I both slept. she was 5 so she doesn't have any recollection of anything.

One day, it was a rainy day and my sister's friend had a birthday party. I was invited for some reason. It was a rainy, gloomy day but the festivals were making everyone happy so I guess I was happy as well. The party was very expensive as they were sorta rich and there were tons of events and foods and things to do. But enough of that story.
After we left the party, my parents decided to go to church. Naturally, as a energetic 9 year old, I was reluctant to leave so I told my parents to drop me off at home with my sister. The house was dark and it was raining so I was a little scared. but, once my mother had tucked me into bed, I fell asleep and I thought that was the end of that.
I believe I slept until night time because I heard the front door closing. I thought it was my parents so I yelled to mom, telling her I was hungry. But there was no reply. Instantly, I was awake and my pulse was pounding. I was suddenly paralysed (with fear? I don't know) and I could only watch as I heard footsteps come up the stairs. My sister, I could hear her breathing underneath me (we had a bunkbed) but she didn't seem hear a thing.
             
Then a creak, and moan as my bedroom door opened. I watched as a shadow grew between my feet and hovered over me. I believe I passed out with fear or something cause the next thing I knew, I was waking up and it was later at night and my parents really came home.

A couple days later, my sister came home with a drawing. i asked her what it was as I shivered in fear. She told me that she had seen the thing I saw, except it spoke to her while I was sleeping that day. It told her that it was related to her, that it knew mom. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I never told mom, who was still having nightmares about her miscarriage. But could it be the sister I never had?

Mrreeburrito88,0,7,1r5odg,0,"Ok so for the past three nights in a row I have had these kinds of ""dreams"" I don't know how better to describe them but here is the first night and I will right the other nights as I get time...
The happenings that have lead up to Tuesday night. I don't remember everything that happened to leading up to it. I tried to go to sleep early because I moved out of my house last month and I had been getting terrible sleep because I am forced to sleep on an air mattress. I am also staying at a friends house till I am able to move into my next house. I went to sleep around seven at night and them woke up at eleven that same night. I couldn't get back to sleep no matter how much I tried so I decided to start watching tv. After a while I got really thirsty so I went down stairs to get a drink of water. After I finished the water my stomach started to feel up so I went into the bathroom. I finished up in there and as I was leaving I started to get a feeling like a was being watched. I can even remember having the same feeling in the bathroom but I ignored it and just tooled around on my phone. Nevertheless I hurried up stairs and it felt as though I was being followed. I decided to ignore it and just lay down with my eyes closed and calm down. I did this for the next roughly thirty minutes and drifted off to sleep. With in minutes of me sleeping I again had the feeling of being pinned down and could not move. It had been months since the last time this happened but it almost felt as though it was going to happen. I cannot better explain the part other than I just new it was going to was coming. So after that I was a little freaked out but it had happened so many times in my past that I would get more annoyed than anything else. I then had a hard time falling asleep again. It took me hours to fall back asleep but nothing happened after I woke up I just would stay there in the bed annoyed that I could not fall back asleep. I am not sure if this is being triggered by the stress of me moving or what is happening. Alls I know is that I want it to stop. I will write another post about what happened last night and tonight when I get more time but this is all I can write for now.   ",Terrible dreams update 1,6
dinofinger,2,8,1r5mlv,0,"Ever since you're young, people have kept branding you ""you are you're parents"". You look like them, talk like them, even act like them when you have tried every single time carefully not to be just the same but you just can't get away with it. I don't want to be my parents. I am grateful that I am born alive as a man but why does they have to be my parents?

They said that, before you enter the physical world, you are a mere soul waiting turns to bond with little human figure inside a pregnant woman once God granted your passage. That's when the heart starts to beat and so does your responsibility in life, shaping the right future. Well, I don't mind that.
The only thing ticks me that, why can't I choose who my parents are? Why wasn't there a catalog of possible parents set before me right at the moment when I am going to bond with the physical world? Why? Why do I have to end up with them?

All I get was a social party mother who always half state of awareness back late at night and when in morning I rarely get to have breakfast from her. The only food on the table was microwaveable TV dinner or a call for delivery from any nearby restaurant. Chinese? I always have that for brunch. During holidays, we celebrate at my Aunt house or dine at any restaurant available. I barely even remember when was the last time my mom using the stove. Such a lovely mother.

And yet my so-called father tend to ignore me always. The only time we are together alone was when my 9th grade PTA meeting. That was when mom had her ladies night off, so she called. My father and I are rarely together because he always disappoints with my grade, his eyes blinds with my greatest-proud big brother in big business world who always provide him this material world of joy and such. I bet he is too overjoy to even remember that I exist. My big brother always said that I may think too much. Maybe I did.

In any case, why did I not act now? Why do I imagine I sit down properly on the road watching fire burn glazing right in front of me? My mind is shrouded with thought on my mother and father good points. We are on our way celebrate Thanksgiving at Aunt Maria's house. My parents are quarreling in the car while I was the one handling the steering wheel. Too loud, just maybe because of that if I may lost my focus we might crash right at the middle of fork road. In the bonnet I secretly hid fire crackers where me and cousins are planning to lit it tonight at Aunt Maria's. If we did crash, we will be fireworks. 

I'm nearing the fork road. If we did crash, I'm not sure that if I'm trying to prove God that I don't like his choice. I'm not sure if I'm happy if I ever let this happen. Just what if, what if I'm the one who choose my parents for all this time and I can never reset this ever.",I let this happen.,7
Undead31,0,2,1r0uz5,0,"So this happened about a year ago. I had been loopy for months but only like see shadows or hear the TV when it wasn't on which is nothing compared to what happened to me. I was home alone as I always am after my school day but today I saw and heard more things than usual but I thought nothing of it. I climbed the stairs and entered the bathroom and after certain events happened that I am not going to describe because I am not gross, I got up then washed my hands and went to the door which is when I heard a BANG! right on the door so I did what all manly people do..... locked the door and hid in the bathtub. Soon I began hearing foot steps but not just any footsteps but boots like combat boots on a hard wood floor. After about 5 minutes of marching I heard whistling of a man and the faint singing of a woman. This went on for about half an hour. After I got the courage to open the door I looked in the hallway and SAW............ no one...there wasn't anybody there I checked over the house twice and nothing! I received every possible test and I'm not crazy so what do you think happened?",Boots,2

I was sitting in bed reading my book assigned for school while eating pizza and drinking coke. Life couldn't be better right? Wrong. I was just reading page 13 when my parents said they are leaving for a party qnd are staying the nigth so i'm alone. I waited till they left and said bye. Then i sat down and continued reading. Thats when it happened. The letters started scrambling and formed a message it read: I'M WATCHING YOU! . Of course I immediately freaked out. I tried calling my parents but they didn't answer. I just thought its from being alone and started making a sandwich but as i lifted the bread knife it came out and wrote the word DIE with the knife on my skin I quickly ran to get the bandages for my hand thinking about whats going on. Then i saw her in the mirror. Blood red hair, no eyes just blood. I jumped and decided to go to bed because that always helps to pass time. 

Next morning my parents came home. I didn't tell them. I have never seen her again until now November 13th 2013 just last week. I was also staying home doing homework when i saw her write with her bloody fingers on my homework: I WILL GET YOU SOMEDAY! . I didn't see it on the homework when I turned in my homework the next day! Please help me with this i'm scared!!! Can I do anything?

Chibler1964,0,1,1qzu3b,0,"When this all occurred it was before the days of pre made stands, so I was up in some Jerry rigged quasi treehouse we had built as kids. We had another name for Jerry rigged back then, but it's more than slightly racist so I won't post it. 

As soon as I heard those gun shots I slung my rifle and started down the ladder we had nailed together with rotten two by fours pinched from a local construction site. In my haste I ended up more sliding down than stepping. At around the fourth rung from the bottom my leg caught between rungs but my body kept going. Unfortunately it was also my left leg, the one that was held together with plates and screws from an injury sustained playing ball in college. The sharp twang of the metal seemed to ring out, I know it didn't in real life but I swore I heard it in my head. I quickly gathered myself and starting limp running towards. Mick's stand. I didn't feel the pain really, the adrenalin took care of that. 

I used to run throught the woods like crazy as a kid, rocks, mud, uneven terrain, nothing stopped me. I've never run like this. I was stupid; I was just reacting, I should have called the sherrif, but I didn't. I just took off my mind half cocked, my rifle fully cocked. I ran until I couldn't run anymore, I ran until my chest heaved like a barrel ready to burst into its individual stags and cease to function. I ran like my life depended on it because micks life depended on it. When I got to the stand Mick wasn't there. I knew that was what I would find but I had hoped like a fool that he would be there. As I looked around my heart rate slowed and I became conscious of the in my ankle. It was bleeding through my cammo pants. Fuck it I thought, if Curt Shilling could pitch game six with a bloody ankle I could save Mick with the same. 

I took a look around the area, I didn't see much until I looked a few hundred yards west of his stand. There was a deer, huge rack, a real wall hanger. It was dead but I had been tied to the tree next to it. I looked at the area around it and saw drag marks. Someone had put that deer out there for Mick, and that somone had drug him away. Follow the tracks, it's just like hunting, find Mick, find him! These things just kept running throught my mind. It was tunnel vision, I couldn't think of anything else. I took off in the direction of the drag marks. 

My ankle was dragging, I knew it was damaged, I just didn't care. As long as I didn't think about it I would be fine. I followed those tracks for miles. I felt like I was being watched but I pushed the thought from my mind, nothing else mattered but finding Mick. I kept pushing on, my belt between my teeth to stifle me from crying out in pain. Finnaly I came to the end of the tracks. It was a cabin, one that hand been taken care of, half the roof had caved in, and the rotting edifice was covered in green pillow like moss. 

I stopped and froze for a moment, contemplating my next move. I was out of my mind, I didn't think. I walked up to the door and kicked it in with my steel toed boots. The door gave way easily, splintering old rotted wood was sent flying everywhere. Before I could see inside I heard whimpering, hoping it was Mick I charged into the building.

What I saw took me completely by surprise, there was Damion, Chuck's brother. He was chained to the ancient wood burning stove that sat in the corner of this one room cabin. ""Damion, you better tell me what the fuck is going on!"" I screamed. Damion just looked at me. It was a look I knew fairly well, he was coked out of his mind. I was so angry I just grabbed him by the neck and yelled. ""He made me do it, he told me I'd get a fix!"" He was yelling. ""What?"" I questioned as I shook him. The man, he made me, he made me! I needed my fix!"" He just kept yelling. I popped his nose with the butt of my rifle stock. ""What man!"" I yelled, ""The hunter, he's a hunter"" Damion choked out through tears. ""He made me, he made me show him the stands, and he asked about you guys, he was just going to rob you! I didn't know this would happen! I swear!"" He was out of his mind. ""What's happening, what's going on, where's Mick!"" I kept firing the questions. ""Mick's not gonna love through this, he already took him hunting, you can live run!"" He said. I was furious. I paced around the room a couple times, I didn't know what to do, then damion opened his mouth one last time. ""He gave me my fix, I needed it, I'm so sorry"" he wailed. I snapped, I lost it, I pulled out my sidearm and fired a whole magazine into his skull.

Damion was dead, I don't think I have to tell you that. I ignored his body and started searching the cabin. Aside from a few moldy blankets and some food refuse all I found was a scrap of paper, on it were a few type written words...

""Predators prey on the weak, to be the strongest predator is to never be weak""

I knew what he was doing with Mick, I bolted out the back door and saw the tracks made from an ATV. I started following them.

DarkOblivionSecrets,0,3,1qxnif,0,"I and my friends knew not to disturb the man at the end our street but us being dumb 17 year olds we decided to rob him.  As we walked up to the front yard we noticed the grass hasn’t been cut for a couple years, well that’s the last time I saw it cut.  The smell of the grass and old house instantly caught our breath but my friends decided to overlook it and go on up to his door.  

Going up to the door I sensed that something wasn’t right but they told me to shrug it off.  What my friends were planning to do was go inside his house and rob him without getting caught.  They said nobody lived here and so on but I knew someone lived here because every night I looked out my window at the old house to see a black silloute of a man standing at the top right window.  As my friends went on into the house but I noticed there was a very distasteful smell that smelled like burning hair.  My friends in their stupid minds didn’t notice it but I don’t know how since it was so intoxicating.

As we stood in the dark hall with flashlights blazing ahead us I constantly heard noises; soft quiet noises here and there.  The so called “leader” of our little expedition told us to split up and find anything of value.  After he got done talking we split off into groups, I went with my friend Gerard and I could tell he was nervous about this whole robbery.  As we searched the main floor we found little old necklaces and took them, but as we walked into the kitchen we found a note that was fairly new.  I read the note aloud to me and Gerard “Leave before the clock strikes twelve and I won’t harm you or choose to stay….Your choice”.  Gerard noticed that it was written in red ink as I looked at it I noticed that it definitely was not red ink.  We yelled so that everybody would come back to the main hall and we waited five minutes.  The five minutes passed and we were all regrouped.

I showed them the note and everyone told me to stop trying to scare them while Gerard looked at me with a faint expression.  Our leader told us to stop bluffing and find the loot.  I and Gerard kept looking while three people took the upstairs and one guy took the basement.  We ventured to the dining hall to only find old chairs sitting quietly with its brother the table.  Two minutes later it was 12:00 and the old grandfather clock signaled loudly.  After the clock stopped ringing we heard a scream from the basement and we instantly knew something was up.  As the whole group met up again at the hall we all rushed downstairs.  Flashlights were pointed near the old boxes and wires as we ventured on near the back of the basement we found something disgusting.  There, lying on the ground was our pal Tom surrounded by a pool of dark red blood.  Not only was he dead, someone had cut off his hands.  As we threw up and looked on in disgust I noticed to a note pinned to Tom’s lifeless corpse by a nail.  I grabbed the note nearly throwing up in the process to only find this written “I see you didn’t heed my warning so now I want to play a fun little game called Hunt the Fools...Ha Ha Ha good luck.”  After I read it aloud all of us bolted upstairs to only find the door locked and another note pinned to the door again I read it aloud “Trying to escape eh you should’ve taken the opportunity when I let you go”.

Now we were all scared and scared to face the fact that we are stuck here with this maniac. Knowing that only made us even more nervous.  Since Tom had died there were only four of us now making us split up into two groups.  I and Gerard decided to try and find a weapon of some sort in the kitchen but all the drawers were empty.  

An hour passed not knowing who was next to go and that alone was killing us.  As me and Gerard waited ever so patiently with our backs against the wall in the dining room we decided to talk.  He started off with “Man I didn’t know I was going to die at this age, I wanted to have a family when I was older and now all of that is ruined.” Taking it in, I replied with “I... I thought this was going to be easy but obviously were going to have to fight for our future”.  He just looked at me and nodded.

Five minutes we heard another scream cut off by the pounding of someone running down the stairs.  It was our friend Matt he called out for us and we answered with “In the dining room”.  He ran into where we were at panting.  He told us “He... He got Andrew... that sicko killed him he’s dead we didn’t even see him coming he ambushed us and killed him and stabbed me in the arm”.  He showed us only to find us looking at his sliced arm in disgust.  He slumped down beside us looking at us knowing our fate.  

He gave us a note he said that the guy dropped when he killed Andrew I looked it over and read “It’s sad you idiots didn’t leave… well I’ll help you out… there’s a knife taped to the bottom of the dining room table… Come on and show me what you got!” 


",The Man on Chicken Farm Lane,3
Narokami,0,4,1qvqr7,0,"Haha holy shit... [Masterpiece](http://creepypasta.wikia.com/wiki/Masterpiece). I've only ever had one night terror in my life and it was really similar to that experience.

Late at night in REM sleep, I totally thought I was awake. My bed was placed on a wall far away from the door to my bedroom and at an angle so I could see the door if I faced the right way. I had been up reading, but I was tired and must have passed out. A noise 'woke me up' sometime around one or two in the morning and I at first thought it was my older brother walking around.

His room was behind mine, almost shared walls, but there was a kitchen and two hallways to actually get to his room from mine so I thought nothing of it.

But you see, if I placed my head on the pillow just right, you know like cupping an ear against it? I could hear everything going on in the house. My heartbeat, our dogs' snores, the tick tock of the clock in the living room, and footsteps.

But footsteps are ordinary. My brother walks around late at night, he's a night owl! The footsteps started in my brother's room. I heard his sliding door open, I heard it close. I heard his feet stepping around one of our Rotties, but my brother must have been hungry because he walked out to the kitchen, opened the kitchen door and then closed it after a short while. But then... then he walked towards our parents room. I had some minor alarm bells ringing: he wouldn't do that in the day time much less when they're sleeping, he and our parents fight a lot. He must have stood outside their door for a full two minutes before walking away.

At this point I was fully 'awake' and moved to get out of bed. I wanted to know what he was doing! It wasn't until he was walking down the hallway to my room that I realized that my brother wasn't home.

He was working long shifts that week, sleeping at a friends house. 

Our two Rottweilers would have protected me from an intruder. They would have woken up. They would have done *something*.

I jumped back in to bed. The footsteps had stopped. I could feel a weight on my chest. I got under the covers and pretended to sleep but in my haste I had placed my back to the door. It was too late to turn around. It would know. My heart was beating a thousand beats a minute and each beat could not have been any louder.

My bathroom door, right next to my bedroom door, swung open in silence but for the faintest squeak of the hinge. No sound. No footsteps. Silence.

I knew it had come to kill me. I didn't know if it was a murderer or a spirit or something else, I was only eleven and scared out of my mind. I thought of all the things I had enjoyed, all of the things I certainly had not... the house was dead. There was no noise. The only sound I could hear was the blood being pumped through my veins, my ragged breath.

The door swung open. Slowly. The air pressure in the room shifted and... a weight entered. An oppressive, dangerous weight that blocked out the light of my own thoughts. I don't know what it was. I don't know what it looked like, my back was to the door. I was paralyzed and I couldn't move to save my life.

I can't die like this, PLEASE... please. Please, I thought. Please no. I had tried to kill myself almost a year before that night, tried to drown myself; I still wanted to die. It was just *so heavy*. I thought through the situation as fast as I possibly could. I imagined all the outcomes, I tried to conjure some kind of imaginative spirit to protect me, tried to will the damn thing away.

But it was there. It was real, and it was hard to breath. Just having it in the room was suffocating me.

It stood there, judging me. Silently. It was weighing my worth. Enjoying my terror. I resigned myself to death: I didn't want to die but... I yearned for death, I still do.

But is death the answer? Will my death solve anything? It wasn't necessarily a solution I wanted. But would I care? Would dead-me care about all that?

I explored the universe for an eternity within the few seconds it had been in my room, I was looking for an answer. I didn't find one. 

My chest was crushed, my eyes were bleeding. My mind was made whole for such a short time and then splintered worse than it had ever been. 

It was okay, I thought; Mom and Dad will understand. They'll get through this, they'll be strong. To honor my memory, you know? I threw the covers off and ran towards the darkness by my too-recently-open door but it was gone. It had left the moment I was able to move.

Just a night terror.
____
The next day I remembered this terrifying dream and asked my father if he had gotten up in the night, had maybe gone to the fridge. He said he thought that I had gone to the fridge. That I had stood outside their bedroom for a bit. That I had then gone to my room and lied down.

He asked me where the cuts in my forearm came from. Deep, red furrows. He asked me why I looked exhausted, why I looked as if I had been crying; I couldn't tell him. In my search for the key to the universe that night I had stumbled upon what had wanted me dead. I had seen it.

But it didn't want me to know. It wasn't just a night terror. It was Death and it came for me, it left without me. 

I wasn't sure which was more terrifying.

LadyDevastation,2,5,1qv2wt,0,"They all looked right through me. The way they always do. Even as I walked among them, even in their midst they looked at every part of me except for my face, failing to notice the disgusted look that plastered my face as I tried my best to keep my emotions stable.

I suppose you’re wondering where so much hate came from, oppression. That’s where it came from, years and years of their games. But now, now it’s my game. I make the rules, and they’re none the wiser. The dress I was wearing, a sexy blue chiffon with skinny straps that hated to stay up, that was stolen from a crusade last weekend. The diamond studs, a plumage from a few months back. The strappy sandals, those I had snatched from one of my first tangos with the elite. 

It’s pathetic the way they all fawn over their material goods, like sweating in expensive material was any different than it was in k-mart clothing. Like somehow their Dior made them better. Petty, I know. But you have to understand one thing, these were the people who had taken away any chance I had to a normal life, repeatedly they had reminded me I was no more than the label I wore.

Standing among them made me sick, but I took comfort knowing it wouldn’t be long. My idle conversation with the too tipsy escort that came with senator what's-his-name wouldn’t last long. My eyes were set on a real prize, a gem in this world of red bottom shoes. He stood a sturdy six-foot man with a smug smile plastered on his face. His tie perfectly placed, shoes shinning in the dim lighting of the room. I excused myself from the sloppy blonde and twisted my face into a flirtatious smile.

He could have seen it coming, he really could have. It was his own damn fault he took the time to stare at my exposed legs and not my eyes. If only he had chosen to stop thinking about his own gain for a moment to think about his safety. Even as he took me up the stairs to give me a tour of one of his many lovely homes, even as he shut the door to the bedroom, even as he poured himself a glass of hard liquor… he thought about nothing but himself. 

My eyes said it all, that hungry thirst was glowing in my emerald eyes. He just had to really look at them to see. Instead he was busy waiting for me to stop talking so he could. Too bad. So sorry.

I remember glancing at the pigs finger, he hadn’t even taken the moment to slide off his ring. An experienced cheater who couldn’t care to give a fuck. So, as he poured his glass I took the time to give him what he really deserved, I served the justice the rest of the world couldn’t.

This was a work of art. You really should have seen it, the way the knife I’d snagged from the kitchen on our little tour plunged into his back. The way it disappeared into him. It was truly beautiful. The deep red staining his expensive suit, the gurgling noises he made as he began to choke on his own blood. It was truly beautiful. I waited a moment and looked at my work, waiting and watching as his eyes rolled into the back of his head, truly beautiful.

I then proceeded to take a moment to ruffle up my hair and slam my fist against my cheek, creating an illusion that I knew would work. No jury would ever argue with me on this one. Then I had let out a blood curdling scream, people came faster than expected. Attention whores bawling louder than the next. It was a sight.

Bryce333,1,6,1qq9mi,1,"All right NoSleep, I’ve been debating whether I should post this story for a while now. I’ve been a long time lurker, and it was actually this experience which both sparked and stifled my thirst for paranormal happenings. On one hand, it gave me a mystery which I couldn’t solve, which is always exciting. On the other hand, it scared me so bad that it’s usually easier to not think about it. And of course I can’t tell anyone at home about it, because they’ll just think I’m crazy or trying to scare them, (Probably the latter, my penchant for telling scary stories as a child is finally coming back to haunt me). 

I live in a relatively small community up in northern Utah. It’s very outdoorsy, we’re surrounded, or rather located in, a small woods. It’s very pretty, being surrounded by trees all the time, especially in the winter. It can snow pretty heavily here, and the aftereffect of such snowstorms is a pristine, unbelievable environment. I moved here when I was 12, and I’m currently 18. This experience happened last winter, when I was seventeen and a senior in High School. 

I was on a diet at the time, because I wanted to lose fifty pounds by graduation. I had always been overweight as a child, and I had finally crossed the point into actual obesity. (The diet ended up working, I went from 205 to 150 pounds the day of graduation, and I’ve maintained ever since). I took diet pills for the first while to help me adjust to only eating 1,000 calories a day, but one of the side effects of Amphetamines is Insomnia. As such, I was always up and restless after everyone else in my family had gone to bed.

It had been a bad day, I was at a friends house for his birthday and had eaten a lot of cake. Worse still, I hadn’t gone jogging that day, so I tossed and turned all night thinking about those heavy calories sitting in my stomach. Finally resigning myself to the fact that I wasn’t getting any sleep, I figured I might as well exercise. I LOVE jogging at night, especially in my area. The trails are well-kept, the scenery is beautiful, and the silence feels sacred, in a way. My dog, Mickey, never goes to sleep at night until I’m asleep. She’s a pretty active dog, and so when she saw me getting ready, she started scratching at the door. I decided to take her with me, since I knew if I didn’t she would continue scratching at the door until she woke up everyone in my house. 

We set out at about 3 AM, (I know, it’s late. But imagine spending four hours doing nothing but lying in your bed. I didn’t really care what time it was, I just wanted out of my room). There had been a light snowfall all day, which had died down earlier in the night. The woods were absolutely beautiful; everything was covered in a light layer of snow. Visibility was pretty good as well. The moon was bright and reflected well off of the snow, illuminating the path ahead of me nicely. I was wearing sweatpants and a hoodie, so the cold didn’t really bother me, and my dog loves it. 

I decided to take a jogging route by the river, making sure to keep a close eye on Mickey so that she didn’t fall in. I let her off leash and we were off. 

This is where it gets creepy…. About halfway through, I’m huffing and puffing when I suddenly see my dog stop right in front of me. I almost run her over, which completely throws me off and I stop, panting. I lift my head to berate her, when I see she’s completely rigid with her hackles raised. Any dog owner know that this is NOT a good sign. I immediately look around, searching for wild animals. But there’s not anything dangerous living in this area, the most threatening thing around is a community of feral cats. 

Mickey then started to whimper, slowly backing up to the side of the road. I followed, crouching down and petting her. “What is it…” I started, then stopped. A complete infusion of dread washed over me. Kind of like the feeling you get when you realize you’ve missed a flight, or that your car’s been stolen. It’s a mix of panic and fear. Now times it by 100 and you might experience the feeling I got. I swear, the temperature dropped by ten degrees. I looked ahead, and I shit you not, there was this black carriage making it’s way around the bend. 

Let me reiterate that. A CARRIAGE. One of those wheeled wagon things used in the olden times, pulled around by horses. Except this one didn’t have horses. I have no idea to this day how it moved, it just kept creaking along at a snails pace. I can’t put into words how terrifying this thing was. It was like every pore of my body was burning, telling me to GET THE FUCK AWAY from this thing. It’s very presence seemed wrong, evil. 

It was draped in these mothy, chewed up black curtains. The windows in it were tinted black, and the wheels were pure black. Which looking back, should have given me another tip that something was wrong about it. It wasn’t until I got home that I realized that it’s wheels should have been covered in the snow sticking to the ground. It wasn’t the kind of snow that turned to wet mush the instant it touched something, this was the hard kind that you dragged in behind you whenever you went for a walk. 

And the smell was absolutely awful. It’s the sour, putrid smell that only really comes with death. It invaded all of my senses, my eyes started watering from the acrid stench. I can only imagine how my poor dog handled it. This thing was moving at a snails pace, right down the middle of the lane. No horses, nobody up front, just a black carriage smelling like death taking a ride at 3 AM in the morning. 

My dog and I were frozen on the side of the road. It’s like all of my muscles were locked in terror, every part of my body was SCREAMING at me telling me to get away. To this day I have no proof of why I had that kind of reaction, but I’m convinced something deep down inside me knew that this carriage meant trouble. My dog was absolutely rigid, not moving an inch, not taking her eyes off of this thing. 

As it came towards us, all I could tell myself was to stay as still as possible. Movement, talking, or otherwise providing signs of life in this dead space wasn’t a good idea. I think my dog felt the same way, because we stayed still as statues until it came up to us. I don’t think we even breathed. 

It was about four feet away from me when it passed us. The smell was unbearable, and I did the best I could to avoid looking into the tinted windows. I was crying, but not because of the smell anymore, but because I was so terrified. I know, it seems silly to be crying about a dead carriage being pulled by God knows what, but the feelings you got from being around this thing… it was so unnatural and WRONG. 

As it pulled away, I started to breathe again. I was still frozen, because it was just behind us. And that was when my dog let out a low whimper. 

The thing stopped dead in its tracks. The temperature dropped another ten degrees, and looking at my dog, her pupils seemed to take up her entire eye sockets. I could hear this quiet rumbling, or rather SENSED it. It was like the feeling you get right before a movie plays in a theater, when the lights start going down and the audio is just crackling to life. 

And then I heard one of the carriage doors open.

My dog bolted, and after a second of pure hell, I did too. I didn’t look back, I was running faster than I had ever done in my entire life. I kept my head down the entire way, to make sure I didn’t see anything else. (And also, partially because I didn’t want to be like those dumb bitches in the horror movies who got slaughtered because they tripped on a tree root). And it wasn’t until I got home that I realized… there were no tracks in the snow. That thing had been treading along for minutes in the type of snow that stuck to the bottom of your boots, but I remember running away on snow that was completely smooth. 

When I got home, I couldn’t sleep for the entire night. My dog was restless as well, she kept circling around me the entire night, whimpering. It had probably only been five or ten minutes, but it felt like it lasted an eternity. It took me a while to recover, but slowly, going back into the woods became less scary. I never take that path though, and I NEVER go at night anymore. Even if it’s only eight or nine, I make sure I’m either at my place or a friends place. 

One last thing… this is probably completely unrelated. But like any fast, rushing river, people have drowned in ours. But the bodies aren’t always found, which is understandable. And most of the “drowning” happen at night, which again, is understandable. People are usually drunk or can’t see where they’re going, and one wrong step and they’re in it. But after my experience… after seeing what goes on in that road… is possible that people DON’T drown? It’s just assumed that if you go out at night near a river and don’t return, you fell in. But maybe, something else happened to those people.

And maybe that something almost happened to me.

mr_nosleep,2,11,1r7pum,0,"I was trapped in a boiler room. *So what do you do in a scary situation like that?* Most people panic or forget what to do. I'm currently trapped in this room. *How did I get locked in here?* Oh right, my friends wanted to see if there was any loot in a weird factory on a November night. It was just another pitch black night in rural nowhere. Maybe I was foolish--no, I am foolish to have listened to my friends. Maybe they weren't stupid. Maybe they were just curious of the old paint cracked factory in the middle of the woods. We had to steal my dad's wire cutters to get past the fence. Most of the doors were locked and rusted. I looked up and there was a billowing tower. It must have been as tall as my middle school. The tower was dark and hard to see. 

Then I get a yell from the rocket scientist of the group. He found a way in. It was a vent that lend to a lower room. The room was barely lit, and we didn't hear anyone. The vent had grippable bars that we could safely climb down with. As we looked around the room, I could see where the light was emanating from. All of the metal in the room was visible, but there was no light source. Everyone was confused, yet we ignored that too. One of the guys bumped into a massive tank with pressure gauges. This must have been an old soda factory, as I noticed a trashcan full of Colas. 

The room was pretty dark. Luckily we had our phones, which didn't have much other use than lighting the way. We didn't have a signal down here. I was worried that our light would attract an unwanted guest. *Hey what does this sign mean?* Asked... a friend. It was a square with smaller squares within it. There number 4 was three of the squares. And... I'm sorry... I'm trying to type this on my phone before it's too late.. and I can't remember my friend's names... 

*breathing*

*I really feel terrible right now.* 

We explored further down the hallway when one of the guys started gasping for air. He didn't want to stay anymore and just left. I heard a loud metallic noise in his vicinity. That must have been the vent door... 

*breathing*

The other friend was feeling okay, but it doesn't look like he's okay right now because he's dead. It started with a nose bleed, I helped him back to the first room we came from, but it was too late. The vent door was shut. My friend was dead... 

*gasp*

I can not remember my friend's names...

I feel so exhausted right now...

It must have been daylight, and our parents must be worried sick. I'm worried. I hear deafening noises pulsate through the pipes. The room began to heat up. It was hotter than my houses boiler room. I can also hear people wahajtlking steadily on the floor above me.

I'm too tired to tshfype anymore...

""My grandmas glowing! And my dad!"" He said, coming back in the room.

 I frown. ""Your grandmas been dead for years."" I say, chilled.

what i realized the gold and the creature with the eyes of blue are both like guard dogs and their masters are in control of them blue acted out of instinct. it has no final destination like visions where i see realities different from our own(theroy from first post in series). 

 changes since last post -moving didn't help much just bought me more time. i also purchased some throwing knives since my last update not due to the creatures just because i was losing my sense of home and slight sense of security from moving from the house i grew up in.

warning: i may ramble a bit with exlpaimations due to me having high funtioning autism and it causes me to have longer explainations than most people. i also have slightly bad social skills  due to it. also sorry about spelling and grammar i am on a mobile phone and it is half an hour until midnight for me i wasn't feeling well today so i am a bit tired and half of this was typed 4 days ago i just fell asleep before typing certain parts out that only i would have understood and i fixed and  made readable sense of itso you are lucky for now that i formatted what i did i will do a spelling and grammar edit tomorrow.

The thing that marked the change was the blue creature appeared just after i shut my eye lids and they felt stuck shut. I didn't bother trting to open them i knew it was no use and that the blue one was safe but not the gold one. So i kept trying to switch into a dream but none would take the creature started to make a half choking half growling sound over and over like it was choking on a word before it choked out the word protect then left.

i normally can start my dreams off then fall asleep into them but i haven't been able to gaurd my mind. i can normally just pick a theme eg. horror story abandon building and spy  every so often i will get an odd dream that my mind can't draw on my most recent dream because the normal ones seem to make a storyline like last spring a t-rex and i were talking and it was wearing a monacle and top hat while drinking champane in a ruined section of a city  and then from down the road walnuts got fired at me i ran forward and cracked them with my bare hands until they stopped. this time though it was they hacked in to a dream i had recently.

the recent dream i had fallen asleep while emotions i had were swirling so it randomized and it was that people on my list of people i trust that was pulled from my memories.
I would be getting ready for a formal dance at the school i went to before my dad moved yet in the dream i had moved to the  town the high school i went to is in. i could see the school in the dream from the house i was in and it was a bright neon green house with a picket fence and elegant hand carved wooden gate there are no houses like that near the school though and a cop knocks on the door of the house and my mom answers it and the cop asks for me and mom says i am getting ready to go to a school dance. the cop explains why he is there is to get me to come with him to talk out a hostage situation because the person with the hostage asked to see me. 
So i slip a throwing knife of the new set mentioned above into each pant leg pocket. then say that he can enter my room. i then ask if i can bring either a throwing knife or a wooden stake for defence should i be used as hostage depends what person from my trust list it is being held hostage already in the dream.

(I have trust lists because my lack of social skills makes it hard to make friends so i classify them as aquaintences with varying levels of my trust whether i am friends with  them or not is there call but in the dream after the dream completes it restarts and gets the next person on the lists.)

I get the ok from the cop who says hopefully it won't get to that. fast foreward dream the person with the hostage has the most defendable place in the school and the only possibilities for escape is the window behind  him or at least the body shape looks male. i will refer to him as chompers due to him having pure gold and silver teeth alternating so it goes silver-gold-silver-gold-etc. i first percieved chompers as a being to represent stress then i would be called to go stand near by, chompers holds a glock 26 pistol a common pistol in military games eg socom in each hand (right hand against hostage's head and the left one points at me) then i offer a hostage swap and hand the other hostage the defence weapon i had up my sleeve. then i stand so my back faces chompers while he demands certain politcians be eliminated and vast sums of money as if i was a powerful bargining chip the cops can't complete his ransom with the assination call. so he threatens me saying any last wishes i say i wish to hear a song from my phone and ask if i am allowed to reach in my pocket to get it. chompers says yeah so i grab a throwing knife and stab back wards near intestines with the left throwing knife and jab his thigh at the same time as i dropped and ducked the cops took thier chance to shoot him.
Each time he would normally fall and i would see the bloody muscles of his face when his head hit the floor the only difference now is his eyes have been like snake eyes bright red with gold pupils instead of just turning to empty sockets.

Could it be stress but what if it is two entities battling in my mind one being instinct and one being stress because the walks i would take around the block were to eliminate or at least vent off stress and the slight paranoia during the encounters let them cross into reality and be anchors for their masters if so could it be only my own brain is the only one with a frequency and pattern they can survive",weird walk around the block and weird dream weird cat thing common factor in both (update 2),2
[deleted],3,5,1qz2ii,0,"Dear readers,

So nice of you to read my story. I have actually never written one but I am just really curious what you think about some things that I have experienced. Lately I have been reading a lot of stories about sleep paralysis on nosleep. And this reminded me of this thing that happened to me about 2 months ago.

First of all you should know I am from the Netherlands so I am sorry for bad grammar. 
I used to live in a small village in a somewhat older house. So creaking noises were not uncommon. But I have always had a connection with the supernatural. And I also believe that I have this sensitivity for it. For example I would be able to feel energies from several friends their passed away family members. In some rare cases I have even seen them.

Anyways at my parents house I used to have this little attic in my bedroom. And from my room there was a stair and if you would walk on it you would be standing next to my bed. I remember when I was really young, around 8 years old. When some days in a row it would sound like somebody was walking up my stairs. Naturally the first times my parents would shake it off as just wood making the sounds they make when it is colder or warmer. But we all know that sounds like that doesn’t sound the same as somebody climbing up my small stairs. So since my parents didn’t believe it could be something else I stopped telling them. And I started opening my door and keep on the light in the hallway. Of course when I heard the sounds again I would check if there was a shadow or something in the light falls. And of course there would be nothing. So after this I stopped checking. Until one night the creaking sounds were back and would stop at the last step. My eyesight was not towards it and I was too afraid to turn around and see what was watching me so I pretended to be asleep. That was when I almost had a freaking heart attack because some crazy woman was screaming in my ear!! When I turned around it stopped and there was obviously nothing.

The next couple of years nothing really specific happened as far as I remember, at least nothing that has a connection to this story I guess. From time to time I would hear mumbling voices and footsteps but nothing out of the ordinary. 

Nowadays I live alone in the city, in a small apartment where no crazy supernatural things happen. Untill 2 months ago. I was just doing a nap after a busy day at work when it seemed like I was awake but at the same time I wasn’t. At that moment it felt like this was not the first time this was happening to me. And I also felt really in danger. I couldn’t move even though everything in my eyeshot was normal and I was sleeping, or dreaming or awake. I am still not sure. And that is when she shuffled into my sight, first she was just looking at me. Her face was not visible because there was this sort of hood over her head. Actually I was not even sure if it was a woman because she was wearing a big black robe and this big hood which covered everything. But deep down I just knew it. And I knew her, I had seen her previously. Back in my mind I recognized her from passed times but I could not remember her, it was like I had some sort of block in my head that contains all information about her.

She came closer to me and started to talk to me. At least her mouth was moving but I did not hear anything. I was freaking out, I was going crazy inside of my mind because I couldn’t move and there was this crazy bitch standing next to my bed which was known to me somehow. All of a sudden she jumped on me and somehow she was totally covered with my blanket. I couldn’t breath because she was so heavy on me. It was like she sucked out all my energy and I got weaker. I was sure I was dying and she would be the last thing/person I had seen in my short life. 

The moment I was thinking fuck it, was the moment I could move again. I threw her off me and pulled the blanket. That’s when I saw her face. I knew I wanted to know how it looked for years. And it was horrible, she was like a really tiny 5000 years old woman. 

And then I “woke up” the same way I was laying in my bed in my dream and she was nowhere to be seen. I was soaked with sweat and out of breath.

What do you think this could have been? I personally think this was sleep paralysis and that I have had it earlier but I just can’t remember the precious encounters. Or do you think this was some sort of entity?

Stay safe, no sleep.

I just had the strangest dream I think I could have ever experienced.

I was there, looking in on this conversation. 

I was a little girl sitting in a room and a little boy was sitting across from the table. This part I forgot what we were doing. The room was naked, practically, with one wall being full windows leading outside, a normal door , could see trees, people, sidewalks, so on and so forth outside. Myself (the little girl) and the boy started having a conversation about something, he started to ask certain questions, football and such and myself (the little girl) started saying “I remember this one time after I had gastric bypass I had a turkey sandwich and I…” The little boy interrupted me right there and said “I do not want to hear this”; got up and proceeded to the door. Myself got mad, got up, went to the little boy and quickly finished the sentence “I remember this one time after I had gastric bypass I had a turkey sandwich and I ate it so fast I threw up and started crying really hard” and started just laughing. The little boy looked up at myself and said “I would have just stuck to football”. All the sudden this vehicle came out of no where, and I was in the state between being awake and sleeping, I heard this soft radio signal sound and a faint female voice say ‘hello? can anyone hear me?” I heard me, myself, me, as I am typing this reply “yes”. The female voice said “Can you do us a favor?”. I woke up.

Part II, A Lonely Dream  http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qof0q/a_brief_history_part_ii_a_lonely_dream/

Shortly after my first experience with this Demon, entity, god or whatever it was, me and my mom were talking about visions that the prophets in the church had, eventually we got into our dreams, you know, back and forth( this is where we talked about the dreams I mentioned in my previous story), until I decided to deaden the atmosphere, and tell her about my experience and the dream I had days after, needless to say, she was terrified. thinking I had encountered Lucifer himself, she asked if I offered to shake his hand (In mormon belief, if you think  you may be in the presence of an angel, you are advised to ask for a handshake, a legitimate angel would be able to shake your hand, a Demon would kindly Refuse, and Satan would go in for the handshake, but his hand would pass through yours, considering he has no body) I smirked ""Yeah next time I'll ask him if he wants to shake my hand after I finish worshiping him"" I said, smugly. 

My dad got a better job in Farmington, Nm  and we moved to my grandparents, I didn't have any problems since then and I had all but forgotten about the ordeal until I woke up one night, petrified with terror, I had a cold sweat all over my body and it felt like there was no oxygen in the room, I was trying to breathe, but it was extremely difficult, my eyes were darting rapidly from each shadow in the room I was staying in, I don't really know how to explain it, but I could not move, like my mind could not communicate with my body.

 hours seemed to go by, all of a sudden I heard a loud bang, I would have jumped right out of my skin if I weren't immobilized. My eyes flashed to the source of the sound. My closet was open, I could have almost swore it was shut. Silence...like nothing...just voidness, I was getting scared, I tried to call for help but all that came out was a whisper. I was still staring at the closet, the blackness seemed unreal. I prayed. I prayed to god nothing would happen, prayed that I could just go back to sleep, but then, out of the darkness, a pale bony hand reached out and grabbed the edge of the closet and seemed to use it as leverage to pull what was following out of the blackness. The robed figure walked out of the closet, this time was a lot more intimidating than the last, I was terrified of the man. with each step he took, my fear grew several times over, until he stopped to the left of me, lurching over my bed, he sat there for minutes just looking at me. Then he came down and sat right next to me, much like a parent would when reading stories. In My mind, I was screaming, I am almost certain that I was crying, although I cannot remember if I could, I do remember that I was in complete Terror, and I realized that the feeling seemed to be emanating from this man. I could not see him at all but I could feel what he was feeling, if that makes sense. I could feel his entertainment at watching a small child try to cower and scream but could not. after a minute of just sitting by me he took his hand and brushed it lightly against my skin making it freeze on contact. I could only lie down and watch. He kept brushing my skin, his head tilted to the right and in my mind I heard the words ""Never forget me again"" in an old cruel voice. he stopped brushing and stood up and walked to the closet, he walked in and turned around, his hand on the door, and then, He slammed it shut, right as the door  banged, the room was filled with yellow light, my eyes hurt. My mom came rushing into the room and embraced me, I was cold, she was hushing me, telling me that it would be ok.... It wasn't until now that I realized that my throat was sore, apparently I had been screaming for several seconds. I cried into my mothers shoulder.  She shrugged it off as a night terror, I never told her about that time I saw the man, I thought I was crazy at the time, I must have been jumping at shadows for weeks... I was sleeping with the lights on. but as time went on I graduated middle school and  became a freshman in Highschool. The memory of the hooded man began to fade away and I started sleeping with the lights off, as it was already hard enough to get sleep with all the extra work. Eventually, He was only something I would think of when me and my cousin went camping and told scary stories around the fire, I never told the story about my experience in farmington, but people would always ask about "" The night I   met Satan"" but school drowned out any other distractions from my work. eventually we moved to Kirtland, just ten minutes from Farmington. Little did I know that this would be a lifechanger for me and that the man was not too happy at all with me.

ps I am actually living in the same house that I had this experience in, if you would like pictures of the closet, tell me how to put pictures on this damn thing, the way the closet is made is really weird and if you slam it it makes a real loud bang, but yeah. and before you ask, no, I would never even go into that room when it is dark, much less sleep in it.",A Brief History: Part III The New House,4

judison,3,13,1qqual,0,"Hey guys, it's November and that means uni exam time.. as I am stressed to the max.

Recently something happened to me and I'm freaking out... everyone thinks I'm going mentally retarded because of exam stress but I'm serious, something is happening!!! PLEASE LISTEN TO MY STORY AND HELP ME OUT ... I REALLY REALLY CANT...UGH ... I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO... IM PRETTY SCARED....

Ok first let me give you some background information, I'm 21, female university 3rd year student. I have recently moved out of home in a suburban apartment and my neighbour is an annoying 32 year old horny twit who occasionally swings by knocking on my door hoping for me to allow him to give me some special ""exam stress relief"", but I never really answered the door. 

Right now I can't stop crying or shaking as I'm typing this... but ok so basically my story started at the local video store. I am a horror fanatic, I'm always at the horror section searching for new movies to watch.

Unfortunately after 7 years of watching 1-2 horror movies a day I had ran out of options and there was nothing new to watch. I keep digging around the old vintage stock for an old movie I've probably missed but nothing. Just when I was about to give up, at the very back of the DVD pile I spotted a black box with no barcode or label on it. Inside was a video tape with the title reading ""horror tape 1"" and since I was one of the few ancient people who still had a video tape player, I stupidly though ""OK! Good enough"". 
This was properly the dumbest mistake I could ever make.. 

I went to the counter to borrow my movie but for some odd reason the line was absolutely massive, I knew it was going to rain soon and I forgot to bring my umbrella (Probably a sign to leave the tape and GTFO) so I just sneakily walked out with the tape, there was no barcode so It's not like I would get caught. Karma got me back good though. 

So when I got back I set up my old video tape player, popped in the tape and played it. And god the first thing I saw was static.....WTFFFFFFF I thought it was a dud tape, hence the no label or barcode. Frustrated and wet, I just left it on and went to dry my hair from the rain, 2minutes later the tv made a boom and the once static image screen went to a scene of an old misty farm with a well in the middle.

At the time I was thinking and you would've also been thinking the same ""GREAT a dodgy cheap imitation version of the ring"" and you know what, the damn creep long haired bitch came right on que crawling out of that goddamn well. 

What was really interesting about this was she was holding a hacksaw... pretty sure this wasn't in the original. A few moments later and she was out of the well and I guess walking towards the screen? forward?.. you know what I mean. 
Head down, droopy arms, slow staggered walk and dragging a hacksaw along, this was on the horror movie scale alright. The visuals was amazing and dark and twisted, I liked it and decided to sit back and enjoy abit. After 2minutes she was still walking.... 5minutes still walking... 7 minutes..10minutes etc, the only thing different was the scenery as she travelled from places to places.

I was getting annoyed and bored and decided to turn the tv off, but as
I pressed the off button it didn't turn off...even more annoying. Something at that point really caught my interest.. the scenery looked ...familiar? I'm pretty sure she was walking past the primary school that was 2 or 3 streets away from my apartment. I was a little freaked out but the thrill turned my horror loving instinct on so I kept watching. 

Eventually she was getting closer and closer to my apartment, she was now at the next block away and slowly she was on my block. My assumption at the time was that it was a pre-recorded tape my friends made me and tactically plan to make me watch and scare me, highly unlikely but what else was there to think?

This is where I really got freaked out, I heard the engine of my other (non-horny) neighbour car drive past my apartment and within 10seconds I saw her car drive past in the video as well....WTF WTF.... this isn't normal. 
I began to get shivers and I froze as she turned to the front of my apartment block. She just stood there with her hacksaw for 3 seconds and suddenly began to start walking again towards the apartment block.

Up the stairs she went and I just helplessly watched, by now I was in tears. Up the stairs she continued to walk, she was on level 2 and I was on level 7. I remember just suddenly pouncing up and grabbing my baseball bat and standing in front of door looking out into my keyhole. 

Finally she was on level 6, and I stared at the staircase waiting for her.
 As I turned to watch her reach the top of the staircase to my level the tv let out a loud BOOM. It went pitch black and I turned around AND suddenly heard a loud bang on my door. MY HEART EXPLODED, I NEARLY PISSED MYSELF. Something grabbed me.. 

My door started to bang again and this time it was my horny neighbour drunk and horny as ever, viciously knocking on my door to let him in. 
I didn't feel the hand anymore and quickly open my door to let him in... I can shamelessly say I screwed him silly...purely out of fear of being left alone.. and its been weird around my apartment lately.

jayden8900,0,6,1qvzio,0,"The past week has sucked. Last night we had to make our own dinner. And the night before we had nothing to eat. Not to mention the weather has been rainy for the past three days, I can't even go bush walking in the afternoons after school. I sat down on the veranda to enjoy the view with while eating my recently made chicken wrap. Finally a good meal to end the day. My house is on a hill and we have the best view ever! We can see all of my suburb. I live in Australia. And everyone in Australia is wonderful and nice, or so I thought.

So I was relaxing and enjoying the food as well as the view. Looking to my right I can see the amazing view of the lake. I stared at the lake for some while. The last time I saw it, it had an amazing crystal effect upon the water, but the clouds of boredom has covered the sun rays to do that. So I got bored and looked somewhere else.

I look straight ahead, gazing down upon my suburb. The suburb I grew up in, the suburb I love. It looked very boring today. It was very foggy and was almost dusk, I could just see the mountain in the far distance that protects my suburb. 

I look to my left to see the bush land. The bush land I grew up in as a child, the woods that holds my dearest memories. But tonight the woods gave me the creeps. Covered in fog, just like any other bush, it looked creepy. I live on the outline of my suburb. So the bush is close by. And that's when I saw it!

I was just trying my best to enjoy the view. I always do. But not as well when its foggy, the bush is extremely creepy when it is. But that's not what made this particular night one of the most disturbing night of my life. What was in the forest-was what made me frightened.

It was just dangling of a tree. Or maybe it was not dangling of a tree, It didn't seem to have any branches around it to support it. Or perhaps I was too dazed by the sight to notice any branches? It was a orange-pink colour, maybe a clothing that covered most of its body? At first I didn't exactly know what it was. I didn't know that it was alive. Not until I looked more carefully.

I am certain it was a baby. A baby wearing orange-pink clothing. It was just dangling there. No. Not dangling, squirming. It had arms, legs and I think I saw a head as well. It was very hard to see, but I saw it's little arms and legs squirming around. Trying to get down off the tree. Trying to get free perhaps? The poor baby.

Off course I was not really certain that it was actually a baby at this point. I decided to go check it out without my parents permission (I was bad-ass). So I ran up stairs, put a jumper on, put my jogger shoes on and off I went. And obviously I brought my phone with me, just to be safe. I didn't care if it was raining or not. How selfish do you think I am? If it's a real baby then I had to do something!

I ran through my front door and started running as my dogs started barking at me. I did not care if I disturb the people living on my street. I was just too worried about what I saw. I had to go check out whatever that thing was. It must of been a child. What else moves around like that? I was scared but I was determined to help. Or maybe I was just too curious.

It didn't take me long to get out towards the bush. The bush was behind a set of houses, and the fastest and closest way to get towards where the baby was supposed to be was through a drive way. And so that's what I did. I was on another street and this drive way was shared between two houses. One house on the left. And one house on the right. The drive way went straight up into the bush and then nothing... Just hill and tree's, and maybe a hanging baby. But I sure hoped not.

Even though I had a sharp pain in my chest, I kept on running. Unfortunately, I am not a very fit person. But off course that is off topic and does not matter! As I was running, I stopped. Dead in my tracks. I was stopped to a sound. I stopped to listen to this sound. A sound of a man.

""What are you doing?"" a voice said. I turned to my right to see a man at his door. He had a smile on his face. At first I was worried, but I figured that he must of been the owner of the house on the right of the drive way. He was just taking the garbage out. Thank God!
""Ummmnn Good day mate, I'm just going for a run"" I said silently. I didn't want to tell him I was looking for a hanging baby. I would of sounded crazy! I wanted to act like a normal jogger.
""You are going for a run, In the rain?"" He said as he's smile faded into a a worried look. No, not just a worried look! I swear I saw anger in his expression.
I just turned and ran up his drive way towards the bush land. Completely ignoring him. He creeped me out. I turned back just before I took my right into the bush land, he was staring straight at me.

I am very good at navigation. I used to go bush walking all the time when I was young. One time we made a track of the particular bush area. We had places like the Giant Rock that took bravery to get there! You had to crawl and a small hole in between thorny bush. And yes the giant rock was a mini cliff. So crawling through the small thorny area was worth it, unless you have claustrophobia. 

Anyhow, no matter how hard I looked, and no matter how good at navigation I was. I did not find the hanging baby. I looked for ages. I looked at every branch at where it should have been. But I did not find it. I sure wish I did because I just knew it was a baby. I definitely saw it moving.
As I was heading back, down and around the corner of the house of the creepy man, towards the drive way. I looked at the house. It had yellow sand bricks and a red roof. It had a window at the back of the house, with a glass door. And there he was, behind the window just staring at me. The creepy man. I swear he was smiling but I am not so sure. After I looked at him for about ten seconds in fear, I started to leave. But I noticed something that made the hair on my neck stand up.

After that I just ran home as fast as I could. This has been one of many creepy experiences of my life. I hope it was not a baby. But now that I think about it, as I am typing. I think it was. Because through the window. Of the creepy man's house. I remember seeing a pink pram. But I could not see all of the pink in the pram. Because it was covered in mud.

I took a deep breath trying to calm down. I need to go to sleep... I repeated this to myself. ""It's just a dream"" - I thought. I turned around. My mom lied there... So it all happened. I looked at my scars. That's his fault... All of this... No. Not all. But... For a second I saw him. There. In a fire. My thoughts were racing through my mind. I tried to stand up but my body was too weak. Crap... I closed my eyes but I saw it again: fire...

 Fire was everywhere... I was trying to go to the stairs but they were blocked. And then I saw him. A tall man in dark cloak stood there with gasoline and matches. I saw scars on his hands and his smile. I've never saw such terrifying thing. He couldn't be human! He couldn't! I ran to my room and opened the window. That's the only way out of here... Everything seems to fading. My bed, table, computer, TV... All turned black... No, I can't give up! I can't. I took a breath of a fresh air. Footsteps are getting closer... I had to run away! I looked on a garage roof. I have to jump! I took my courage and jumped. My vision was still fading... Why? Why I felt so weak? He... I saw him in the window staring at me... All was fading... All of it...
-Do you believe in ghosts? - I heard a low voice causing shiver running down my spine. 
I couldn't gather my strength to even answer. What happened then? Why was I like that? Fire... I felt fire... Licking my skin... It hurted but I couldn't even move or scream. 
-It's just a fire... - Again this voice. - You'll pay for your sins... 
Sins? What sins? I couldn't understand. I still can't. Even if I can move a bit now I still don't know what happened then. This man... He set my house on fire... Now I have all memories but why... My mom woke up and looked at me.
-Mom... I'm sorry - I tried to say but no sound was coming from my mouth. 
I tried to reach my lips but I felt weak again. The doctor came to my room. 
-You should go and let her rest, miss - he said. Mother looked at him unsure. - Don't worry... Her body might be dead but she'll be awake soon.
What?! My body... Is dead... Is it because of fire? Why? Why that happened? Why?! I swear I could move a while ago! I swear! So why I can't do it now? I felt frozen inside... Something wasn't okay... Doctor took a seat on a corner of my bed. He changed somehow... He seemed blank... Or dead... What's going on? I have to run!
-Do you believe in ghosts? - he asked.
I heard it before... That's what I heard during the fire! No! Could it be him? He... I tried to glance at his hands and I saw his scars... The same scars as the man who attacked me! But why?! 
-Ah... Do you recognize me? - he added. - Don't worry... that was just a fire... Your mind survived as previous victims... 
I was too shocked. Why? What I've done?! What make him so angry?
-You shouldn't have ran away... - he said. - Now you pay your price...
That will sound strange but I relieved... I stopped felling pain. I felt light and free. But why? Suddenly it became warmer... Now I understand. Fire! He locked me here! No! No! NO! NOOOOOOOOO!
                                                         ***The next day***
Mother came to visit her daughter. She gazed at her sleeping face.
-Her body is still dead but her brain is alive... - admitted doctor laughing. - As it should be... Everyone will pay the price for running away...

I went to a party with my friends the other day and I got drunk. I was disoriented but as I was walking on the sidewalk and my mind got the better of me so I sneaked into Tom's house.





I found him in the basement luckily he didn't notice me. I saw him put his hands on both sides of his mouth and stretch it and it turned out that was not what he really looked liked. His skin was really some type of suit. He looked different his skin pale, his body skeletal, his head bald, and his eyes white. He had very long finger nails and his teeth were really dentures and instead his real teeth were yellow and crooked. He got out what I can assume to be a trash bag. In it was the corpse of a man who had: black hair, brown eyes, and stab wounds on his chest. Tom got a drawer full of surgical equipment. He carefully cut off the skin of the poor man and stitched it up as if it were cloth to make a new suit. He made himself a new suit and put his foot into it's mouth and put it on. He then laughs into a mirror with such a horrible crackling noise to it.




I quickly ran out. I came home screaming at my mom what had happen, she didn't care. ""I'm still going to Tom's house and not listen to your stupid story."" She said in a angry tone. I followed her just in case. I hid behind the wall they seemed to having a normal dinner.
I notice Tom puting something in her wine, a pill and she drank it and she started coughing and she passed out. She stopped breathing and died. He then turned and saw me I ran but he hit me with a blunt object so hard I passed out.

[**HI, HOW ARE YOU FEELING TODAY?**]

Pretty weaker than usual. But I've been a lot worse.

[**ALRIGHT, THEN. NOW, CHARLENE...**]

Yes? {coughs}

[**BEFORE WE START, IS THERE ANYTHING I COULD GET FOR YOU. LIKE SOME WATER OR...**]

No, thank you. I don't need any unnecessary things.

[**ARE YOU SURE?**]

Yes. {coughs} I'll be fine... At least, I think so.

[**OKAY, THEN. LET'S BEGIN WITH EMILY. WHO IS SHE LIKE TO YOU?**]

A stupid girl

[**WHY? WHAT DID SHE EVER DONE TO YOU?**]

Everything that I've been through for the past few years.

[**WELL, I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT SHE WAS ONCE YOUR BEST FRIEND. IS THAT TRUE?**]

Emily was my best friend until... {coughs} Until 'he' came along.

[**'HE'?**]

Let me tell you the whole story. 

You see, me and Emily... We were more than best friends. We were like sisters. We... {coughs} We would always share everything together. Our happy times; our sad times; even our mad times.

[**AND ABOUT 'HE'?**]

Oh, right. I forgot about him. He... He is a very selfish asshole. Don't know why most girls would fall for him. 

[**WHAT DID 'HE' EVER DONE TO YOU?**]

Framing me; calling me a whore; tried to fuck with me; etc. How I hated that son-of-a-bitch.

[**DO YOU THINK THAT THE ONLY REASON WHY 'HE' TREATED YOU THAT WAY IS BECAUSE... HE LIKES YOU?**]

Shut the fuck up. He hated me as well as I hated him. There is no such thing as 'like' or 'love' or any bullshit like that between us. Only 'hatred'.

[**I... I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO...**]

Of course you didn't mean to. Nobody means to hurt me. Because I'm the ""luckiest"" girl in the whole world! {slightly chuckles}

[**CHARLENE...**]

But I'm getting off-topic here. Sorry.

[**NO WORRIES. JUST AS LONG AS WE HAVE SOME TIME TO SPARE... PLEASE, CONTINUE.**]

Right, um... Well, Emily... He knew that Emily and I are both close to each other. So, he thought that it'd be funny to play a little prank on both of us. {mumbling}

[**I'M SORRY. WHAT?**]
Nothing. I just said that Emily... Emily is so fucking stupid! I mean, she knew that me and Kyle are enemies and-...

[**KYLE? AS IN, KYLE RICHARD?**]

Yeah, he's the one that I'm talking about. Anyway, {coughs} she knew that we were enemies, and yet she believes in every bullshit that fucker said.

[**WHAT DID KYLE SAID TO MAKE EMILY TO HATE YOU?**]

I don't know. Some stuffs I never actually done before. {whispers} I can't believe she believed that little shit.

[**WELL, WHY DID SHE BELIEVED IN EVERY WORD THAT KYLE SAID?**]

Because... Because Kyle was her boyfriend. 

[**HER BOYFRIEND?**]

Kyle knew that Emily was easy to manipulate. So, he did what he had to do to make my life miserable.

[**HOW DID HE MADE YOUR LIFE MISERABLE?**]

By making Emily to do the dirty work for him. If only she knew that he was using her.

[**BY 'DIRTY WORK', YOU MEAN?**]

Emily and I were never as closed as we used to be. She insulted me every day, tells me that I'm useless in life, spreading rumors about myself and... And... {sniffles}

[**AND?**]

{bursts out crying} Kyle is a fucking jerk, okay?! He knew that it'd be the last of me after what he did to Emily! Emily, the sweetest girl I've ever met! Emily... {sobs} The poor {coughs} innocent soul.

[**IS HE THE ONE WHO... WHO IS RESPONSIBLE WITH EMILY'S-...**]

{screams} Yes, it's him! It's always him! Kyle the jerk! Kyle the dirtbag! Kyle the... {cries} Kyle the heartless.

[**DO YOU NEED SOME TISSUES NOW?**]

No, {sobs} it's alright. My time is almost up anyways.

[**SO, COULD YOU AT LEAST TELL ME ABOUT THE NIGHT YOU WENT TO MEET HIM?**]

{sobs}

[**CHARLENE, THIS WILL BE THE LAST CHANCE YOU'LL EVER HAVE BEFORE... WELL, COULD YOU AT LEAST TRY TO TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT?**]

{sobs} I went to Kyle's house that night. The night after... {sobs} Emily...

[**IT'S OKAY, CHARLENE. JUST TELL ME.**]

{sobs} Kyle said that he wanted to talk about something. I figured that it was another stupid harmless prank or something like that. {whispers} Wow, was I dumb.

[**WHAT DID YOU BOTH DO TOGETHER THAT NIGHT?**]

That night... We {coughs} drank a little wine together. Talked about some shits and stuffs. At first, I thought that the reason why he wanted to talk to me is because he regretted what he had done to Emily and me and he wanted to change into a new leaf.

[**AND THEN?**]

I asked him about how he felt when he knew that Emily... 
Shit!

[**WHAT HAPPENED?**]

He said that he didn't fucking cared about Emily. He didn't felt guilty about every bullshit he said to her. He said that it's all part of his plan to... Fucking kill me!

[**HE SAID THAT TO YOU?**]

He still fucking hates me! He hates me. Always have, always will. That heartless bastard! That was when I finally lost it. 
When he was off-guard, I grabbed the bottle of wine and used it to hit him in the head! I'm still glad that I did.

[**BUT THAT'S NOT THE REASON WHY HE WANTED TO TALK TO YOU, IS IT?**]

No... It wasn't. After I hit him in the head, he managed to fucking smirk at me and said; ""gotcha"". As time passed by me, my vision was starting to get blur, as my head went fluster before I could even realized what he had done to me.

[**HE POISONED YOU THAT NIGHT, DIDN'T HE?**]

I should've seen it coming... The way {coughs} he gave me that glass of wine. I... {coughs}.

[**SAVE YOUR BREATH, CHARLENE.**]

What's the point? I'll be dead by tomorrow, anyway. I just can't wait {coughs} to go to hell.

[**WELL, I GUESS THIS IS IT THEN. SO BEFORE I GO, ARE THERE ANY LAST WORDS BEFORE... EVERYTHING ENDS?**]

Yeah... {coughs} Tell Kyle that even though he had ruined my life the last time, I'd still say that he's {coughs} the broken one.

LM_13,0,10,1qw89b,0,"Very sorry about grammar. Again.
***
 Yesterday, my friend Chloe told me something that made me go pale all over. Today, she completed her story, so I asked her if I could post it, and she agreed. Our conversation was a bit messy,though, and I'm trying to use proper grammar here by quoting exactly what we said, so here it is:

""My mom got me a Ouija board yesterday.""

""From Hamley's?""

""Dude,NO. Like a real *real* Ouija board with the 'Yes' and the 'No' and all that shit. It even looked worn down and used.""

""O....kay then. So where'd she get it from?""

""I DON'T KNOW! She wouldn't tell me! But no really, I asked it what my age is, and it said xx(I won't be revealing personal info. here)! Plus my maid is religious and she knows these black magic stuff, but she's not a witch or anything. She actually wants to be a nun. 
So I was holding my Swaggy Justin Bieber hat (yes, she's a fan, don't know why, but I got nothin' to do with it) and I asked it what I was holding, it fucking spelt 'S-W-A-G-G-Y'! Then the door slammed really fucking hard, like *really hard*, and it had the triangle-door-stopper thing!""

""Alright! Alright! I already believe you! It's just....you shouldn't be messing around with these things."", I told her.

""I KNOW! I posted a 10 second video but then I got scared and everyone was just saying 'don't do it, you'll die, don't do it you'll die.""

*(today)*

""Dude, look at what happened!"" *she showed me her scars, sorry I couldn't take a picture, I didn't have my phone*

""Dude, WTF did you do?""
*This is where I went pale*

""The friggin' demon-ghost scratched me, and don't you notice the pattern? It's the Holy Trinity! The scratches hurt more than usual though, you know, like more than when I get scratched normally.""

"" Fuck, dude. Aren't you a little bit worried?""

""No, because God will protect me and they only come when you want them to. But get this: When I first talked to it, it was 2:30 a.m. Yesterday night, when I got the scratches, the clock stopped at 2:30, and it had new fucking batteries.""","Unless you want the Holy Trinity scratched into your arm, don't mess with Ouija boards.",3
Jaunt-701,68,171,1qwru3,711,"I opened the present. What the fuck is this shit? “Oh wow, grandpa, thanks!”

He pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose and said, “It's a Ham Radio, son. I used to have one when I was younger. It's got a hundred mile range, so you can talk to people all the way out in Fairview. Real conversations, not the text messages or emails you all use these days. I'll even let you use my old license and call sign.”

Yeah, I'm never going to do any of that. “Sounds great, grandpa!”

“Let's set it up together.”

“...Uh, yeah, cool!”

He spent two hours setting it up, showing me how to operate it, and telling me stories about the other “hams” he'd met over the years. He switched it on and got in contact with some gruff sounding dude out in Fairview. They had a lively discussion about how the FCC was oppressing their constitutional rights.

I caught a movie with Jeremy, got some free pancakes at IHOP, and turned in early. A mediocre birthday, like always. I have a bad habit of drinking soda before bed, and, as usual, I ended up staring at the ceiling wide awake. I browsed Reddit for a while, but you can only see so many cat pictures before they all start to look the same.

I flicked on the ham radio and fiddled with the tuner. Other than the police band, the air traffic tower, and some guy ranting about the Federal Reserve, it was quiet. I sighed, laid back in bed, and started to doze off.

That's when I heard it.

At first I thought I imagined it. I was in that half-awake, half-asleep state where your thoughts start to play tricks on you. I thought maybe I had started dreaming before I was fully asleep and had hallucinated a sound.

A sound like a voice calling through static.

I listened for a moment. Nothing. Just a dream. I turned over on my side and closed my eyes.

I snapped back awake. There it was again, for certain this time. A voice calling out, as if from a great distance.

It was coming from the radio.

I turned the volume up as far as it would go, but I could still hear only the faintest sound, like someone calling from the bottom of a well. I adjusted the tuner for better reception, but it didn't help. I picked up the microphone and spoke into it. “Hello?”

The voice stopped. There was a long moment of silence. Then the voice called out again, more clearly this time. “Hello? Hello?”

“Hello? Can you hear me?” I suddenly felt very stupid. It was probably just another weirdo survivalist out in the woods who wanted to babble about EMP blasts and the gold standard or something. Still, there was something in his voice. An urgency that was hard to ignore.

There was a fluctuation in the static, and the voice came in again. “Hello?” He said something else, something in what I assumed was German.

“I'm sorry, I can't understand you. I only speak English.”

He spoke again, and I could hear how thick his accent was. “Please, I ask you. When are you?”

“Where am I? I'm in Chester. About forty miles outside Fairview.”

“No, no.” The static was starting to overtake the voice again. “*When* are you?”

“Excuse me?”

“What time? What *year*?”

I stared at the radio. So this was one of those ham weirdos that grandpa was talking about. I shook my head and chucked a little. “Uh, it's 2013 dude.”

There was an excited barrage of German that turned desperate when the static started drowning him out. “Please, I must ask you. Please, wait...”

Then nothing.

I set the microphone down. Great. Another outlet for creepers to say creepy shit. We sure don't have enough of those in the world. I switched the radio off and went to sleep.

-------

“What the fuck is that shit?” Jeremy said.

I rolled my eyes. “Ham radio. My grandpa got it for my birthday.”

“That's hilarious. Does it work?”

“Yeah, hundred mile range. It's stupid though. The police band is sort of interesting, but other than that it's just survivalists and conspiracy nuts.”

“That's awesome. We should pretend we're under siege during a zombie attack, like do some *War of the Worlds* shit with this thing.”

I laughed. “I don't know man, it's just a lot of weirdos on there. Like the other day, I was listening to it, and this one guy--”

Jeremy switched the radio on, and immediately I heard a frantic voice calling out. “Hello? Hello?”

“*This* guy,” I said. “This guy is a fucking psycho.”

“Dude, sweet. I love talking to psychos.” Jeremy picked up the microphone. “Hello?”

“Hello,” the voice sounded overjoyed. “Please do not go. I do many fixes to machine. Transmission is very much better.”

Jeremy giggled. “Dude, you've got fucking Bruno on your radio.” He spoke into the microphone. “*Ja, das is gut*. Much sound. Bravo.”

“*Sprechen Sie Deutsch*?”

“I've had a few semesters, yeah.”

They spoke back and forth in German for a bit. “What are you saying?” I asked.

Jeremy sat back and shook his head. “This guy is a piece of work. I asked him where he's located, and he said 'long ago, many years in your past.'”

“When I talked to him he wanted to know what year it was.”

“He's playing a prank. He probably goes on here, pretends to be a time traveler to troll the survivalists, and then puts the recordings up on YouTube. Actually pretty brilliant, if you ask me.”

“Ask him how he's communicating from the past.”

Jeremy spoke into the microphone, and there was an excited flood of German from the other end.

“What's he saying?” I asked.

“I have no fucking idea.”

“I thought you spoke German?”

“Level three. If he was describing the animals he was seeing on a safari I could maybe follow him. But he's talking about like, 'particle tunnels' and 'chaotic duality waves' or something. I don't think I could understand him even if I was fluent.”

The voice on the radio sighed and took a long pause. Then, with heaviness in his tone, he said, “Please. Tell me about your world.”

I scoffed. “We should switch it off.”

Jeremy looked shocked. “Why?”

“He's fucking with us.”

“So? He's doing a great job of it. Don't be such a downer. This is the most interesting conversation I've had in a while, so I say fuck it. Let's play time travelers.”

We told him about our “future” world. We described airplanes, self-driving cars, space stations, microchips. We tried to describe a smartphone, which was difficult to do with the voice's shitty English and Jeremy's shitty German. He was fascinated by the Internet, awestruck by the moon landing, greatly amused when we played some Daft Punk as an example of futuristic culture. Jeremy spent a weird amount of time talking about his Vitamix.

And through it all, the voice kept repeating, “Beautiful. So beautiful.”

“Okay, enough about us, *mein herr*,” Jeremy said. “Your turn. Tell us about your world.”

A long silence. “My world,” the voice said, “is very dark. Bad things happening. I do not know...how we will escape the shadow.”

“This guy's a great improviser,” Jeremy said.

“Please, my friends. I have question. It is very important. I must ask you.”

Jeremy smiled. “Sure man, go ahead.”

The voice asked something in German. Jeremy frowned.

Suddenly, there was a noise like breaking glass from the radio. The voice gasped, “*Nein, nein*.” There were other voices, angry voices, clamoring and shouting. It sounded like a crowd was in the room, and they were wreaking havoc. Loud bangs and thuds, like furniture being turned over. The voices grew louder, and louder. There was a tremendous crash.

Then silence.

I looked over at Jeremy. “What the fuck happened?”

He shook his head. “I don't know. Other people were there. They were saying, 'Dog. Worthless dog,' over and over again. Sounded like they smashed the place up.”

I fiddled with the tuner, but there was no sign of the voice. Jeremy and I sat quietly for a moment.

“His question,” I said. “What did he ask you?”

Jeremy stared at the radio. “He said, 'Can they be stopped?'”

-------

Too much soda again. Another insomniac night. I counted the cracks in the ceiling, over and over. Over and over. My eyes began to feel heavy at last.

A burst of static from the radio made my heart jump. I shot upright in bed and looked over. The static faded out and the voice faded in. He was speaking German, quite softly.

Anger flared in my chest. I was sick of this. Sick of him and his stupid pranks. I wanted to smash that goddamn radio to pieces.

I grabbed the microphone and shouted, “Leave me alone for Christ's sake. I don't care about your stupid fucking time travel act, just stop bothering me and leave me alone.”

But he just spoke over me, like he couldn't hear me at all. His voice was shaky and quiet. I couldn't understand what he was saying, but I could feel a great sadness in his tone.

I grabbed my phone and opened the voice recorder. I sat there, listening and recording, until he was finished speaking. I sat in silence for a few minutes to make sure nothing else was coming through, then I switched the radio off.

I sent the audio file to Jeremy with an explanation of what had happened. I asked him to translate. The next day at school, he handed me a sheet of paper at lunch. He didn't say anything, he just handed it to me and walked away.

It read:

&gt; My friends, I do not know if you can hear me. I do not know if you could ever hear me, or if I was imagining our encounter. But I hope you are out there.

&gt; The machine is critically damaged. Perhaps with a great deal of work it could be repaired, but I doubt that I will have either the resources or the time necessary for such a task. I am deeply saddened that we could not speak further. There are so many questions I wanted to ask, so much more I wanted to learn about your world. But please know that, in the brief time we were able to speak, you gave a tired man a reason to continue living.

&gt; I know now that the madness that has gripped my country cannot be stopped. I tell my son to be strong. I tell him that our people have endured for thousands of years. I tell him that if we were strong enough to build the Pyramids, we are strong enough to withstand a few grunting apes in jackboots. But he knows I am afraid too. We are marching forward into a nightmare that will take a terrible toll on all of us. I do not know when it will end. The only thing I can cling to is the fact that, somehow, our world will lead to yours.

&gt; I think of your world, and I feel something I haven't felt in many years. An emotion almost unknown to the people of my time. I feel hope. For in a world such as yours, a world of such wondrous invention and progress, what use could there be for war? What reason for hunger? What tolerance for injustice? I know in my heart that you have solved the problems that have plagued our species and created a world of enduring peace and unity.

&gt; I do not know how such a world could spring from the darkness that is enveloping this continent. But I hope that the future is as beautiful as you described it. I hope you have built the world that we could not. I hope you have learned from our mistakes. I hope you treat each other with the dignity and respect that is the birthright of all humanity. I hope you have forgotten the word for “hate.” I hope that things are different.

&gt; Goodbye, my friends, from the shadows.

&gt; Dr. Albert Bachman. Frankfurt, Germany. November 12th, 1938.

A prank. That's all it was. I don't even know why I'm even posting this. There's no way it was actually some sci-fi miracle. It was obviously just someone with too much time on his hands playing a big joke on us. He's probably listening to the recordings and laughing at us right now.

Just a prank.

But...

I still keep the radio on at night. I'll switch it on as I'm laying in bed, and sometimes when I'm starting to drift off, I'll think I hear a distant voice calling out in the dark. A voice from the shadows, tiny and frail, yet full of hope. And I'll sit up in bed and listen. I'll listen for a sound, a word, anything. But I never hear more. Just my mind playing tricks on me.

I don't sleep much anymore. Probably because I drink too much soda, right?

horriddaydream,86,140,1r338n,570,"My mother left when I was four.
Normally, that wouldn't mean anything, but I suspected for a long time that the porcelain dolls were coming from her, like some pitiful little attempt to show me that she loved me. 

My father; he worked overtime to keep things going in the household even if it was just the two of us. His hands were always worn from working the machines at the shop and he slaved even more when he got home and had to make supper for himself and I, and go through my nightly routines before I hit the sack. I sometimes woke up in the middle of the night and he was still awake, cleaning a room in the house, and I thought to myself, ""This man is dedicated. Has to be awake in only a few hours…and here he is."" I love my father, and I always have.

One of his most trusted friends from high school, Alexander, was my babysitter from the time my mother left, to the time I was about seven years old. We trusted Alexander. He worked night shift and so he was able to work babysitting in around his hours, and he would have done anything to help out my father to make that work. My father paid him even though he asked for nothing; he said he was just 'doing his good deed', ""and I like it anyway!"" My dad used to come home from work and Alexander would pick up his bags full of toys that we played with; he always brought the best toys and trinkets with him. His daughter had passed away when she was ten years old, and I think it brought him great joy to now share her old toys with another little girl. He would say to my dad, ""She was great for me. She ate well, and she took her usual long nap. I'll be back tomorrow!"" And he always came back. 

Well, eventually times changed and my dad's work schedule changed with them. We didn't see Alexander anymore because we didn't NEED Alexander anymore. My father thought that they lost touch permanently and when I asked about him he told me truthfully that Alexander was a very busy man. And he understood that, and I did too. 

For my eighth birthday, the first porcelain doll arrived. It had beautiful, blonde curly hair and a painted on face. She was wearing what looked to be an expensive, velvet dress with an attached tutu. She came inside a stuffed envelope with nothing else on the package to identify who had sent her. Just my name, that was all. The first thing that my father did was call my grandmother, who said, ""No, I didn't drive by and place a present on the porch. I'm not her coward mother; I would have given it right to her."" That gave my father the second idea: my mother. Only thing was, we had no way of getting in touch with her and finding out for she had literally taken off and abandoned us both. And over the next few weeks, nobody came forth and said they had gotten me the doll, so we assumed this is who had sent it.

They showed up every year since then. Each unique in their own ways, each more beautiful than the last. I thought it was a little odd, yes. Especially because my mother made no outreach to me so if she was sending me gifts but not bothering to even so much call me and check up, then that was just plain rude of her and her gifts meant literally nothing. But I continued to set them up on my shelf in my bedroom and they looked nice there, I suppose.

The year I turned nineteen, I was moved into college and was taking courses on my birthday. My father called me from home and asked me when I was coming back home for a break, and I told him that I had time this weekend, but I only said this because I sensed some urgency in his voice. I could make it work. He told me not to worry about anything but that he would really like to see me. Then he stressed that I always lock my doors and always have somebody walking with me if I was out past dark, which I already knew.

I returned home that weekend and my father said there had been an accident.
My porcelain birthday doll had arrived, my nineteenth year doll. When my father brought it inside the house, it had smashed into a hundred separate pieces.
Inside, there was a diary entry on a piece of paper.
We spent the entire day smashing open every porcelain doll, and the entire night speaking with the police.
Alexander had written diary entries for every time he had drugged and molested me, each more explicit, admitting that he had done the same to his daughter up until the time of her horrible death. My father and I hadn't a dry eye in our house that entire night, and I continued to have problems throughout my college career knowing that Alexander was somewhere out there, probably assuming a new identity and doing the same thing to other girls.

Now I know why he had always commented on me taking such 'usual long naps.'

honeymoonatthefalls,59,121,1r0fus,540,"The falls have a pull, according to the locals.  Something dark and unearthly like a siren’s song, sweet and somehow terrible.  It draws people “of a certain intent”.  That’s the polite way to say a lot of people end up crushed on the rocks below, their limbs torn apart by the unending rush of water, the brains that made them who they were nothing more than bits of foam and meat floating to the surface.  20-40 a year, in fact, depending on who you ask.

We were happy.  Weren’t we?  I thought we were.  I thought maybe we were different from everyone else, that we’d actually make it.  We wouldn’t end up in that 50% statistic.  We’d grow old together, laughing at the same stupid jokes, knowing what was going to come out of the other’s mouth before they even had a chance to say it.

Was it the pressure of the wedding?  The fact that I’m still “between jobs”?  Young 20-somethings in one of America’s bleakest economies, doing what we could to get by.  Scrambling for every scrap as the magazine covers reminded us how worthless our generation is, the snide remarks about our smartphones and Facebook and selfies.  Maybe getting married wasn’t a good idea.

But we were in love!  We were in love and we knew deep down in that secret place in our stomachs that she was the one for me and I for her.

So then why did it happen?

No.  I’m not supposed to ask that anymore.  I’m supposed to accept that she’s gone.  I’m supposed to accept the fact that she’s her own statistic now, one of 20-40 people a year.  Another tumble of bones on the body count that’s reached over 5000 since the falls became an attraction both for tourists and people with death on their mind.

But it’s hard to accept when I can still see her face so clearly, that sweet heart-shaped face with the little crescent-moon scar on her left nostril, the way her big blue eyes lit up when she showed me the fantastic deal she scored on Groupon, a Niagara Falls getaway for our honeymoon.

If only I could go back.  Tell her that the price was nice but I’d rather go to a beach, or Ireland, it doesn’t matter, anywhere but those cursed falls.

It’s impossible to describe how it feels to stand at the crest of Niagara, the mist peppering your face like cold little kisses, drinking in the smells and the sound and the remarkable way the water rushes down, down, ever down.  Your existence seems like a cosmic joke in comparison to this almost hauntingly beautiful feat of nature.  For a moment, it is.

The locals say you can tell who has a death wish by how close they’ll get to the edge.  Those who shy away, who shake their heads and insist nervously that they can see just fine from where they are, thank you very much, those are the ones who can’t trust themselves to get too close.  If they get too close to the edge, some little part of them knows they’ll jump.

She didn’t shy away.  She went right up to the railing.  She was smiling.

That’s the worst part.  She was smiling.

It was early in the morning, one of those damp gray dawns only possible in the new spring of upstate New York.  We had the sight to ourselves.  It was a little spooky, being out there alone, the kind of spooky you get from being in an empty shopping mall after hours, all those metal gates pulled down and the lights turned off.

She was standing there, a little too high on the guardrail, leaning just a little too far over, smiling as the mist touched her lips and made her hair curl in damp little tendrils on her cheeks.  She was beautiful.

I’ll never know why I pushed her.

That’s something I have to accept.

yurglar,64,90,1qrlzl,390,"This is a true story and by all means, I am fully aware all stories on this website are true, however I am also fully aware of the suspicion natural to people upon hearing something beyond their comprehension. The case I’m about to relate to you is one of those situations, where reason and logic mean nothing when compared to the facts, and I wish to find someone who believes me here. I am a doctor, a pathologist, normally in charge of autopsies and anatomical studies at a highly regarded university (its name is not relevant for the narrative). I am writing here in this site because all my doctored friends do not believe a single word I tell them, and I have also been threatened of losing my post at both the morgue and the university. I do know however, that I am perfectly sane.

The events began when I took a trip, alone, as I have no close family, to the north of Europe, to Sweden. It was not on holidays, the University of Uppsala invited me to give teach there, an offer which I quickly accepted. I needed the money and Uppsala was quite a prestigious university, boasting 8 Nobel Laureates. However, I did not stay in Uppsala, I stayed at a town, further north, near a forest, a beautiful and serene place, just half an hour away. 

I stayed in an old, typical Swedish house, painted red with a dark rooftop, and a small garden. There was something odd about it, but I ignored it. I should never have done so. I stayed there, a few nice months, opening bodies and examining entrails, until it started getting cold, and the ravens started circling around the village crops. The leaves were starting to fall and there was something ominous about the whole village atmosphere. People seemed sullen and shut in, old ladies gave me hateful looks and kids avoided my path like I was some kind of pedophile. I was starting to think the townsfolk were avoiding me for some reason, and upon reaching that conclusion, I decided to talk to the only friend I had there, named Father Erik, the local priest. I told him about the townsfolk behavior as he was the only man who did not show any signs of being afraid of me. He looked at me and I remember he smiled, his teeth shining through his thin lips. “They think you are this year’s Midvinterblot.” “Mid-what?” I replied. Father Erik then explained it to me, how in this place, back in the Viking age and throughout the middle-ages had a ritual performed here, where men were chosen to be sacrificed to please the old Norse gods. Mid-winter blood, Father Erik Ragnerson said slowly, like the words meant anything to me. “And how is that related to what I told you?” I asked, as politely as I can. He shook his head. “You’re not from here, you wouldn’t understand. These people think…” he chuckled “think the dead come back every nine years to claim another sacrifice, another Midvinterblot.” I saw the Christian disbelief in his green eyes, and the same disbelief was also in mine, pale blue eyes. “Viking dead?” I asked, somehow amused, to which he responded affirmatively, I cannot remember his words correctly, adding that the souls of previous Midvinterblots are the responsible for the collection of yet another. We quickly shifted the conversation, as another proof of how foolish town superstition is something global and went through several beers, to which he did not say no, in spite of being a man of God.

That night I returned home from the church, slightly dizzy with the beverage. There was snow all over, and I held my scarf over my nose afraid it would freeze. My house was at the end of the road, and I kept walking steadily. I remember, as if it had been yesterday, the shivers that ran down my spine, as I head distant, loud, horns playing, and ululating voices. Coming from the dark, from the forest. The streetlamps flickered and I closed my eyes shut, and when I opened them, the sound was gone with the wind. I thought back then the cold was just messing with my brain, so as soon as I got home I drank hot tea and sat in front of the fireplace. I googled all Father Erik Ragnerson had told me and confirmed it. Then, with some curiosity, I accessed the town’s morgue register. That was one of the privileges my profession had. Running through the names, there was an odd pattern. I ran my hand through my hair and that time, the hair on the back of my neck prickled. Every nine years a person had been found dead, in gruesome circumstances, in the snow of Mid-winter. However, suicides were far more common in Sweden than car crashes where I come from and the police never paid it any heed. That was when I should have left, but my stubborn mind refused to see the evidence and I lingered, until Mid-winter finally arrived.

That day, I had forgot about all the townsfolk nonsense and was busy in my study, drawing an anatomical diagram when someone knocked on my door. As a precaution, I had become weary of serial killers or general psychos and went to the kitchen, grabbed a butcher’s knife and opened the door to find a small old wrinkled woman looking up at me. “Hello?” I asked inquisitively, the knife hidden behind my back. “Wear this tonight. For Midvinterblot.” She held out a white tunic to me. I remember snapping angrily at her, telling the few Swedish insults I knew and grabbed the tunic from her shriveling hands, hell-bent on burning the thing. The woman walked away and when she turned her head, she had the ugliest expression I have seen in this world, an expression of hate, disgust and cruelty combined.
 
Angrily, I kept working until I fell asleep on top of the table, only to be awoken by a man on the TV announcing a starless night. That is when the knock came. As soon as it hit my door, I felt my heart sink, the TV went quiet and all the lights, candles and illumination were gone with wisps of smoke. I stood up, gulped nervously and rationally grabbed the butcher’s knife, still standing near me from my encounter with the old woman earlier. I took cautious steps to the door and inhaling deeply, opened it with a full swing.

The image that was before my eyes still haunts me today. A procession of people walking in the snow, along the village road, dressed in white tunics, all shaven and either with their throats slit or limbs chopped of. All of them were pale, wore blank expressions and had dirt all over them, like they had literally rose from their graves. The drums sounded loud, and all was silent but from their thud. As soon as I opened the door, they all stopped and turned their heads to me at once, some in impossible angles, twisted and turned. Screaming, I closed the door. The townsfolk were hiding in their homes, afraid, and I remember how quickly the dead began to bang on my door, on my walls. Thinking quickly, I came up with the stupidest idea. I dressed the white tunic, took some white powder I had in the bathroom and ran to the backyard and around the house, pretending to be another one of the dead. As I struggled through the thick snow, my heart stopped when one of the dead turned its shaved head, which I remember was painted with dark patterns and circles, and spoke to me in a deep voice, something so obscure, it still shivers me today. For some reason, he seemed regal, as if he was the commander of the procession. He said something in old Swedish, a harsh voice from the afterlife, impossible to describe in words. I nodded instinctively, almost pissing myself and the man turned away and kept walking towards my house.

I ran as soon as he was a good distance away, my feet burning in the snow and my entire body turning purple with the cold. I remember knocking at Father Erik’s house, and how he opened the door. I remember taking a shower and crying in front of him like a baby, as I told him how I had luckily escaped. After I recovered somehow, Father Erik still eyed me with disbelief. “The man actually talked to you?” “Yes, he bloody did!” I snapped angrily. “What did he say?” the calm, still rational priest asked. Surely he had heard the drums, I though. I told him the words the dead had said, in old Swedish, and I saw his face go pale and his eyes widen. “What does it mean?” I asked, half afraid of the answer. “It means” Father Erik said, trembling. “Death awaits the heathen priest.” I dismissed his superstitions, trying to convince him there were more priests in the surrounding villages, and the next day I left Sweden, Father Erik Ragnerson and the town behind.

Yesterday, after nine years, I received a mail from Swedish authorities, telling me how a man had been brutally nailed to the front door of my previously owned house in Sweden and that they would desire to ask me some questions. 

His name was Erik Ragnerson.

I was hungover in the morning, so I stayed in bed and streamed more movies. It was time for *Breaking Dawn*, except this time I was actually interested in Bella and Edward’s relationship. Don’t judge. I was sprawled in my bed, weakly navigating to the stream page, when another CAPTCHA appeared:


KILL AVA


I narrowed my eyes. What the fuck? I forgot about Breaking Dawn and sat up, rubbing at my eyes. At this point it wasn’t funny anymore, it was just weird. Ava isn’t a very common name, and what kind of sick CAPTCHA algorithm would generate stuff like that? I mean, I’m majoring in Tourism Management, but I sure as hell know that companies block out phrases like that.


Someone had to see this, no matter how bizarre it was. It was Sunday afternoon. Rachel was gone, and Ava was usually at the South’s most annoying megachurch, NewStart!!. Yes, the church’s name has two exclamation points in it. I heard some rustling on the other side of the apartment— Ava must’ve skipped.


“Yo, Ava!” I yelled. Maybe CAPTCHA went all NSA on me. “Come on, I want to show you something!”


“Yeah?” She rounded the corner into my room, wearing her usual placated smile.


I spun around the laptop on my lap to face her. I tilted the screen so she could read, and as I did her expression dropped from a smile to neutral as stone.


I watched her expression with one of those eager dog faces after you show someone something funny.


She punched me in the mouth.


I whipped over the side of the bed and smacked on the floor, eyes rolling to Ava for a split second before she kicked me hard in the stomach.


I retched and rolled over, scrabbling to get up, hair in my eyes and my heart thumping. She was screaming the entire time, this shrill, one-note screech, kicking me over and over again. As she rolled back for another kick my mind suddenly snapped into action. I threw myself to my desk and she threw herself at me, screaming and scratching at my eyes. I grabbed the knife in my desk and jammed it in her shoulder. She screamed, dislodging herself before running out of my room.


I stood, shaking, before lunging at my door to lock it. I drew back and caught my face in my mirror— my mouth was dribbling blood and I was missing a front tooth. I looked like a hillbilly. Whatever. I already go to college in South Carolina. Deal with that later.


Nothing that happened in the past five minutes made any sense, but I knew that I had to get out of the house. I couldn’t stay locked up in the apartment with her.


I grabbed my tote bag and pocketknife before waiting at my door for a minute, listening.


Nothing.


Knife in hand, I cracked my door open and looked around the crack. The living room was empty. I inched out of my room when I heard a whisper. It was coming from Ava’s room; quick and frantic whispers.


“*FIRSTANDLASTfirstandlastfirstandlastnononononononononononono*”


First and last? Uh, no thank you.


I rushed past her door and out the front door to the apartment complex. I decided to go to my friend Sam’s apartment. I thought that once I got to his apartment, I could explain things and call the police. Sam gets drunk a lot and wears fedoras ironically, but he’s still a pretty normal person.


He answered the door on the first knock, giving my hillybilly mouth the stink-eye. “Kierra, what the hell happened to your face?”


“Ava beat me up.”


“*What*?”


I pushed past him and dumped my stuff on his couch before grabbing paper towels from the kitchen. He plopped his generous frame on his couch and I explained my story in detail, pausing once in a while to blot my bloodied mouth. I split my lip on my tooth and it hurt like a mofo.


“Was she drunk?” he asked.


“No. You know she doesn’t get drunk.” I was getting antsy. I tossed the paper towel in the trashcan once the bleeding steamed. The whole thing seemed completely batshit. Ava was tough, but she wasn’t unstable.


I finally looked up at Sam. “Any ideas?”


“Call the cops…?”


Well, no shit, I could’ve just sat on my ass in my locked room and done that 30 minutes ago. I picked up my phone to call the cops when my phone buzzed. A text from a blocked number:


CAPTCHA
NEWSTART!!
GO NOW


That damn church Ava always went to. Great. This was the last thing I wanted to do hungover. Sam looked over my shoulder and we both frowned. 


“Who the hell texted you?”


“I don’t know. But I think we need to go to Newstart!!.”


“No way.”


“The last time I didn’t do something internet communication told me to do, I got the shit beaten out of me.”


“That’s a stupid reason to follow some random text!”


There was a knock on the door.


I flinched, but Sam brushed me off. ""It's just Trey back from church.""


He waddled to the door and Trey stepped into the apartment, smiling, before his eyes locked on me. His expression slacked.


""THE FIRST AND LAST,"" he screamed.


Oh, shit.

thorninhisside,78,177,1qtj6z,347,"I don’t know if what I saw was true. But, I’m pretty sure it was. You might think me mad, but I've read loads of accounts of people on the internet where people who have had shit like this happen to the recount it for others to read. And now, I’m doing the same. So here goes...	

Snapchat is a fun little app where people take selfies and send them to each other. I used Snapchat pretty much every day to send pictures of myself doing stupid things to my friends and they would send pictures of themselves back. That was, up until that one afternoon.

I had just returned home after a long day at school, made even longer by my friends absence due to his little brothers funeral, so I decided to recline on the sofa and procrastinate on my IPad for a while. As it usually did, my procrastination took the form on messing about on Snapchat. I had a few unopened pictures, several of them from my friend who had been absent that day. I opened them. Each of them was a selfie of him in his room after the funeral. He looked like shit. I guess he just wanted sympathy from the many girls he was looking to hook up with. So I sent him a picture of me with a message attached saying ‘Chin up man’. It wasn’t long until he replied. He just replied with a sombre image of himself and a simple message saying ‘thanks’. But, something caught my eye for the briefest second - A pair of eyes sunken and dead, peering out of his wardrobe. 

I was a little shaken by this, as I could not be sure that I saw what I saw. For, images sent via Snapchat can only be viewed for 10 seconds then they’re deleted. I replied immediately. ‘Are you all right man?’ With a picture of me trying not to look freaked out. I waited anxiously for his reply. When the little notification that I had ‘1 unread Snapchat’ popped up on my screen; I was slightly nervous about opening it. I was worried about what I’d see; I was worried about what was waiting for me… 

Curiosity took the better of me - I opened the message. Another picture of my friend and a simple message saying ‘Yeah…’ At this point, my IPad froze, leaving the picture message from my friend on the screen. I couldn’t do anything. The home button didn’t work nor did the lock button. I was left with the image of my friend staring back at me.  This gave my chance to view the picture with more depth. After close inspection, I saw nothing out of order. No eyes in the wardrobe door. In fact, his wardrobe door was closed. I was about to hook my iPad up to my computer to see if I could unfreeze my device when I noticed that my wardrobe door was wide open…

TheeMikeG,19,60,1r4fsf,273,"Dear Mike,

They’re letting me write a letter so I figured I’d get my story out there.

It was a routine night drop, nothing different from what we’ve done countless times before. The steady hum of the C-130 as it tore through the clouds was the only thing keeping me calm. Yeah, I’ve done this a lot, but you can never get rid of the nerves before a mission. We had an idea of what awaited us down there, but we couldn’t be a hundred percent sure. People are unpredictable, and that’s scary. The plan from higher was to have our five man team infiltrate by night drop a small village I can’t pronounce to search for and capture or kill a HVT whose name I also can’t pronounce. The gunship would rise up and provide overwatch until we were extracted. Airborne all the way, hooah. 

The LT joined us again, which he decided to do from time to time. Nice enough guy, I respected him. Was supposed to be having a baby girl soon, he would always talk about it during PT. Good for him, I could never hold down a relationship for very long. I figured it was just because I’ve seen too much shit to be normal and cuddle or whatever the fuck it is that couples do. The rest of the squad was the usual guys. Mitch, Craft, and Burroughs. All experts in their craft. We were a solid group and I’d take a bullet or hell, even two, for any of them. 

“Thirty seconds!” shouted the LT from the bench, a few spots to my right, closest to the door. The jumpmaster heaved the door upward and the familiar sound of air whooshing past the plane made my heart jump. There was always a kick. “Hook up!” he shouted. We all stood up in unison and clipped our static lines to the wire that ran through the plane above our heads. I tugged on my static line to make sure it was attached. There were no reserves for this one. The jumpmaster held up his hand. Five seconds. The red light turned green and the LT positioned himself by the door. The jumpmaster smacked his rear and the LT jumped out and was whisked away. My stomach turned in knots. Over a hundred jumps and I still hated this shit. I was last to go out. I tucked my head, took a hop out of the plane and suddenly there was the rush and I felt myself getting tossed. I heard my chute above and I breathed a sigh of relief. 
Looking up to check my canopy I saw a fully inflated chute and I thanked the Lord once again. I looked down for the rest of the squad and saw their chutes inflated too. Past them, I expected to see the ground, but there was only a thick smoke, or at least that’s what it looked like. A storm cloud? Why didn’t the jumpmaster hold off the jump until the bad weather passed? 

“Staus check” I heard the LT ask through the radio. 

As I watched the other’s canopies disappear into the black cloud I began to worry. I heard the squad all check in though so I felt a little better.  I held my hand up to my ear to activate our comms. 

“Sir, what’s the situation down there?”
	
“Zero visibility guys. Pretty foggy. Can’t see my own canopy,” he said.

Then I entered the black cloud and couldn’t see a damn thing. I heard something nearby. Flapping? My radio clicks before Mitch starts talking. “I heard something. Flock of birds?”
	
“We’re too high,” replied the LT. “Eyes and ears open.” I tried to look around but there was no point. I couldn’t even see my canopy. What if I was falling to my death right then? Heavy flapping got my focus. It sounded large, whatever it was. 
	
“Sir, something is up here with us,” I say.
	
“Simmons, stay calm, what’s gotten into –”
	
“Fuck!” Craft interrupts through the mic. Then I hear a long, painful scream far below me. 
	
“Jesus Christ!” yelled the LT, “Craft! You there?!”
	
Silence. Not even static. 
	
“Guys, stay calm. Get ready to hit any minute. I can’t see the ground in this shit but we’ll sort this out on the DZ.”
	
I checked my watch. It takes maybe two minutes to hit jumping from a mile up. It’s been six minutes and I know this wasn’t a HALO jump. Was I caught in a thermal? I pulled on my risers and felt myself drifting through the air. When I released, I didn’t notice any change in descent speed. The LT must have noticed the same thing because I could hear him cursing through the radio. There’s a loud screech; unlike anything I’ve ever heard. After it ended a few seconds later the LT had to shout over the commotion we were all making on the radio. We were scared. 
	
“Guys! I don’t know what the fuck is going on but stay calm! Weapons on amber.”
	
My combat gear was in a large sack between my legs, but my USP was on my belt. I took it out and held it ready. I didn’t know for what, but I was ready to go. How had we still not hit the ground yet? Then I got an idea. My combat load. We are supposed to release if before landing, and it slides down a twenty foot rope so we don’t break our legs when we land. I thought if I could cut it free, maybe I could hear it hit the ground. I asked for permission from the LT who quickly approved. He must have been as freaked out as me to allow me to abandon my combat gear. I pressed the handle on my hip and the gear slid down the rope and out of sight into the darkness. I took out my knife and sawed at the line until it snapped. I waited and waited but couldn’t hear a thing. 
	
I heard the flapping again, and someone fired their weapon, two, three times. Then silence. “Jesus Christ,” whispered the LT. “Status check.”
	
“Burroughs.”
	
“Simmons.”
	
Nothing.
	
“Sir, what the fuck is going on?!” I knew he wouldn’t have an answer, but I was desperate. 
	
“I have no idea.”
	
We drifted through the air for ten more minutes. Then I touched down. I didn’t hit hard, it was like I was just set down. Didn’t even have to fall over. I still couldn’t see a damn thing though. I heard quick steps and then Burroughs burst into view and tackled me to the ground. He was frantic. He begged me through tears to follow him. We wandered around until we came to the LT. He didn’t have a right half of his body. He was barely alive, sputtering through bloody lips for us to run. 
	
“My baby, my baby, my baby,” he whispered over and over until he didn’t say anything anymore. The cloud cleared from the area behind him and there was this thing. All I saw before I turned and ran was large leathery wings. I heard the screeching and the flapping of those awful wings again. Burroughs screamed as he was ripped backwards from beside me. Somehow I burst out of the cloud and I saw headlights. I nearly got hit by the jeep but dove out of the way just in time. Out got two guards who spoke a language I didn’t understand. Burroughs was the translator. They prodded me with machine guns and kicked and beat me until I was barely conscious. How did they not see the thing behind me? They dragged me into the back of their vehicle and drove me to their camp. 

I’ve been their POW for nearly a month now. If you get this letter, please get my story out there. I’m not crazy, I promise. I can’t explain what happened any better than that. We’re not alone. Something terrible is going on over here. Time to go; they’re beckoning me to come outside. It’s awfully dark out there. Is a storm coming in?

AmbiguousGopher,26,59,1r5xlc,272,"For most of my life, I've been drawn to a certain room of my house. A bedroom at the far end of my basement, which used to be a guest bedroom. I can't really explain why, but I just always wanted to sleep there. Until the age of 8, my older brother and I shared a room right across the hall from the bedroom of my parents. When he was 13, however, he moved into that bedroom, and over the years, the room become even more interesting. The room is now filled with posters of The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix, an authentic Spanish sword he bought hangs above his desk, and loads of other bits and pieces which captured my imagination when I was younger. To top it all off, there was an air vent connecting his room and mine. Almost directly below my room, I could hear him some nights talking to his friends on the phone while playing video games late into the night. I envied his freedom. If I had tried that, my parents right across the hall would hear me and I'd be grounded.

When I was 13 myself, my brother and sister (twins) left for college. Now the only child at home, I called my brother up one weekend and asked, 
""Can I have your room?""
My brother paused for a long time before responding
""No.""
He gave no explanation, but I didn't really care. I could understand that when he came to visit, He'd want his own room to sleep in. For 4 more years, i didn't ask to have the room again, but when i was 17, my brother bought a house. To me, it seemed like he was pretty much beyond the point of having any reason to care about his old room, so one day when he called to check up on things, I asked again.
This time he responded more quickly. His voice sounded casual, but at the same time, It kinda freaked me out. He said,
""Nah, let mom make it a guest room again. Besides, your room is super classy! My room isn't that great.""
And so, yet again, I let it go. I stayed in my room and didn't really think anything of it... that is, until last week. 

This summer, I started having severe anxiety attacks coupled with spells of incapacitating depression, especially at night. I've been on different medicines to help, and have been going to therapy to help work on relaxation techniques. Last week, my therapist noted that sometimes the brain can form associations with certain rooms or areas. She suggested that my brain, due to the recurring spells in my room, may have formed a negative association with it. She told me that switching rooms may help me relax when I start having an attack.

That night, I did it. I switched to my brother's room, and it was amazing. Since my basement always stays around below room temperature, the sheets and pillow stayed cool, which was just to my liking. I slept better than I'd slept in weeks, and thought that perhaps this room was going to turn things around. But the second night didn't go as well. I woke from a nightmare, and felt as if there was someone watching me. I shook the feeling and went back to sleep. This kind of thing happened for a few more nights; each time, I awoke more worried than the last. 

Then came the big one. I fell asleep as usual, and I began to dream: another nightmare, but this time it was more vivid. In the dream, I saw looking at my brother, when he was only 13 or 14 years old. He was sitting on his bed, talking to something. I couldn't see it, but he was looking at an angle which suggested something much larger than himself. Tears were flowing steadily from his eyes, and he was pleading, BEGGING the thing to go away, to leave him alone. The power in the room went out; I heard a horrible screeching, like a pig being tortured. The lights turned back on and my brother lay there, unconscious. A large black bruise had appeared on his ribs. The clock in his room recovered from the power outage, blinking the numbers ""00:00"". My brother then jerked upright and walked over to the only poster in his room at the time, his Hendrix poster. He took a pen form his desk and put a tally mark on the wall behind it.

I jerked up in my brother's bed. I turned on the lamp and looked around the room. I noticed every poster. Sweat started pouring from my forehead, burning my eyes. I looked at the clock. The numbers blinked ""00:00"".
",My Brother's Room,331
horriddaydream,37,132,1r0562,262,"By the time that I was seventeen years old, my parents sighed as they walked into my room one afternoon and told me that it was a necessity that I get my license. I had been hanging onto that shitty little piece of paper for months that said that I could drive, that meaningless little permit that meant nothing in comparison to the real deal. My own license. My reasoning behind waiting to get it? I was terrified of the road, despite the recognition others gave me that I was doing fairly well as only a permitted driver. My father handed me the keys to his old Explorer that night with the promise of, ""If you schedule your appointment and make it happen, this SUV is yours."" And as far as I was concerned, that was all I needed to hear.

The license took a good four attempts. Parallel parking was not 'right up my alley' and every time I would exit the driving center with that smug look of sadness written across my face, my father would pat me on the back and say, ""Next time."" And he was right; after that fourth time and only a few short months, I had received my license and I exited the center that day smiling as I held up my 'temporary card', flashing it to both of my parents, them excitedly smiling and nodding at one another. I drove them out for pizza right after.

We lived in a fairly disgusting country area even though my parents were well-off and lived on their own secluded road in a huge, stone house that all my friends seemed to be quite envious of. There was always your usual shit on the backroads to my house - dead animals, trash, things left behind from people's midnight outdoor sex sessions including garments of clothing and used condoms. I would shake my head and swerve out of the way for these things as carefully as possible; protecting this SUV was a very important ordeal to me. 

One day as I was driving into town from our backroad, I came up around the corner and had no time to think as my eyes met with a cardboard box, fairly large, maybe even large enough to hold a large screen television. In the blink of a second my car has collided with it and it took a few seconds for it to become apparent to me that I had hit HARD, and whatever was inside it, was now damaged all to hell. My tires had shredded the box to pieces as I had seen it fly up in front of me as it got pulled along with the car. I hadn't seen what was inside.

I was cursing up a storm inside my car as I pulled off to the side. There were no houses around here and I felt uncomfortable with doing so because it was getting closer to night and I really didn't want to be back on a near-abandoned road, checking out some stupid person's box contents, and be picked up by some creep who would want to do who-knows-what with me.

I turned off the car and slowly opened my door, not looking into my mirror or anything before getting out. I slammed my door and trudged back to the start of the bend where the box had been. It was in that moment's time that a part of me wished that I had 1.) Either not gone back there, or 2.) Not even left the house that night to go pick up some measly groceries for my parents. Nothing could compare to the feeling that struck my heart as I noticed the two small bodies ripped nearly to shreds in front of me, two little children who had been alive and well probably playing inside of a box, before I came along and completely fucked their day all to pieces. They wore looks of total sadness on their faces from what I could make out, a brother and a sister perhaps, both with black hair and rags for clothing. Underprivileged. Dead.
	
The trauma and torment I endured within the next few weeks was the worst experience of my life. I worked alongside the police as these children went unidentified, and nobody could piece together where these two children had come from. I got little to no sleep at night wondering what their lives had been like, what their parents were thinking, wondering about where their two kids were. Did they even care? Had their parents been homeless and just left them alongside the road in a box, and they had decided it would be worth a try to make a game out of it and push the box to the middle of the road? I mean, why?! 

One night I was getting a good night's sleep for once after this traumatizing incident, and I heard a knock at the front door to our house. I swept out into the hallway and noticed that my parent's door at the far end of the hallway was still closed and that they hadn't heard the rapping, which was usual because they were horribly heavy sleepers. I ran downstairs as lightly and quickly as possible and opened the front door, but to my surprise, nobody was standing there as I had thought would be. I assessed the situation and realized that it was stupid of me to answer the door in the middle of nowhere late at night, but then I saw the box. It was sitting off to the side of the porch and I leaned out of the door, plucked it up, and brought it into the house. There was nothing on it. It was light. It was around the same size as the one that contained the children.

I took a kitchen knife and seized open the tape that held the box closed, and again to my surprise, noticed that the only thing inside it was a small piece of paper with writing on the inside.

My heart skipped a beat. I dropped it to the floor and screamed in sheer terror and panic, until my parents were both at my side, hugging me and comforting me. 

""Unwanted child? Make a donation.""

theworldisgrim,42,78,1qsnvw,252,"I was jolted awake about an hour ago, confused and disoriented; my heart was pounding and my sheets were soaked in sweat. Some slavering, malevolent horror was in the trailer with me, creeping up on me while I slept with poised claws and razor teeth. The absolute certainty of this coated my mouth with the metallic taste of fear, sour and dry and thick. I grabbed the baseball bat that lays beneath my cot and tip-toed around the cramped darkness of my trailer, straining to hear over the keening of the wind outside.

And the pounding of my own heart. 

Of course, there was nothing here except my goldfish and yours truly, the sweaty guy in his underwear. It was the gusting wind that startled me awake - it happens quite often in the late autumn and early winter. The wind rips through the scrub of skeletal trees that surround the trailer park and charges, with a lion's roar, into our lonely huddle of frail little shelters. It gibbers and shrieks and pounds on our walls with fists of dead leaves and frozen grit.

Satisfied that I wasn't about to become chow for some unspeakable creature, I laid back down on my squeaky, saggy old cot and tried to get back to sleep - but I couldn't. Instead, I found myself thinking about that night in the penitentiary, the night of the lockdown; I kept thinking about Mikey and Big Rob and the rest of them, all of us huddled in a cell with the lights off and the frigid northwest winds howling at the walls. After a while, I gave up trying to sleep. Instead, I sat down in front of the computer and I started typing. I'm no story teller, not like Mikey or Hutch, but I'll try my best.

When I first came to the Pen, the thing that struck me the most about the place was just how *much* the cons talk. On the occasions when I'd served time in the County jail, there had been talk, sure, but it was terse and impersonal  - when they're only serving a few months, I guess a lot of people feel the situation is too temporary to bother forging any ties with their fellow inmates. You'd play cards with your cellie, or you'd sit in the day room and watch TV in relative silence; the only time that there would ever be any noise or action was when a scrap broke out over a card game. Fights were the only thing that passed as excitement in County; every other moment of the day was comprised of dull, boring nothing. Going in, you just hoped that the food wouldn't be too bad, and that your cellie wouldn't end up being a gang member or a meth-head biker waiting out a long patch of dead time. People, in other words, who might beat the shit out of you as a way to pass the hours.

The Pen, though - it's an incredibly noisy, smelly, *vocal* environment. I remember, very clearly, the moment when my little group of new arrivals were let out of the Fish Tank and into our new home, a pod housing two hundred inmates. I was overwhelmed by the deafening din of voices and activity when the hacks marched us, bundles in hand, out onto the range. Of course, there were the obligatory cat-calls and wolf-whistling, but most of the cons seemed completely oblivious to us - they were too busy living the ebb and flow of penitentiary life.

Of course, this was not actually true. Cons see everything. And I mean *everything*. But they talk even more.

My first cellie wanted both my bale and my ass, in that order. That wasn't happening. I hammered him in the mouth and it was on - the fight spilled out of the cell and into the corridor of the pod. He was a big, tough old bull, but I had him leaking and his confidence was shaken. Before the C.O.'s got to us, I'd managed to get the nasty old fuck face-down onto the floor, and was whamming away on the back of his head and neck like a jackhammer. Then the hacks got there and one of them laid a size twelve boot upside my skull. The kick knocked my brain clear over the Moon: the world immediately went out of focus and it stayed that way for almost twelve hours. I spent the next three weeks in the Hole for fighting, and when I got out I was placed in a different pod. Word had got around that this fish wasn't exactly new, and that I had a mean right-cross; no one bothered to try and roll up on me in the yard that day, and when I sat down at chow with my new cellie and some of his boys, no one objected. I had been checked, and I'd passed the test. I wasn't a punk or a sissy: I could sit with the men.

Yeah, it's a different world, the Pen is, and it has wildly different rules. You couldn't fully understand unless you've been there.

It wasn't long before I settled into a routine: up for headcount and chow, off to work in the laundry, chow, nap, work out, chow ... and then the struggle to fill the dead hours between supper and lights-out. There wasn't much to do. The cons played cards, betting with tobacco bales purchased from the commissary and individual, hand-rolled smokes. Some watched TV, and others watched the wall. Some watched each other; tensions were always high between the rival gangs. Dope fiends spiked what they liked to spike in the bathrooms. Daddies took their sugar-boys into rented cells or the showers, and they got some ass-pussy while a homeboy held watch for the cops.

And there was, of course, a lot of talk. Talk of family back home, women had and lost, of misdeeds proudly done. There were enough stories flying around that place to fill a library.

 My cellie was an old con named Mikey. He had originally been sentenced to fifteen years for second-degree murder during a robbery - but he had gotten into so much trouble since landing in the Pen that he'd managed to acquire an additional ten years on top of that. Mikey was doing all day and he'd made peace with that fact - a good cat, all in all, a straight shooter who didn't fuck with the spike. The thing was, he'd kill just about anyone, if he got it into his head that he wanted to. In earlier years, Mikey had been a trigger-man for the bikers. He'd been convicted for the murders of six people, and was a suspect in sixteen others ... and I can well imagine that a number of them had probably been friends of his, at one point or another. In certain circles, a good friend can become your murderer in the blink of an eye.

That's the kind of people you do time with in Maximum security.

Mikey and his crew liked nothing better than to spend a Sunday evening crowded up in someone's cell, drinking Pruno and shooting the shit. Personally, I didn't care much for the hooch - it tasted like rotting garbage with a heavy fruit bouquet - but the stories were welcome. When Mikey or one of his homeboys were on a roll, we could all forget ourselves and be somewhere else for a little while. As far as cons go, they were good fuckin' guys, they were, and these bull sessions were the glue that held Mikey's crew together. I remember watching and listening for hours on end, spellbound, as Mikey or Big Rob or whoever wove a tapestry of words in the thin air around us. They'd make us roar with laughter, clench in rage, and even silently choke up in sadness. Some of those guys could play a man's emotions like a violin with their storytelling. They were masters of the form.

Most of the time, the stories were pretty coarse (which was to be expected - look where they were coming from), and occasionally, they were downright fucking horrifying. But ... there's one in particular that I can remember word for word, quite literally; I can actually close my eyes and *see* Mikey and Rob Hutch and the rest of them, sitting there in the cell that night, all of us bathed in the sickly red glow of the emergency lights and transfixed by what we were being told. This particular story likes to pop up in my head in the small, dead hours of the night, when the harsh winds of drab old November lash and rock my rusty little trailer hard enough to wake me up, as they did tonight.

Coincidentally, it was on a November night just like this when I heard this story. I was about a year into my four-year sentence for armed robbery, and this was my second winter in the Pen. I recall that the goddamned wind was cutting through the walls really badly that night, and the drafts were freezing our toes solid. There had been a murder that day, and the whole Pen was on lockdown, all five pods and the Protective Custody unit, too. Big Rob Hutch was a man who had his ear to the ground, and he had known that the lockdown was imminent; we had just enough time to make preparations for what was coming. Happy for a chance to hang out and get fucked up, seven of us quickly herded into his cell with our bedding, snacks from the commissary, and as much gear as we could get our hands on. I remember that we were all wrapped up in our thin, scratchy blankets like convict burritos. The blankets were grey and made of rough wool; upon checking into the Razor Wire Inn, you were issued one and one only. In the winter, blankets were at a premium. Men would fight for them; sometimes, even kill for them.

Mikey and Big Rob were both sitting on the lower bunk. Coltrane and his kid Remmie had the top one. I was freezing my ass on the floor, along with Nick and Richie. The young pups had to sit on the floor; that's just the way it was. The old cons got to snuggle their asses into the relative comfort of the thin mattresses that covered the squeaky spring-slats (and, in Coltrane's case, the old con's bitch, as well). We weren't complaining out loud about it, though - we knew better than to do that.

Big Rob was a trustee, and one of his duties was to mop the floors in the prison morgue. He was telling us what had happened when the coroner performed his autopsy on Stutters. Stutters was a junkie who had been suspected of ratting out various other cons to the cops in exchange for smack. He was the reason why the entire Pen was on lockdown. He had been discovered in his bunk after lunch, dead as day-old dogshit and full of ragged holes. The shiv was found in a toilet in the shower room. It had been made from plastic bags, heated to melting with a Bic, then compressed to form a sturdy, sharp little weapon. 

""So I'm mopping up by where they keep the gurneys, and down the hall the door's open a bit, so I can see the Doc leaning over Stutters on the table. He's humming and singing to himself like usual, and I'm smiling at how shitty his voice is, when all of a sudden the Doc says, 'Holy shit, wouldja lookit *that!*' and then he starts gagging and retching. Then - get this - then he actually screams - for real, he fuckin' *screamed* - and he yells, *'Jesus Christ, it's all over my fucking arm!'* He runs outta the room and down the other hall, and I'm like, 'What the fuck is that all about?' I heard him yelling for his assistants or whatever they are, the younger ones. They all come runnin' back and I heard one of the assistants say, 'Oh, fuck, you gotta be kiddin' me!' Then the smell hits me, from all the way down that long-ass hallway, and it's *putrid,* boys - it smelled like a combination of rotting flesh and an old shit-house in August. I had to grab my nose and run the fuck outta there. Worst thing I ever smelled.""

Nick asked, ""What was it from?"" and shifted uncomfortably where he sat beside the toilet.  He was a good bit younger than me; he'd just celebrated his twentieth birthday a few months ago. It was his first time in and he'd drawn the fuckin' short straw - fifteen years, eight before he'd be considered for parole. His uncle, fortunately for Nick, was also serving time in the same facility: he was an upper-echelon Hell's Angel who ruled both B Pod and C Pod with an iron fist. As a result, Nick was getting the easiest ride a first-timer to the Pen ever had. Coltrane and Mikey had personally welcomed the kid into the crew, as per the old man's orders. He was fresh-faced and physically soft. I occasionally wonder if he'd ever really known just how bad it could have been for him in there.

""Apparently,"" Big Rob said, lowering his voice to a husky stage whisper, ""Stutters was getting checked for pokes and track marks pretty regular, because he got busted so much for possession. So he started shooting in his ass. But not, like, in his ass-*cheek*, ya dig; I mean right into the wall of his rectum. He was shooting it right inside his fuckin' *asshole*, man. Can you imagine that? Pretty soon, he developed a fuckin' *horrible* abscess. Because of all the fecal bacteria and crap that was living up his old dirt road, the abscess got infected real bad. After a while, it skinned over with a crust of white blood cells and gross stuff and ballooned out into a giant pus-bubble. That bubble got so big that it eventually closed up the poor fucker's ass, and I mean right fuckin' *shut*. He was apparently going around like that for weeks, man, for real. *Weeks*. It musta hurt like a bitch ... so, the Doc saw something kinda bubbling out of the dead fucker's asshole and he prodded at it with his scalpel and *pop!* Out gushes a metric fuckload of bloody green pus, full of dead bacteria and stinkin' like the Devil's ballsack.""

""Aw, fuck, that's just *dirty*, man,"" Mikey groaned, and mimed throwing up all over Hutch. We were all wrinkling our noses in disgust and shaking our heads. 'Dirty' was not nearly adequate for this disgusting image.

""That ain't it, though, my friend ... that ain't it. The worst part,"" he continued, ""was the fact that Stutters had been bunged up with this fuckin' pus balloon for a few weeks or so, y'know? It stopped up his shit-canal. When the Doc popped that thing with his scalpel - aw, hell. It was a literal shitstorm. It spurted out of his ass like a high-pressure hose.""

We regarded that image for a moment or two in stunned silence. I felt a bit ill.

""So ... *fucking ... DIRTY!""* Mikey roared, and despite what I'd just heard, I had to laugh. Coltrane and the others joined in. Remmie just looked disgusted. He was filing his nails. Remmie was no longer just another cellblock punk, a weaker man that traded what he had to trade in order to get by in world dominated by strength; in recent months, he'd gone and went full-blown sissy. After a year or so of enduring the subservient ""female"" role at the receiving end of Coltrane's hog-leg (Coltrane was, in fact, the one who'd turned Remmie out in the first place) he'd finally stopped playing the part of a woman and was now living it.  It was apparent that he'd started taking illicit female hormones -his arm hair had thinned out, and it seemed that he had recently grown the barest suggestion of breasts beneath his orange jumpsuit. By the time I got out of the Pen, Remmie had changed his name to Rhianne and was the wife of (get ready for this) none other than Nick's uncle, the unofficial King of Pods B and C. Rhianne was known for causing savage fights amongst inmates who were vying for his attention. That, incidentally, was exactly how Coltrane ending up earning an unexpected early parole ... a 'back-door-parole', as they call it. Because you don't leave through the front gate when you're dead.

""So the Doc got shit on by a corpse,"" said Richie, in a slow and dreamy tone. ""It was *pus*-covered shit. That's fucked up, man. Hey ... do ya think that happens a lot to him? Or, like, was that the first time?"" Richie had snorted some hydromorphone earlier, and now he was somewhere in the clouds, floating around with a stoned grin on his face.
 
""Richie, *that's* just fuckin' ..."" Mikey trailed off. ""Actually, it's a good question. Want some hootch, boys?""

I was just opening my mouth to say *Fuck, no* and then there was a POP and everything was dark. The cons began yelling and hooting all across the pod, both tiers on both sides. Big Rob yelled, *""Shut up, ya fuckin' idiots! It's just a blackout, fer Christ's sake, pipe the fuck down!""* and, for a wonder, some of them actually did. The thing was, Big Rob Hutch was ... well, just that. Big. He was as big as a buffalo. I was surprised that the lower bunk could support both Rob *and* Mikey, who was not exactly small himself.

The emergency lights snapped on, soft and red and eerie. It made the common area of C Pod look like a scene from an apocalyptic horror movie. We could see the guard standing there in the guard hut through the bullet-proof glass, waiting to see how the cons were going to react to the power going out during a lockdown: now, not only were we being sequestered in our cramped little cells for an indeterminable length of time, we had also been rendered unable to properly read a book (a number of the cons could actually read, and did) or see your hand while playing cards, or even listen to the radio, for Christ's sake. The hack was a dark figure swathed in dim red, his body language alert and poised for action. I'm pretty sure it was Robson who was the boss on hut duty that night. Robson was a dead-eyed, square-jawed oaf without an ounce of empathy in his whole body ... and he just so happened to have a twelve-gauge shotgun on hand with a modified choke. I fervently hoped that no one would take it into their heads to start some serious shit - because if they did, there was a good chance we'd *all* regret it.

There was a lot of hollering and door-kicking around the pod, but it soon became apparent that the ruckus was just for show, and was half-hearted at best. We all silently thanked Whoever might be listening that the Emergency Reaction Team wasn't going to be called in. The ERT didn't fuck around. Kevlar-suited and anonymous in their visored helmets, they'd march into the pod and indiscriminately barge into cell after cell, busting heads and whapping out teeth with their batons. Hell, you might even get shot - and the ERT shoot to kill.

Richie broke the silence. ""Man, I was gettin' real worried there, for a minute. If the fuckin' Goon Squad busted in here and found all our shit, we'd be dicked."" Richie was doing six years for selling pills, the sentence for a second-time loser. Oxycontin and Hydrocodone were his chemicals of choice. Faced with the boredom of prison life, he'd started using the products he sold. He was a straight-up junkie by Christmas of that year. Mikey didn't care about anyone using junk - would even have a little snort here and there, himself - but he didn't like addicts, not one bit. He cut Richie out of the crew. Addled by junk, plagued by debt, weak and alone, Richie ended up bunking with some fellas from the top tier across from us. The ""black"" tier. In a maximum-security penitentiary, this has unpleasant connotations. Business might occur between the color lines, but that's generally where any benign fraternization ends. You might not be racist when you're on the outside, but when you're inside, you don't have much choice. To be blunt, it's like this: if you're white, you stick with the whites. The black and Hispanic cons don't want to be your buddy, and vice versa. There are, for a variety of reasons, a large number of hostilities between the color lines. They'll stomp the shit out of you ... or worse. When we got word that Richie had been seen walking, his face cast down, up the stairs to that second tier ... well, we knew. Richie had heavy debts. Forced to either trade himself or die, Richie had chosen life.

Jesus. I felt horrible for how it ended for Richie; I still do. His desperate last bid to cling to his wretched mortal existence only prolonged the inevitable; he was dead within a month. One day, after enduring his morning gang-rape, something must have finally snapped in Richie's head. His will to live crumbled and fell. Richie stayed behind while his tormentors went down for morning chow, and he stuck a spike in his arm for the last time. High as a kite, Richie then hung himself from the corner post of the top bunk. He did it with a rope made of knotted-together socks.

I'm rambling, now, aren't I? Sorry, I do that sometimes - you'll just have to bear with me, I guess. I'm not a good at this, not like Mikey or Hutch. I'm just a lonely guy who can't sleep some nights, when the shrieking wind could be mistaken for the wailing of lost souls, shaking and rattling the windows in their frames. Even though I was released from the Pen fifteen years ago, I can't shake the feeling that I'm somehow still inside. But I suppose that we're all imprisoned by *something*, on some level, aren't we? On nights like tonight, my prison is this rusty trailer. It's my pathetic, menial job. My divorce. My raw, red-eyed fury, unfocused and impotent. It's sorrow and regret. On nights like tonight, my prison is the past, and my inability to leave it behind.

So there we all were, sitting there in the weird red gloom and listening to all the yelling and bullshit slowly die down. Richie abruptly went on the nod: Nick balanced a shoe on his head. We all chuckled. Coltrane started talking about the hockey game that was about to start, then abruptly shut up. We were on lockdown with no electricity - there would be no hockey game that night, not for us. We passed a jay around, and when that one was roached we passed another.

Finally, Mikey spoke up and broke the silence. ""So ... who's up for some Twilight Zone shit tonight? I gotta good one for ya. You remember the last time the power went out, Hutch?""

Hutch shot him a dark look, then did something very unusual, for a hardened con - he shuddered. ""You wanna tell the boys *that* story? I dunno, man ...""

""Why not? Fuck, the lights are out and the wind's a-howlin' out there. Perfect time for it.""

 ""Okay, fuck it. Let's do it."" Big Rob cleared his throat and said, ""Okay, boys, it's time for a scary story. Crowd around the fuckin' campfire and grabba cup of this fine wine.""

""It's more of a brandy, I think, Hutch,"" Mikey grinned, and offered me some. Reluctantly, I accepted a Styrofoam cup of the murky, eye-watering stuff and steeled myself to swallow it. I was feeling a bit happier, now - I've always been a fan of spooky stories.

His voice stern, Mikey growled, ""Okay, first thing's first - this shit is one hundred percent true. Got it? We're not bullshitting about any of this. For real. So don't tell us that we're full of shit, or you can go have a fuckin' sleep-over with that asshole over in the Hack Shack.""

""Got it,"" Richie grunted, then flopped over onto the floor. He was out of it.

""This all went down a long time ago, before any of you were here. At least twelve years, I'd say. Mikey?""

""Yeah, fer sure. At least that long. Back when these little punks were still givin' out handjobs in Juvie, ha.""

""It was a while back, anyways. Me and Mikey here were both running with different crews back then, into different shit, but we knew each other. I guess I woulda been about your age,"" he said, pointing down at me. ""So, one day The Fish Tank had just been emptied out into the pod, and there's a new fish with 'em that immediately starts turning heads. I was playing checkers on the tier upstairs when they all came walking through the gate, looking like a bunch of lost little lambs down there on the range. They came toddling in behind a couple of the hacks, and at the end of the line is the prettiest little sweet-boy this whole penitentiary has ever seen. I don't play no grab-ass like Coltrane up there, but this kid ... he was, I dunno ... almost like an angel, or something. He was *too* perfect, like a picture out of a magazine, y'know? Slender and fair-haired, teenybopper heart-throb material. Yeah, the kid was pretty, all right, and he looked like he'd be easy to punk.""

Big Rob took a moment to pause and force back a swig of the awful, cloying Pruno, a noxious blend of fermented fruit, sugar packets and yeast. As he grimly swallowed it down, Mikey jumped in and continued the story. ""The new fish immediately drove the whole pod completely fuckin' nuts. The wolves were losing their minds, for real. The guards were looking worried - a pretty kid like that can cause a lot of hard feelings between the bulls. Hard feelings usually turn into murder. So they released the other fishies to the care of the boss at the guard hut, then hustled the pretty-boy off to Protective Custody, post-fuckin'-haste. They kept him there for a few days, but the wolves didn't forget about him, not for a moment. All the time, they're asking about the kid to the trustees who had access to PC. They're asking if the kid's lonely, if he wants a candy bar or a fuck-book or a baggie of fuckin' horse, whatever the kid might possibly want ... they're handing the trustees love notes to give to him, money, weed, all kinds of shit. Finally, a con named Holbrook called in some heavy favours, and the hacks moved the kid back into the pod. More to the point, into Holbrook's cell. I remember watching as the hacks walked the young fella across the pod and up the stairs to his new home. The kid had no expression in those wide, blue eyes. None at all. Just ... blank.

""Holbrook was a big, greasy son of a bitch, real nasty. You could smell him from twenty feet away. Complete psycho, that guy. Man, I'll tell ya - watching as Brookie grinned and waited at the door of his cell for his new little bunk-buddy to arrive, hell ... it made me feel sorry for the kid. He was planning do bad things to the boy, you could see it in that grin. He was gonna hurt 'im. No expression at all, though, on that kid's face. I remember thinking that the fishie was either brave as fuck or just too stupid to understand what was in store for him.""

Rob tossed back the rest of the hootch in his Dixie cup and tried not to gag. ""Gah, this shit is just fuckin' *awful.* Who brewed this?"" His voice sounded dry and burnt.

""Our fine neighbours just down the hall, that's who,"" Mikey chuckled. ""They managed to hide it in the toilet tank long enough to get 'er finished, and holy *Jesus*, ain't it nasty.""

""Fuck, I think I'm going blind already."" Hutch held out his cup and Mikey poured him another glurt out of the plastic bag, taking care to make sure that the sock he was using as a filter didn't slip out and spill rotting fruit cocktail all over the bunk. I tried a sip of mine and almost retched. They all had a good har-dee-har at this - except for Richie, I guess. Richie was still laying on the floor, his eyelids fluttering and twitching.

""It broke more than a few hearts, to see Holbrook get his dirty hooks into the kid first. He would wreck the kid's asshole and destroy his soul, that was the general consensus. Come morning, they'd be rolling the kid out to the infirmary and, afterward, probably stick him back into PC for a twenty-four-hour suicide watch. Even if he *did* come back to the pod again, no one would want the kid, not after the permanent damage that Brookie was liable to do to him.""

""See how lucky you are?"" Coltrane said to Remmie, and the little Frenchman smiled down at his nails in response. Then kept filing them, delicately, with all of his concentration. Every now and then, I wonder if Remmie was already planning the flirtations and indiscretions that would inevitably result in Coltrane's murder, his skull smashed in with a twenty-pound dumbbell in the weight pit. Coltrane, the bull queer who had taken Remmie's manhood and, eventually, transformed him into something that he'd probably never wanted to be ... thinking about it now, I'm pretty sure he was. And I can't blame him for it.

Rob told us, ""I heard screaming that night. It was muffled, but I could still hear it. So did my cellie - back then, it was old Johnny Franzini. I whispered up at him, *'Hey, you hear that shit, man? Fuck, that's awful,""* and he answered, real matter-of-fact, 'That boy, he hadda know it was coming, hey? He's too pretty like a girl to be here in this place. He should have never come here!' As if the guy had fuckin' volunteered, or something. I just shook my head and told Johnny to go to sleep. I felt so *bad* for the kid, y'know? I think that was one of the worst nights I ever had in here.""

""I heard it, too,"" Mikey interjected. "" I think we all did, including the bosses on duty that night. But no one went to check on him, 'cuz money makes the fuckin' rules around here, not the Warden or the government. It's money. I don't doubt that the sick fuck offered big coin for the kid. And some cold son of a bitch sold him without a second thought.""

Hutch nodded sourly. ""Money's a whore. That's okay, though, 'cuz there's a thing called karma, too. When morning came, lo and behold, Brookie ain't standing outside his cell, waitin' to be accounted for. Neither is the kid. A whisper popped up real quick and spread down the lines like the breeze, and it said, *'Holbrook went apeshit on the kid last night 'n killed him. He's waiting in his cage for the ERT to come in and bust his head.'* The boss doing the head count paused at Holbrook's cell and every con craned his head to see what was gonna happen next, all of us in unison. I seen the hack pull out his radio with one hand and his club with the other. He started talkin' real fast into his radio; at the same time he's slowly walking towards the door of Brookie's cell with his club poised to bash a skull in, like he's trying to ward someone off. He started yelling for the other hacks to get the fuck over there, pronto! They all came thundering past with their keys jangling and their boots clomping, and then we all got ordered to step back into our cells with empty bellies. I heard 'em down there at Brookie's cell, yelling into their radios and stomping around, and then I heard someone barf. I heard the puke splatter on the tiles.

""We had to stay in our cells for a few hours, and there was a lot of bitching. I remember being totally, completely pissed at Holbrook, me and Johnny Eff. We'd assumed that he'd gone psycho on the new fish and cut the kid's throat while he was fuckin' him, or some shit like that. But then some of the emergency response guys came past wheeling a gurney, and when they wheeled it past us again you coulda knocked me flat with a pea-shooter ... because it was *Holbrook* strapped in there, not the kid. I only saw him for a few seconds, but I remember that his face was fucked. It was mostly gone. Stripped right down to bloody sinew and bones. No skin or muscles left. It was fucking *gruesome*. I kinda gasped out loud, and even close-mouthed, crooked-nosed old Johnny Franzini had to look twice and say, 'Eh, what the fuck?' They only way I knew it was him was the hair - a big, greasy mop of it, like a caveman. The sheet covering the body was soaked right through with his blood. I think that the rest of him had matched his face.""

Nick whistled and said, ""Fuck, man, that's hardcore,"" then sparked another joint. We floor-dwellers had almost forgotten about the discomfort of our numb behinds and tingling feet: we'd forgotten the lockdown and the power outage and even poor Stutters, who'd not only died a violent death, but had also died with his ass blocked up by a cystic sore the size of a man's fist. Mikey and Hutch were telling a story and we were *living* it, you know what I mean? We were right there.

Mikey said, ""Must've been five minutes later, the cops are rolling this crazy-looking thing down the block and I'm like, 'What the fuck is that?' to my cellie, but he don't know either. Before too long, they roll it past again and I'm like, 'Ohhhhh *shit*, lookit this!' You ever see *Silence of the Lambs*? The dolly-cart thing that they strap Anthony Hopkins into when they're moving him? Yeah, that's exactly what it was - and they've got the kid strapped into it. Bite-mask and everything. And the kid is just *soaked* in blood, man. It was dripping off his clothes and I could hear it pattering on the floor behind him. It left a trail on the floor.

""They let us out for breakfast about a half-hour after that, but by then it was almost lunch and we got served a fucked-up mix of warm lunch and cold breakfast. There was more talking going on than eating, though - and everyone was saying the same thing; we were all saying, 'What the fuck did the kid *do* to 'im?' Most people thought that he must've gotten hold of Brookie's shiv somehow, then sliced the fucker's shit right off. Whittled him right down to the bone. But ... Brookie was a really big dude, and the guy was a crazy motherfucker. How a skinny little bitch like that could have overpowered a bad dude like Holbrook so easy ... well, we didn't know.""

The joint travelled across the floor-folk and was then handed up to the bunks. Mikey hit it hard and made that funny choking noise that older guys sometimes do when holding in a big toke, nasal and strangled. He gave Nicky the thumbs-up and blasted out smoke like a grizzled old dragon.

""Shit's pretty good, Nicky. Good score - gotta get some more of that. So, yeah, the kid ... he got rolled off to the Hole on his fuckin' Hannibal Lecter dolly, and they had him on a super-tight lockdown: nobody even catches a glimpse of 'im. They had the kid on a twenty-four hour watch and the whole works. A couple trustees tried asking the hacks what happened with him and Brookie, and they got told to mind their own business and mop the fucking floors.

""The kid was in the Hole for a week, then two, then a month ... all the while, ain't no one heard a peep about him getting charged with murder. There was a rumor going around that the coroner said in his report that Holbrook had died from a heart attack. Maybe his heart seizing up *was* the thing that actually killed him, sure ... but there wasn't any mention of the way he'd been carved up like a Sunday turkey. None at all."" Mikey poured himself another round of refreshment, and the stink of the open bag made my eyes water.

Hutch smiled a little, an action with no real humor behind it. ""Well, tongues were wagging, as they tend to do, and pretty soon people were saying that maybe the kid wasn't natural. That he did Brookie in with his teeth ... that he ate the fucker alive, like some sort of monster. Guys were even saying that the priest paid him a visit in the Hole and ended up leaving with tears in his eyes ... actually fuckin' crying and shit. Wouldn't say what happened, just that he didn't wanna talk to the kid, never again. He quit working here not long after that happened. Just up and quit, and I heard that the Padre ended up selling his house and moving away. Like, across the country. Somewhere far, far away.""

Mikey's iron-grey beard split with a slight grin of his own. ""Now here's where shit gets *really* weird.""

courtneymadison,32,77,1r2j24,234,"I'm just a normal 18 year old that lives at home and goes to class. I've never really had any unexplainable experiences but I had one today. I woke up and started getting ready for class, I thought I saw my mom in her room so I started having a conversation with her while I was getting dressed. She was responding as per usual so I thought nothing of it. (Quick sidenote: Nothing felt wrong with the way she was responding. Whatever this was it sounded just like my mom.) After a while she stopped replying to me. Being curious I decided to go see why. I went to her room and it was empty, looked in the kitchen and it was empty, She would of had to have walked past me to leave the house so I knew she hadn't left. I decided to call her to figure out where she'd gone and when I looked I had a text from her that was received at 5:27 a.m. saying ""Got called in to open. Be home at 11 so you can take the car."". I called her to see if she was messing with me but she was actually at work. I don't know who I've been talking to all morning and I'm really freaked out. Can anyone help me? 


EDIT: I asked my little sister if when she had had anything strange happen when she was getting ready for school and she looked at me like I'd lost it. For all the people that asked about the conversation, the previous night my mom had found a ouija board (unused and still in the packaging) in my closet and she had thrown it away, ""She"" was talking about how ouija boards are dangerous and I shouldn't mess with them. She was very persistent that I don't get involved with things like that but she's always saying stuff like that so it wasn't a very out of the ordinary topic for us. The conversation was about an hour long and I was fully awake when it took place. We checked the house and nothing was missing or out of place. We live in an apartment and all the windows were locked and the screens were intact, so someone couldn't have gotten in or out through them. My mom is really into the weird/paranormal stuff so I told her everything and she has no idea what it could be. Also I feel I should mention we've lived here for 15 years and nothing like this has happened before.

BONUS EDIT: My mom went to leave for work and there were footprints leading out of our house in the snow.",Who was I talking to?,311
PeckerPoker,41,68,1r58lt,205,"Ok, so this isn't a long story filled with twists and turns, but it just happened about 15 minutes ago, and I'm a little uneasy now.

For reference, my husband, son, and I moved into an apartment in the top-half of a century-home a couple months ago. The doors all have old knobs and the doors don't always close easily - you really have to pull sometimes.

Anyway, I just put my son (almost two years old) down for his nap. I told him night-night as I closed the door. As I always do, I pulled the door shut firmly and made sure I heard it click. I swear I heard it click.

I walked away and into the bathroom to go pee. As I sat down on the toilet, I heard my son start crying, which isn't that unusual, but normally he doesn't do more than fuss for a minute before falling asleep. I even kept him up a little longer than usual to make sure he fell asleep. He seemed pretty ready to go down... thumb in mouth under his blanky, he rolled over onto his side and put his blanket over his head like he does when he's really tired.

I finish peeing and walk out of the bathroom and his door is wide open. I see him standing in his crib crying. I go in, feeling uneasy, and lay him back down and cover him back up. He lays there and just keeps crying as I check his closet... like there would be someone hiding in there or something. Kind of dumb, I know, but I couldn't just shut him back in his room alone without checking.

Even if I was wrong and the door didn't click shut (which is possible), it shouldn't have been wide open. When I haven't completely shut it in the past, it will open up about 5 or 6 inches. It's never opened up all the way like that.

I checked the rest of the rooms and closets, feeling nervous, but kind of stupid. Of course, there wasn't anything unusual anywhere. Still, I'm kind of on edge. I wish my husband was home.",Nap Time,273
PlotThickener,12,41,1r0aj7,185,"This is a story I've never discussed with anyone aside from those people involved. But I figured it belonged here. For the longest time I chalked it all up to pranks, my imagination, whatever...but hopefully you'll all be able to make more sense of it.

I was driving in a rural part of Wisconsin (which, if you live there, you know is much of the state). Lots of flat farms, country highways named for letters, empty back roads, etc. It was 10 p.m. or later--I don't really remember when, but it had been dark for some time and it was the middle of summer, so it must have been late. 

It was the time of night cars stop moving on the rural roads so it's just you and your headlights and the world around you starts getting really creepy. Plus you're always watching out for deer on these roads, which can just pop out at any moment, so you're kind of on ""yellow alert.""

I'm driving north on a long section of road. There's a big flat farm on my left, mostly empty-looking, probably planted with soybeans which don't grow high. I'm concentrating on the edges of where my headlights meet the darkness to watch for deer, and I think I see one walking out of the farm toward the road.

I tap the brakes, not sure of what I see, but soon I realize it's not a deer. It's upright, something walking on two feet, and it's HUGE. And it's all black. It's still moving, but it's not moving with any kind of walking movement; it's just sort of gliding across my vision.

At this point I've stopped the car completely--in the middle of the road, just watching. One instinct was to hit the gas and drive past, because I could have easily passed it, but I'm not sure if it was about to jump out. I'm not really afraid yet, I'm just frozen; you know those moments where you can't figure out what something is so there are no real emotions? That was me.

Then it comes into clearer view in the headlights. Well, that's not very accurate to say, because it didn't seem to reflect any light. It was like the light moved through it, if that makes sense. But I could see the outline of the figure against everything else that was lit--the road, the trees, etc.

The figure looked like Death. I mean EVERYTHING you imagine when you read the stories--the scythe, the big black hood. It was exactly what you think when you think Grim Reaper, only unnaturally tall and thin. It was so tall and thin it looked a lot like this guy's halloween costume when he wears it after about five minutes or so: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8PoCkNKDGk Especially how tall it was. I mean, ten feet minimum. I think most people think of the Grim Reaper as being as large as a big person, but it wasn't really like that.

But that was my first thought. A halloween costume. It was still summer, though, so not Halloween. But, I rationalize, maybe it's just a prank. But then I pay attention to how it moves to the middle of the road.

It just GLIDES. I see no feet, no hint that this thing is doing anything but flying off the ground, but you can't see feet or anything because the robe hits the ground.

Then, in the middle of the road, maybe ten feet in front of me, it stops.

The hooded face turns--toward me.

It's so slow and smooth, and just plain UNNATURAL, that I completely freeze in the car. My hands are locked on the wheel. The face is turning to me, slowly, perfectly smoothly, and I'm scared out of my mind. Even if this is some prank, this thing clearly means business. Maybe it's some psychopath scaring people, and not just an innocent prank.

It sees me. I don't see eyes, no glowing eyes or anything, just black, but somehow I KNOW that it's looking at me, making eye contact. I got goosebumps even on my scalp; I remember my hair feeling like it stood straight up. I feel like I was literally looking death in the face. My stomach sank like someone just told me a loved one had died. I mean, you do not want to feel this feeling. Ever. The thing stood perfectly still, too, as if considering me or weighing me. I felt really judged, if that makes sense. Like I was being considered.

Then he glides off so fast I don't even see where he goes. The roads are clear again, and then I heard the engine running as if all of the world's sound had suddenly been un-muted.

I drive back home, still frozen, still rationalizing what I saw. A prank, I figure. It had to be a prank, some overzealous Halloween lover setting up rumors of the Grim Reaper walking around the farms. I tell my parents about it, and they're sure it's a prank. So sure that I eventually rationalize it away, and the memory is filed away as creepy, but nothing supernatural.

At about the same time, I heard that a farmer who owned that soybean field had died that night. But it took me a long time before I put two and two together, when I realized that I saw something that looked like THE FREAKING GRIM REAPER on the same night that farmer died. I remember when I first had the thought, and my stomach sank.

It was like the rationalization I had used to remember the story of the Grim Reaper was suddenly stripped away, and I had to confront the fact that I saw something very, very scary.

But what else can I do but live my life?

I went back to college--every time I came back home at night I took an alternate road just because I got the creeps so bad. Had a good semester, mostly A's, had some good times with friends. I drive back mostly during day or evening time so I don't have to revisit those unpleasant memories.

Then my parents tell me that there are more ""Grim Reaper"" stories going around lately, all pretty similar to mine. When you live in a  small town it seems like there are a lot of funerals for old people that you know or at least heard of going on all the time. At one funeral, an old lady's granddaughter cried because she saw she said a big black figure over the casket. My parents heard that story and thought of mine, but they still just treated it as a joke.

I would stay up a lot later than the people in my house (parents + younger brother, plus an uncle aunt and cousin who were spending Christmas with us), and slept in a room upstairs on this little side road in a rural subdivision. No streetlights out there; just the lights that other people kept on their garages all night.

One night I went up to my room at about 2 a.m., and of course the whole house is quiet, and I go to my room and turn out the lights so I can go to bed. I usually throw a glance out the window and you can see most of the side street because the neighbors kept their garage light on all night.

This time the whole scene looks a little different. There's a big shadow looming in the front yard, and it's blocking a lot of light. Then I look closer and I realize it's not a shadow--it's something black that's cutting THROUGH the light.

Then I feel my heart practically stop as I realize…it's back. The Grim Reaper figure.

It was just like before. It cast no shadow. The scythe was there, and the tall hooded cloak, with no face.

The breath went out of me when I realized that, unlike before, this reaper was not looking to the side when I discovered it. It was looking right at our house.

II stood there, frozen again, my finger still on the switch from just having hit the light. It was a windy winter night, and you could see some snow move, but the creature's robe didn't move at all. The same way its movements before had been unnatural, now it loomed like a statue. No flailing around in the wind. Just standing tall, scythe up high, staring at our house.

I looked away, then looked back again. Still there. Looming. I didn't get the sense that it was looking at me, but I still couldn't stop staring.

Then I looked away, and looked back again. This time I KNEW it was staring. Again, it was hard to see--there was really nothing that I could tell that suggested it was looking at me. No evil glowing eyes or anything. I just felt it. Felt the same feelings as before--a rotten pit in my stomach, the feeling of being measured and weighed and considered.

I heard a squeak, and realized it was me. My breath was being squeezed out of me, simply from the fear. Keep in mind I had no idea what this thing would do next. What, fly up to my window? Suddenly disappear? Rip off its hood and reveal a laughing skull?

After a moment, its gaze departed from me, again. I felt good enough to go to my brother's room and wake him up to show him something in the window. It took him forever to get out of bed, but it may have only been a few minutes. By the time he woke up, rubbed his eyes, and listened to the panic in my voice, a few minutes had at least past. I showed him the window but, of course, the figure was gone.

But still, that was it, I knew. The night I saw death.

That was the night my uncle died.

Big Rob grunted, ""Billy Tremont,"" and hauled hard on the joint, decimating it to a smoldering ember between his thick fingers.

""Yeah, him. Billy Tremont. He was a hack who worked the night shift, and I'll tell ya something - he was just as dirty as they come. Fucking guy wasn't just on the take - he *was* the take, you know what I'm sayin'? He was as much a gangster as any of the boys in here. He controlled what came into the Pen, and when, and who got it and how much they got. The dude squeezed out whatever competition he had from the other cops that were playing the game, by any means available - he set 'em up to get fired, payed to have 'em shit-kicked by the bikers, you name it. He was a complete fuckin' asshole, but he was also real good at getting you what you wanted ... for a price.

""Well, it's a fact that people love a mystery, especially people who ain't got fuck-all to do with their time. A few guys pooled together some cash and they came to Billy, 'cuz if anyone could find the answers to their questions, Billy Tremont could. Billy laughed and tells 'em that he'd love to take their money, but he couldn't do what they were asking. He says, 'The weird little bastard didn't have no file, as far as I can tell. I don't know who he was, why he came here, or where he came from. No one does, and that's the goddamned truth.' The guys called him a bullshitter and Billy got serious on them. He narrowed his eyes and said to 'em, 'You guys don't think I tried to find out for myself, already? Hah? Far as I can tell, the kid just sorta popped up into the Fish Tank outta thin air. Looks to me like everyone just kept processing him along 'cuz no one wanted to admit that they didn't know who the fucking kid was. Call me a liar again and I'll beat the fear of God into you.' It was clear that they weren't gonna get anywhere with Billy, so the guys-""

""What kid? Wait a minute, man ... which one's the kid?"" Richie's eyes looked like black, bottomless pools. I remember that. He had already sunk deep into the mindless tar pit of addiction, by then. He was past the point of no return. You could see it in his eyes.

""Shut up, dummy."" Rob turned to Mikey and made a gesture that said *please, continue.*

Mikey gave Rich a cold stare, then said, ""So the guys gave up and said, 'Fuck it, then,' and that's that for a while. Life goes on. Then a day comes when Billy sidles up to one of the cons while he's standing in the morning chow line and tells him that he'd found some information on the fish, if anyone still cared to know. Billy was lookin' bad, they said. He looked tired and scared.

""That night, Billy comes to see the guy in his cell, after lights-out. He asks the guy for a smoke ... and Billy had quit smoking years ago. Billy says to him, 'I don't want any money for this. Keep your lousy fuckin' money. I don't wanna be the only one that can't sleep at night, is all. You pieces of shit got him into my head, and I couldn't get him out. Fuck you for doing that. Fuck you people sideways.' The guy said that Billy Tremont's hands were shaking so fuckin' bad that he could hardly get his smoke lit.

""Billy tells the con that curiosity had been eating him fuckin' alive, so he spent some time thinking on how to go about getting want he wanted ... then he picked his mark. Billy always had his ear to the ground, y'know the type - he knew this and that, who did what and where and why. He knew stuff about people. He knew that one of the suits in the office had a bad coke habit, the kind of raging habit that most people can't afford for long. He also knew that the suit and the Warden were both banging the same chick - the Warden's secretary. Billy gave him an quarter-ounce of good rock cocaine and told him what he wanted. He promised to shoot the guy an eight-ball on top of what he already gave him, if the guy could deliver the goods.

""The suit came back to him a few days later with the sniffles and a file folder that looked older than the Bible. It was made outta some kind of rough, crumbling old cardboard, dry as dust. The office stiff says that the Warden's secretary told him where to find it, locked up in a cabinet in the Warden's office. He said that he'd put himself in all kinds of danger to get it, and he wanted more than a 'ball for his troubles. He wanted more than a quarter, too. Billy told him that he could either take the 'ball, or Billy could let the Warden know that one of his minions wasn't just a coke-head and a thief, but he was dipping his wick into the Warden's honey-pot, too. Billy told the suit that the ass-fucking the Warden would give him wouldn't be anywhere near as bad as the one the wolves would deliver. The guy shut his yap, took his eight-ball and they parted ways.

""So, in between drags of his smoke, Billy tells the con that the first documents in the folder were pages taken from a court transcript, some back-water courthouse sittin' way out in cow country. They were hand-written with an old-time pen, Billy said: you know, the kind that you had to dip in a fuckin' ink well, then pat dry against a blotter so the shit didn't smear. That's how old the thing was. All the dates and the kid's name were scribbled out, Billy said, but he figured that the first documents in the folder were from the late 1800's.""

Nick snorted. ""What? That ain't even possible.""

 Mikey shrugged. ""It is what it is, Nicky. The transcript said that the kid had been charged with multiple murder, practicing Satanic rites, cannibalism, arson, mayhem ... he was only sixteen years old when they tried him. The prosecutor wanted to hang 'im for his crimes. But the defense lawyer that the Crown had appointed, some greasy little fucker - he argued it would be Godly to let the kid live out the rest of his days in jail, seeing as how the kid was known to be an orphaned vagrant who'd raised himself in the woods. No moral guidance in the woods, that was the argument. The jury ended up getting all pious and they commuted the kid's date with the rope to a life sentence. They shipped 'im off to the clink and, that very first night, he killed his cellmate. Killed him with his nails and teeth, and then he ate the poor sonofabitch.""

Coltrane looked disturbed. ""Holy fuck. This is horror movie stuff. I'm sorry, but you guys have *gotta* be shittin' us.""

Mikey shrugged again. ""Kinda wish I was. But I'm not. Not according to Billy Tremont, anyway. Billy said that they stuck the kid in a loony bin for the criminally insane, after he ate his cellie. Put 'im in a strait jacket. At some point, the quacks realized that the usual treatments weren't working for shit, so they decided to give the kid a lobotomy. He was out like a light from the ether and they were just getting ready to start, when the kid suddenly breaks his arm restraints and sinks his teeth into the lead surgeon's throat, just like a goddamned wolf. Ripped it right out. There's no way that he should have still been conscious, let alone being able to snap those thick bands of leather ... but he was, and he did.""

""Way I heard it,"" Hutch said, ""after he killed the quack, they put the kid back on the stand - and this time he got twelve votes for death. They took him to the town square and marched the kid up to the gallows, with all the townspeople screaming and throwing moldy bread and cow shit at him. He was laughing at 'em. The hangman put the rope around his neck, and asks the kid if he has any last repentant words to share with the crowd. The kid says, loud and clear, 'There's nothing to repent in doing what you want. I'd fuck your mother's ass and fry up her heart, if I wanted to, and after I was done picking my teeth I wouldn't so much as fart her a blessing. Why should I?' So the cops beat on the kid with their clubs a bit, put the hood on the little fucker and the hangman pulls the lever ... but the trap door wouldn't open. He fiddled with it and tried three more times, and each time the fucking door wouldn't swing open. They didn't know what to do. All the while, the kid was laughing and cursing at them and praising the Devil, just being a general pain in the ass. People were screaming for him to swing. It was getting ugly out there, and fast. So someone gets the bright idea that they could just put the kid up against a wall and shoot him, and be done with it.""

""Only that didn't work, either,"" Mikey added. His words were becoming thick and slurred - it sounded like the hootch was starting to do the trick. ""They put the kid up against a brick wall and five cops took aim. Five cops pulled the trigger, and five guns misfired. They tried again and the same shit happened again. By now, the people watching were getting spooked. The crowd of farmers and mill workers who came out to watch the kid hang - they all suddenly had places to go. Everyone left, and the Lord's Prayer was on more than a few sets of lips as they went, I'd bet. When everyone was gone, the cops packed the kid back into the wagon, because there was nothing else they could do. They took him back to the courthouse and, after some debating behind closed doors, the judge had him sent to a different jail, where he was locked up in an unused room in the basement. Then they boarded up the door ... and *then*, for good measure, they bricked the whole thing over.""

Richie attempted to focus his eyes up at Mikey and asked, ""Can they ... can they really do that, man? Just put someone in a hole and brick the fucker over?""

Nick spoke up. His voice was hoarse. ""Maybe not these days, but we're talking back when a lot of people didn't even have a birth certificate. Sure, they coulda done that. Who'd ever know?"" He lit another joint and passed it.

""So, what, man? They just left the crazy little fucker there to die?"" Richie appeared to be in the grip of a dubious species of moral outrage.

""Another good question, Richie. Maybe you haven't killed every single brain cell yet, after all."" Mikey slugged back some more of the noxious hootch and grimaced. ""Billy Tremont said that there was only two other documents in the folder - an extremely fuckin' old mug shot, and a report to the Board of Corrections from a sanitation engineer. It was written sometime in the Fifties. He'd been down in the old basement of the very same prison where they walled up the kid; he was down there checking out the shit-pipes. It didn't have fuck-all to do with what he was looking for, but the engineer mentioned in his report that he'd found a bricked-over doorway down there. Curiosity got the better of him, and he tore away the crumbling old brick with a crowbar. Pried the boards off and popped the door open. Do you know what he found?""

""A skeleton,"" Richie muttered. He was struggling to keep his eyes from sliding shut.

""No. Nothing. That's what he found. When he forced the door open, the room was empty.""

We all took a few moments to digest this.

 ""And then Bulldog ate his gun, don't forget about that,"" Hutch rumbled. He handed the jay back over to Nicky. Nick curled his lip in disgust.

""Who slobbered on this shit?"" he demanded. ""It's wet as fuck. Gross, man, fuckin' gross.""

No one owned up to the deed. Nick started to bitch about it some more and Hutch gave him that look, the one that said *shut up immediately or regret it.*. Nick shut up. Mikey snickered.

""Thank you kindly, Hutch - and Nicky? C'mon, kiddo, just pinch off the wet part and stop yer bitching. Anyhow, that fuckin' prick, Bulldog ... he was one of the least-loved hacks in the entire history of this joint. A real, genuine, dyed-in-the-wool piece of shit. He was still a few years south of retiring when this all happened ... late fifties, I'd say. A huge, fat, red-faced motherfucker, he was. Meaner'n fuck. His blood pressure was right off the scale, all the time; there wasn't nothing he liked better then to find an excuse to smash some unfortunate bastard upside the head. He'd do it with a sock full of quarters that he kept hanging on his belt. When you heard the jingling of the change, you straightened up and stopped fucking around until it was gone. If that nasty old fuck was in a mood, well, you steered clear and you kept yer big yapper shut.

""So, they put this fuckin' guy on watch in front of the kid's cell, doing the graveyard shift, right? He was all alone, too, no partner or nothin' ... I guess the other hacks didn't like the fat, mouthy fuck, either. There he was, night after night, just him and this creepy fucking kid, all night long. Normally, this wouldn't have been very good for the con being watched - being alone with a tired, grumpy Bulldog, and no witnesses? It woulda been a long, long season in Hell for most cons. But the fish wasn't the usual white-boy dummy we get in here - you know what I mean. Like, a kid who got mixed up with something stupid, then wasn't rich enough to buy his way out of it. Not this fish. He was something else entirely.""

Mikey paused to force down a big glurt of Pruno, and Hutch jumped in. ""Well, Ol' Bulldog only lasted for about a month before he goes to his shift supervisor and requests that he be taken off the watch. The head screw's office door was open a bit, and some dude named - uh, Tags or Rags, some shit like that, I can't remember - anyway, he supposedly overheard most of the conversation while he was waiting to see the Warden.""

""Why was he waitin' to see the Warden?"" Richie mumbled. As per usual with Richie, he wasn't really getting the main focus of the story. ""Fuckin' ratting on someone, right? Fuckin' *goof!* I hate those fuckers. Rats need to get *hurt*, bro. Fuckin' rats need to get -""

""Jesus, Richie, go on the nod or something, wouldja? You're a waste of skin."" Hutch looked dangerously displeased. Richie grinned a big, goony grin and whispered, ""Fuckin' rats, though.""

Hutch frowned at him thunderously, then continued. ""So Tags or Rags or whatever hears Bulldog say that he wants off the watch. His boss asks him why and he won't say. Just that he's tired and he doesn't like watching the kid. Boss asks if he wants a partner and Bulldog says nope, he just wants off the goddamned watch and that's that. So the head screw huffs and puffs and blows him off. He gives Bulldog some shitty speech about not wanting to abruptly change everyone's schedule for one fucking guy, and how if he *did* do that, little Johnny wouldn't see his Daddy up in the fucking stands at his next ball game and it would fuck him up for life. You know ... guilting the fat prick, and all that sorta thing. Then he tells Bulldog no and sends him on his way. So Bulldog went home, and he drank most of a bottle of whisky ... then stuck his service pistol in his mouth and pulled the trigger.""

Nicky roached the allegedly slobbered-on joint and blew out a tremendous lungful of smoke. There was no way that the smell of the dank wasn't rolling through the whole goddamned pod by then, but none of us were concerned about it. If everyone was behaving themselves, the C.O.'s would leave us to our vices in peace. The situation was volatile enough already.

Mikey piped up and said, ""It's a sad fuckin' thing, you know ... when one of *us* string ourselves up or gets his hands on a razor blade, no one gives a fuck. The hacks laugh atcha because your bowels let go and you fuckin' shit yourself when you died, and that's your obituary. Life goes on, and no one gives you a second thought. But *this* asshole sticks a gun in his yapper and blows his brains out the top of his head, and hell, suddenly he's a hero. There was even a big article in the local paper about how the stress of being a Corrections Officer causes depression and blah blah blah, sensitive souls can't handle the gritty reality of working with drugged-out, ass-fucking convicts. It was kinda laughable, really. Whoever wrote that article didn't know Bulldog personally, that's for sure.""

Hutch interjected, ""But the fuckin' newspaper didn't mention nothing about what actually drove the piggy to pull the trigger and ventilate his own skull, fuck no. No mention of the kid at all. The kid was the Warden's nasty little secret. Because they still didn't know who the fuck the kid was or where he came from; and one way or another, the creepy little bastard was making people dead. All they had to go on was an old court document that read like a horror book, a passing mention in a sanitation report and a black-and-white picture of someone who looked like the kid, but couldn't possibly *be* the kid.""

I was suddenly aware that I was getting a bit freaked out. In the soft, red gloom, stoned out of my tree, every word that Mikey and Hutch uttered seemed frighteningly plausible. I cleared my throat and announced, ""I gotta tell you guys, this is a fucked up story. I'm getting creeped out down here.""

Hutch blinked down at me with inebriated surprise. ""Shit, I forgot that you were even down there! Quiet little fucker, ain't he? More bubbly in yer cup, my friend?""

I still hadn't managed to finish my first helping of the vile stuff. I shook my head and finished up Nicky's doobie instead. Mikey lapsed into silence, and we were silent with him. Even Richie. In the silence, something dawned on me. I said, ""Hey, Mikey ... when they brought the kid to a different jail and walled him up, after they couldn't execute him ... that was *this* place, wasn't it? When you guys first saw him, he wasn't a new fish at all - the kid was the oldest con in this entire joint.""

""This one's pretty smart, Mikey,"" Hutch said. ""Compared to Richie, he's a fuckin' scholar. We should make him our Treasurer or something, whaddya think?""

""We ain't got nothin' to treasure here, old man. Not in this fuckin' shithole."" Mikey poured himself some another shot of the eye-watering concoction in the bag. ""Yeah, you got 'er, buddy - according to Billy Tremont, it was right underneath this very building."" He let out a raspy sigh and hoisted aloft his Dixie cup of hootch.

""To Billy Tremont,"" he said. ""I sincerely hope God took it easy on you.""

""How'd he die?"" Nick asked, and Mikey flashed that humorless smile again.

""Not long after Bulldog ate some lead, we woke up to the sound of gunshots in the middle of the night again. They found Billy Tremont dead in the C.O.'s locker room. His brains and bits of his skull were sliding down the wall beside his body like snails. The coroner declared that it was another suicide, but here's the thing ... they found five chunks of lead embedded in a wall, all at chest-height. And one in his brain. There was a full cup of coffee spilled on the floor beside him and he still had a vacation request form clutched in his free hand."" Mikey leaned back against the wall and let out a scornful gust of air. ""So, according to the official report, here's Billy sipping on a fresh coffee, just about to go to the office and request some vacation time - when suddenly, right then and there, with no warning or reason, he decides to shoot himself. But, before he does that, he fires all the bullets in his service pistol into the wall, except for the one that he fires through his own temple. That's a hell of an odd way to commit suicide, dontcha think?""

Nick looked disturbed. ""The kid came for him. That's what happened, isn't it?""He appeared very young and very vulnerable in the dim crimson light, his face unlined and guileless. ""It got out of its cell and ... it was coming for him. The cop tried to shoot it, then turned the gun on himself before it could ... get at him.""

""Can't say for sure, Nicky. The only guy who can is thirteen years in his grave.""

Remmie tentatively cleared his throat from the top bunk. ""You said something to Hutch about the power going out before, and something that happened when it did. What were you talking about?""

""Nah, maybe we shouldn't get into that tonight-""

""Hell, might as well tell 'em the rest,"" Hutch rumbled. ""Gone this far, haven't we? A week after Billy bit the dust, a storm rolled in and knocked the power out, clear across the county. We were all herded into our cells and told to shut up and fuckin' behave. A lot of the hacks couldn't make it into work that night, on account of the roads being all fucked up with accidents and torrential rain and shit - so the bosses who *did* make it to work were all carrying heavy firepower. They made it clear that they weren't going to fuck around if somebody got out of hand.

""Right around midnight, I heard a shotgun go off somewhere on the other side of the Pen. Can't mistake that sound, if you're familiar to it. I was wide awake and on my feet in a heartbeat. Then, sort of muffled and far away, I heard screaming. There was a boss standing nearby my cell, and over his radio a voice was squawking, *""He's out! He's out of his cell and he killed Aimsley! He's ripping everyone apart! Get your asses over to Solitary NOW!*"" The hack took off running and I turned to Johnny Franzini - but he stole the words right out of my mouth. He said, 'The boy - he is loose. This is bad.'

""It was dark in there, but I'm pretty sure I saw Johnny cross himself.""

Mikey's eyes glittered at us in the semidarkness, glassy from the drink and wide from the memory on his lips. ""There was a second gunshot, and then a whole lot more. They echoed and boomed and scared us shitless. When they tapered off we heard more screaming. It sounded like ... like animals at a slaughterhouse, squealing and bucking while they breathe their last. Me 'n my cellie, we fuckin' hid in the corner with a mattress in front of us. We didn't know *what* was happening, just that the hacks had tried to shoot  something and they didn't fuckin' succeed. I'm not afraid to admit it - I was shitting my pants.""

""I heard feet come slapping against the cement and then three hacks sprinted past our cell,"" Hutch said. ""They weren't just running - they were fuckin' *sprinting*, haulin' ass like Olympians. I seen their faces for a second, and they were wild with fear. I've never seen anyone look like that, before or since. Everyone was hollerin' at 'em as they passed, asking them what the fuck was going on. They didn't answer, didn't even hear us - they just ran on by and kept going.

""After a few minutes, a fourth guy comes along, and he's limping real bad, using his rifle as a crutch. He got left behind, I guess. The hack was looking over his shoulder a lot and sorta jog-hopping as fast as he could manage. He was leaving a trail of blood behind him. The hack's uniform was shredded and torn on one side of his body, flapping around like rags. I yelled at him, *""Hey! What the fuck happened to you guys? What's going on?""* and he stopped in front of our cell. I could see the guy a little better, now, and I wished I hadn't. It was Aimsley. He wasn't dead, after all ... at least, not yet. His right arm had been shredded to almost nothing. I mean, it was just a few flapping pieces of meat and stringy shit, oozing blood and barely holding the bones together. His right thigh was missing huge chunks of meat, too ... and most of the foot. The guy's face was grey from blood loss. His eyes were like a doll's ... like twin pieces of round, murky glass. He was in shock. He moved his mouth, trying to find some words, then said, 'I think I'm dying.' Then he started hopping again. There was a puddle of blood on the floor where he had stopped.""

""Okay, that's enough,"" Remmie said, and his voice quavered a little. ""I don't want to hear anymore-""

""I don't remember asking if you did,"" Mikey rasped. Remmie pursed his painted lips and was silent.

Hutch continued. ""I heard something else coming, then. It sounded like something running on all fours, something with claws. I backed up against the wall, as far away as I could go, and Johnny cowered down into his bunk with his blanket pulled up around his face. It came in fast and ripped past my cell, just a fuckin' blur of arms and legs, and about ten seconds later I hear Aimsley start wailing like a siren. It was awful. Those were death-screams, man ... nothing else can force a living creature to let out such awful fucking sounds. it took me a moment to understand that Aimsley wasn't just screaming; he was saying something. He was saying, *'Mommy! It's eating meeeeee! Mommy! It's eating meeeeee!'* Then I realized that I was screaming right along with him. So was Johnny. The whole pod was screaming. You remember that, Mikey? All of us, two hundred murderers and stick-up men, fuckin' screaming in unison like little girls.""

""I won't ever forget that. Not ever."" Mikey said, quietly. ""The hack finally stopped making noise, and we all did, too. You could almost taste the terror in the air, sharp and bitter. I could smell Aimsley's blood, that coppery smell that gets in your throat and makes you want to retch. It was so quiet ... silent as a tomb. You could have heard a pin drop. And then, slowly - so slowly - a figure comes strolling into view on the range. It was the kid. He was red from head to toe, completely covered in blood and guts and shreds of stuff that kept sliding off of him and dropping onto the floor. He wandered right down the middle of the range, and he was carrying Aimsley's head by the hair, dangling beside his leg as he walked. I watched him as he passed by and I didn't breathe, not once did I even fucking *dare* to breathe. The kid ambles on up to the Hack Shack, just as casual as could be, and he puts Aimsley's severed head up on the ledge of the window. Then he walked out into the middle of the range, raised his arm, and pointed at all of us, each individual cell. Like he was marking us, each and every one. Marking us for death.

""When he was done, the kid walked back the way he came, and he disappeared from view. That was the last anyone ever saw of him. He was just ... gone.""

There was a full minute of silence. Finally, I spoke up. ""Why the *fuck* did I never hear anything about this before? *How?* This should have been everywhere - the news, TV crime shows, fucking everywhere -""

Nick chimed in and said, ""I never heard nothing about this, either, and used to love those fuckin' crime shows.""

""No, you never heard nothing about that ... but you might have heard something about a prison riot,"" Mikey said. ""According to the newspapers, the cons took advantage of the power outage and went apeshit for a few hours. Most of the guards on duty died trying to stop us, or so the story goes. The government funded a swell new electronic locking system, all because of what happened that night.""

I thought about this for a moment, then said, ""I dunno ... ""

""What don't you know? Huh? I'll fuckin' tell you the rest, how's that?"" Hutch glared down at me, and his narrowed eyes slammed phantom punches into my face. I froze. ""The three hacks that we seen running for their lives - they ran right into the arms of the SWAT team, who'd just gotten on the scene with their guns drawn. The cops busted through the gate, and they found what was left of Aimsley first. They ignored our hollerin' and followed the blood trail. They found the rest of them in the hallway that runs down the middle of Solitary, lying in a raw heap with the blood congealing in a pool beneath the bodies like gravy. All the cell doors had been ripped away from their hinges, and the cons inside had been torn into pieces. From what I heard, it took a crime scene cleanup crew six days to clean out that wing. And even after that, the cons and the hacks were finding dried-up bits of flesh and bone for months on end.

 ""We toldja what happened, and you can believe it or not. I don't give a fuck, and neither does Mikey. Ask around, if you wanna - there's some long-timers here that might talk about it, if you give 'em something to loosen their lips. Once again, I don't give a fuck. This whole pod had nightmares for a long, long time. I'm probably gonna have 'em til the day I die, and I doubt I'm the only one. There is something within these fuckin' walls that looks human, but isn't. It's something that you don't want to meet, and believe me - you better hope you never do.""

Hutch stopped talking, then, and as the hour was late and we were all pretty fucked up, the silence soon turned to sleep. I recall dreaming of a fair-haired young man who stood amongst us as we slept, silent as a shadow. His eyes were completely black in the feeble glow of the emergency lights, his expression vulpine and hungry. I remember that, in the dream, I was very, very afraid that the boy would sense that I was not actually asleep. If he discovered that I was awake, he'd devour me. I remember this quite clearly.

We awoke early in the morning to the pitiful sounds of a junk-sick Richie, dry-heaving into the toilet. The lights were back on, and the lockdown was over. Richie wasn't the only one who was feeling like shit that morning - we were all in pretty rough shape, especially us floor-folk. Sleeping in a sitting position on cold concrete makes for a stiff, painful morning.

None of us had much to say. We all sat and smoked and waited for the hacks to do morning head count. I wondered if pounding hangovers weren't the only reason for that. I suspected that I wasn't the only one whose sleep had been disturbed by the fair-haired spectre. A thing that should have ceased to walk the earth years before, but had not. A thing with a terrible appetite.

The cops finally came around and let us out of our cages. They pointedly did not perform the morning cell check. If they had, there simply wouldn't have been enough cells in Solitary to confine all the rule-breakers. We all trooped off to stand in the chow line (except Richie, who opted to stay behind and, undoubtedly, indulge in a snort or two) and that's pretty much where this story ends.

Well, almost.

I was released a year early for good behavior. During the rest of my time there, most of Mikey's crew were paroled either through the front door - or the back. Richie was the first one to get wheeled out the back way. Then, eight months later, Coltrane's skull was pounded into a new and messy format, and he followed Richie out the back door. Six months before I was uncaged, Big Rob Hutch had a heart attack while walking up the stairs that led to the tier above ours. He fell backwards, clutching his chest, and was dead before he somersaulted over the last few steps and landed at the bottom.

So, for a while it was just me, Mikey, Nick and a few casual homeboys. It got boring. The crew unraveled at the seams and, by the time I was paroled, it had ceased to exist.

A few months after my divorce was finalized, I got nostalgic one night and decided to try and find Mikey online. Soon enough, I did - through his obituary. He died in hospital of a ""short illness"" not long after I was released. Remmie was also deceased, the victim of a shower-room rape and stabbing. And Nicky? I discovered that he was in a mental institution.

I visited him in there, once. I'd rather be in jail, any day. Most of the patients I saw there were zombies, chemically bitch-slapped into subservience by their meds. There were a few others who were just ... strange. Their gaze made me feel unsafe - and for Christ's sake, I did time in a federal penitentiary. I was shown to where Nicky sat by himself at a table, and he instantly recognized me. We greeted each other like old friends and made small talk, just like anyone would. He seemed completely normal to me. I didn't understand why he was in there ... until I mentioned Hutch.

""What do you think happened to Hutch, exactly?"" I asked him, and his relaxed grin suddenly became a twisted grimace of fear. He seized me by the front of my jacket and hauled me close, and his eyes burned bright with the fire of insanity. He hissed, ""The kid pushed him down the stairs. It wasn't a fucking heart attack, that's a cover-up. The kid got Mikey, too - it ate everything but his head, it left his head on his fucking pillow -""

The orderlies grabbed Nicky and pried him off of me, and they dragged him away while he screamed and flailed and twisted in their iron grip. I watched this with an open mouth and my heart pounding. 

Then I went home and got very, very drunk.

Somewhere within those prison walls, there is a thing that hungers. And, sometimes ... it feeds. I don't expect you to believe this, any more than I did. But, you know what? On nights like this, with the wind howling and the fine hairs standing up on my neck, I couldn't care less what you believe.

And, if you were ever unfortunate enough to meet him face to face, well ... I'll bet the kid wouldn't care what you believe, either.

NEWACCOUNT3,57,60,1qs3hz,167,"I suffer from sleep paralysis pretty regularly.  I've grown accustomed to it, so it's not really an issue anymore.  It terrified me back when I was like, eight, but I'm twenty-five now; I've learned to cope.

It only happens to me under certain circumstances.  Only when I'm asleep on my back. Never in any other position.  It's much more likely to occur during the day, if I doze off for a nap.  It happens plenty at night too, if i'm too tired or not tired enough to sleep yet.

The first step to dealing with it is to realize that I am, in fact, having an episode (or whatever you call them).  That's pretty easy- if I am awake, scared, and unable to move, it's pretty much a given.  This seems like a trivial step, realizing that i'm paralyzed, but it's really important.  Having that realization help me block out all the terrifying shit that's going on in my head.  It helps dull the ominous chanting that I always experience.  Helps me ignore the shadows moving around the room.  Helps dull the terror I have of whatever is behind my bathroom door, that I generally assume is on its way to get me.

The fucker behind my bathroom door isn't always behind my bathroom door.  It depends on where I'm sleeping.  Sometimes he's around the corner of my living room.  Sometimes he's coming from the back door.  He was even coming from the closet door once, though I don't know how he managed to cram himself in there.  It's hard to convey the visceral terror that fucker instills in me, at least to those who haven't experienced such a phenomenon.  He's the only thing that haunts my paralysis.  Others get ghosts or demons sitting on their chests or whatever, but all I get is the sense of impending doom, knowing it's right there, coming for me to do only god knows what.  It's a feeling of all-consuming fear, of absolute and complete panic, and of utter helplessness.  Which leads me to:  

The next thing to do, obviously, is snap right the fuck out of it.  I think most people who deal with this regularly probably have their own little tricks to get out of it.  Mine's simple: I shake my head back and forth.  That's it, but it's easier said than done.  Because I can't actually move my head (hence the paralysis).  But I put forth the effort.  Over and over again, back and forth, back and forth.  Honestly, this is the most terrifying part.  It really sucks to try to move and not be able to.  Especially when that fucker in the bathroom is on its way.  But eventually, after some time, one of the mighty shakes of my head manages to move me, and then everything is okay.  The chanting stops, thank god.  Why my head conjures up some cultist shit is beyond me.  The corners of the room clear out, and that fucker in the bathroom goes away.  The sense of terror evaporates, and that's that.

Next thing to do is to roll over onto my belly to ensure it won't happen again, grab my girlfriend and go back to sleep.  No big deal.

That's how it usually goes, anyway.  But lately it's not quite been the same.  I'll explain more about that in a bit, but first let's take a detour to address the question that some of you may be asking: ""NEWACCOUNT3, why don't you just, you know, not go to sleep on your back?""  And that's a good question with a simple answer.  It's because sleeping on my back, in addition to being a prerequisite for sleep paralysis, is also a prerequisite for lucid dreaming.  Lucid dreaming, needless to say, is a lot more fun than sleep paralysis.  So much fun that it's worth the risk of waking up paralyzed.  

What's more is that i'm certain that these two phenomena are related in some way.  For me, the circumstances have to be identical for either to occur.  Asleep on my back.  More frequent during daytime naps, or when i'm too tired or not tired enough to sleep.  They both occur in the interlude between sleep and not-sleep.  At their core, I think, they are 
essentially just two tricks of the mind.  One is me doing the tricking, while the other is my mind playing tricks on me.  Two distinct phenomena, but related in some way or another.  Generally, it's a crapshoot which one I get at a given time.

That's how it usually goes, anyway.  But lately it's not quite been the same.  They are no longer distinct; the barrier between paralysis and lucidity has diminished.  It started off small.  I'd be flying around and hear, ever so faintly, chanting.  Or i'd feel a bit uneasy about what's behind a door I'm about to enter, because maybe that's where the fucker's 
coming from.  Not the pure panic i'm accustomed to, because i'm free to move around, but a sense of apprehension.  Gradually it became worse, over the ensuing weeks.  

I'd emerge into the world of lucidity to full-blown chanting, that came from nowhere but came from everywhere. The fear and terror i'd only experienced when paralyzed would overcome me, and i'd have no choice but to flee.  But no matter where i'd go, no matter how fast i'd run or fly away, I knew that fucker from my bathroom was close.  I couldn't open any doors, because I knew he'd be there.  I couldn't stop moving or he'd catch me from behind.  I couldn't fly too high because I just knew he was waiting in the clouds.  There fear was all-encompassing. Pure and absolute terror was the only thing my mind 
could comprehend.  I'd wake up exhausted from spending all night in fight-or-flight mode.

This new phenomenon was infinitely worse than sleep paralysis.  When I was paralyzed, I could eventually shake myself out of it.  But now, I couldn't force myself to wake up. I'm trapped for as long as the dream lasts. I'm free to roam, but I know he's coming. All I could do is keep running.

That's how it usually goes, anyway.  But lately it's not quite been the same.  Because last night I had normal dreams.  The kind you can't remember when you wake up.  I had to pee when I got out of bed, but I didn't really like the bathroom door.  I was groggy, though, and didn't think much of it.  I used the bathroom downstairs before I made myself some eggs.  When I got back to my room and turned my computer on to browse reddit, I heard something.  Ever so slight, like it was far away, I heard an all too familiar chanting sound.  What's worse, my dog, Riley, won't go anywhere near the bathroom door.",Sleep paralysis is one thing...,227
SamMarduk,16,55,1qvt4k,169,"I have been a Disc Jockey for five years and counting.  I started at high school sporting events with a cheap ipod mixer but slowly moved up, both in equipment and venues.

Being a DJ is just as monotonous as any other job for most gigs.  Usually, the client only wants top 40s hits with smooth transition to each song (no silence in between).  God forbid they let you showcase any talent.  On the off chance you're allowed to scratch and mix you have to still be careful not to let any expletives slip out, or else be fired on the spot without pay.

I have done jobs for churches and the community and I've done high school house parties and college keggers.  My rates don't change and I get it up front.
Now, the scariest thing for some DJs is the equipment, you never know if it will work when you want it. Other DJs have wicked stage fright, so they just create music on their computers and post it online.  Some DJs are afraid of ""lower in"" venues like a house party. All it takes is one drunken boyfriend one time to beat the shit out of you and no more house parties for that DJ.

I've dealt with all these things and yet I have only truly been afraid once.

It was a pretty large party.  The client called me two weeks in advance and gave me the rundown.  I was thrilled.  He offered double my asking rate and told me it would be all EDM (techno) and that he wanted ""a show."" The crowd was set at 500.

It was a dream event.

I arrived about 2 hours before the event started.  I came to the address I was given to a large, empty warehouse.  I parked at the back in some tall grass and brought my stuff inside.
When I walked in the door I saw the stage lining the short wall at the end of the building.  This place was huge and it could easily hold 500.  The dome lights that all warehouses have were brightly lit so the staff could set up. There was a large circular bar in the center of the floor and multicolored lights all over the ceiling.  There were tables on the far side, opposite the stage and one main entrance besides the two emergency exits.  Throughout the entire ceiling there were cages with paid dancers waiting to climb inside to perform.  There were waiters and bartenders standing around and a few burly guys taking posts at the doors.  

""Yo! DJ!"" 

A voice called.  I saw the client approaching from the far wall. He was a young, rich, white guy, probably in his 20s.
We shook hands and he showed me to the stage after quick hello.
It was massive.  I could see the whole warehouse. Lights were all aimed at me and the crowd area. Behind the stage was an emergency exit for the performers.

Setup was very routine and soundcheck went well.  He had a great speaker system.

All was well and I could tell it was going to be a good night.  Everything was perfect.

All except for my headphones.
In my ears, behind the tracks I swear I heard what sounded like static... whispering.  

The main lighting turned off. Then the colored lights flicked on. The cage dancers started moving in their cages.  Smoke machines poured fog into the giant dance floor and the staff took position.
The doors opened and people began flooding in as I hit the first track.

Several girls who I assumed had ""pre-gamed"" before entering came in dancing and several douchebag guys followed.
As the stage lights came on and as the fog thickened I began to see less and less.  While they danced I realized that I could only see the lasers in the fog and maybe a few feet in front of the stage.  I was having a blast and so were the patrons.  Until that noise came back, this time clearer. I could make out chunks of hissed words.

""Essaaa..... Hialaa.... Charamph.""

Obviously not real words but god it sounded so clear.

The night rolled on past midnight and it was insane. People were drinking, dancing, probably doing drugs and banging on the dance floor.  I kept playing until I heard my headphones make a static coughing noise.  This time it was loud enough to mess up my focus.

""That's it."" I thought, ""I'm fixing this asap.""

I let the track play as I examined my headphones.  I turned my laptop brightness up and for a split second I thought I saw a face.  Eesh. Probably the lights against my relfection. 

I gave up and kept playing through the off and on static noises; the headphones tightly attached to my ears.

It was roughly 2 am and I decided to scan the crowd. The fog was still thick but I could see heads dancing.  I looked until I locked eyes with...something.

At first glance she was a college aged girl. She was in a pink raver tutu and had pigtails.  However, the closer I looked the more horrified I became. 

She was soaked in blood.  

On her skin looked like black scuff marks.  She had one eye bulged out of its sockets and her jaw looked smashed.  Her arms and legs were mangled beyond the point of function but she still stood, hunched, but still standing.

I shook my head to make sure I wasn't insane but the next moment she was gone. 

I want to point out that I was entirely sober for this event. All that I heard and saw was done so in my right mind.
I tried hard to ignore what I had seen so I made sure my ears were covered by my headphones and continued to play
I was getting worried that the stress of such a high profile event was getting to me, but I was able to brush it off and return to my work. Until 3 am.
At around three the static was back.
This time very clear after a few seconds.  I heard in my noise canceling headphones a tiny, hissing woman's voice:

""see. shee. leiiia.... ssssss. shhhh. shsa.  
SHUTUP! SHUT UP! SHUT. UP!""

Followed by an intense screech. 
I yelled and tossed my headphones off onto the tables, silencing the track.
As my ears adjusted from the ringing I heard it.

Screaming.

Several people were screaming.

The main lights suddenly came on and the doors opened as people rushed out. 
One of the security men ran up.
""It's a good thing you saw that.""

""Saw what?"" I replied as the fog was still thinning slowly.

""The cage?"" 

""I can't see ten feet man!"" I retorted.

""Oh god,"" the big bouncer muttered.

""What the hell is going on?"" I demanded, more annoyed than confused at this point.

""A cage fell. Nearly a hundred feet. Crushed the dancer and some poor girl under her. Her friend was screaming and that's why we thought you stopped the song.""

I walked out to my car after the paramedics came and placed the dancer DOA. The other girl was crippled but survived.

I saw her body as the smoke cleared. She was the same crushed corpse that watched me that night. She was the same voice I heard as foreshadowing to her death.


I am not afraid of the crowd.
I am not afraid of my equipment malfunctioning.
I am not afraid of people dying at my shows.  
But there is one thing I am afraid of. 

I am afraid when I'm at a prom or block party or house rager and in the back of the crowd I see a trampled bloody body, wearing a pink tutu.",What scares a DJ?,224
DarkPie,20,64,1qqxas,161,"""Mom. I love you. I'll be here whenever you need me.""

Those were the last words I said to my mom before they put the sedative into her veins, the serum pumping through her blood and bringing her frenzied tears to a rest. She had been here, at Washington State Mental Health Institution, for almost a month now, and rather than getting better she was deteriorating. She'd been giving me letters every time we met, recently, and by her description was a horror-movie type event, transpiring within the very institution.

Tests. Monitoring. Illegal abuse. Drugs that weren't quite fit for human consumption. She described these things with vivid awareness, and told me that God had taken her side. Forgive me when I say that I was... Skeptical, to say the least. After all- This was an accredited facility. Others who'd gotten out of the facility while my mom had been in, who were once patients, even described my mother as, well... Insane. How was I to take her word, one who'd lied to me and seemed totally crazy, over patients in the same hospital, and over doctors who swore to help?

In hindsight, I should have taken her to a new hospital, at the very least. If only to put her mind at ease- But then, hindsight is 20/20. Every week I went to visit her, and every week she gave me those notes. ""Mom. I love you. I'll be here whenever you need me."" Those were the words I left on, every time. Every time, she became more and more desperate.

The doctors approached me, telling me she needed to be transferred to intensive care. My senior year in college, I was stressing out enough as it was. An only child, father no where near the picture, my mom was all I had. Seeing her deteriorate wasn't helping my case, so of course, I agreed. I should have seen her first.

While gone, she was allowed to send just one letter, in her first week, before she was completely enveloped by the program. Her letter was short, to the point. ""I need you."" I was there for her, if only in spirit. But my senior project was taking a toll, and going out with friends allowed a relief from the stress I'd been taking on.

I didn't go. 

I decided, despite her words, that this was for the best. If not for her, then for me. She'd hopefully come back calmer, and I'd be a happier person. We'd pick up where we left off. The institution contacted me before the police. My mom had escaped, while on a ""nature walk"" with her psychiatrist from the main facility, where she first went. He'd gone with her, despite how much she hated him, thinking he could help. Or at least, that's what he said. I guess I'll never know which one was telling the truth... 

He was found dead. The words ""God Has Forgotten You"" were written, in his blood, on his chest. His shirt and coat had been taken off, his skull bashed in with a rock. The police said they'd keep me updated, and asked me to tell them if I heard anything from her. The institution warned me to get out and go somewhere safe, perhaps even in police hands, but I turned it down. She was my mom, and no matter what she'd become, she'd never hurt the one who'd been there for her.

I thought that, of course, before I noticed the humanoid figure, shooting out the spotlight in front of my house. My frenzy kept me from seeing the truth as I attempted to pick up the phone, only to find it holding a dead signal. My fear drove me upstairs, to my room, to open my laptop, to try to email my friends... To try to message someone, anyone, for help.

Four shots. One to my stomach, one to my shoulder. One to each leg. She told me I wasn't there when she needed me, so all she needed now was her God. She wrote ""I Have Forgotten You"" beside me, and left me to bleed. I've typed this to the only people who can do something with this. To remember me. That's all I need. After all, my friends are partying and haven't answered me. My cellphone is downstairs, I forgot all about it while panicking. And the home phone is still out. I'm getting tired...

I love you, No Sleep. You better be here, now that I need you...

Resident_E,39,90,1quso7,150,"I've always been into Jessica. 

The first day I saw her, I knew she was the one for me. I can't say my affection has been well-received. Every time I try to make a move, she just seems oblivious to my advances. Whether it's a polite, girlish giggle or my innuendo simply went over her head, I get no real reciprocation. Though, I feel like it's only because of her over-protective family. Her father is the main roadblock. He's the type that will set a curfew for eleven o'clock and be waiting with his shotgun on the porch if you're a minute too late in bringing his daughter home. Not that I've even gotten to the point of being able to ask Jessica on a date. There's always something that keeps me from getting a moment alone with her.

The most Jessica and I have done is gone to the park together. Played on the swings, slid down the slides - innocent fun. I offered to take a break from playing and have a picnic, but of course, her father showed up just as we were about to have a romantic lunch together and gave me a terrible glare, like I was some kind of creep, just for wanting to date his daughter. What's his problem, anyway? I guess he sees me as some sort of ""bad boy"". I've got a few tattoos and wear leather jackets, but I've got a part-time job and a college education. I'm a nice guy, never hurt a fly. 

One of these days, I'll find a moment where I can just swoop Jessica off her feet and bring her back to my place, and she'll realize how over-bearing her dad is. She'll love me, if only I got the chance to woo her. True love is patient. True love can wait. But not too long. If I wait too long, I won't be into her anymore. I'm not into girls for very long.

[deleted],18,55,1qvjha,145,"The shadiness of this whole ordeal wasn’t apparent at the time, but boy do I feel stupid now.

It was a Friday, I think, and I had just signed onto Facebook and noticed that I had a friend request. I’m usually very cautious when it comes to adding people but the person listed their college as the one I’m attending so I obviously accepted. After scrolling through my timeline for a bit I decided to call it a night and go to bed.

The next morning I woke up because my phone kept constantly buzzing practically begging for my attention. Through my blurry vision I was able to read the notifications and they were all from the guy that had added me. Most of them were him liking my photos—some of them being ones I posted years ago, but whatever, it was just a guy trying to get my attention, right?

I shrugged it off and scrolled through my timeline in my tired state and noticed that he had tried messaging me. He said that he claimed he’s seen me around campus, which wasn’t exactly unusual, but then he started to message me about trying out an app for him. He said I could be one of his first beta testers.

I gladly accepted because what if the app became the next big thing, I’d be one of the first people to have used it. How fucking rad.

He eventually sent me the file via messenger and he told me to just drag it into iTunes easy enough right?

The app was titled “Smile for the Camera” and the icon was a glossy animated girl with gigantic breasts, typical male.

When I opened the app I was greeted by a friendly message explaining how I was merely a beta tester for the app and any progress made may or may not continue onto the final version, whatever.

It made me sign in through Facebook which I wasn’t too bothered by, but I was beginning to think that all the hassle wasn’t necessarily worth it.

Fast forward ten minutes of trying to navigate around the app and I found myself at the main menu. I clicked the ‘Instructions’ option and it redirected me to another page. 

Since the app is no longer available, I’m trying my best to recall what it had said but it was something like:

“1. Load the app (Obviously..)
2. Once you are redirected to the Main Menu click the small camera icon located to the left.
3. Now that you have the camera loaded, take a few pictures and then you can post them onto Facebook or whatever social media you have connected. Be sure that you have your location enabled for Twitter.
4. You can add a few filters but not too many, your natural state is always the best. ;)”

By then I had concluded that it was a sort of Snapchat knock-off but continued on anyway.

I clicked the icon and proceeded to take a few pictures, flashing a few funny faces that I was sure my friends would get a kick out of.

When I had taken quite a few I clicked the ‘Export’ option and it redirected me to Safari and loaded what seemed to be the Facebook login page.

I put in my information and clicked ‘Log In’ and was redirected to yet another page.

The site looked like something Facebook would make and it had a few boxes that asked me to type in a mailing address because they occasionally liked to ship out Facebook merchandise. Maybe that should’ve been a red flag right there.

I put in my college’s address just for safe measure because whatever they shipped out could easily be given to me so I clicked on the ‘Next’ option and Safari then closed.

Once I had got to college I opened my laptop and checked Facebook to see if the pictures had actually posted and they were nowhere to be seen. I tried to message the guy who had originally given me the app to test out but he had evidently deactivated his account. Red flag number two.

Right then and there I uninstalled the pointless app and thought nothing of it, until this past Friday.

I was in my Anatomy class when an officer came into the room and asked for me. By then I was freaked out because as far as I was concerned I had done nothing wrong.

He asked me to come with him to the station—which I gladly complied.

Once there I was sat down with two other officers and they started asking me about the damn app.

I told them everything I knew, from the guy giving me the download straight to when I tried to post them on Facebook.

By then they were rubbing their temples, clearly flustered by the whole situation.

“That app, that app was a sex trafficking app.” One of the burly officers said, sighing as he leaned back in his chair. “That guy that claimed to go to your college wasn’t a real person. Well they were but not who they said to be.”

By then my eyes were brimming with tears, I was honestly terrified, what did this all mean for me?

“You see, these criminals did their research. You were merely a target. It looks like they gathered as much information as they could about you to make it seem legit. You’re lucky we got to you in time.”

“What do you mean?” I remember asking, trembling as they explained it further.
“You see, those pictures you took were listed on a sex trafficking website. If they wanted you all they had to do was bid on you and you would’ve been stalked and eventually kidnapped to finalize the sale, we’re assuming. I talked to other victims who almost got kidnapped but managed to get away. They didn’t really give us much to work with; they just said that they’re cleverer than we all take them for. We had a few undercover cops bid on that website and we bid on you.  Once you’re sold your information is revealed to the buyer but it mentions that whoever you bought the person from will get them to you within a week’s time. We noticed that it was a local college’s address so we went to get you and here we are now.” 

By then I was dumbfounded, it all made sense once you put the pieces together and I can’t believe that I almost fell prey to something so sinister.

Afterwards they had told me that if anything fishy happened to call the immediately and they also mentioned that they were close to busting the case.

I think it’s safe to say that I’m staying away from anything having to do with pictures for now.","""Smile for the Camera""",200
mathearetice,17,50,1qsodj,140,"About a year ago, give or take, I took my time walking home from class at around 10 at night. The reason why I was out so late was that it was a Friday night. The night my stepfather would always become intoxicated and abusive, not something I enjoy being around. I was never afraid, my mum would sometimes question me otherwise and I’d always joke about how even junkies can be lovely. I remember it had began to drizzle a little bit but I didn’t bother quickening my pace, I enjoyed rainy nights so I took the route that would add about an hour to my journey, a bit quicker if you ran. 

I came onto a narrow back street it before I saw the silhouette of a tall skinny man emerge from the shadows. 
I stopped in my tracks. 
I wasn’t scared; he was in my way. 
I couldn’t really see him because he was standing next to a dimly lit bus stop. 
I squinted as best I could before I noticed him getting closer. For every step he took, he’d purposely drag his other foot behind him. I could hear the Stomp, scraaape just barely

Stomp scraaape.
Stomp scraaape.

I knew he wasn’t really handicapped; his movements were too quick and easy.  
As he limped closer I noticed his hair was long and hadn’t been washed in what looked like forever.
His clothes were white and covered in dirt. 
His lips looked blood red, like he had put on lipstick. 
Stomp scraaape.
What really put me off about him was that his clothes were close to looking brand new. I found it very odd. 

Stomp scraaape.
Stomp scraaape.

He stopped. 
He stopped limping and he stopped facing me. He had turned to look at the sky; to me it looked like he was admiring it. Maybe he was.
I was a full moon tonight, an especially bright one. 
He faced me again

He started to limp, and before I knew it he was feet away, and at this point I was scared. He did this disturbing giggle. 
“Girly” he cried, “Come with me… Let’s… Have some fun” He reached out his bony hand that was attached to a long, skinny arm.
It took me forever before I figured he must have been drunk, so I politely said no and smiled. His face went twisted with anger for a few seconds in the dim light.  He was provoking me, and it was working.
“Girly” he growled, “are you sure?” I gave him no answer and continued to walk.
I dreaded every step that brought us closer before realising he wouldn’t let me pass. I decided to be brave and walked right up to him, leaving a few inches between our faces. 
He smelled putrid, like fresh road kill. I didn’t show any sign of wanting to puke; I stared him in the eyes and tried to look fierce. 
My instincts told me to be defensive. To say something threatening like ‘Get the fuck out my way’, so I did. Well I tried. All that came out was a whimper 
“get the fuuu…”
Just because humans cannot smell fear doesn't mean we can't hear it. I heard it in my own voice, anyone could.
For a second I thought he didn't hear it, was wasn't affected by it at all
Without saying a word he turned and limped away. I watched him disappear into the darkness before taking the next turn out of the street. 

Stomp scraaape.
Stomp scraaape.

Still shocked from the strange encounter I began calculating the quickest route home. The best I could think of was a walk that would take 20 minutes, 10 if I ran. Even after figuring it out I didn’t start walking, not for a few minutes anyway. I finally managed to bring my foot forward and start my pace again, constantly keeping a look out for any weirdo jumping out of a bush or shadow. I was halfway down the street before I began to feel a bit calmer.

I could hear something in the distance. 
I turned around for the last time.

Stomp scraaape.
Oh, no…

Stomp scraaape.
No…

As I did my heart erupted and all blood vanished from my head. He was standing there, about a truck's length away from myself.
This time I could see him perfectly under the streetlight between us. 
He was hunched over but his eyes looked straight up at me, burning two holes into my face while his teeth were bloody and gritted.
I wish I said he was drunk or high. But he wasn't. Not at all. He was very, very insane. He was the scariest THING I had ever seen. 
He started to limp. Every step he took pained me, like he was killing me on the inside. 
When he was just a foot away from me horror had consumed my whole body. 
We were in the light. 
I could see everything. 
His lips weren’t covered in lipstick but in blood, and that wasn’t dirt on his clothes. 

When I gasped from the sight he just smiled. 
I didn’t get my phone out because it was dead. 
I didn’t run because my legs wouldn’t listen. They just shook. 
And I wish I had pulled out my pepper spray, but I left it on the counter. 
I finally looked up at his blood red eyes. His mouth got wider and became an unnerving smile. 
“Get the fuuu…” he mimicked.
Silence had ceased the moment. His eyes wide and wild his mouth still holding that painful smile. He raised his hand to me, expecting me to give him mine.
I took a step back instead. 
His face snapped straight into rage and grabbed my arm. Just as he took a loud deep breath I ripped myself out of his grip and ran for it. I ran for my life. 

The agonizing roar behind me made me run faster.
“GIRLY!” he screamed, “GIRLY!”
It sounded inhumane, like he was possessed. 
My arm hurt so much I felt tears in my eyes. I think it was broken
I didn’t want to look back. I didn’t want to see that rage in his face. 
I tried thinking of all the routes possible, but his roars clouded my mind. 
I tried blocking them out as hard as I could.
If I took the next turn and went straight home not only would he follow me home but he’d know where I lived. 
If I ran to the park to try and lose him I’d probably fall into a ditch and break a leg. Then I’d be done for. 
My only hope was to run to traffic that was on the end of the street. I ran the hardest I had ever in my life. My lungs were aching and my chest was sore but I didn’t care.
By the time I had reached the end I spun around and saw no one. I looked around frantically, hoping I could lead him into traffic, hoping someone could run him over. 
But I couldn’t. He was gone
I ceased the opportunity and went as quick as I could back home, checking every shadow, every bush. When I reached the front gates of my home I looked around for the last time. He was nowhere to be seen. 

I exhaled loudly and collapsed onto the floor. I felt an overwhelming wave of relief hit me and I began to smile.
‘I made it!’ I thought to myself, ‘I actually fucking made it!’ 
My celebration was interrupted by my stepfather’s drunken cries and relief had disappeared. I got up, ready to open the gate.

Stomp scraaape.
Wait…
Stomp scraaape.
No fucking way…

I looked down the hillside of the street and there he was. Right at the bottom. Even in the distance I could see his wide eyes and smile. He raised his hand and waved at me. I wanted to scream but my vocal chords didn’t want to cooperate.

He started to limp.
 
Stomp scraaape.
Stomp scraaape.



",I now stay home at night,190
FishCustard,21,39,1qrr82,135,"This is the story of how I became a monster.

----

I was heading home from work on the day it started - I'd stayed late to finish up a presentation for the next morning and had to take the slow train home. It seemed to stop at every little place between the city and the small town where I lived. The darkness closed in as the train trundled on, and I drifted off into a light sleep.

When I awoke, a few stations away from home, I was startled to find myself staring into the face of a young woman. She had long, ever so slightly curly black hair, bright blue eyes and a very pretty pale complexion.

""Hello!"" she chuckled as I blinked myself awake.

""Hi there,"" I replied, forcing all the services in my brain to start as quickly as I could.

""Heading home I'm assuming?"" she said, smiling.

""Yeah."" I explained that I was heading home from work. She asked what I did and I gave a quick overview of my very boring job. In almost any other setting this conversation would have been beneath notice, but on the cusp of night, in an empty train carriage with a beautiful girl, it was rather odd.

I asked her what she was doing out; she said that she was visiting someone in one of the towns we passed through as I was sleeping. The conversation went on - I learned that she lived in the same town as me, that she'd just moved into an apartment there and didn't know anyone, that she was looking for a job, etc. We got off the train and exited the station still engrossed in our conversation. Before we headed our separate ways I thought I may as well ask for her phone number - this wasn't something I'd usually dream of doing, but we seemed to have just clicked.

She smiled, took my phone and tapped in her name and number.

Elysia.

A pretty name to go with the pretty girl, I thought as I walked home. We continued our chatting via text over the next few days, and even had a Skype session over the weekend during which we argued the merits of the latest film releases and swapped favourite movies.

Everything was going swimmingly until I received a text one evening that made my chest tighten instantly.

&gt;Jake, I'm scared. I think there's something weird going on here...

&gt;What do you mean, what's going on?

&gt;Yesterday when I got back home the door was already wide open. Nothing was taken though. Thing is, the same thing happened today, and now there's a horrible smell in the bathroom.

&gt;Ok, call the police and I'll be right over. What's your address?

She texted it to me - one of the new build apartments on the edge of town. I remembered them because of how unusual the blocks are: each floor is painted a different colour, the first floor is blue, the second green and the top floor is red. They looked a bit like alien angel cakes.

I drove out to her as quickly as I could without drawing unwanted attention to myself. The parking lot was almost empty, so I parked as close to the entrance of her building and rushed in. I looked at the address again to confirm: 404, that means 4th floor I thought to myself.

I decided to forgo the elevator and bounded up the stairs two at a time, heart thumping through my ribcage. When I got to the 4th floor landing it was pitch black. A strong uneasy feeling crept up my spine, but I crept forward, groping the wall for a light switch as I went. Eventually the lights came on of their own accord - a faulty motion sensor, I thought to myself as I headed for #404 at the far end of the corridor.

Elysia opened the door as I approached, she must have been watching through the spyhole.

""You didn't have to come over, but... thanks,"" she said.

""No problem - did you call the police?""

""Yeah, although they didn't seem to take me very seriously. They said they'd send someone though, to take my statement and have a look around.""

I asked whether she wanted anything, but she declined. I continued by asking whether she minded if I had a quick look around myself - she didn't. I started with the bathroom.

As soon as I walked in I was hit by a disgusting combination of sickly-sweetness and metallic tang. I checked everywhere I could think of to find the source of the smell, but it seemed to be coming from all around me; there was nothing obviously out of place, no rotting horrors under the bath, no Cthulhoid beings in the toilet cistern. I was about to head up into the loft space when the lights went dead.

I froze for what felt like a whole minute, but could only have been a second or so. I called out to Elysia. No reply. Shit.

I fished my phone out of my pocket and turned on its flashlight. I crept out of the bathroom and walked straight into something. Leaping back in terror I turned my flashlight on it, expecting to see some shambling horror, but was immensely relieved to see that it was only Elysia.

""You frightened the life out of me!"" I said.

""Sorry! I didn't know you were still in there. I don't know what happened, everything's dead!"" Elysia said. ""What do we do, what's going on...""

Putting my arm around her, I led her toward the front door, gently but quickly. ""I don't know, but I do know we have to get out of here.""

""But the police...""

""We'll wait for them in the lobby, where it's bright and there's more than one way out, okay?"" I think I was trying to convince myself of the plan more than her. Nevertheless I felt her head nod against my shoulder.

As we reached the door there came the sound of scraping metal from outside. My heart nearly lept out of my mouth until I realised it was the elevator doors opening - the cops must be here. The sound of heavy boots striding down the corridor followed. I looked through the spyhole, and immediately wished I hadn't.

The lights outside were flickering on and off, bathing the corridor in stroboscopic lighting. In the flashes of illumination I saw three large figures heading directly for the apartment. They had elongated faces that appeared to taper to a tentacle-like appendage, no mouth and huge, black sunken eyes. They walked slowly, with a vaguely stooped gait.

As they approached the door, I heard their raspy, gurgling breathing. Only then did it click that these things were *right outside the fucking door*.

I grabbed Elysia and ran to the kitchen, telling her to hide in a closet. She screamed at me that there were no closets in the kitchen. I was about to tell her to make a run for one, when there was an almighty crash - the splintering and rending of wood. They were inside.

I frantically searched the drawers for a knife, eventually finding one. I grabbed another and gave it to Elysia. A second later one of the things filled the kitchen doorway. I ran at it, knife raised, but the next thing I knew I was on my back on the floor - and the knife had slid somewhere under the cooker. Elysia was too terrified to do anything - the monstrous being simply picked her up and put her over its immense shoulder. I got back to my feet and looked around for another weapon, eventually settling on a large marble rolling pin.

I followed the thing out into the living room, only to be confronted with what must have been one of the others. By now I was running on adrenaline only and my eyes had adjusted to the dark somewhat. I swung the marble rod at the creature's head with all the force I could muster, expecting it to magically deflect, or simply have no effect. But it didn't. It connected, and the horrible thing collapsed to its knees. I struck it again and it collapsed to the floor, its unearthly rasping breaths laboured and uneven.

Despite my triumph, two lights clicked on in my head. One, by now the thing that had taken Elysia would be long gone, back to whatever fucking dimension these things came from. Two, there were three of them.

I turned on instinct. Too late. It was on me before I could react, punching me to the ground with a massive fist. I tried to stand, but fresh darkness was creeping into my vision. As I drifted away from consciousness, my arm began to burn with pain - it had injected me with some kind of venom. I was going to die.

----

Only I didn't. That might be the worst part of all this.

I woke up to blinding white light and an unfamiliar ceiling. I looked around and new fear gripped my heart. I had no idea where I was, but I knew I had to get out - clinical white walls, intense lighting and nothing in the small room bar a metal-frame bed and a bedside table. One door. I tried to get up but I couldn't coordinate any of my movements properly. What did that thing inject me with?

Thoughts swam through my brain as I remembered the beings and the apartment... Elysia. They took Elysia. My train of thought was brought to a shuddering stop by the door opening. I fully expected to see one of the tentacle faced horrors, come to finish the job.... but it wasn't. A man wearing a crisp black shirt, black trousers and a deep red waistcoat stepped in to the room. His clothes were totally at odds with the bright white room, but his hair seemed to blend in nicely. It was thick, almost bushy, and bright white.

""I'm sorry about all this,"" he said. His accent was odd... British? I couldn't place it. ""We're normally a lot better than this. Long story.""

""What did you do with Elysia?"" I shouted.

""The girl? She's safe. For now.""

""You monsters,"" I spat, imagining what they would do to her.

""That's a very interesting point,"" the man said, walking to the table and pouring two glasses of water from a jug I hadn't even noticed. He offered me one but I obviously declined. ""Hm, I don't blame you,"" he muttered at that point.

Wanting any answers I could get, I blurted out ""what the fuck were those things?"".

""What things?""

""The tentacle-faced things that took Elysia. They're something to do with you I assume.""

The man looked genuinely confused for a moment, before his face fell. ""Was this what you saw?"" he said, heading back to the door. He muttered to someone just outside the room and one of the horrific beings followed him inside.

Only it wasn't a horrific being. It was a man. A man wearing a full-face gas mask and some kind of respiration equipment on his back. A long rubber tube connected the bottom of his mask to the pack on his back, and there were two large black lenses over his eyes. The equipment must have been heavy as he walked with a slight stoop.

""What the fuck is going on here?"" I just about managed to say.

""This is Iain,"" the man continued. ""You're fine to breathe in here, this one's clean."" The 'monster' reached up and took the mask off. Underneath was a broad-faced, brown haired man of about 40. He nodded curtly.

""So... what happened?"" I said, unable to form more of a thought than that.

""Well, tell me about Elysia,"" the first man replied.

I told him the story of us meeting on the train, how we got closer over a few weeks and then how she texted me to say that her apartment had been open and there was a weird smell.

""This is the interesting bit,"" he said, almost smiling. ""Where did she live?""

""In an apartment on the edge of town,"" I said, sighing. Clearly they knew all this.

""Yes, one of those weird multi-coloured low-rise blocks. Which number?""

The instant he said that my world started to upside down. ""404,"" I whispered.

Realisation hit me again like a freight train. Those wacky buildings where the first floor is blue, the second is green and the third is red.

There is no fourth floor.

""Which leaves us with the question of just where you were last night,"" the man said. He continued prattling but I wasn't listening - I was too busy replaying events. Meeting Elysia after waking up on a midnight train, texting her... she never mentioned work, or even what she did all day. Then the dark landing, the smell in the bathroom, the lights going out... the fact that she didn't reply when I called out to her, yet she was *right outside the door*. I practically fell over her when I came out of the bathroom. Oh God.

""So Elysia..."" I said, unable to finish the sentence.

""Let's just say that you weren't meant to get out of that building.""

""But she looked perfectly normal.""

""*But* we now know that appearance is far from everything. It was dark. Did you *really* look at Elysia after the lights went out?""

As I replayed my memory to see if I could pick out anything about Elysia's appearance, something else jumped out at me. ""I hit one of... them,"" I waved a finger at Iain, ""with a rolling pin.""

The white-haired man sighed. ""Yes, you did. Understandable under the circumstances.""

""What happened to him?""

""He died. Subdural haematoma.""

I collapsed back onto the bed, cold and shaking. ""What's going to happen to me?""

""Well, under official procedures you'll have to be charged with... manslaughter probably. Obviously you'd have self-defence and diminished responsibility as defences though. Can't guarantee you won't go to jail, they're under instructions to push for hard sentences.""

""Instructions from whom? Area 51? CIA? NSA? The SCP Foundation?""

The mysterious man stared at the floor for a couple of seconds. When his eyes met mine, there was a distinct sadness in them. ""No. Me.""

For a brief moment, silence filled the room. Then I burst out laughing. ""Wait, you're going to tell all this to a judge and jury? I killed some man in a mask on a floor that shouldn't exist while he was trying to stop some fucking demon from eating me?""

""They... they don't eat people,"" the man corrected as if I'd just said that two plus two is nine. ""Anyway, not that kind of court. You've heard of military tribunals and such, yes?""

I nodded.

""It's like that.""

Despair was about to consume me when I caught onto something. ""Hang on, you said 'officially'...""

The man smiled. ""Well, I *am* one operative short now. And things are so inefficient these days, they're always losing evidence and having to drop cases...""

And so that is how I became a monster. A monster with a long face, black sunken eyes and raspy, gurgling breath, trying his best to save the next person from similar fate.",Elysia,174
PatMallon,18,50,1qwsuf,128,"It had me where it wanted, delivering its final test, or perhaps threat. “Blink and they will all be gone. Everyone you love. Everyone you care for. Stripped from your mind like they were never there.”

The following minutes were agonizing, feeling like an eternity. My eyes twitched repeatedly as I unnaturally pried them open. They streamed tears of both pain and misery, but soon those tears ran dry and dust began collecting.  That’s when the burning started, like hot irons singeing my corneas. Despite the suffering, I cried out, “I must keep them open.” But I knew I wouldn’t be able to do this forever.

Soon, I regrettably freed my eyelids from their pry and let my lashes engage. Moisture returned. The pain ceased – not just the searing of my eyes, but the sadness within. I suddenly realized its plan was flawed. I raised my head with a cocky grin to let it know that it should have chosen someone, unlike me, who actually had others to love.

For whatever reason, it simply returned the very same grin.","""Blink and they will all be gone.""",178
you_are_all_jerks,24,49,1qyvt1,126,"I grew up in northern NJ my entire life.  We lived in a couple different houses/apartments in nice, quaint neighborhoods with good neighbors and an all over good vibe.  The first house we lived at after my parents split up will be one I will never forget, and I was only 3 when it happened. 

My parents were divorced on my first birthday and a year later my mom, aunt, and I rented a house in the small town of Blairstown.  The house was split into two houses as it was a fairly large older house.  We had the upstairs and a rabbi lived below us; he lived there for many years.  Even though I was only 3 or 4 at the time, it seems like yesterday.  I remember being in my moms arms as we took a tour through the house and I just felt very uneasy, like someone was watching me.  I guess my aunt and mom liked it because no sooner had we looked at it did we move in.  As most normal renters do when they move in, we cleaned the house up, there was this weird red paint on the walls and water in the kitchen, we thought there was a water leak.  After a plumber came, there was no water leak so we just assumed someone left the picture window open during the storm the night before.

Everything seemed to be going great the first couple weeks.  It was a lovely neighborhood and all but there was just this weird vibe I kept getting.  I woke up one morning to my aunt screaming, it wasn't loud or anything but just a small shriek of surprise.  Getting out of my bed I noticed the floor was really cold, but then again it was winter and real hardwood.  But the heat was on last night, why was it so cold?  I walked down the hallway and saw my aunt and mom with buckets cleaning this red paint off the walls again.  I overheard them talking in low voices to one another;
Mom: Gum (my aunts nickname was Gumby), this smells like blood not paint.
Gumby: I noticed.  

They continued to wash the walls off as I, being the little explorer I was, decided to go upstairs to the attic to look for my barbie dolls.  The attic door was at the end of the kitchen and usually hard a hard time closing, the house was way old.  As I  walk up stairs I smelled something really bad, like warm dog poo on a hot summer day, bad.  I get up stairs and see a pile of what looks like coal in the corner and a big red door next to it.  A noise from behind the door startles me and I run back down the stairs, nearly falling on my butt most of the way.  When I open the door I start crying and run to my mom.  She asks me what's wrong and I tell her there is a big red door up stairs and there's something behind it. My aunt looks at her, she looks at my aunt and they both tell me it's probably a squirrel or something, I knew better than that.  There was something bad up there, I could feel it.

A few more weeks pass and things are getting more and more creepy.  Every morning I listen to my mom and aunt clean blood off the walls.  They just kept saying it must be paint that is bleeding through the wall paper.  You could tell by their voices they were scared.  I spent most of my time playing barbies or doll in the living room but it kept getting really cold.  The pilot light on our furnace kept blowing out and we couldn't figure out why.  Again, my aunt and mom told me it was cold because it was winter.  

We would sit on the couch and watch a movie or TV at night before bed.  One night my mom and aunt watched a scary movie, of course I wanted to watch and they actually let me but said I couldn't get scared.  Looking back now, I laugh at my childish self, I am a wimp for good reason!  We were about 15 minutes into the movie when I heard a knock on the window next to the couch.  I look over and see someone looking in our window waving.  It was hard to tell if it was a male or female, it was solid but not, had a face, but didn't.  I screamed and jumped on my mom's lap yelling ""Mommy someone is outside!!!""  My mom quickly glances at the window, she saw it, I know she did!  She runs out the front door and around back.  Only a few moments later she came back, pale as could be and told me to go to my room.  I cried that I didn't want to but she said it was time for bed.  

I stayed up and listened to my mom and aunt talk at the kitchen table. 

Mom: Gumby, that window is 10 feet up off the ground, there is no way someone could be in the window.
Gumby: Tee (my mom's name is Tina), she's a kid she probably just saw a reflection of the TV.
Mom: I saw it too. It wasn't a reflection.

The house got this eerie quietness to it.  I went to bed and fell fast asleep.

The next day I wake up to footsteps in the attic, I go out into the living room and see the attic door open, my aunt is cleaning up the blood.  I asked where mom was and she said ""Upstairs, checking out that door for you.""  I had completely forgotten about the door. 

I go outside and sit on the porch, the neighboors dog comes up to me and starts licking my face, he was the cutest black lab ever.  Suddenly , his fur stands straight on end and he starts viciously barking at the front door of our house before whimpering off as if someone scolded him.  I go back inside and my mom is pacing around the kitchen talking on the phone to someone.  Under the door knob to the attic was my little rocking chair I had, it was in my room, I wondered why my mom put it there.

That evening we were eating dinner and I felt weird again.  I was sitting across from the attic door eating when I noticed my rocking chair was ever so slightly rocking, almost as if the wind blew it, but it was smooth.  Never really slowing down or speeding up.  I guess my aunt saw me staring at it and looked over.  I felt her kick my mom under the table and nod towards the door.  My mom turned her head, after a few more rocks the chair stopped, dead.  The lightbulbs in the small chandelier over the kitchen table started dripping water.  At first it was slow but it increased to the point where there was a steady stream coming out of the bottom of them.  We all looked up, completely silent, you could feel the wave of panic/horror in the room though.  I look back at the rocking chair and there is a little girl with a grin on her face looking at me.  Her fingers are all bloody and her old school dress looks torn.  My mom let out a shriek my aunt jumped out of her seat and ran to the attic door just before the little girl turned and walked through it.  The water stopped dripping.

My mom worked nights and had to leave that night for work, my aunt was watching me.  She put me to bed with a glass of water as usual.  I don't know what time it was but I know it was before 4AM.  I woke up and was really thirsty, I reached down on the floor and picked up my glass of water.  After a nice big drink I start putting the glass down and it falls, shattering into a million pieces.  I looked at the door, I hear my aunt come running down the hallway.  When I looked back down I saw a face in the puddle of water.  I blinked twice, thinking it was the reflection of the moon playing tricks on me.  I was mesmerized by this face.  It was purple and black and had this slightly evil yet welcoming grin on it's face.  I reached down to touch it when all of a sudden I felt this pain on the back of my hand.  I screamed and the trace was broken as my aunt flung my door open.  She picks me up and takes me to the kitchen where she sits me on the table.  The back of my hand is covered in blood, I guess the glass cut it all up, but why the top of my hand and not my palm I wondered.  My aunt ran my hand under water and it became clear why it was bleeding so bad.  It was glass that cut me, it was teeth.  There was a full imprint of teeth on the back of my hand.  My aunt started yelling at me for biting my hand and I told her it wasn't me, it was the lady in the puddle.  She didn't say much after that.  She just bandaged up my hand the best she could as she called my mom to tell her she was bringing me to the doctor.  

The doctor looked at my hand and confirmed that I did not bite my own hand.  He also had to take imprints of my  mom and aunts teeth to rule out child abuse.  They weren't a match and everything was fine.

When we get home I over heard my mom and aunt saying that they want to move.  My mom suggests they talk to the rabbi and see if he knows anything about the house.  We all head downstairs and knock on his door.  His smile is warm and welcoming and he lets us in.  He gives me a toy to play with and I go about letting my imagination run wild but still keep an ear open.  My mom and aunt tell him everything.  The big red door in the attic that goes no where, is hot to the touch and doesn't have a knob.  The bat crap that's next to it that she cleans up every day.  The pilot light constantly going out, the kitchen raining, the face in the puddle the window, EVERYTHING.  After choking back tears my mom asks what we can do.  He suggested to move out, and leave everything.  He pulled out a box of newsclippings and started showing them to my mom and aunt.  There was a mother and little girl who used to live in the house years ago.  They didn't have much money so the mom worked all of the time.  One cold windy night the mom left to work, leaving her daughter in the house.  The wind blew the pilot light out on the furnace, and with the age of the house, the wind whipped through there making it nearly freezing really fast.  This little girl got cold and wrapped herself in a blanket.  The walls of the kitchen were still warm since the furnace was close to there.  She began taking panel after panel off the wall to get to the warmth.  She crawled into the insulation to keep warm and doing that cause her to choke on fiberglass and die in the wall.  When the mother came home to see her daughter dead she hung herself by the window in the back.  There it was, all laid out on the table.  The rabbi explained that most people who had lived in the house since then didn't have a problem unless they had a small child, particularly a girl.  My aunt and mom thanked him and we left back to our house.

A week later we were finally moving into our new house.  That week was the week from hell in our current house.  We packed our essentials and left them in my moms truck.  I had a diamond cross that was given to me as a baby that I wanted but it was stuck upside down on my dresser.  The diamonds also looked like they were dying, that is the best way I could describe them.  

The last night we were there we decided it would be best to put the queen mattress in my room since it got the most light from the outside light and moon and we would all sleep there.  I was in the middle, my mom to the left my aunt to the right.  My aunt being the prankster she is kept knocking on the floor to scare me.  Finally my mom reached over and slapped her and told her to stop because it was scaring me.  A few seconds later she did it again.

Mom: Gumby knock it the fuck off you're scaring her!
Gumby:...It's not me.

No sooner did she say that and my water glass started to move across the floor towards the hallway.  We looked down the hallway and saw this figure at the end of the hallway where it meets the kitchen, kneeling down and pounding on the floor.  It was pounding so hard that you could feel the vibrations in the bedroom.  The figure also sounded like it was wailing.  A shrill cry of sorrow and despair is the best way I can describe it.  We slammed the bedroom door shut and locked it.  My mom grabbed her cross on her neck and just held us all close until the pounding stopped.  I don't know when it stopped, I was being clutched so tight the only thing I could hear was my moms heart beat until I fell asleep.

The next day we were gone at the crack of dawn to our new place.  We had left so many things in that house, we were too scared to go back in let alone possibly bring something with us.

To this day, I still remember everything pretty clear for the most part.  There are a few things I have forgotten but that is to be expected after almost 22 years.  Whenever I am back home I like to cruise up to Blairstown and drive by the house.  I still get the creepy vibe but then again that's the whole town.  After doing some research my mom found that the town was once known for devil worshiping.  Makes sense as to why my cross looked like it was dying and there was bat poo all by a red hot door that led no where.  I'd definitely like to go back in one day just to see how things are.  I'd also one day like to go to the library there and do some more research on the town and that house.

Oh, and to this day I am still afraid to pick up broken glass for fear of seeing that face again.",The house on Lake street.,175
Odyssey_The_Crip,40,37,1r4dm5,122,"Fuck me.
I was told to come here by a friend of mine, having never heard of nosleep. personally I'm not really on board with the idea of having a community of people read my story for personal pleasure, but hey, what ever. 
I guess a little bit of back story is needed here. I live on the nice end of Vancouver city, with my grandmother. I'm in secondary school, and that school is in my general posh-ish neighborhood.  

2 days ago I was Getting home from a long-ass boring day at school, I decided to Fuck around on DayZ until either I died, or fell asleep at the keyboard. At around 11:30 my Dog, Buddy, Decided to be the most annoying little shit possible. So i turned my computer off, and put the little fucker's leash on. At this time of night, the whole block was lights out. I Could barely see 15 feet.
10 minutes of walking later I began to feel a bit paranoid, street light's were flickering, fog was getting thicker. Buddy, on the other hand, was  trotting along rubbing his little schnauzer face in the frosted grass. 
Then, he stopped. Dead in his tracks, then buried his head in my calves. I urged him to keep moving, and after much encouragement he reluctantly followed.
I rounded a corner, going back toward my place, when i spotted a figure in the fog, a big one. Thinking nothing of the fact, just someone else enjoying the fucking weather or something. 
As we got closer buddy started barking, crazily. I urged him to shut up, lest he wake the neighbors. 
Then I got a good look at the figure. It was a man, 6'7 about, pale, He had a brown tweed waist coat, a brown tweed fedora and some brown baggy suit pants. 

As we neared him Buddy grew more and more frantic.
That's when I noticed his smile. The scariest fucking smile you will ever see. He looked like he won the lottery, got laid and inherited a mansion within a period of 2 minutes. It stretched from ear to ear, a yellowed, fake smile.
God, i wish i could have unseen it.
I was within about 3 feet of him, then the smell hit me, It was a mix between pure decay, shit, aged cheese. 

Then, he stopped right in front of me. and said in the most strange voice, like an elderly man trying to be smooth.

""You have a cute dog there, boy.""

""Uh, yeah, thanks.""
I guess something in my voice must have pleased him. or something, cause he chuckled a sick, smokers laugh. I began to move away from him breaking eye contact. Looking back on it, I should have just fucking ran.

He grabbed my arm

""Do you want to see my dog?""
I looked down, and i realized he had a leash too. He yanked on it, and trailing blood, Came the corpse of a maggot riddled dog.
I threw up in my mouth, This thing that was once a dog was missing patches of white fur, it's skin was turning green, bits of skin were missing, it's ear was ripped and an eye was gone. I couldn't even tell what the dog's fucking breed was.

Through his smiling teeth he said.

""Pet the dog""

My dog was oddly quite this whole time,i missed his barking.
I tried to get away, he tightened his grip on my arm then he dug his finger nails into me.

""Pet the dog""

""Please, No"" was all that came out of my mouth.
His smile drained instantly. Into an angry twisted frown, teeth still showing. 

""PET THE FUCKING DOG"" He screamed. yellow spittle flying from his mouth. my arm was turning red from the irritation his brown fingernails were causing me.
I had no choice but to pet the dog. I reached down slowly and ran my free hand along its back. The fur and skin began to peel back as maggots crawled along my palm. My hand was covered in a clear, slimy film. 
He let go of my arm, then shoved me. I landed flat on my ass on the pavement, Then i took off running. My dog was sprinting along with me. Then i heard him laugh, then scream.

""NOW I WANT TO PET YOUR DOG.""

My blood went cold.

I heard pounding on the pavement behind me, and a dragging. 
He was coming after me, pulling his dog along with him. Running 2 straight blocks, i ran down my alleyway, my house was at the end of the block. I flew down the alley, still hearing his laughter and slamming footsteps behind me. I got to my house, ran up the stairs and fumbled for my house keys. As His laughter grew in volume to an unbearable height, i got the door open shoved my dog in then slammed it, and locked it. not even a full second after I locked the door, there was a slam on it. 

He had ran into the door. 

This slamming continued for 20 minutes and then, silence. I waited 5 minutes then called the cops. in less than 10 minutes, they were here. I told them exactly that what happened, they told me they'd book the guy. Until then they told me not to leave the house.

not 5 minutes after they left, i was asleep on the couch with my dog.
I was awoken to the sound of a door bell ringing. I practically jumped off the couch, ran into the kitchen, grabbed a kitchen knife, and went to the door. thinking to myself, 

""I'm gonna kill this bastard.""

I Flung open the door knife in stabbing motion.
No one was there, Nobody.
Then I looked down, And threw up. 
The fucking dog corpse was sitting there, in a pool of blood.
Nailed into the dog's head was a note

""I don't like it when they run.""

Right now I'm sitting in my house, With no one but my grandmother, who is too sickly to get out of bed. My parents and my little brother are out of town at a dude ranch in the interior of the province. 
Fuck dammit.

EDIT: I'm sorry if there's any spelling mistakes, grammar errors, or punctuation issues. I'm shaking right now",Pet The Dog,159
horriddaydream,11,41,1r68c5,117,"My father always taught me to be kind to everyone.

There was this garbage dump close to my home; I can't say anybody got a thrill out of living closely to the wretched thing, for it stunk all to Hell and the trucks constantly entering and exiting could be an extreme annoyance. I walked on the outskirts of town frequently past midnight, which you may say is stupid, especially if you saw my build and how small of a person I am, and just how difficult it would be for me to protect myself from anyone. 

A few times as I passed by the always-opened gates of the dump, I also passed the man who would enter their limits every single night.

As shady as he was, he had a lot to say.

His name was Terrance and he had been staying in the dump at night ever since it had opened back in 1980. He had long, straggly hair and he claimed that ""this area was just too dry; the job shortage was unbelievable."" He would probably never have his own house. I felt the upmost of pity for him and sometimes I even welcomed him to walk with me. Everybody always seemed to know Terrance. He was like the friendly neighborhood hobo. They would nod to him, wave, give him a few dollars, thank me for being so kind to him even though I would shrug it off and whisper that he was simply good company. 

I asked him where he went during the day and he just said ""everywhere."" He had a huge, black satchel that he slung over his back that probably contained normal homeless materials like paper towels, maybe a few little scraps of food. It always smelled but he smelled in general, though I was too nice to say anything. He claimed that there was a hollowed-out truck near the far side of the garbage dump and he would stay there at night because it was warm, and it was shelter. 

It made me want to cry; just the situation that this poor man was in.

I lived with only my father and so on occasion I would invite Terrance home to have a warm meal, and my father was more than happy about this. He was a kind man as I was a kind young adult, and he completely understood that my heart was in the right place. Terrance knew everything about our family in only a short amount of time and he never once took advantage of us. He was just a man who had no direction after losing his way.

Terrance disappeared for a couple of days. I peered in through the gates of the garbage dump, thinking twice about entering. 

I walked to the back and noticed that there was nobody inside the shell of the truck that he had described to me a many of times. But as I peeked inside the windows, I saw many black satchels just like the one that Terrance was always carrying. Most of them were empty, but others were still shut tightly and looked full. 
I reported the scene.

The cops had found small children of all shapes, sizes, ages, and genders inside the bags. He had been living off of them for years. 

There was a lack of missing children in the area, though some were found to be local. Nobody knew where they had all come from.

He had been inside our house. He had been inside my head.

Now he was nowhere to be found.

Magnum6,32,58,1r5par,109,"Born in the mid 90s, i grew up active, and was outdoors alot. However, as the technological age began, I found myself inside more and more. As I grew, i spent more and more time watching T.V., playing videogames on my Super Nintendo. And when the Sony Playstation came out, my parents couldnt pry me from the screen. As a consequence, my eyesight suffered. Slowly at first, but as i got older, it became an issue. It was never so bad that I couldn't see without glasses, but it was bad enough that i needed them to drive when i turned 17. However, as senior in high school i quickly lost my glasses and proceeded to drive anyways. No wrecks, no tickets. I thought that maybe my eyesight had improved over the few months that i had actually worn my glasses. Oh how I wish I had been right. Halfway between being 19 and 20, i picked up a job as a delivery driver. Easy at first. Until i had to start driving at night. The night I almost ran off the road because I couldn't see through the oncoming cars headlights, was the night I knew I had to get a new pair of glasses. The next day I made an appointment, and 7 - 10 business days later i had my new glasses. Nothing special. Just a simple blue metal frame with slightly skinnier than average lenses. I Wore them all day. And whenever someone asked how it felt to have new glasses, i smiled and would comically sing ""It's a whole new world"", you know, that cute little song from The Little Mermaid. Oh how right i was. As I prepared for bed that night, getting changed, taking a shower. It all seemed normal. Until I wore my glasses into my darkened bedroom. No light was on in my room. And i had foolishly turned off the hallway light before entering my bedroom. Now in total darkness, I realized just what real fear was. You see, with my slightly blurred vision of not wearing glasses, any shadow could be brushed off, simply because i couldn't focus and see what was just beyond the outer veil of darkness that covered them. But now, with those infernal glasses. I could see them clear as day. The creatures from monster stories. My own personal Boogiemen. All sitting around my room watching, waiting, inviting me to lay down and fall asleep right in their midst. Right in my own bed. I stood stunned. Terrified. Not Knowing what to do. When suddenly, one of them spoke. The most terrifying voice I had ever heard. ""Why not run away again child? It amuses us to watch you at night, oblivious to our very existence. Unaware that you lay right where we want you. Each and every night."" I stared blankly, and felt confused. Again? How could i have seen these creatures before and not remember it. Surely I would have some memory. But none came. As if to answer my question, it spoke again. ""Perhaps these will jog your memory."" It brought up its gnarled hand and un-clenched its fist, palm up, to reveal my original pair of glasses. A pair now almost three years old. That's when it hit me. I hadn't lost my glasses. But thrown them away. Into a river. Nearly twenty miles from where i lived. Now more afraid than anything, I did the only thing I could, I laid down in my bed. Removed my glasses, and watched as those terrible Boogiemen, again returned into those empty, featureless shadows, that surround each and every one of us every night as we lay down to sleep.",Glasses,167
mrmappy,9,35,1r4x0l,91,"I always listen to music as I sleep. Before I go to bed, I turn on my laptop by my bedside table, run any pending downloads I still have, open Banshee (my music player), press play and leave it as I drift off to sleep. At times I would wake up, groggy and sensitive to the sound so I would stop the music and go back to sleep. Two nights ago however, what I woke up to was not music. Instead it was the voice of my mother. Telling me something with the sweetest motherly voice I have long been familiar with.  

Mom already passed away. For almost four years now.  

Was I afraid if hearing her voice? Of course not! Everyone at home longed to hear her again. Everyone at home longed so much to see her again. I missed that sweet voice, and boy was I happy to be able to hear that again. Of course, I understand that it was just a dream. A dream in the most familiar of environments, with the voice of your late mother talking to you. I'm happy for just that.  

What she told me in that dream though, did make me scared. Her words, though in the most caring and motherly of voices, were:

I used to be on NoSleep every day.

___________________________________________________________________________________

Sunday night, maybe 2am.

I had just shut down my computer after my nightly gaming session.  I was laying in bed, browsing reddit on my phone, and debating whether or not I was hungry enough to eat another can of spaghettio's, or if it would even be worth the trouble of walking downstairs and waiting for it to heat up. I'm not sure what made me notice it, what actually snapped my senses to the realization...but it was suddenly too **quiet**.

Granted it was 2am, so its not like I was expecting any sort of noise in particular.  My roommate had fallen asleep hours ago, but it was just so *still*.  I'm not sure if any of you know what I'm talking about, but it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  I felt like I was in a vacuum; it was utterly oppressive. 

I'm not sure how long I sat there, waiting for something, before the glow.  A deep blood red light had flooded the hall and oozed under my door, and it was slowly pulsing.  I wanted to call out, to tell my roommate to fuck off, but I knew it wasn't him. I just knew. I don't think I could've formed words if I tried.  The vacuum sensation I had felt was gone, and now, sitting in my tiny bedroom I felt like I was under a microscope. That terrible “like you're being watched” sensation I read about so much hit me like a brick.  I can't explain how exactly I felt, a mix of horror, dread, and confusion.  I wanted to bolt, but I wouldn't have been able to force myself to open that door if I tried.

I managed to shuffle off my bed, and to the floor.  I opened up my nightstand, reaching for my revolver. I needed to feel that cold steel, and the heft of it in my hand. As soon as I picked it up, I was at a loss because for the first time, it just felt like a toy in my hand. I looked back to the door to that glow, and felt completely powerless.  There was a shadow now, someone was standing outside my bedroom door, and I felt like I might as well have been holding a nerf gun.  

When the long scratch started, I felt nauseous.  Like I was 17 again, smoking weed in my room when I thought I had the house to myself and my mom knocked on the door asking why the fuck it smelled like burning leaves in the hall. That sudden weight in my stomach, the sudden dryness in my mouth.

It was like a nail being dragged down the door, from the top of the doorway to the bottom.  I followed the sound with my eyes, and when it stopped, I heard a voice.  “Hear” might not be the right word, because it came from inside my head.

*Michael. Please put down the weapon.  We do not want to harm you, and I do not plan on doing so. Your weapon would be useless anyways, but I respect your autonomy. May I enter?*

This had to be a dream; a nightmare. If every waking moment since I...heard that voice hasn't been an eternity in a waking hell, I might be able to convince myself that it was.

*I wish to speak with you, Michael. We have much to discuss. May I enter?*

There was no fucking way this was happening.  I'm...lucky I didn't need to, because I couldn't have spoken if I tried.  Whatever it was must have known there was no way I would have let it in, because it answered me anyways.

*No matter, you will see us in due time.  We would like to invite you on a journey, Michael.  You will come with us, and see everything you have always wished to. We've known you for a long time, you would say “years”.  You have a week to decide, we will not force you. You will require no luggage, no currency. You will want for nothing.  You will not see your family or friends again, but in time you will cease to worry about them.*  

 *We respect your decisions. I do think however, you only have one real choice.  I will see you soon.*

__________________________________________________________________________________

Then it was all just over...I might have sat there for hours. At some point, I got up and sat on my bed.  When I finally mustered the courage to look out the window, it was already dawn. When I heard my roommate get up and go to work, and finally figured it was safe to open my door.

I am a shell.  I don't know what to do you guys.  I haven't slept. I forced myself to eat something yesterday, but everything tastes of cardboard.  I booted up my computer, but now my *life* just feels like a game I'm sick of. 

I forced myself to talk to my parents the other day, and smile at work, but any interaction I have feels forced and artificial...like I'm just going through the motions. There was no way I could mention what happened Sunday night to anyone. 

He was right...I have only have one choice.  If I don't go with him...with *them*, I'll be trapped in this empty hell. My life feels like a hamster in a cage.

Who the fuck knows what will happen if I **do** go with them...?  

I cannot sleep. ",Invitation.,124

Alright then. This will be a long post. Ive been putting off writing this all down, but Ive got a growler of Pech Mortel and half an hour till new shows download, so here goes.

Post #1
So a week or so ago I was sitting, minding my own business enjoying a delicious club sandwich, lasagna soup and Extra spicy Caesar for lunch at a local pub, when I received about 7 calls from a local, but unfamiliar, number. 

Now, Im not really one to talk on the phone, if you know me well. Text message, facebook, whatever is fine. I also really dont like having to take the time out of my day to listen to voicemail like some kind of archaic peasant. My voice mail message is something along the lines of ""Hey, I dont listen to my voice mail, ever. So text me or email me at *****@gmail.com""

So I return to work and notice that I do, in fact, have a voice mail. Now again, I normally wont bother even listening to them, but, with that many calls, it could be an emergency call from a payphone or so. I give it a listen, after then painfully arduous process of dialing the number, password, and the like.

""Errrrrrm, *scramble scramble* you call this number about 5 times yesterday *scramble scramble* I dont know who you are *scramble scramble* the authorities are on to me *scramble scramble*""


Ok.

Like an idiot I deleted the original message. I instantly regretted it.
Well, first thing first is to google the phone number. The only hit I receive on the internet is a personal ad from the Los Angeles Times newspaper.

http://i.imgur.com/hT3hbNV.jpg

Hmm, thats bizarre. If you look up those Revelations quotes they are all in the ""the streets will flow with the blood of the non-believer"" vein.

Well, I text the number back ""Hi there, who is this?""

No response for a few days, figure thats the end of it. But definitely curious as to the back story of that ad....

*****************************

Fast forward a few days, my phone rings again, I answer. It is a relatively pleasant, rational, elderly sounding gentleman

""Hello?""

""Hi there, Ive recieved like 17 calls from your number in the last few days, my name is Greg. Just wondering if youve been trying to get ahold of me?""

""Sorry buddy, no idea. Ive definitely never called you. You do have a pretty crazy personal ad in the Los Angeles times with your phone number attached to it though....""

""Ahh yes, the ad! I put that there. If you know about the ad, then you know who I am!""

""Umm, no I really dont actually, who are you?""

""Well then, Im in fact Jesus Christ!""

""Well(wtf!?!), Amen to that!""

""Good, im glad you are on board! We shall keep in touch!""

""Ummmmm, ok. Cheers man""

Oooook. Well thats interesting......

An hour later I receive the first Email.

lynzo,10,42,1r79t5,82,"Through years of failed attempts to have my own kids, I yearned for children of my own, well, used to. 

I would travel for hours just to baby-sit my nephews while Helen (my sister) goes for their fortnightly romantic dinners to ""keep the flames of passion going"", in her words.

Playgrounds and parks were my favourite hunts. Toddlers old enough to walk would sometimes totter their way to the bench I'm sitting on just to smile at me. Young children would come up to me and play 'pretend' with me. It's quite a strange phenomenon, but without my trying to, children takes a liking to me. Of course, I'd gotten strange looks from parents, as though I dangled a carrot in front of their children's noses to lure them to me. There were carrots, but just not fr.

I met my BF (now husband) some years ago. In the beginning stages of courtship, he would just look at me and smile, and I just thought he was just smitten with me. It was only some months into our relationship that I found out he could see spirits. His childhood was shaky when he first realised no one else saw the paler beings. He had since gotten used to them as they would either wander aimlessly or just stay rooted to a spot. Apart from seemingly looking at him, they don't try to communicate with him.

One day, a few months after finding out about his ability, he told me he has something to tell me. For one, he isn't the secretive or romantic type so I guessed it wasn't to propose. He held my hands and looked at me straight in the eye, and said, ""Umm... How should I put this..."" After a few false starts, impatient me started losing my cool and he finally got it out, in the crudest way he could put it (I know I deserved it), 


""You have three little ones following you since the day I met you and that's the reason why I looked your way and smiled at you. I've been wondering, but why are they following you?""


He went on, with a matter-of-factly tone, to explain that the children at the playground were not approaching me, but the little ones following me, and that the little ones aren't like the usual spirits he have seen but are much smaller (thus the name ""little ones""). Despite it being a hot day, the chills and the cold in my chest made the weather more bearable.

Before this, I had a failed relationship with a man who loves children as much as I did, but just upped and left, the day after I was discharged from the hospital for my third miscarriage.

I don't exactly know where to turn, like the majority of the sub I'm assuming you share the same interest as me in the supernatural, the other side. I've always been intensely fascinated with it, usually the furthest I went was browsing /r/nosleep or heading into abandoned houses to sate my thirst for the creepy, although, the same routine things quickly became dull and eventually, I slowly got desensitized, bored. This was about the time I started reading 'recipes' for paranormal experiences.


The whole thing seemed awesome, the Midnight Man, One Man Hide and Seek, The Shoebox Telephone. All gave me chills, but I remained quietly skeptical the whole time. Fuck. Why did I have to be so blind. I still can't find the place to blame myself, I mean reading scary stories on the internet posted by a bunch of anonymous people, it would be stupid to take it all for fact, right?


Of all the rituals, one caught my eye, The Three Kings. I'm hesitant to post the link but I feel like it would be naive to think that no one would give it a quick search. http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wbo0u/please_dont_actually_try_this/ A blunt explanation of it would be a recipe where you can contact the dead, and ask them questions through two propped up mirrors.


After reading it I felt like I had to do it. I quickly spread it to a few friends and it wasn't long until hype was built upon the whole thing. Me and my best mate (For his sake i'll call him, Darcy), organized to do this when we had a few friends over for a small gathering whilst my parents were out for the week. Funny enough, at the time the thing I was worried the most about was it not working. We had tried a ouija board once at my request, and nothing happened, we all just sat there fingers on the cup for 10 minutes blaming each other for pushing it whenever it moved in the slightest. They all probably thought I was an idiot. So I thought I would give it a kick, my bright idea would be that we would all get absolutely hammered beforehand so that when it (surely) didn't work we would imagine that it did or at least get really scared in the process. Well at least we had the 'really scared' part down pat.


So everyone came at around 9:00pm yesterday, and it was all pretty normal, caught up, bitched about a few people, had some laughs and it wasn't until around 11:00pm that we started to set up. The atmosphere then was so... amusing of all things. We all giggled the whole time in our stupor, acting as if we were kids in primary school kids about to pull a really lame prank. It all seemed fun then. Of course I had to be the one who volunteered to be the one who sat the throne, eager to show my courage off to my friends. My lifeline was Darcy, if anyone was to hold the key between my life and death i'd gladly hand it to him.

For the sake of the story I'll skip all the tedious setting up and get to 3:33am. We were all fighting sleep by then and I think Sarah and Alistair were already gone, though we were sitting outside that door for so long it was hard for us to miss the time. When I had walked in I was immediately hit by the cool air, though this one wasn't the ghostly cold, it was literally fucking freezing from the fan that had been buzzing on for a few hours. Though something did feel off, it was either the fact that I was in a pitch black room holding a candle to my chest with a chair and two mirrors propped up adjacent to it, or it was that all of a sudden everything was quite. As if the world around me was devoid of life bar the constant drone of the fan. 


I sat down clutching the candle tightly, persistent to not let it go out, suddenly very aware to what i was doing. I remember shifting in my chair uncomfortably for a while but what follows that still remains hazy. I remember trying to call out for answers, ""Who's there"" ""What are you doing?"" ""Is there another side?"". None were answered, just silence, and the buzzing of the fan. I then said something stupid and heard giggling, assuming it was my friends outside I started cracking jokes. The more jokes I made the harder they laughed until I said ""Why arn't you responding, too scared to show your faces?"" and looked into the mirrors. Now, the huge cardinal rules of this recipe is not to look in the mirrors and around about this whole thing turned to fucking shit. The worst thing about looking into the mirrors isn't what I saw but rather the absence of it. I saw nothing, i saw the chair, the fan, but no me. I quickly looked to the other, and greeted by the same emptiness. Then the rumbling began, have you ever been in a house when a plane has flown overhead and the ground slightly shakes? It was like that except the sound emanated from the floor rather than the sky. It continued to get louder and louder until my eardrums felt as if they were going to burst and then I peed myself. The mirrors shattered and sent shards of glass everywhere and my candle was quickly snuffed out, and I screamed, boy did I scream, I legged it out of there like nobodies business and slammed the door behind me. Of course everyone was fast asleep but woken up with a few of my screams and sharp kicks to the ribs. They attempted to calm me down but i was flailing and screaming, I told them we had to get out of my house, but where do seven 17 year olds go at 4:00 am in the morning? Eventually I calmed down and tried to pass it off as a drunk hallucination which i knew was very impossible but it made my mind sort of at ease. 

We decided to get everyone up and camp downstairs in the living room. I felt safer with all of them around me and after much apprehension my tired state got the better of me and I drifted off to sleep. Last night was some of the worst nightmares i ever had, I saw my friends hanging and mutilated, I saw my childhood cat lay gutted on the floor, I saw myself smiling at a mirror. When i woke up, i was upstairs in the room. In between both mirrors, which had been shifted to face me lying on the floor. All my friends had left, when i called them they all gave me half ass reasons and some just avoided the question altogether. 


I'm scared. It is now 6:27 and starting to get dark again and I haven't been into the room since I woke up this morning. Help me, please. I don't feel alone in my house anymore.","Please, help. I screwed up.",101
ephique,27,22,1r5tqd,82,"Me and my brother were spending some quality time playing old video games from our childhood, just chilling on the couch in my upstairs bedroom when the electricity in the entire house went out. It was just us two home at this point, and it was pitch black outside. In desperation of finding our way through the house we used our phones to take flash-shots, giving us a small update of where in the big upstairs level of the house we were; trying to make our way to the staircase leading down.

We finally did, and from there it wasn't ridiculously hard to manage ourselves to find some candles and what not. We did what we could to drain out the time while waiting out the electricity-problem. Eating sausage rolls, gossiping and having conversations about what games to play once the electricity was back.

It did come back after a couple of hours. We already found ourselves in the kitchen, positioned in the lower level of the house so we brought some snacks and drinks before we inevitably decided to continue our journeys into Donkey Kong: Country, Super Mario World and Castlevania 4 on the Super Nintendo.

Upon starting our Super Nintendo my brother asked me where the remote for the tv was, since we both were too lazy to actually use the power button on the tv. Although the remote was nowhere to be found. While looking for the remote, which we both swore has never been anywhere else than on the coffee-table next to the couch, the electricity ran out again.

My brother expressed as he sighed: ""Oh come on, are you kidding me?"" Being slightly more prepared the second time, we picked up our phones and started taking flash-shots again. After a couple of shots the memory on my phone ran out. I never thought we had taken that many pictures. Either way I entered my image library on my phone to delete the old photos from the first time the electricity went out. I took a good look at the first picture I opened, it was my brother walking ahead of me, just before we reached the stairs. There was a man standing just next to him in the picture.",Where is the remote?,104
BensonHedges1,4,19,1r2xlz,79,"I heard the coffee pot drip before my alarm even went off, bizarre, I don’t usually set a timer. I like to go to the gym before I have my coffee. Maybe it was my boyfriend being nice. He typically works the graveyard shift, and sometimes he comes home in the early morning to leave nice surprises. 


“Might as well get up” I said aloud to myself, since no one else was home. 


My cat was absent from the bed, which is also weird, he’s usually by my head in the mornings. As I stretch my legs and arms out, I notice an odd chill run up my spine. Surely it was the weather, New England has a way with inconsistent temperatures, and the blanket over me was not quite fit for winter. It’s November, that sixty-degree weather is bound to disappear sooner or later. I haven’t quite figured out the thermostat, we just moved in, and the heat only seems to kick in on times when I’m not home. Must be the reason we bought this place so cheap...and why people keep selling it. New England is not the place to have a busted heating system. This has been the biggest point of arguments since my boyfriend and I started co-habitating. 


“Get out of bed, you’re going to be late to your class…” 


I said this to myself a few times, in hopes to have motivation to get to the 5:15am class at the gym. I had no idea what time it was, but if the coffee pot is going off, it’ was creeping close to sunrise. I haven’t unpacked the alarm clocks yet, so my phone’s been the only thing reminding me what time of the day it is. 


I thrusted my arms to the floor and pulled my phone to my bed — 2:11 am. 


“What the fuck?! I’ve still got two-and-a-half hours of sleep…and why is the coffee pot on?”


I slipped out of the bed from the left side and stumble to the kitchen to turn off the coffee pot. I’m a coffee lover, but nothing smells worse than burnt-coffee. As I went to flip the switch to off, I realize the time isn’t illuminated on the pot. Directly above on the microwave - nothing. Damnit. The power went out! The drip-sound of the coffee pot was so loud, and it was too early. I was confused. I could even smell the lingering scent of fresh brewed coffee…but it was 2am, my mind must be playing tricks on me. 


I headed back to the bedroom, a little freaked out, but convinced it was just all a coincidence. This hallway seems so much longer in the dark, and I still haven’t gotten used to the layout of this condo. As I pass the bathroom, I notice a shadow out of the corner of my eye. I turned my head and didn’t see anything, except the shower curtain pulled all the way open. Since we’ve moved in, we haven’t used that shower…we’ve got a shower stall in the bedroom…much more convenient. Though, I am sure there was a logical explanation for it. 


When I get to the bedroom - another chill down my spine. This was uncomfortable, it was a winter chill I was feeling. I was sure of that. Something was wrong, but i couldn’t figure it out. 

I need to go back to bed.


I hop in the bed and pick the blankets from off the floor. As I turn on my side, I hear the heater click on. The electricity is back on…fantastic! I start counting sheep in my head to fall back asleep, and keep thinking…”how did the blankets end up on the floor?”


What feels like an hour later, my alarm finally goes off. The smell of burnt coffee has filled the condo, and now I’m frustrated. I should have just unplugged the damn thing. And where is my cat? I have most definitely woken up on the wrong side of the bed. I moved to the kitchen to pour some coffee - and it’s dry. Nothing. I must be imagining things. 


That chill again! I could feel the hairs spike up on my neck - absolutely razor sharp. I decided to skip the gym and start my morning. I remained timid, but continued with my normal routine. As I rummaged around the kitchen, I noticed my cat out of the corner of my eye. He was twitchy, and obviously anxious. 


A few years ago my cat had major anxiety problems, and he developed what my vet called - “Rolling Skin Syndrome”. When my cat got anxious, his skin would roll around his body, it looked almost as if he had a small gum ball moving around beneath his fur. Today that ball was most definitely moving.


He paced back and forth around the house with me now, seeming more comfortable now that I was up with him. Every time I moved to another room, he cautiously peeked around the corner, almost as if he was looking for something. We moved to the bathroom, I started to floss, and then I heard it…drip drip drip. I am sure it’s not the coffee pot, and the house starts to smell again. As I analyze my senses the smell become more pungent. Less of a coffee smell and more of a rancid scent. 


Drip drip drip…


I follow the noise, it seems louder now, and it seems like it’s coming from the bedroom. Surely I would have heard it loud and clear when I was in bed earlier…it seemed so distant then. I enter the bedroom, and my cat stopped dead in his tracks. His skin is rolling again and he appeared more on edge, tail straight in the air and it’s hairs following suit. And that chill, of course, it was back. And my sheets and blankets, on the floor again.


WHAT THE FUCK? 


I’m working from home today, and every time I walk by the bedroom, I get the chills. I’ve resorted to closing the door until I’m not alone. It sounds like the wind is blowing up against the windows in that room, but from where I’m sitting, the trees are as still as ever.

CDC_,14,28,1qwsx4,79," I always hated going outside after dark. Night casts a natural shroud around my home; what is familiar during the day, becomes a mystery to me at night. It's a mystery I have no intention of solving. Those were my thoughts as a child. At 28 years old I'm suppose to be over my fear of the dark, but the darkness fills me with dread. 

As far back as I can recall, going outside, alone, after dark has scared me. As a child I had a ritual. If for any reason I had to walk outside after dark, I was not allowed to turn around and look behind me.  There was no rhyme or reason for it, I just had this very real sense, this feeling, that if I turned around, someone would be standing there, waiting for me to see them. The feeling was almost a taunt, as though some force was daring me to turn around, but I couldn't seem to bring myself to do it. At around 10 years of age, I had been dealing with this problem for quite some time. Be that as it may, my absent minded ways got the better of me, and all to often I would leave my bookbag in the car after school. After dinner it was homework time, and I, inevitably, would have to go outside to fetch my books. My mom drove a Cutlass, but we also lived with my grandparents, and my grandfather had a rather large GMC van. It was fun to take camping, which we did, often. The van was parked parallel to my mom's car in the driveway. On the nights that I would leave my bookbag in the car it was same system, every time. Walk straight to the car, open door, grab bookbag, spin around, look directly at front door, walk straight inside, never look back on the way inside. Never.  

One night, everything changed. I'll never forget that night. My grandmother had made fried chicken for dinner, and it was an especially cold night, so I put on my blue coat to go out to the car. I loved that jacket, though I was beginning to grow out of it. My arms stuck too far out of the sleeves and it was beginning to look ridiculous on me.  Such is life, I suppose. People outgrow things, and they replace them. Although I could feel the brick in my stomach in regards to having to go outside after dark, it was a brick that had been laid long ago, and was generally regarded as a familiar fixture. That night I walked out the front door, walked to the car opened the car door, leaned in, grabbed my bookbag, spun around saw the front door in the distance, maybe 50 feet, and I began walking, slower than usual. 

""I'm too old to be doing this anymore,"" I told myslef out loud. 

I stopped walking. I stared at my front door for a while longer.

""Fuck it,"" I told myself, for perhaps the first time ever.  

I slowly turned my head and my body followed. Turning I saw my mom's car about 20 feet away from me. I spun all the way around and looked directly at my mom's car. Same as it always was. No different. Nothing. I raised my head ever so slightly and caught view of my Grandfather's van beside my mothers car. I didn't notice it at first. I stared for probably 6 whole seconds before we locked eyes. Peering at me from behind the van were two eyes, two unfamiliar eyes. The eyes were connected to a face that seemed to be grinning at me, ear to ear. For a moment I stood frozen, eyes locked on the man behind the van. His smile seemed to get wider the longer I stared. All I could see of the man was his face, partially obscured by the blanket of night, and his right hand, planted firmly on the back door of the van. I couldn't tell you how long the staring match lasted. It felt like an hour, though, it was probably more like 30 seconds. There was a taunt in his expression, a dare. Was he daring me to come closer? To Turn back around and walk toward the door? I felt there was nothing I could do but continue this stand off until his head slowly pulled back behind the van, and he was gone. I walked back into the house backward, never taking my eyes off that spot on the van. Somehow I managed to make it back inside without falling. Good memory I suppose. 

Today I'm 28. I still have to go out to the car after dark somtimes, but I never dare to look back. I know he's there, watching, waiting. He wants me to know he's there; he wants me to see him. He'll never leave me. The winter is coming, and I'll need to start wearing a jacket soon. I bought a nice heavy one about 5 years ago. Kind of old, I know, but it does the trick, and this one fits me just fine. ",He's still there.,107
Sleepwalking_t,21,30,1r7w1t,71,"I have been having sleeping problems for about 6 months now. I have troubles falling asleep and staying asleep. I also have issues with sleep walking, serious sleep walking issues. I live in a dorm, on the first floor, and right outside my dorm across the street is the smoke pit for my area. I once woke up sitting at the smoke pit in my pajamas sitting on the picnic table with my elbows on my knees, face in hands.

 
Please, hear me out, I know this doesn't seem supernatural, but I'm terrified and I don't know who to tell. I am going to continue with my sleep walking issues. 
I will not get into specifics on where I was but let's just say I was not in an area you would want to walk around alone at night. It was a community sleeping area, massive tent and I woke up sore, bruised, and covered in dirt. I figured I must have slept walked outside and fallen down. I have woken up standing in the middle of my dorm room, woken up sitting up right on my couch when I had fallen asleep in my bed. 


A few months ago I could not sleep for 2 days straight; no sleeping aids or cold medicine would work. Frustrated, I finally made a doctors appointment for my sleeping problems. I left out my sleep walking because I could loose my job if they knew I slept walked, and was prescribed Ambein. 
The first night on Ambein I still had troubles getting to sleep but they finally kicked in after an hour or so laying in bed. I woke up refreshed but a bit groggy, and got dressed for work. 


The next night on Ambein the pills kicked in quickly and I had , what I thought , to be a deep dreamless sleep. When I got into work my co worker laughingly asked me what the hell I called him for last night. 


"" What are you talking about?"" 


"" You called me last night, crying hysterically."" 


""What?!""


"" Yeah... I was about to get dressed and come over to check on you. You said , ' It's here Myke, it's here!'. Then you started snoring sooo... yeah figured you were just dreaming...""


Completely bewildered I apologized. I checked my call history and sure as shit, I had called him at 0447. 


Strange. I just played it off as a side effect of the Ambein. 
A few weeks went by and nothing else strange happened. I continued to take the Ambein. 


Sometime during the work day I went to show another co worker a funny picture I had saved on my phone when I noticed I had a lot of black photos on my camera roll. I selected the first one and it was my  dark room lit up from the flash. The next one of a different part of my room again lit up by the flash. This went on for 12 different photos: different parts of my room, dark, lit up from the flash. I downloaded an app so I could see the time stamp from the photos. I was definitely asleep; great, sleep me was taking pictures in my sleep.

 
I have started waking up with bruises, cuts, and feeling sore for no particular reason. 


I was staying the night at my guy's house and he told me the next morning  I sat up out of bed and asked him: 


""Do you see it?"" 


""See what?""

 
Silence from me, then I laid back down.

 
He jokingly told me that was the last night he would sleep with me. We laughed but I felt terrible creeping the hell out of the poor guy. 


It's escalating, Ive started seeing things when I'm awake. I see a black form walking into my bathroom while I'm getting ready in the morning. I ignore it, there is no way in hell I'm going to investigate that. Things disappear from my room then show up in the same spot days later.

Children making their way to the bus stop walk by with more and more layers, on their way to looking like brightly colored fluff balls. Leaves are falling more frequently as winter approaches. My thoughts of you become more frequent too. Don't get me wrong, I've thought of you nearly every day for...what has it been? Ten? Eleven years? 


It's hard to think it's been that long since you destroyed so many lives. It was around this time too. I remember because I was watching the brown leaves fall just before she told me what you did. Did you think they'd forget? Did you think they'd ever forgive you? I know I haven't. I haven't forgiven you. And I definitely never forgot you. Sometimes I repeat your name before I go to sleep. Like a mantra. A slow, soothing mantra that washes over me in waves. It keeps me sane.


My thoughts of you are becoming more frequent. Like they do every year.


Sometimes after I repeat your name, I dream of you. I dream of the day I can finally introduce myself. That's right! I forget ever so often. You don't even know who I am. It must be satisfying to know how many people you REALLY affected. So fucking satisfying. You wanna know what I dream about? I dream of making you scream. Like he screamed. Would I use fire?

Oh, I don't give a shit about you, but I have a life to live after I take care of...your rot. Your rotting, filthy, insidious heart. YOU FUCKING CUNT!


I've been thinking of you so much. Can't you tell?

But I really do need to focus on myself right now. Playing the good girl. Maintaining the 4.0. Staying out of trouble.

What a terrible, heart-breaking, unfair joke. You killed him. You fucking monster. YOU'RE A FUCKING MONSTER!

God, I hope you read this. I hope you show someone too. I hope a little tear leaks out when they tell you you're imagining the coincidences. That you're letting the guilt get to you and that you should just leave the whole messy ordeal behind you. I hope these words make you worry that someone else out there knows your dark secret. Someone besides your friends and family who you've convinced that it was just a mistake. Who you've convinced you really are a good person who made a simple error. 

I hope these words slowly begin to sink in and make you tremble at every little creak of your house. I hope you hear a branch scratch your window, and flinch away in fear. Cause I want you to know I'm coming. Oh, yes, I want you to know this is coming. So when I hold the blade against your ear, you know exactly how much you deserve this.

I love to leave my window open a crack when it's warm during the Summer, but here in Ireland it's now getting into the deep part of Winter so I always keep it closed. Thing about Winter is that sound carries better at night. Living in the suburbs, I can hear every drunken scuffle and argument in the wee hours.

A few months ago I started hearing these footsteps at night, like high-heeled shoes. It'd be at about 2 in the morning, I'd hear them start, out of the blue. They'd fade in from one end of my road and keep going as if they were just walking forever. I'd hear them go past my house but then get caught in a sort of limbo and never get any quieter. Then after about 10 minutes (my road is only 15 houses long), they'd fade out again.

They usually keep going. Not anymore. Now I hear them every night. I hear them fade in. I hear the steps walking until they get to right outside my house. Then they stop. My windows are on the back facing side of the attic so I can't look out to see what's going on without going downstairs and waking the house up. But I know she's out there.

JohnFrostNeruda,6,15,1quu9h,60,"Strange things used to happen in my childhood home. The house that I lived in was ancient, almost a hundred years old. It's only reasonable that a couple of people could have died in it right?  Over the course of ninety-six years, five people died in that house. I did research on all of them.

Because I saw all of them.

Every single night, the house would force the souls to replay their deaths.  I noticed this when I was fifteen (yes it took awhile).  I was up to get a midnight snack when I saw James Gunderson in the kitchen with his greasy haircut, his leather jacket and denim jeans.  He was vomiting uncontrollably and then he passed out, choking on his own filth.  His spirit was gone the next morning.  You would think I was scared out of my mind, but I was more perplexed.  I looked up James Gunderson and found that he died of alcohol poisoning after coming home from a party in 1954.  He was sixteen. I never touched alcohol after watching his death.

James Gunderson was there again the next night, and he had company.  Alice Williams was chasing a dog down the stairs when she slipped and fell. She was such a cute girl too with blond curls, and deep nut-brown eyes.  She would've been a heart breaker. Her head struck the edge of the fifth step.  I would then see her mom run screaming down the stairs to find her five your old daughter spasm uncontrollably as the family dog lapped up poor Alice's blood. That was a sad case. But you should never leave your toys on the stairs.

Jack Saline was an elderly man who slowly passed away in his room, which my mom turned into a guest bedroom.  I remember enjoying watching his death. It was somewhat serene. Mr. Saline would gaze out the window as a spectral beam of sunlight would hit his face. He smiled and then closed his eyes for eternity. His body would shake with a death rattle, and then he would fade out. Until the next night of course.

The fourth death was strange because I never could figure out who it was. A man was in the basement. I heard him thumping around one night and went to investigate. The man's face was sweaty and his face was stained with anxiety. He got up to pace around when he looked up at the top of the basement steps. Our eyes met, and I saw years of wear and tear on the man's face.  He nodded his head like he knew me, and then he walked out of site into a dark basement room leaving his cause of death unknown.

The next person to die in my house was my sister.  She was never right in the head, and we seldom spoke to each other.  She was the eldest of my parent's children, and yet it seemed like she was forgotten. She hung herself on the ceiling fan in her room.  I remember my mother and my two other sisters being devastated but my father and I were largely indifferent. He always had trouble finding feelings for others, and I was a regular chip off the old block.  The night after her funeral, I watched Ellie grab a rope from the tool shed and tie it to one of the fan blades. She hesitated a little bit when she put the noose over her neck and stepped on the chair. Our eyes met, and I saw a hint of fear in her eyes.  She took a deep breath and jumped. Her face got redder and redder and redder and she started tugging on the rope to set herself free, but she was only making it worse. She had second thoughts. She didn't want to die like she thought she did. This wrestled with me for a couple of days. My parents decided it would be best to move, and I agreed with them.

Before we left, I set the house on fire. I didn't even think about it that much. I just did it.  I watched it burn, and it was strangely comforting.  I don't know if it had any effect, but I like to think it did.",Souls Rewinded,75

“Stupid bitch. Die after work!”

Those are the words that hung over me like a prophecy. I’m not sure exactly why; normally, I’d dismiss such comments as someone’s emotions and sense of self-importance getting the best of them. But for some reason this time the words worked their way into the back of my mind like little tendrils. Strangling all reason and perverting my perception.

I’m getting ahead of myself; I should explain a few things before sharing my experience. I work at an answering service and about a year ago, I worked third shift. What this means is I answer phone calls for businesses from all over the country when they aren't in or are otherwise unable to answer their phones. I then take messages and either forward them to the office or dispatch them to people on call. Third shift meant I was manning the phones 11p-6a by myself. I was the sole person in the building from 11:15p to 5:30a, most nights. 

Now, the majority of the calls we receive are people complaining about something. They need a prescription called in, their water heater is leaking or they've locked themselves out of their apartment. Something along those lines. And people will often get upset when you’re unable to help them. This is usually expressed through yelling and cussing, etc.

I want to share with you a series of calls I received one night around 2a and my experience afterwards.

It began with an older woman calling on a public housing property management account. She had a southern accent. The kind where the letter “R” has two syllables instead of one. Like “are-uh”. Anyway, I answered the line by saying our answer phrase for the particular account.

This is how I remember the call going:

//

**Me:** “Thank you for calling [blank] Housing Authority. This is [Unrealsky].”

**Her:** “Thank goodness y’all answered. I need help. You have to…[something].”

*(She was rushed, out of breathe. The end of her last sentence was unintelligible, she was speaking so fast. This isn't uncommon. People tend to panic when their apartment is being flooded or something similar. My job is to keep them on task, gather their info and get someone out as soon as possible.)*

**Me:** “The office is closed, ma’am; you've reached their answering service. What is the reason for your call?”

**Her:** “I’m telling you, it’s not workin. Oh, lord, please help me, please. It took my boy. I.. I...”

*(She had started sobbing now. That last statement was kind of strange, but I moved on.)*

**Me:** “What is not working, ma’am?”

**Her:** “Oh, my god. Oh, my lord. I’m sorry. [Something]. I’m sorry. Oh, my god….”

*(Her voice trailed away as she moved away from the phone. I then heard a familiar beeping on the line. On this particular account, the company has one of those buzzer boxes on the front entrance of the building where you can ring a particular apartment to be let in or you can press a certain option to get the office or security desk or whatever. After hours, choosing that option causes you to get the answering service -- me -- and we have no way of letting anyone in or anything like that. We’re in a completely different state. And the line is timed, so when that time is up, the line will begin to beep notifying you that it’s about to be disconnected.)*

*(And the line disconnected.)*

//

The call kind of rattled me. People will act like anything is the end of the world, but she sounded like she was actually in fear for her life. Like she was in immediate danger. I sat there a minute just looking at my screen as I pondered the idea of calling the security guy. I mean, I knew she was at the front of the building, he could go check it out. But before I got a chance to, the same account popped up on one of my other lines. I answered it:

//

**Me:** “Thank you for calling [blank] Housing Authority. This is [Unrealsky].”

**Her:** “Let me in!”

*(She screamed this at the top of her lungs.)*

**Me:** “Ma’am, I’m at an off-site location. I don’t have the abili…”

*(She interrupted.)*

**Her:** “God damn it! Please, let me in. I can’t [something]. Oh, god, it’s…”

**Me:** “Ma’am. Ma’am.”

*(I tried to interrupt her.)*

**Her:** “Oh, god. Oh, please.” 

*(Her voice trailed away from the phone again, but came back. Her pleading had morphed into anger now.)*

**Her:** “You son of a bitch! You don’t let me in, I swear, boy, I...”

**Me:** “Ma’am, I want to help you. I can’t let you in, but I can contact securi...”

*(As I started, the beeping started as well. Right before the line disconnected she said those five words -- yelled them actually -- interrupting me.)*

**Her:** “Stupid bitch. Die after work!”

//

A chill went down my spine and my heart started racing. There was so much hate in her voice. It was terrifying. Briefly paralyzed by fear and confusion, I stared at the screen scrambling for what I should do. Her voice and those words felt so powerful. Finally my brain found it’s way back to reality and I quickly pulled up the number and called the security guy on his cell phone. As it rang, I tried to figure out a way to put what I just heard into words.

//

**Security:** “....Hello?”

*(He sounded groggy; I woke him up.)*

**Me:** “Hello, this is [Unrealsky] with your answering service. I've got kind of a strange call for you.”

**Security:** “... Yea? What is it?”

**Me:** “I just had two calls; they both came in from the buzzer box on the front of the building. It was a woman and she was kind of hysterical. Sounded like she was in danger, practically begging to be let into the building.”

**Security:** “Shit…”

*(I could hear him moving, probably getting out of bed.)*

**Me:** “Yea…”

*(I didn't know what else to say.)*

**Security:** “Probly some stupid crackhead.”

**Me:** “Um.. I don’t know. It sounded legitimate to me. I thought I’d at least notify you in case you wanted to go check it out.”

**Security:** “Alright, I’ll go check it out.”

//

I started to say thank you but he hung up on me before I could get the words out. He didn't sound very pleased to be woken up. I didn't care, though.

What she said echoed in my mind, “Stupid bitch. Die after work!” 

I had done everything I could. I did my part, but I still felt antsy. Uneasy. Afraid. I wasn't really worried for the woman’s safety. It was just that her threat -- no, her curse -- had freaked me the hell out. It sounded… unnatural. Powerful. Real. 

That was when I realized that I had been sitting up straight in my seat the entire time, had started to sweat pretty profusely and was bouncing my legs up and down like a maniac. I had to laugh at myself. Why was I letting something like this get to me? Being concerned for her safety made sense, but why was I so scared? Why was I taking her emotionally charged, but completely insubstantial, curse so seriously?

I stood up from my seat and threw my headset on the desk. I had to walk around. Walk it off. Forget about it. I made my way out into the break room and grabbed my coffee cup from the cupboard. As I was filling my cup with the fresh coffee I had just put on not long before, I was playing the calls over in my head. Trying to make sense of it all.

What did she mean by “it’s not working,” and, “it took my boy?” And why did she say, “after work?” I mean, I understand people get upset and will say anything when they’re mad, but why “after work?” Seems unnecessarily specific.

What’s going to happen to me “after work?”

Maniac_Mortician,8,12,1r4jq5,58,"I am surrounded by death. Mr. Jones on the prep table, currently expelling the blood that gives us life. Mrs. Loughlin is dressed on the side table, waiting for the casket to be delivered. The 4 year old Ryan awaits my oven in the walk in fridge. And the 23 year old, Jill Brewer, is lying in the casket, sitting silently still, waiting for her family to pass by, look upon her pale, lifeless shell, and weep. 

Jones finishes pushing the blood out of his system, and I set to work. I use the needle injector to put the wires into his upper and lower jaw. I pull tight, and twist, like sealing a loaf of bread. He looks at me, with his eyes partially opened and his mouth firm. I grab 2 eye caps, lubricate with Vaseline, and grab my tweezers. One tug of the top lid, one placement of the bottom, and then again to the other eye. He no longer looks at me. He now looks like hes sleeping, if sleeping involved 2 hoses connected to the arteries and veins of your neck. His naked corpse is covered in purple and blue bedsores. They come with the elderly, and especially the cancer patients. Most of these dead who pass from cancer are older, and the older they are, the less they have moved in the months that the infliction slowly ate the remaining life from them. 

A quick threading of the needle send me into cleanup. I baseball stitch his neck, scrub him down, and rinse again. Some skin is slipping on his left hand. Nothing the embalming fluid shouldnt take care of. If it continues, I resolved to just wax it before putting him in the last suit he'll ever wear. 

I look up, just in time to see my colleague wheel in the dark blue casket. The younger worker is  guiding it through the door. He looks pale. *Id probably use the pink dye for him rather than peach. Would make him more lifelike.* I plan the embalmings of the people I meet. Some call it morbid. I call it early planning. 

We grab Loughlin, get our arms around her frame, and place her in the casket. They wheel it to the parlor, and set up the chairs. I take off my gloves, remove my apron, roll down my sleeves, and grab my jacket. As i shut the door behind me, i hear the door buzzer go off. The Brewer family has arrived. The service goes normal, and I tag out with another director to go finish up Loughlin. I prop the door open, get on the gloves and apron, and grab my trocar. I stick the pointed metal pole into his stomach, and vacuum him out. With the plug in place, i rinse him again. I glance to the clock, and a figure invades my vision. 

A little boy in his suit and tie. I panic, and immediatly stop what I'm doing and throw a sheet over the body. I ask the boy his name. He just stares at me. I ask if hes lost? He smiles, and walks away. I follow him. He goes into the first room, and circles back through the office. I get back to the hallway, and hes back in the prep room. I tell him he cant be here. He looks at me, sadness in his face, and looks back to the walk in. He begins to sniffle. I walk next to him, and say ""Ryan, it's okay."" He looks back at me, and stops sniffling. Instead, he holds out his hand to me. I reach for it, and... Hes gone. I open the door, and hes sitting on the tray, in his little suit, waiting for my oven.

On 12/4/2009; James E. Parker (17 yrs), Richard ""Lou"" Marcus (19 yrs), Helen Greene (17 yrs), and Barbara Holmes (16 yrs) left school at exactly 4:57pm. These four teenagers were reported to have last been seen headed in the general direction of Harverfield.

On 12/6/2009, phone calls from all said teenagers were recieved and responded to. The calls all reported that their children had not been home in two days which was out of their normal behaviour. Police arrived at the four homes and acted in ordinance of ""Missing Person(s) Act,"" and began to search for the four teenagers. A search was conducted extending from their school to Harverfield itself. None of the missing were located during that search. Police issued an Amber Alert once more for the four children. However, there were no new leads brought forth.

On 2/2/2010, a man named Weasly Conner called into the station reporting to authorities that he had seen Barbara Holmes (16 yrs) wandering the street and that he was currently on his way to the nearest hospital to have her submitted for large gashes on both her left wrist and the lower left portion of her neck. Police notified her parents and arrived at the medical center roughly 8 minutes later. Officers found what was described as the stereotype used for how one would envision a mental asylum patient. The doctors were eventually able to sedate Barbara Holmes (16 yrs) with the aid of authorities. The cause of her meltdown in the hospita care is still unknown. When the medical staff managed to stitch her wounds, they reported to police that the cuts were far too deep and seemed to have been ripped into for it to have been an accident or stabbing. They stated that it was also not likely to have been self inflicted. Authorities remained on site.

During the night of March 14th, police were notified by a hospital that they had found Richard ""Lou"" Marcus (19 yrs) during a response call to a man lying on the sidewalk covered in blood. Richard Marcus's (19 yrs) family was notified of his discovery and were already at the hospital when police arrived to be notified that he had bled out before they got him to the emergency room shortly before they arrived. His body has been sent to autopsy.

Three weeks after the death of Richard ""Lou"" Marcus (19 yrs), a 911 call was made from Harverfield by someone claiming to be Helen Greene (17 yrs). The dispatcher reported that she could hear a male screaming in the background and something screaming in the distance; however; she was unable to identify what could have made the noise. Officers were sent to the site that the call had been traced to during the call which lasted for a minute and thirty-nine seconds. When the arrived on the scene, they found no landline. Officials are investigating into how a landline was traced to the location but so far no results have been yielded. There was a single report by an officer on the scene saying that he heard a woman scream in the general area that they had been searching after discovering no telephone.

On 6/13/2010, a letter was recieved at the police station written using cut outs on a dirty grey crumpled sheet of paper. The message read as follows:

*""There were four for fear, but they shriveled to one in here. Please send us more, for this we shall endure. The deaths of few lead to the strength of plenty, prey to us and you will witness the darkest entity.""*

The envelope was noticed to have a bulge, which when turned upside down, dropped a human finger onto the tiled floor. Forensics found it belonged to James E. Parker (17 yrs).

Terzis28,15,33,1r6la8,54,"So, a while ago (about a year ago now) I was sitting on my bed with the laptop on my lap. Next to me was my desk with my lamp on it. I was using an MSN video chat with one of my female friends. 

After talking for a couple of hours with my friend she messaged me (we both did not have microphones) and asked ""What is that kid eating? haha"" i simply replied ""What are you talking about?"" She stated that there was a kid sitting next to me with his hands at his mouth, as if to be chewing and gnawing either on his hands or something that he was holding. Chills ran through my body, but i soon realized that she was most likely messing with me.

I replied ""Seriously, stop messing with me"". She seemed like a pretty good actor considering she wasn't laughing or smiling at all. ""I'm not messing with you, I was just curious as to what he was eating"". At this moment I was getting a bit worried and decided to put her to the test. ""I want you to swear on your life that right now, you see a child next to me who looks like he is eating something"" I requested. ""I swear on my life, that is what I see"" she replied. I was pretty worried at this point and just when I thought I couldn't get much more creeped out, my lamp turned itself off.

I know it wasn't a power surge because my alarm clock was still on, and the standby light on my TV.

This could just be a strangely timed sequence of coincidence, but it sure did freak me out. I left the room immediately.",Child Eating,87

My friend /u/shelbels and I went over to check things out. The front door was unlocked and I found a journal lying on the floor right inside the door. My neighbor was lying on the floor in a pool of blood with a gun next to his hand. I took the journal and read it, I think he was truly disturbed and in need of help. I went to the police of course but I am posting the contents of the journal here because while frightening they are also very interesting.**

**October 12th**  
Last night I was woken at about 1 by a picture on my wall, when it fell. It seemed like it was darker than normal. Without turning on the light I got out of bed and picked up the picture and hung it back up, barely giving it a glance. This morning though, I gave it a second thought. It’s an old photo of my family at the beach, taken on a vacation when I was about 10. Despite being taken over ten years ago, I remember the vacation vividly. My twin brother was tormenting me as much as always, but the picture was one of the few where I actually looked as though as I was enjoying myself. It’s almost time for work now so I need to finish getting ready and stop reminiscing about the past. I don’t know if dreamed last night so nothing else to record.


**October 13th**  
A crash woke me up again, the clock next to my bed said 1:05 AM. The picture had fallen again, I hung it up before going back to sleep. After falling back asleep I dreamed about the family vacation. My brother kept dunking me under the water, I was afraid I would drown until my mom finally came to my rescue.The sad part is that it wasn’t just a dream, but more like a memory. I haven’t seen my twin brother in years, for good reason. I should probably call mom later today, I haven’t talked to her in weeks.


**October 14th**  
This is starting to get a little creepy, the picture fell again last night, at 1:05. There must be some kind of animal living in the wall. I will call animal control later today. Instead of hanging it back up this time I just set it on my dresser. I did not dream last night.


**October 20th**  
It wasn’t an animal. They came out and looked at the house, there are no openings for anything to get in, but I didn’t believe animal control so I ripped out a panel of drywall and found nothing. I have not been dreaming at all the last week.


**October 21st**  
It’s 1:05...again, the picture fell off my dresser. I cannot think of a reason why this would happen, maybe my dresser has a tilt to it. When I picked the picture up I stared at it for a few seconds, I could almost swear I am turned more toward the ocean than I remember being. Not to mention the fact that I look, I’m not really sure how to explain it...the smile I remember me having in the picture is more of a frown. I am going back to sleep now, but it just bothered me enough I felt like I had to write this down tonight.


It’s morning now, took another look at the picture, nothing has changed. I must have been half-awake last night when I thought I saw that stuff. Though honestly the stuff with the picture is starting to creep me out, I have it set on the floor now. There is no way that it can fall.


**October 22nd**  
I woke up to a sharp pain in my foot and found myself standing in the broken glass from the picture frame. There was a little blood but not much, if it continues bleeding I will go to the hospital. I haven’t slept walked since I was a kid. I’m going to have to buy a new frame for the photo. As I picked up the picture from remains of the frame I saw another change. I am almost positive I have taken a few steps away from where I used to be, I am behind my family. I know that is not what the picture looked like before. I decide to put off cleaning up the broken frame until the morning. I stare at the picture studying it. I doubt I will fall asleep tonight.


I fell asleep at some point last night and woke up with the picture underneath me. It was exactly as I remembered it, a little crinkled from me sleeping on it though. I must have been imagining things again last night. I would write it off as all a dream if it wasn’t for the cut on my foot and the shattered frame on  my floor, which I still have to clean up. My birthday is coming up in a couple weeks, we are supposed to be having a family dinner. I am going to ask my mom if she has another copy of this photo. It’s one of my favorites from my childhood and I want an unblemished copy.


**October 30th**  
I have continued to wake up at 1:05 every night. I stopped looking at the picture. I put it in a drawer. But tonight I dreamed about it. In my dream 10 year old me was moving backward slowly like some invisible force was dragging me toward the ocean. The first thing I do in the morning is look at the photo. It’s still the same. Always the same. The five of us, my mom and dad in the center with my dad’s arm around my moms shoulder. Smiling the happiest of smiles. My older sister next to my mom her head on her shoulder a half smile on her face and her hand on my brother’s shoulder. Then me and my twin next to my sister in one of the few moments where he wasn’t trying to strangle me, we almost look as if we want to be around each other. All this on a beautiful beach with blue waves crashing in the background. A picture perfect happy family. I know this picture by heart. It can’t change it’s impossible. I tried calling my mom, she didn’t answer. My sister also didn’t pick up her phone. I’ll try again tomorrow.


**November 1st**  
I decided to look at the picture when I woke up tonight. I pulled it out and was horrified. I’m in the water now, up to my neck, choking on a wave. I immediately shoved it back in the drawer. After a few minutes I reconsidered, opened the drawer again and carefully placed it in an envelope, further adding another layer between it and me. I tried to call my mom again but it’s late, I’m not surprised she didn’t answer. My birthday is in two days. We never came up with any solid plans but I always go home for dinner on the holidays so I will see everyone soon and maybe this will make more sense. I haven’t been sleeping well since all of this started.


I didn’t sleep last night. I spent most of it thinking. I don’t know when was the last time I talked to my family. Or saw them for that matter. I wonder if I did something to upset them. I mean that’s the only reason I can think of for them avoiding me. Maybe it was that fight I got in with my brother.


**November 2nd**  
I managed to sleep for about 3 hours last night and I had a very disturbing dream. I dreamt that my brother was laughing and eating me alive. I think I might be going crazy. I pulled the picture out at around midnight and it was normal. Looking at it though I don’t really look included in the family. I don’t think it represents the happy memory I want it to. 


**November 3rd**  
Today’s my birthday. I am about to drive to my parents house. I’m bringing the picture along to show them.  

…………………………………………………………………………………………………….  

I don’t know who I am. I don’t know what’s going on. Are all my memories false, am I crazy? I am trying to calm down enough to write this out…


I arrived at my parents house a little after 6pm. Dinner is always at 7. Their old black sedan was parked in the drive the same as always. At the last second I hesitated and decided to leave the picture in the glove box, I have gotten too obsessed with it and I don’t want to scare my family. And I can describe which one it is pretty easily anyway to see if my mom has another copy.


I went up to the door and rang the bell, I haven’t had a key in a few years. My mom opened the door and looked confused. She asked what I wanted. I told her I was there for dinner just like always, she only looked more puzzled. She said she had no idea who I was but she was very busy getting ready for her son’s birthday dinner. I thought she must be trying to play some kind of joke on me, I reached for the screen door to open it. She yelled out “Stop!”, sounding afraid. I jumped back. I realized she truly didn’t know me. I wondered if in the time since we last talked if she had had some kind of accident or started to develop early onset Alzheimer’s, I was very worried.


Having heard my mom’s yell my brother appeared at the door behind her and asked what was going on.


Trying to cope with what was happening I started talking to her as if she was a child. I told her I was her son, I was born November 3, 1992. She told me she only has one son. My twin brother was standing right behind her, getting scared I yelled at him, asking what was going on. He responded that he had no idea who I was, but November 3rd was his birthday and he did not have a twin. Upon hearing this my mother began crying. Through her tears she told my brother he did have a twin, but he was underdeveloped and died at 1:05 AM the night they were born.


At this point I was terrified and confused. As a last ditch effort to understand what was going on with my family and make them understand they were mistaken I told them to wait, I had something to show them. I frantically ran to the car and popped open the glove box. I pulled out the envelope with the picture and ran back to the doorstep. I told them it was a picture of our family at the beach around 11 years ago. I slowly pulled out the photo and turned it over. It was a picture of a happy family of four people. I wasn’t in the picture. My mother and brother both gasped seeing that it was indeed a picture of them. My mother then began to get angry and demanded I leave before she called the police because she thought I was trying play some sick prank on them. I got in my car, crying, and came home. I’m still sitting here in shock, not knowing what to do next. I pull out the picture looking at it. I’m not in it. How am I not in it? I cannot accept this as the truth.

iwillneverbefree,8,18,1r1p8k,48,"I'm just your average everyday guy with a job. I cook, I clean, I drink; hell, I even had a girlfriend before all this started going down. If you saw me on the street, you'd walk right by me without a second glance. It's just that I have a job. I'm a Paramedic.

I don't do anything important, I just help those in need. I started doing this because I didn't feel great about myself. I always loved helping others, and I always loved A&amp;P, so I saw this as a logical step. I loved every second of it when I first started. There was no greater high than when your adrenaline kicked in and your hands moved faster than your mind could think. It was ecstasy. This went on for 8 years. Every day I fell more and more in love with my job. My calling. The only thing that bothered me was that overwhelming sense of being in a battle. I thought it was normal; after-all, I was fighting for someone else's life I thought. If only I knew how true that statement was.

It started off with a shadow when I walked onto a scene. I thought it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. Maybe it was my constant concern of someone attacking me. God forbid I got shot while working. I should have known something wasn't right when my partner looked in the same direction when I did. I should have known better when he just shut down and barely spoke the rest of the night. This went on for a while, every so often seeing the shadow. Things started to get worse, however, when the whispering started.

At first, they were nonsensical. Sometimes I wondered if they were even there at all, if I was just going fucking nuts. But they were... They WERE there. It only took me losing my first patient to hear them clear as day. They were congratulating me. They were telling me how great of a job I did. I didn't understand then. My mind had been turning on me, it had to have been. ""It's the stress... It's the stress of losing someone"" I told myself on my way home. I sat at home and hit the bottle. Hoping that my next shift would be an easy one... one quiet shift.

It wasn't quiet. I should have known better than to use that word. It's bad luck. The voices didn't go away. They only got louder. Every patient I had I could hear them. ""It's their time"" ""She's ours now"" ""Let her rest"". I thought I was just compensating for losing someone. I thought I was just preparing myself if I lost another one. The more people I lost, the more they got more sinister. ""You're almost ready."" ""I haven't seen one this talented in eons"" ""You can't change fate""... ""Come join us"". I didn't understand right then, but I understood it all soon.

It was a 5 year old male. His heart stopped. I had to save this one, he was just a child, I HAD to save him. We got him to the back of the ambulance and I started my work. Things felt... odd. I felt as if I was in a daze. My vision was blurry, the lights seemed faint against the road. I tried not to think about the voices, I tried to block them out, I did a damn good job until it screamed my name.

""JOHN"". I heard. I stopped, and slowly raised my head to look at the bench seat across from me. It wasn't what you would expect death to be. It wasn't a man in a robe with a scythe. It was just a man in a suit with black eyes. I froze. I had to have been insane. I needed to tell my partner to drop my off in the psych ward when we got to the hospital. His smile was... calming. It was the kind of smile you'd expect a great car salesman to have... calming... but also sinister. His hair was well kept for a man his age, I'd have to say 50's or 60's. His eyes like a void of everything that makes us human, as if they were a black hole that sucked all feeling out of whatever had the poor misfortune of getting caught in their path.

""Haven't you been listening John?"" He said with a caring tone

""You know what you must do... You know who you'll become... Why are you fighting?""

I started screaming at him. ""Who are you?"" ""What do you want?"" ""Why have you been following me?""

He ignored all of my questions. He simply put his hand to the child and started rubbing his head.

""You fought for so long John. You know this is your fate. How much more pain can you endure?""

""What are you talking about?"" I yelled at him as the child's rhythm became worse and worse.

""Don't you understand John, we've been with you since day one! We are who you fight every day... We are the ones who you ignore to do your job... We are you.""

I began to understand.

""John, you must know something."" He said looking at the monitor as it flatlined. ""This will also be your fate. You will die just like everyone else. There's nothing you can do about it""

""Don't you think I fucking know that?"" I yelled grabbing the epinephrine out of my bag.

""JOHN"" He yelled again knocking the epinephrine out of my hand.

""You need to understand the forces that be. When you die, John, you will become one of us""

""The fuck I will"" I said, standing up, but was forced back down by some unknown force.

""It's not something you can change, John. You have so much potential... so much promise... We've been watching you from the day you were born... and we are very, very, excited to meet you""

I stopped fighting. I looked into his eyes and I felt something. Something I wish I never would have felt... I felt at peace. It was if all the stress of saving a life was gone. It was as if I didn't have to fight anymore. It felt like I was being held by my mother again, like all was right with the world.

I sat there and placed my hand on the child. I felt death pass through me. I felt the coldness of the nothing reach my heart and sit there. I understood now. I understood why I am who I am. It was as if everything made sense to me...


You don't have to believe me. Hell, if I was you I wouldn't either. All that I ask of you is that the next time you see an ambulance look closely for the man in the suit with black holes for eyes. Maybe I'll see you too.",I work with death,66
jinn979,8,39,1qzm6d,48,"Ok, so I'm not a writer so please excuse my mistakes and storytelling telling style. I'm not great at descriptions or anything like that so forgive me. 
This actually happened in 2001. I have a son who at the time was 6 years old when his father and I moved us into a small two bedroom house in an older part of the city. I was telling him about the spooky things that happened  in that house and this is when he told me something new about our time there.

First, I have to describe the place. When Lee and I went to look at it, it was so adoreable on the outside. It was painted white on a quiet street, with a huge backyard. It completed my ideal of a family home. We were living in a basement suite at the time and I was tired of living in suites, I wanted my own space and backyard. 

This little house was within my budget. It was a two bedroom, the second bedroom being in the basement. The first bedroom faced the street and to right of that small bedroom was a livingroom/kitchen area, and towards the back to the left a bathroom, and across from  that to the otherside of the kitchen a stairwell into the basement.

The very first night Lee left me and my son alone, I dont remember why. I just remember that I had this continuing nightmare throughout the night about something dark coming for us from the basement, and it took its time. I felt frozen in the front room and I struggled to get to the front door which was a few feet from where we slept. At about sunrise, I woke up finally. The horror of the dream lingered but the sunrise eased my fears. I made it away in my dream, but after I woke up I still felt haunted. That was the first night.

Lee and I got a dog. We adopted one from the spca and he was already full grown. He was named Sparky ( my son named him) Sparky was a lively, gentle and smart dog. He had something stuck in his paw, but he never snapped at anyone who bumped it. We only found it after we had taken him to the vet. It was open and bleeding, and we had to give him antibiotics for it and keep it cleaned. but he never snapped or showed any discomfort. The reason why Im going on about this is because when i tried to get him to come downstairs so he could sleep there instead of outside, he growled when i pulled his collar and he knashed his teeth at me.

So he had to sleep outside. Lee worked until 2am because he was a cook, and so it was me, my son and Sparky each night except for weekends when my step kids came over to stay with us. Anyways, this dog would always bark at 11:30 at the back door. I told that to Lee and the dog had to sleep outside after that because he was noisy.
Lee had three other children, Sally who was 7, Asher who was 10, and lily who was 7 months old. Thats a different story.*sigh* Our family was complicated.

The first thing I suspected something was wrong was the night I went to bed downstairs. Lee was already under the covers, and I was in my tshirt at the foot of the bed, I felt this draft come from the floor up my legs under my shirt. I got goosebumps all over me. It couldve been a draft I know.  A draft that went up and across me. It was a basement afterall.
The second thing that happened was in that basement bedroom again. I woke up with the moon shining brightly through the small window above our bed. I looked over at Lee and he had this grimace? on his face, and it changed his face ..his expression made him look like an older man. plus, ive never seen him make that face before. I got chills, and rolled over to face the wall, and cringe...but then i thought maybe he was having a nightmare, so i turned back to see if he was ok. his face was smooth and he looked like Lee again. I dont know how I fell asleep but I did.

Life continued, Lee and I were arguing in the basement...when al of a sudden he went white and his knees buckled...shit, that scared me. I grabbed him and put his arm around my shoulder and took him upstairs.
His daughter would scream and cry when he tried to bring her down there. I told him the second time she did that to stop bringing her down there. I knew the house wasnt right, I just had other more pressing things on my mind.

Ok, this is part is from my sons point of view. It was a weekend, i had the kids and it was a hot summer day. Sally was feeling left out from the boys, and so I told Asher to stay with my son while i went ot get ice cream with Sally. I wanted to have some girl time and make her feel special and wanted because with the new baby(lily) it was a rough transition to going from daddys girl to big sister.

Anyways, we get back and I knew something happened. Both my boys were in the backyard and not arguing, just serious and outside watering the lawn. I asked Asher what happened, I was thinking an accident of sorts. He tells me there was a man in the basement. A man with a green shirt. My son collaborates with him on this and they are both looked very disturbed by this. I asked him where he went, and a white faced Asher says he didnt know. he didnt come out. The chills up my spine man! I asked if the man talked to them, tryed to come close to them or anything to make sure they hadnt been touched or anything, and they said he didnt come close to them, he just walked around downstairs. thats when they ran outside and waited for me to get back.

This last part is when my son told me just recently. He said one night, he and Sarah were awake in the bedroom ( they all had to share that one room. Asher and Sarah on one side, Aer on the other bed)
In the white light fixture, it was one of the square white shallow dishes put over the light bulbs. Anyways, in the light fixture in the saw a woman in the kitchen moving around looking like she was cooking something, but the could clearly see the kitchen and no one was in there. and I guess Sally asked Aer if he saw it too. He said no because he didnt want to say yes out loud. he said he was too scared.

he said it was the middle of the night, we were downstairs.
We moved out shortly after. For different reasons, but that house without a doubt had something in it. I tried to ask the neighbor next door but she said nothing ever happened there. 
It looked so cute out on the outside.

-- Part 2 -- 

I started walking back into the call center from the break room when a thought occurred. We have a voice logger that records every call that takes place on our system, so I stopped at the supervisor station on the way back to my desk. Maybe if I tried to figure out the pieces of what she said that I couldn't understand, I could make some sense of it. I pulled up the logger and searched for all the calls on the account in the last hour. There were three. The two from her and the one where I called security. I clicked on the first one to start playing it:

**Me:** “Thank you for calling [blank] Housing Authority. This is [Unrealsky].”

But then where I should have heard her voice there was just this static. It kind of waved in and out, getting higher pitch at times, but there was no woman. Just static.

**Me:** “The office is closed, ma’am; you've reached their answering service. What is the reason for your call?”

And then the same static again. There was nothing besides my voice talking to and responding to this static. I sounded crazy. I set down the headphones I was using to listen to the call.  “What the hell is this?,” and various other similar thoughts trampled through. I tried to mitigate the wave of confusion and fear with some sort of reason. Maybe there’s just a problem with the call or the voice logger and it only recorded my side of the conversation. Maybe it was because she was calling from that buzzer box. Maybe it was just that call.

I picked up the headphones again and clicked on the second call.

**Me:** “Thank you for calling [blank] Housing Authority. This is [Unrealsky].”

Suddenly this painfully loud static screeched through the headphones causing me to drop them. I could still hear it as they laid on the desk, so I clicked stop on the call and just stared at the screen for a while.

I reasoned that that had to be it then. When they use that buzzer box to call in, it has to cause some sort of problem with the way the lines are forwarded or something and for whatever reason the voice logger can’t pick up the other end of the call. It just comes through as static. It’s the only thing that made sense. It was the only explanation.

Deciding to just forget about it, I walked back to my desk and sat down. A few calls came in on other accounts before I got another call on the housing authority account. Nervously, I answered it:

//

**Me:** “Thank you for calling [blank] Housing Authority. This is [Unrealsky].”

**Security:** “Hey, man, it’s [security]. Just wanted to let you know there wasn't nobody out there.”

**Me:** “Oh, um, alright.”

*(Again, I didn't really know what to say. On call people rarely check back with us about this sort of thing.)*

**Security:** “Was probly just some stupid kids out playin pranks, tryin to scare people. Fuckers spray painted your name on the front door in big red letters.” 

*(He laughed. My heart raced and that chill came back. My name?)*

**Security:** “Probly thought you were goin to be the one to find it. Heh, idiots.”

*(I feigned a laugh.)*

**Me:** “Yea, people can be ridiculous sometimes.”

**Security:** “You’re tellin me, makin me get up in the middle of the night.”

**Me:** “Yea, sorry about that, she just sounded…”

*(He interrupted me.)*

**Security:** “No, no, it’s not your fault this town is full of idiots. Bet you’re as ready to get off of work as I am to get back to bed.”

*(He laughed again. What’s with all the small talk? They never do this especially not in the middle of the night. “Ready to get off work?” What’s it to this guy? What’s going to happen when I get off work? I feigned another laugh.)*

**Me:** “Yea, um, you have no idea.”

**Security:** “Well, you have a good night, man.”

**Me:** “Alright, you too. Bye.”

//

My adrenaline was pumping. Ready to get off of work? What the hell was that? And my name spray painted on the door? It had to just be kids. They knew my name from how I answered the phone. That made sense. And their story wasn't even very good, it didn't make any sense. “It’s not working,” “it took my boy.” Amateur. Just some stupid kids trying to scare me. Stupid kids and a line forwarding problem. Nothing more.

Regardless of my attempts to reason it away, it all kind of lingered on the edge of my thoughts as I tried to collect myself and took a few calls on other accounts. As the time passed I managed to push the subject further and further away, but I just couldn't shake it entirely. I felt uncomfortable and tense. Despite being alone in the room, I felt like somebody was watching me. Like something was waiting for me. When not on a call, I paced, looked out the windows repeatedly and drank my coffee. Hidden in my little room, counting the time until I was off work and I could see that this was all just some stupid kids playing a joke and nothing was going to happen. I mean, they were in a completely different state, what were they going to do to me?

I drank so much coffee that night. 

The rest of the night was really slow, even for third shift. Usually, I would consider that a good thing but that night I hated it. It felt like torture, waiting and watching the clock. I knew nothing was going to happen, but… that didn't matter. Those words had a grip on me.

“Stupid bitch. Die after work!”

At 5:23a, I heard the door buzzer go off, meaning someone had opened the back door. Only employees know the code to get in, but regardless, it startled me. The back door is in the break room and I could see the door into the break room from where I was sitting, so I leaned back to peer through the little window. It was the first shift supervisor early for her shift. Despite knowing that was who it had to be, I was relieved. I don't know what else I would have expected. 

We greeted each other as she entered the room and she offered that since she was there early and it was slow that she would just take over for me and I could go home. Normally this would be something I’d jump at, but this time I was hesitant. Suspicious. I got a grip on reality, though, and took her up on the offer and thanked her. I thought about telling her about the weird calls I’d had, but figured I’d just end up sounding crazy. Back in reality, it was kind of embarrassing. So I just left it alone.

And that’s really what I've done with the whole thing for the past year. Just left it alone. Nothing ever came of it. Obviously, I’m here writing this so I didn't “die after work.” I realized it was just one of those things where something finds just the right spot in your brain in just the right circumstances to plant this little seed of fear --  of some inexplicable unknown -- that grows and grows, gripping and strangling your thoughts until you find all the pieces. Until you can explain away that unknown. And that morning when I got off of work and nothing happened, I was able to leave it all behind.

But, there’s a reason I decided to type all of this out. I still work at the same answering service, though now I’m a second shift supervisor, and we still answer for that same housing authority. One of my agents tonight received a call on that account and asked me to listen to it. She said the person gave all of their information really quick and she wasn't able to get it all down before they just hung up on her. So, I pulled up our voice logger, listened to the call and wrote down the information the caller had rambled off. At the end of the call, though, my heart started thumping again. The caller didn't hang up on my agent. She was calling from the buzzer box; I heard that familiar beeping again shortly before the line disconnected.

That means our voice logger works just fine recording the calls from that buzzer box.

off-black-cadillac,7,12,1r4jax,48,"Hi reddit, I just need to tell someone, because no one else would believe me and I'm not even sure if I'm imagining things or not but here goes.

Last Thursday. I went to a pub night organized by my college's student union, but I wasn't feeling too well so I decided to go home early. I don't live too far from the area, so I decided to walk.

I'm from Toronto, by the way (please I can't worry about Rob Ford right now). Most of the streets around here are pretty busy on weeknights. But as I was walking back (along College, for you fellow Torontonians), the street was eerily empty. No cars, no other people. I didn't think much of it at the time, but it was quiet. I remember that. And I also remember a car zooming down the road eastbound. I had my head down and was on my phone when I heard this loud, high pitched scream. I literally jumped back and almost dropped my phone. It wasn't like a drunken I'm-having-the-time-of-my-life scream. It was almost like a horror movie scream, but worse. It sounded tortured. It sounded  like that sound you get when you scrape your fingernails down a blackboard. I remember looking up at the car. It had already passed me, but I could see the passenger window rolled down. And I could see someone's head sticking out and looking back at me. But it was all wrong. The head was bending off the neck in a strange angle. I think it was a woman - it had long black hair waving in the wind, but it also had a blackened shrivelled face. And no eyes. I was so certain of that because I had felt such a strong sense of repulsion when I looked at the screamer's face and saw nothing but holes. But I did have a few drinks.

It wasn't the drinks though.

Last night, I went to bed relatively early. I'm usually a heavy sleeper and never wake up in the middle of the night. But last night...ok this is weird because I live on the 17th floor of an apartment (no roommates, for the record). But I woke up because I heard a thump. Like something hit my window. I thought it was a bird at first, because don't birds fly into buildings all the time in the city? But my lights were off. And I got these chills, and my stomach dropped, and I knew something wasn't right. I also got this feeling - no, I absolutely knew this - that someone was staring at me. At the time, I was turned away from the window and facing the wall. I didn't dare turn around, even though my blinds were closed. I just squeezed my eyes shut and waited. Someone was still watching. 

Eventually I fell asleep because the next thing I knew I was being woken by my alarm. Half asleep, I rolled out of bed and went to pull back the blinds.

And fuck, I should have left them. There was a huge print on my window: two hand prints and two foot prints, and a print that looked like it might be from someone's face? Except the hand and foot prints would have belonged to someone with extremely long fingers and toes. And actually I'm not kidding when I say that my building was doing window washing that same afternoon so when I came back home after night class and the prints were gone, I was pretty sure I had dreamed up the whole thing. Or had I?

Something seemed off about my place. I couldn't quite place it, but fuck. When I walked into the bathroom and turned on the light, they immediately flickered off. I turned the switch off and back on, and light flooded the bathroom. I looked at the bulbs. They seemed to be working. I didn't even notice I was holding my breath but I breathed out in relief. And then I looked at the floor. 

There was long black hair everywhere. Large greasy clumps. It wasn't mine. I had long hair too, (and girls you know it's a nightmare cleaning up hair after showering) but it was dark brown, not black. And I had recently dyed it blonde. So no way it was mine. 

I absolutely freaked out.

I packed some things in a duffel and my laptop in my backpack and headed over to a friend's place. I arrived looking like a train wreck and in tears. Fortunately, she's letting me stay for a few days. (She thinks I broke up with my boyfriend.) Right now, I'm lying on her couch and typing this because I can't fucking sleep. I don't think I imagined any of it, but... 

Sorry reddit, this was poorly written but I needed to unload my thoughts somewhere. I'm not sure when I'll go back to my place yet, I still need a few days.

MissMonstrosity,20,26,1r5z11,49,"Hello everyone. I told this story to a friend who told me I should post it here in Nosleep. I'm sorry for any grammatical errors or bad commentary, I''m not much of a writer.

About four years ago I was a troubled thirteen year old, who like most teenagers, didn't get along with my parents.
It was just me and my little Brother, our Mother who spent more time on the computer then being a real Mother, and our Step Father, who in most cases, acted more like a frat boy room-mate then a parental figure.

Anyway this all started one day when my and my Mother got into an argument, only god knows what it was about since we argued all the time  back then. 
All I remember is that I stormed off, taking a backpack of clothes and some food with me, and ran into the woods.

We live on a huge property in the country, and the woods go on for miles and miles in every direction, with only a small creek running through it to break up the never ending amount of trees.
Alot of people might be freaked out by the ominous looking place, but I loved it. I went exploring out there everyday and I knew those woods like the back of my hand.
I ran to the south west, down a large hill that had the creek I mentioned earlier at the bottom of it, the creek itself went on even farther than the woods, cutting through several private properties and stopped just outside of a town over fourteen miles away.
I decided I'd follow to town, where I'd find somewhere to stay the night.
Why not just take the road to town? well we lived in the country, there were alot of crazy people out here, drunks, hill-billies, prostitutes, and a combination of all three. I figured if I took the road I'd only be asking to get raped or robbed.

I'll fast forward a little, about 2 hours later I finally came to the edge of our property.
The property after ours belonged to an old man, we met him in church a couple times. Despite several threatening ""No Trespassing"" signs  I wasn't worried, If he did so happen to come all the way out here and somehow find me, I could just claim to be lost.  I was sure he wouldn't be this far out in the woods anyway. 
Here the woods thinned out a little, and there were several small fields tucked between the trees. I came here before, but never went any further then the edge of the fields.
At this point   the sun was only an hour or so away from setting and I started walking faster to hopefully get to town before nightfall, I ran through the creek that separated me from the field, and slipped on something causing me to fall.
It hurt like hell, later I found out I had broken my toe. It was bleeding badly and I had to limp the rest of the way through the creek and fields.
I came to the end of the fields several minutes later, where a small path, either for ATV's or a tractor, led through the woods.
I never went this far before, but I knew if I kept going straight I'd get to the town within only an hour or so, so I went on.

After what felt like forever of following a twisting path that seemed to go nowhere It finally came to a small circular clearing. There was a fence surrounding it, with a large sign once again threatening anyone who crossed. I thought it was strange, we were hours from any house, why bother putting up a fence blocking off where no one would ever be likely to go? Then again I was going through, so maybe it wasn't all that uncommon. I crawled under the fence, foot still hurting like hell and went on through the clearing. I knew I wouldn't be caught, theres no way there would be anyone out here.
I walked, or more less, limped, through the clearing, on the other side there was another small field, and just my luck, there was a old tree stand in one of the trees surrounding it. 
We have a large hunting community, and hunters often hide out in the tree stands that were often camouflaged in the trees.
I thought it would make a great place to stay the night, since the town was still a long ways away and it was already starting to get dark.
I went up to it and poked my head inside, it was perfect. Just enough space to lay down and sleep if need be. 

I climbed back out and headed back to the clearing, There was a large hill to one side of it, I figured if I climbed up it I could see just how far away the town was. 
Ignoring my aching foot, I limped over to the hill, and right in that moment something hit me on the back of the head. It felt like someone angrily poking me, or throwing a small  pebble
I turned around quickly, expecting to find an angry farmer or hunter, no one was there, it was probably just an acorn or nut falling from one of the surrounding trees.
I laughed at myself for being stupid and rubbed at my now aching head.
For whatever reason, I decided to not try to force my way up the large hill, and instead went to the opposite side of the round clearing, I dont know why, it just felt like something was pulling me there.

About half way across the clearing I stopped dead in my tracks and gasped. I literally uttered  the words ""Oh my God"" Before quickly shutting my mouth in fear someone might have heard me.
There before me, were several grave stones. All ranging in height and design. 
The ground in front of some of them was lower than the rest of the ground, almost as if the coffins underneath had caved in.
I stumbled over to the graveyard, and bent down to try to read the head-stones.
Most were unreadable. Only one of them had enough words I could make out, it looked like two head-stones fused together.

The one on the left read ""G.A Keaton -date unreadable-
The one on the right said ""Harriet Keaton 18?? - 187?""
at the bottom, just visible, was ""Our angels, together in heaven""

At this point, I turned and ran.
I blacked out for most of the time I was running, I ran through the clearing, ran along the path, ran across the fields until I was finally back on our property. 
I only slowed down because it was pitch black outside, and stupid me forgot to bring a flash-light. It was so dark I could hardly see in front of me.
Once again, I'll fast forward, I finally got home after my step father had found me, apparently he went out looking for me, not to ensure I was safe and guide me home, no. 
Only because he wanted to drag me home to make me apologize to my mother.
I didn't care, I happily followed him home.
After finally getting there I found my brother, looking like he was crying, and my mom sitting at the table eating dinner, looking like she didn't have a care in the world. She glanced at me, made a face. And left the room.
Over time I ended up telling her about the graveyard, she found it interesting, and soon enough all my family knew about the weird graveyard in the woods. It became quite a conversation topic in our family, before over time, being forgotten.



One thing I never told anyone though, And the reason I went running out of that place like a baby-
 Was because, shortly after finding that cemetery, I started to hear whispering, and among the trees behind the graveyard, I could've sworn I saw something moving.

 Then, right after reading what was on the one tombstone, what felt like a long boney finger,
Started tapping on the back of my head.
",A Cemetery in the Woods,75
wezziford,7,20,1qxs1g,45,"There is almost nothing that I hate more than flying.

Unfortunately (yes yes, first world problems), due to the course my life has taken, I find myself on a plane at least once or twice a month.  Generally speaking, my flights are boring and uneventful with a smattering of panic attacks here and there when we fly through a thunderstorm or encounter severe turbulence.

Generally speaking.

One of my more recent flights was from Miami to Boston, a voluntary trip home to see friends, family, and dog.  Mid-afternoon departure, exit row to myself - all ingredients for an almost enjoyable flight.  Honestly, except for the woman in the row ahead of me chatting (yelling) with her row mates all flight, I would have had no complaints.

Unfortunately, for those of us that fear a ""fiery plane crash into watery grave"" type of death, the most direct flight path from MIA - BOS is largely over open water.  For most of the flight I had my nose in a book and felt no need to even peek out of the window next to me.  This time, though, the captain announced that the left side of the plane had a ""postcard perfect""view of New York City.  However, as I am lazy and perhaps spoiled in the sense that I've seen the city so many times, I decided to stay put and see if the right side of the plane had any majestic vistas to offer.

I started to lift the shade - what the fuck was that?

Alright wezziford, you're a paranoid flyer.  Look again - rip that fucker open.  Holy shit.

An unfathomably huge head, blunt at the end and longer than the freighter it was surfacing next to.  I looked around me - of course.  The view of the city had almost everyone on the other side of the plane, ooh-ing and ahh-ing.

Snap out of it.  Look again.  Too much medication before the flight?

A literal gaping maw.  It looked like a portal in the ocean, full of teeth on top of teeth.  And...shipping containers?

The freighter!  Fuck!  Now listing heavily to one side as its cargo tumbled into the ocean cavern, and just as quickly swallowed by the blackness.  In about 5 seconds, maybe even less, the ocean was still again.  The ""hole"" in the ocean replaced by what looked like a huge grey-blue island that shot a geyser into the air that seemed it would hit the plane before disappearing back into the sea.

I turned my head from the window, breathing heavily and sliding the shade back into place.  I denied, denied, denied, willing myself to believe that it was an overactive imagination and paranoid mind at work, always assuming the worst when it comes to flight.  As I settled back into my seat, trying my damnedest to stop sweating, I realized how quiet the exit rows were.  I noticed wide blue eyes looking around the seat in front of me - the loudmouth.  With a face as white as the clouds we were flying through, she looked to my window and then back at me.  Hands clutching the cross around her neck, lips moving without sound, I knew at that moment that she had seen it too.  This wasn't a Benadryl-induced illusion.  This was real, and true, and completely unnoticed to anyone but us.

Maybe the Biblical tales and sailor's stories have been true all along.  We laugh and poke holes in the plots, looking for scientific explanations to prove them wrong, because it makes it easier to sleep at night.  The ocean is vast, unexplored and desolate, even more so than outer space.  Perhaps it's best we keep it that way.",Livyatan,65

I've been trying to find similar stories to mind, but I wasn't able to find anything that would help me figure out what is going on. But I found this sub-reddit so I figured I would just register for an account and try to find help here.

I recently moved to a new town, it's all been great and I love it. One evening at a park, a woman approached me and started asking me how have I been doing, how is life, and in the end - why am I in that town, how did I decide to come, she wouldn't expect to find me there. She referred to me as Magdalena and asked me why didn't I stay in a certain small village. When she figured I had no idea who she is and that I was rather shocked that I was approached by her, she got kind of angry and first told me to cut the shit, and kept ranting. I couldn't shut her up to ask what is this all about, she kept rambling and rambling, on and on. In the end I just told her to shut the fuck up, she's a freak, I have no idea what was all of that about and I don't want to hear any more. I even started making threats. She was pissed but she walked away. 

I'm not Magdalena, that is my great-grandmother's name. She lived in the village the woman mentioned.  She's dead. And the woman that approached me couldn't have known her, because she doesn't look older than 30, my great-grandmother has been dead for more than that. People say I look like her when she was young, and there is only one picture of her - when I compare it to me, yes, we do look alike, almost the same. My grandmother says we even have the same walk, same mannerisms and voice. But that's not a weird thing - not freaky at all.

What is weird in this - even if this woman DID know my great-grandmother, or saw a picture, or whatever - why would she address me as Magdalena? No one can stay the same after more than 60 years, and that's how long ago she COULD have looked like I look now. If she was alive, she sure wouldn't be a young woman walking around parks in random towns. It's a ridiculous assumption.

I asked my grandmother about this, she asked me to describe the woman and tell me about her behavior. I did. She asked me how did I react, and as I explained the exchange, she just cut me off and asked me if I was bitchy to the woman. I had to admit that yes, I was, but she provoked that reaction. My grandmother said ""Good, she won't bother you again"". But that was it. 
I asked her about the woman, who is she, what does she want, why and how would she assume I am my great-grandmother but my grandmother just told me to leave it as it is because I got rid of her.

My father told me that it's all ridiculous and she must have made a mistake looking for someone else, but it doesn't sound like it. What kind of a coincidence would it be that she was looking for a Magdalena from that village? And plus, there are no young people in that village anymore. Especially not ones that are called Magdalena and look like me.


I met her in the same park again and she just apologized to me for her behavior, I didn't. I figured if my grandmother says I got rid of her by being bitchy I'm not going to take it back.

I was still in shock, but a few days later I approached her (she's always  in that park in the evening) - I asked about her name, who is she, why did she talk to me that day, etc. but she wouldn't answer. She would keep going off topic, saying that it's a nice day, or that the woman over there has a nice jacket, or the dog under the tree is cute, etc.
So I just let it go.

But I'm still creeped out.
Plus, I see this woman all the time in that park. And the moment I arrive - she turns to me, looks, stares. She listens while I talk to people, looks at me no matter what am I  doing. When I leave the park, she stares at me for as long as she can see me. She never gets up, even though I assumed she'd follow me.
I don't see her any other place but the park.

My grandmother told me not to talk to her, not to mess with this, to just let it be and let it go, but I can't.

Help, advice, opinions?

 UPDATE 20.11.20132 :
-I called my grandmother since I figured it would be better than trying again with the woman. 
At first she wouldn't tell me absolutely anything, but once I said ""She couldn't have known greatgrandma..."", she cut  me off and said ""She could and she did."" Then she said something like ""But she doesn't need to know you and I'm telling you to stay away.""  Obviously I tried asking who she is, what is she, but I got no answer, so I asked is she dangerous, evil - she said no, but she isn't such good company either.  She compared her to a friend I had when I was about 14 that wasn't really evil or bad, she just often caused trouble and if you were her friend, you'd be in that trouble too of course. She'd stick with you through everything, but she'd cause the shit that you have to stick through in the first place. I told her I want to know more and if she doesn't tell me I'll find out on my own, possibly by asking the woman, she said I don't need to know but it's my choice and if I don't trust her enough to stay away, that's fine but she's not talking.
My father told me it's all bullshit and I can just go talk to the woman and ask her is she crazy or drunk or drugged or something. But how the fuck did she know.",Who is this woman?,56
Desequencer,3,20,1qwubp,45,"I woke up this morning with little to no recollection of the day before. It’s not the first time, either.

I remember waking up. I vaguely remember going to work. I don’t remember what I worked on. I only remember waking up again this morning.

Being a detective, you can imagine that this type of mental illness would not go over well with my higher ups. No one knows that I have a fleeting memory, except my brother. I call him every time it happens, because I have no one else to talk to.

“Again?” he asked wearily, not even greeting me after he picked up the phone.

I sighed and rubbed my head.

“Still no headaches or anything?”

My brother works in pharmaceutics, so he knows his fair share about medicine, but he’s still no doctor. I haven’t gotten any pills from him; instead, I’ve only gotten pleas do go to a real doctor. Like I said, I can’t do that. Not with my job.

“I’m going to work,” I said.

“Come on, man. Be reasonable. What case are you working on right now?”

“That missing person case, where the husband claims–“

“Right, right.” He became more serious, solemn even. “I know you don’t trust him, but…”

“But what?”

“Maybe he’s telling the truth.” 

I laughed. “Like hell. There’s a realistic explanation for everything that appears supernatural. Including hauntings.”

“I believe him.”

After the brief chat with my brother, I got ready for work. It pained me to be unable to remember a single damn thing from the day before. The best I could do was believe I followed my usual routine, deep into the fog of my memory. Shower, breakfast, drive, case… I would have interviewed the husband about the case. I would have written down new information. I would be fine.

I got to work and found the most recent folder in my case list. A missing persons report, and the husband was being held for questioning. There was no new information from the day before, so I wondered what work I had even gotten done yesterday.

An officer brought the husband into one of our interrogation rooms at my request. “Still no headway, huh?” the officer asked when I met him at the door.

I furrowed my brow. “Why do you say that?”

He shrugged. “Well, you were in here with him yesterday. You left in a hurry so I figured you… you know, *had* something.”

I glanced at my folder, in which I had written nothing about this interrogation yesterday. Struggling with what to say to cover, I shook my head. “Nothing.”

“Didn’t mean to step on your toes, Detective. Just curious.”

“Not a problem.” I gave the officer a reassuring smile and entered the room.

“What is this for, man?” the husband asked before I had a chance to shut the door. He was frustrated, and I didn’t blame him. I needed answers for more than just this case, though.

I sat down across the table from him and opened the folder, skimming over it. I’d already read through the available information, but I wanted him to sweat. Based on what I had, I suspected the guy, and I wanted him to think that I’d found the evidence to nail him. But when I looked up after a minute or so, he wasn’t sweating. He was dejected, his face in one of his hands.

“So what’s the story?” I asked.

“I told you,” he groaned. “It was that–“

The last four interviews, he said the same thing. That’s what my reports say. But the last time, I don’t know what he began the story with. I glanced up at the camera in the corner of the room, deciding to pull the tape and see what had happened. As for now, I’d had enough. “Why don’t you tell me something new, John?”

“Like yesterday?” He was quick on the trigger. “What about yesterday, huh? You hurry out of here like you’ve got to take a huge shit, and now you’re back here today, starting over.”

I held my hands up to calm him down. “Alright, okay.”

“You didn’t find her, then?”

I didn’t remember. “Sorry, not yet. You know I’m working on it.”

“Go talk to the dry cleaner or his wife, they’ll corroborate my story.”

“That your wife is missing because of a ghost?” Maybe I had already gone to see them, and one of them hit me over the head so I wouldn’t remember.

Then again, maybe my lapses in memory were related to the case. *There’s a realistic explanation for everything that appears supernatural. Including hauntings.* I was making headway but forgetting the progress, and not for inexplicable reasons. Was someone keeping track of me? I glanced up at the camera again, briefly imagining that one of my higher ups was responsible for this. I suddenly felt in over my head as I tried to reason through this logic. It was as unreasonable as a haunted dress, right? 

“Are you even listening?”

I snapped out of my train of thought and looked at John. “No, I was thinking.”

“Don’t…hurt yourself,” he said quietly, sitting back in his chair.

When I noticed that his eyes were fixed on my nose, I became aware of something draining from it. Blood.

“Are you alright, Detective?”

I didn’t have an answer. “I’ll be…” I got out of the chair. “I’ll be back,” I stammered, backing out of the room.

After waving the officer off I got to the restroom to clean myself up. The bleeding stopped after a moment, but even then I remained to stare at myself in the mirror, trying to figure my own self out. There was a piece to this puzzle in my brain, and I didn’t know how to get it out. Maybe my nose would bleed it out for me.

I went back to my desk in a daze. I sat down and found that my computer was off, which was peculiar. Due to the long boot up time, I usually just logged out and left it idle overnight. Groaning, I pushed the power button on the tower and waited the agonizing several minutes before the login screen appeared.

Once logged in, I used the shortcut to open the program we use for digital case information. Instead of opening the program, it opened a text file.

*Check your trash, and you’ll see!!*

A wave of chills crashed against my back. What was I supposed to see? I swallowed and looked at my trash can. Empty. Not that I would rummage through it while the office was busy anyway. Then, realizing my mistake, I checked the computer’s trash.

A single text file. Untitled.

I opened it hesitantly, and I was greeted with a long slab of prose instead of a single line of text. Shaking, I began to read.

Decendent,4,26,1qwq4m,43,"My mother recently told me about how she(oblivious at the time) was almost raped and possibly murdered by Mike ""The Mall Passer"" DeBardeleben (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_DeBardeleben).
He was a serial rapist, murderer, counterfeit money passer, and sexual sadist.

She told me recently that in 1979 while she was in college in North Carolina, she noticed someone following her in a big car as she walked home one night from class. She tried to ignore it at first, but when it was obvious that she was being stalked, she got scared. She saw a cop car parked at a gas station and ran to it, and the car that had been following her peeled off. Once she thought she was safe, she continued her walk home. Everything was ok until she had to cross the little footbridge that's on her way home. Once she was over it, the same car ripped around the corner and stopped her, and a man rolled his window down and started small talk, and asked her if he could give her a ride. She said ""No"" and started to turn, at which point he grabbed her and tried to pull her into the car. She said she jerked away and immediately ran to a house that was across the street, and he sped away.

2 weeks later, she awoke to the sound of her roommate screaming (Mom, and 3 other girls all shared a 2 bedroom apartment, so it was 2 to a room). When she gained her vision she saw THE SAME GUY standing in the middle of her room looking at her. She said that the look on his face was calculating. The roommate screamed ""Who are you what are you doing here?!"" and he turned and replied ""uh...I uh..forgot my guitar"" and grabbed a guitar that was leaning on the wall. The roommate shouted ""That's my guitar!"" and he threw it to the ground and ran out.

After reporting this event to the apartment manager, the manager told my mom that some guy had come by a few days earlier stating that he was a family friend of ""the pretty girl with long dark hair that lives upstairs"" and wanted to surprise her. So the apartment manager gave her pretty much ever detail about my Mom. Where she works, goes to school, basic weekly routines. Of course my Mom flipped out on her, as anyone would.
That was the last she ever saw or heard of him, until several years later. 

She was reading a book about notorious serial killers in America and read the story of Mike DeBardeleben. Who was all over the country raping and apparently killing some of his victims. When she flipped the page and saw his picture, she gasped. It was him. They also showed a picture of his car, and it was the one that followed her that night. 

Once she told me, I started to research. I found this page : http://www.docstoc.com/docs/54025280/James-Michael-DeBardeleben-Mall-Passer that showed that he was in the North Carolina area at the same time my Mom was attending college there. Also, the victimology shows that he targeted women around age 18 and 19, my Mom's age at the time. Seriously got the creeps. 

He died in 2011. I wouldn't be here today if he had done what he was planning to do. I'm glad he dropped his pursuit, but I wonder more often than I should...why? I can only assume that his initial plan failed and it would have been too easy to tie him to any crime committed against my mother at that point, so it was easier to move on.

His next victim was Laurie Jensen. She lived, but was repeatedly raped. Who knows where she is now, but for some reason I can't get her out of my head.


TL;DR - My mother was almost raped and possibly killed before I was born, by a serial sexual sadist named Mike DeBardeleben. He died in prison in 2011.",I was almost never born,69
LightTheDark,3,25,1qw2x2,42,"Recently I have noticed little changes to things around the house.  The electric blanket had been turned off on the temperature control rather than at the wall, a tape measure was moved from the store room at the back of the house to the glass shelves at the front of the house, my kindle opened to a book I had finished reading weeks ago, rather than to the book I was reading now.

I didn’t think too much of it, maybe my husband had changed the electric blanket setting to 0, maybe I moved the tape measure and forgotten I had and electronic devices sometimes do some wacky things.

Then, last night, just before bed my husband and I were having an argument.  Just a silly little tiff about nothing in particular, the kind of fight people have when they have been together for so long, normally for us this is triggered by the tomato isle in the supermarket.  No idea why.  

We were both tired, and I don’t like to go to bed angry with each other, so I tried to end the fight by saying if I wasn’t to blame and he wasn’t to blame, then who was?  My husband responded saying ‘Nobody’.  I laughed and said ‘naughty Nobody, you really should apologise’.  

Very quietly somebody said ‘sorry’.

DickBanditDoneLanded,10,65,1r1zac,39,"As a kid, I grew up singing songs of joy with my friends. Fun songs that made me feel like a child. There was one song that I never really liked, for reasons unbeknownst to me, but that one song would become a living hell during my adult life.

My wife packed my son's lunchbox with a pizza lunchables; It was always his favorite one. I had the privilege of walking him to school that cold October morning, holding his hand the whole walk. We talked about toys, games, and then the topic of songs came up.
""Hey, dad...how come you never showed me the song about Josh Jacob Jinglehyper Smith?"" he asked. ""Haha, you mean John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt? I never liked that song, kiddo,"" I replied. ""I thought his name was Josh, like mine!"" He added.

 We got to the school about half an hour earlier than the entry time, so I suggested we go to the playground located around back; Josh agreed and followed me. The air felt relatively dense that day, I could barely see fifty feet away and asked Josh to stay in sight and have a little fun before school starts. I look away at the birds in the trees and I'm startled by the piercing cry of my son, nowhere in sight. I call his name and he says ""Sorry, dad! I fell off the monkey bars, I'll be fine!"" I sighed and laughed a little knowing my kid was such a warrior. I notice Josh riding a swing and laughing with another little boy who also came to school too early. I see his father standing on the side, laughing and I worry about not being a good enough dad to Josh. I start to walk toward the boys and that's when it hits me; I wasn't watching Josh play, none of the two boys was mine. I tried to keep calm but felt the need to yell out his name to locate him. I look around the playground and the school bell rings, announcing the school's opening. The dense, foggy air dissipates and I'm able to see everything clearly. I find a note in the second floor of the jungle gym, it reads: ""I know how hard you tried to avoid me, I wouldn't want the same thing happening with Josh.""

My heart sank and my eyes widened as the note dropped on the mulch and made a thud. I felt every possible emotion at that one point in time. I didn't know what to do, where to go, who to ask for help, so I walked into the school, where I come across a corkboard with pictures of kids on it. All of these children were abducted by a strange man who walked into the forest beside the school. I knew what I had to do, I ran into the woods, clenching the note he had written. ""John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt!"" I hear a high pitched voice scream from the bushes, as I fall to the ground in fear.

 I noticed a building on a hill about a mile into the wild. It was a greenish wooden house, much like the ones mystery inc. would investigate, but this was not a game, this was my son's life and possibly that of many other children. The smell of rotting was emitting throughout the air, and I feared the worst for the status of the kids. Not willing to be detected, I snuck in through a window that was left open and creeped about the dark house with nothing but my signal-less cellphone and my dedication. I was in the basement floor and couldn't see anything, so I turned on my flashlight app. I had no idea I was about to come across one of the most horrible sights anyone could've seen.

 There were mutilated corpses, not just any corpses, but children, kids who I had met through class pictures my wife bought and showed me. The kids were decapitated, burned, sliced, naked. I was scared for my life, I almost threw up one too many times but swallowed it back along with my will to flee. I found a wooden staircase that was old and rotting. The first step I took on it made a loud creak and there was a groan in the distance. I hid behind a giant flowerpot as a huge figure approached the area I was in. I could barely breathe as I noticed this man had blood between his fingernails, as if he mutilated the children with nothing but his fingers. He returned to the room and I followed him from afar. The smell I picked up earlier was much stronger than before and I heard muffled cries coming from the room the man walked into. 
""Say it with me, now, kids!
John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt! 
His name is my name too! 
Whenever we go out! 
The people always shout! 
There goes John Jacob Jingleheimer Schm-"" A kid bit a hole through the duct tape on his mouth and was able to scream while he sang. I heard the kid's name; It was Gary.

The children were all able to remove their mouth bindings and cried in unison for about ten seconds. Then I hear a loud laugh, followed by a ""SHUT THE FUCK UP!"" At this point, I was enraged. Nobody has the right to scream at kids like that, nobody. I barged in, grabbing this freak by his back-length hair and slamming his face into a table with limbs on it. ""What did you just say to those kids, you motherfucker?!"" I yelled, oblivious to the children in the room. ""You're gonna pay for all your shit, you son of a bitch!"" I said ""Well that's just too damn bad!"" He added ""I didn't know today was the day I'd be found! It's such a shame you've missed your playdate with your son...he was SUCH a nice boy!"" He said, laughing his head off at the sight of my expression. I was cold, I was numb. My son was dead.

 I unleashed my fury on the man, not holding back at all. I knocked him unconscious and tied him down to a giant piece of metal. I broke both his legs and made sure he'd never walk again, then I released the children, many starving and ready to go home. I tugged the slab down the hill and walked alongside the children toward the school. The police had previously raided the woods, but never came across the house in the entire year he had been performing the kidnappings. I called the school and notified the authorities of the serial killer I had slayed and I wanted to make sure he was arrested and would suffer his whole life for what he did to my wife and I. She was hysterical, unable to perform for almost a whole year. We cancelled any holidays and vacations and mourned a year away. We finally concluded that our son was happy in a better place with the rest of his friends. Although my wife and I never had any other children, I became teacher at an elementary school in another state and was happy knowing I had kids who were fun to be around and nice to me. 

One Monday morning, we have a new girl come in and I ask her to introduce herself. She's laughing and she's shy and she wants to whisper something in my ear. ""I'll introduce myself if we can just play today."" She says I promise her, along with the class, that we'll have a free day and she introduces herself and makes friends. I start to like this girl because I never had a chance to have a daughter and always wanted one. She was very sociable and was the class clown.

She stopped coming to school for a week, and out of curiosity, I called her parents to ask about her sudden disappearance. Her mother was crying and I couldn't understand her, so her father came to the phone. I told him about how the class missed her and he told me about a note that was left at their door one afternoon. It read: ""Go through her drawings"" I asked the dad to give me a minute while I did just that. *HE* was in the pictures. Every drawing she made had *him* hiding in the background. There was a folded piece of paper that was thicker than the rest. Little did I know, it wasn't school paper, it was skin; Pressed and cut to replicate a note. ""I thought, by now, you'd figure out I was never human"" I got on the phone to tell the girl's father the news, but all I heard was a demonic, maniacal laughter. I felt a hole in my chest, as the phone line went dead, followed by three beeps and elongated static.","His name is my name, too.",104
Capntallon,20,14,1r8n66,53,"I got this letter from an old friend I haven't seen in a long time. I figure that this would be best place to ask for advice. Here's the transcript of the letter:

*Hello, Daniel. Haven't seen you for quite some time now.*

*No time for formalities, though. I need you to do something. Remember that old house we used to hide out in down by the farm? I need you to go there. When you approach the house, try not to make any sound. Go up to the loft and you will find a trunk. In it you will find a small vial, a razor blade, and a folded piece of paper. Take the razor and prick your finger. Touch your forehead and make a dot of blood. DO NOT touch the vial before you do so.*

*Open the vial and drink it. When you do so your vision will go blurry, but you have to stay calm. Pick up the paper in the trunk and read the first paragraph. It's in German, but I know you won't have trouble with  pronouncing it. At this point, you MUST stay calm. You will start to feel closed in and you will start hearing voices. DO NOT listen to what they have to say. Tear the paper into the smallest pieces you can and scatter them on the floor.*

*When that's done, go downstairs to the ""kitchen"". You will find a gas can and a lighter. Set fire to the house. No matter what the voices say, you HAVE to set fire to the house. After it starts going, the voices will go away. Then you need to get away from that house as fast as you can.*

*Good luck,*

*Tiffany*

I'm really freaked out. What should I do?",I got this letter a few days ago...,67
YourOldPalHoward,40,26,1qzw9o,31,"I first discovered the darker side of the internet in the very early 2000s, when I was 12 or 13. Between 3 and 5pm every week day, the window where I was home from school and both of my parents were at work, I'd be on the family desktop browsing gore sites like Rotten.com and Ogrish. I don't know what the fascination was for me, but it was (thankfully) the sort of thing I grew out of with time. That's not to say I don't enjoy a good /r/WTF post from time to time, but it's been many years since I've had the urge to intentionally trawl through those dark corners of the web.


At 13, however, I was a real glutton for disturbing content. I wittingly exposed myself to photos of horrible deformities and medical conditions, the aftermath of grisly road accidents, videos of Al Queda beheadings and public suicides, the list could go on. I desensitized myself to such stuff, and troubling as it may be, I remain mostly as desensitized to this day.


But that's just how it is when you grow up with unrestricted internet access and a morbid streak.


There was one site I remember stumbling across, though, that haunts me to this day. Not because the videos on it were especially gory or anything—once you've seen the Bud Dweyer suicide, or Nick Berg screaming as a terrorist saws through his neck with a rusty knife, gore on its own just doesn't do much for you.


If I had to come up with what was so terrifying about this site, I guess it would be the fact that I just can't imagine what sort of person would make videos of this nature, much less in such obscene quantities. You can kind of get into the head of a terrorist bomber or cartel executioner— they're often products of circumstance and have identifiable motives. But the sort of person behind these particular videos...I just don't understand his particular sickness of the mind. And as terrifying as such an unknown might be, I'm not sure I'd even want to.


There had to have been at least 50 videos on the site. They all had titles and descriptions in Russian, but this was a good few years before the days of Google Translate, so I still have no idea what they read. I don't know if that makes it better or worse.


Each and every video was filmed on a tripod in the middle of the woods. They'd start out with nothing in frame for several seconds while the angle was being adjusted. Then the cameraman would walk into view wearing a balaclava and pulling a dog on a leash. He'd usually speak to the camera briefly (again, in Russian). Sometimes the dog would get anxious and whine, and the man would kneel down and speak softly to it for a moment.


Then he would take the leash, wrap it around the dog's neck, and choke it to death. Sometimes this took several minutes. The man would maintain the choke until a full minute or so after the dog had gone completely limp, then get up, walk towards where the tripod was mounted, and end the video.


Again, there were *at least* 50 of these videos on the site. I watched way more of them than I'd care to admit, and every one of them went exactly the same, just with different dogs. Some of the dogs would whine during the video, but all of them were docile and obedient— some of them were even playful and affectionate towards the man before he began choking them. These dogs clearly weren't taken from Russia's feral dog population, these were pets. 


Were they other people's pets, that were stolen and killed? Or did the man in the video adopt and care for animals just to choke them out for his video collection? I'm not sure which would be worse.


Lastly, I don't recall any two videos having a dog of the same breed. Though I didn't watch all of them, I saw everything from beagles to Great Danes get the same treatment. Sometimes there would be a particularly uncommon breed, including some I didn't recognize at all, and the guy's cadence and body language reflected a kind of creepy excitement. It was almost like the guy had made a game of acquiring and killing as many distinct breeds of dogs as he could come across.


So yeah. Nothing supernatural about my story, no danger or unexplained phenomenon. Just a Russian guy and his awful hobby. I don't even know if it will count as NoSleep for you guys— all I know is, whenever I think about what sort of person was behind those videos, and the fact that he's in all likelihood still around somewhere, it gives me the fucking chills.


I don't remember the name of the site. It might not even be up anymore. But I can't be the only one who came across it. Someone else who sought out fucked up shit at the time has to have encountered the same videos. Right?",I can't be the only one who saw these videos...,57
breezy84,4,12,1qvgrc,36,"I was about 15 or 16 when this happened, and I will never forget it! 

I ate lunch with my little group of friends every day at school. We noticed that our friend ""Erin"" had been overly tired for the past few days and asked her if there was anything wrong. At first she answered no, but then she said ""Well, there is, but you guys wouldn't believe me if I told you."" Well, of course we wanted to know what it was after that! We finally got it out of her. ""I've been waking up in the middle of the night lately, and....I swear my dolls are breathing."" Woah! What?? Our friend ""Blair"" and myself automatically gained interest - we were big fans of the paranormal. ""Mary"" wasn't as interested and was very skeptical. Blair and I decided a slumber party was in order, stat!!

The next day was Friday, we all arranged to have a sleepover at Erin's house and find out for ourselves about these ""breathing dolls"". Erin had a rather large bedroom upstairs. At the far end was a bay window with a bench to sit on, and on both sides of the window there were two shelves lined with Erin's porcelain doll collection, probably about 30 dolls in all. We had a great time, doing normal dorky things girls do at sleepovers, we all practically forgot the main reason we were staying there in the first place. Time flew by and before we knew it, it was about 2am. ""Well,"" said Blair, ""let's hit the hay and see what these dolls do!""

We all settled into our sleeping bags or make-shift beds, shut off the lights, and waited. Occasionally one of us would say something that would make the rest of the slap-happy gang laugh, but eventually we settled into silence. We all laid there for probably about an hour, listening and waiting and trying not to fall asleep. I was just starting to doze off when I heard Erin whisper ""There it is...do you hear it???"" Blair, Mary, and myself lifted our heads up and listened. It was quiet, but definitely there...a faint, rhythmic breathing. ""Are you sure we're not just hearing each other??"" asked Mary. We all held our breath to test that theory, but the breathing still continued. Blair, the bravest of us, got to her feet and slowly made her way over toward the dolls. Erin and I got up and followed...Mary followed also, but hung back a ways.

The moon was shining through the window, illuminating the dolls from the side. As we leaned in to have a closer look, we noticed something...condensation underneath the noses of several of the dolls. The condensation coincided with the breathing we were hearing, the spots getting larger on the exhale and smaller on the inhale...THE FRICKIN' DOLLS WERE BREATHING. Needless to say we freaked out. There was a door in Erin's room that led to a storage area over the garage. We flipped the lights on, ran into the storage area, grabbed a box and threw all of the dolls in it. Then we took it back into the storage area, put a couple heavy boxes on top of it, then closed locked and barricaded the door. None of us slept very well the rest of the night, after experiencing that and just knowing that those dolls were still under the same roof as us.

Erin's house was (and still is) incredibly haunted and all kinds of weird things have happened there over the years, but this was by far the craziest! I had one porcelain doll that immediately went into the trash as soon as I got home. To this day I still refuse to own one and really just hate dolls like that in general. I know it wasn't the ""dolls"" themselves so much as whatever was possessing them, but I'm definitely not providing a vessel for whatever it was!",The Breathing Dolls,48
DarkPie,12,14,1qvq2y,27,"For those of you who didn't see my original entry, I figured I should put a link to it. [Here you go.](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qqxas/mom_i_love_you/)

I was asleep a lot the past day or so. I think it was the blood loss, personally, but as soon as I was awake I was confronted by a psychologist. Dr. Sharon Richardson, a woman who I never met before, but she knew a lot about me. She knew of my mom, her snap, the wounds I had received. She was worried about me, to say the least. ""One does not get betrayed by their own parent and feel nothing."" That might be true, but that wasn't how mom saw it.

""I'll be okay once she gets the help she needs."" The look of pity on her face made me confused, but she simply said it was someone else's job to explain that to me. We talked for about an hour, about everything from school to the recent craziness, and she came to the conclusion that I was in mild shock. It sounded right- I still hadn't wrapped my head around the fact that I was alone now. ""I'll talk to you in a few days"" she said with a smile, resting her hand on my head.

A woman in her early fifties, she had aged well. A fine wine among most women who age, admittedly, like milk. She left, and I thought I could rest. I couldn't- I was confronted instead by Officer Hughes, a man of Filipino descent. He introduced himself, asked how I was feeling, seemed like a genuinely good man. He slid up the chair and sat down, looking at me with the somber expression that made it seem like he'd be telling me my mother was dead.

""Son... It's about your mother."" My heart stopped. My pupils dilated, my muscles tensed. I sat straight, making the bullet wounds stretch and feel just awful. ""Do you have any idea where she might be?"" She was still alive. I thought that had been what I wanted to hear, but instead I panicked. My mother, when she was more sane, was OCD. She didn't like leaving jobs half done. Face growing pale, I shook my head. ""Uhm... I have... Grandparents."" I could barely talk, and the answer didn't please him.

""Yes, we know. On your mothers side. They've both been killed. It seems after your mothers escape, she went there to talk to your parents. We assume that your grandfather decided to call the institution and tell them where your mother was, and she found out. Your grandmother died from lacerations, your grandfather- Well. They're no longer alive"" he said. Now I felt it. Remorse, pain. Without his assurance, though, I knew this wasn't my fault. Mom was... She was going crazy.

""How do you know they were calling the institution..?"" The officer smiled. ""They received the call. They just never heard his voice. She was too fast for them"" he said, trying to say it as calmly as possible. ""From there, she took your grandfathers Browning M1911 handgun, and .375 H&amp;H rifle. I guess you came into contact with the handgun."" He seemed solemn. ""My mom... She's not going to jail, is she?""

""If we catch her, she'll be in an institution the rest of her life. Medication forever. She won't escape there. Is there any other family she might go to?"" There wasn't. ""Do you guys have any regular places you'd like to go?"" We didn't. ""Well fuck, where would she b-"" his voice was rising, but he was cut off by the nurse entering the room quickly. 

""We received a phone call"" she said in a panic. The officer stood quickly, and she almost started balling. ""Some woman, she sounded mad. She... She said she was coming to pick up her son"" she said among chokes of tears. ""Goddamnit"" The officer yelled, running his fingers through his hair. I didn't understand the problem, but apparently the area they thought she was in was the complete opposite side of town from the hospital. He was my only protection. 

""I have an idea..."" I offered up timidly. The officer looked at me, bemused and irritated. ""Well... If I know her, she just wants to finish what she's started. Which means she knows charging in here won't work out. She'll probably just sit around until I try to go home. So why don't you just take me home in your car, we'll beat her there, and you guard me? You can have your backup waiting like a block or two away..."" 

""And she'll think she has a chance if it's just me there! Kid, that's actually a good idea!"" he exclaimed. He helped me into a wheelchair and took me to his squad car, loading me in and watching his back like he was the one being followed. Once I was strapped in, he entered his seat and we started driving. I arched back, watching the hospital fade away as a nurse stepped outside to see me off.

It wasn't a nurse though. It was my mom in a nurses outfit. She'd been in there. I was wrong. She was going to finish the job in there herself. I cried. I lost it, unable to keep it in anymore, and explained through sobs what I saw.

He shook his head, unable to believe it. ""Don't worry kid. I offered my service to this career to help people like you- Innocents. It'll end soon, and you'll be okay"" he tried soothing me, I know, but it did little to help. She almost had me. She knows where I'm going- I can feel it. It's about to end. I feel scared. I feel like you're the only ones I can talk to. None of my friends have contacted me, and this officer... 

He's great and all, don't get me wrong. Nice, down to earth, and genuinely wants to help. But he took me upstairs and put me in my room, and has been watching out since. The police agree that staking out the house would scare her away, and we need her captured fast. Hughes will be staying in my house with me, sleeping during the day while they have a squad car parked outside, and an officer who comes in to check up every five minutes. Hughes stakes out at night in my moms old room. I'll have no time to talk to him, to take the load off my mind. But it's coming to an end soon. I can feel it.

Please be with me Nosleep. I need you.","I Love You, Mom (Part 2)",41
IrishSurfer,2,13,1qscwt,33,"On June 4th, 1983, my high school was one of many that took us to Disneyland for Grad Night. If you’ve ever been to Disneyland on Grad Night, you know how much fun – and how crazy – it can be. The park stays open extra late, the skippers who drive the Jungle Cruise boats let loose and tell dirty jokes, and there’s plenty of opportunities for people to sneak booze and weed in. Getting a bunch of amped high schoolers in Disneyland is one thing, but with a nightlife and party atmosphere behind it, things can get pretty nuts.

My two friends and I, Anaheim locals, were particularly excited. We all loved Disneyland, and while we didn’t get to visit often, living practically in the park’s backyard gave us more opportunities than most. In addition, we hadn’t been since the new Fantasyland opened earlier that year, going from a sort of Medieval fairground into a storybook village, so I was kind of looking forward to that. Unlike a lot of people who were there, we intended to keep things clean and have a grand old time of it, hit as many rides as possible, and just revel.

But the big plan for the night was kind of ambitious and maybe a little reckless – to this day, I can’t remember who suggested it first, only that we all thought it was a great idea. We had already gotten into the park and gone on a number of rides when it was brought up, while we were sitting on a bench in Frontierland eating churros. From where we sat, we could look across the Rivers of America to Tom Sawyer Island, and past that where the river curved to New Orleans Square. Poking above the trees was the cupola of the Haunted Mansion, with its clipper ship weather-vane. The sun had just gone down, and the sky was awash with dull orange and purple clouds, most of which seemed to loom behind the cupola. I pointed out how perfect and spooky the whole thing looked, and that got us talking about it. The mansion was a collective favorite, and being dumb kids, we agreed to do a little exploring: to effectively “spend the night” in the Haunted Mansion.

We laughed about as we got in line for it, moving past the brick columns and up the walk toward the mansion, but inside I was a bit nervous. You have to understand security was a bit more lax back then, so it was plausible that we would be able to pull this off if we were careful. Plus, Grad Night always had kids getting into trouble, and the likelihood of us getting banned for good was not as high as it could have been. But I still felt tense, that feeling you get when you’re scared about going on a thrill ride for the first time, excited but hesitant.

The three of us – Mike, Karen and myself – had it all worked out: when you first enter the mansion, you’re escorted into a room that seems to stretch and warp before your eyes, which is actually an elevator that takes guests below ground, where a hallway connects to the ride building beyond the park’s berm. As everyone else crowded out of the room and into the Hall of Morphing Portraits, we lagged behind (which the disembodied voice of the Ghost Host jokingly warns you not to do) and fell in at the very back of the line. By the time we piled into our “Doombuggy,” there was no one else behind us, and the black, endless procession of clamshell-like cars were empty.

We went through the ride as normal, cracking jokes and making banter at all the old familiar scenes, until we reached the exit crypt. We stepped out onto the moving platform and walked toward the escalator ramp that leads from the crypt back to the park outside. If you don’t know, the escalator hugs the wall on the right, but on the left is a small crypt scene where a tiny, ghostly bride stands on a stone shelf and tells you to “Hurry back…Hurry back…” Mike took charge here, deliberately turning backwards as we went up to watch the cast member near the buggies below us. Mike’s a big, broad-shouldered guy, a football player through-and-through, and his bulk hid me and Karen from view as we slowly ascended. At his signal, when the cast member monitoring the exit had his back turned, Karen and I climbed over the rail and dropped down into the crypt scene, where we quickly scurried under the dusty space beneath the escalator. Mike was over a moment later, and we laughed and congratulated each other on a job well done.

We must have spent a good hour or so down there, giggling into our hands whenever we heard footsteps and voices overhead of unsuspecting people exiting the ride. Karen even had some snacks she’d brought with her, and we sat there in the dark and ate and whispered to each other. It was like being in a weird clubhouse, and it felt good that we three shared this delinquency together, even as the narration of the ghost bride looped over and over again in the background: “Hurry back…Hurry back…Be sure to bring your death certificate. If you decide to join us, make final arrangements now. We’ve been…dying to have you.”

Eventually the novelty wore off, and we got quiet, and then listless. Sure, we’d managed this much, but then what? Karen pointed out that it had been eerily silent for awhile – other than the monotonous speech of the bride and other spooky ambient sounds, there were no more people coming up the ramp. Mike said he thought maybe the park had closed, but that made no sense because it was open all night on Grad Night. Not wanting to get in trouble, but also wondering what was up, I volunteered to clamber back up and take a look. When I did, using some of the crypt scenery for hand and footholds, I saw that there was no one around, not even a cast member down at the unloading platform at the end.

When I reported this, Mike and Karen climbed back up as well, and we went back down the unloading station to look around. All the Doombuggies coming along the corridor were empty, and there was not a person in sight. It was odd, to say the least, and I felt like something was definitely off to have the place so empty. I was about to suggest turning around and heading back outside when Mike said he’d always wondered where the Doombuggies went after they dropped you off. They rounded a dark corner in the crypt area and vanished from sight, and Mike was curious what was down there.

Now really, I should have said no, that there was no point and that we could get into some serious trouble if we snooped around back there. It was probably just a utility corridor anyway, since the buggies just looped back around to the loading room anyway. But I was young, and I was stupid, and when presented with a golden opportunity like that, it was hard to pass it up.

So we went ahead and jumped into a Doombuggy going by, and it slowly rounded the corner into the darkness. This was uncharted territory for us, and even if it turned out to be boring back there, at the very least we’d get a chance to see it, and maybe get another ride out of it.

Hardly a day goes by where I regret not having said something.

The main thing I remember was how spartan it was. It wasn’t quite pitch black, but it was even gloomier in there than the rest of the ride. There were small lights set into the walls on either side of the track, but they were low to the ground and far between. The walls were painted black, and the corridor seemed so narrow that I felt boxed in. It was quiet too, other than the hum of the track moving the buggies. I felt tense, and Mike and Karen weren’t helping that, because they looked tense too; I think it was dawning on all of us how much trouble we might get in.

I think a minute or so had passed like this, us going down that dark, featureless backstage corridor, when the ride suddenly stopped and I nearly jumped out of my skin as a voice came from somewhere overhead – and laughed when I realized I’d been startled by the normal breakdown spiel. “Playful spooks have interrupted our tour,” the recording went. “Please remain seated in your Doombuggy. We will proceed in just a moment.”

The teasing was immediate, as we all pointed out to each other how we’d jumped. We waited for the ride to start again, and every thirty seconds or so, the spiel would play: “We have been unappointedly detained by prankish spirits. Kindly remain seated in your Doombuggy. We will continue our tour momentarily.” This went on for good long while – ten, maybe fifteen minutes – and still the buggies hadn’t moved, no one had come looking for us. We were getting antsy, and the silence between the announcements was becoming unsettling.

Then Karen leaned out a bit and looked around, and she noticed the door first. Just ahead, past the buggy in front of us, worklights revealed a little alcove and a utility door on the right-hand side of the corridor. We were so sick of being in the buggy by that point we were willing to try anything, so after a short discussion, we all squeezed out of the buggy, pressed against the wall to go past the next one – Mike had trouble here – and stood before the door. I pushed it open, finding it unlocked, and it led to a metal staircase leading down into the darkness, footlights like the ones in the corridor revealing where to go. I was thinking up excuses in my head as we went down the stairs, to explain why were likely stepping into Disney’s underground utility corridors – the infamous “Utilidors” said to run like a spiderweb beneath Disneyland – if someone found us. And by this point, I hoped someone did.

At the bottom of the stairs, another closed door with a sign on it, reading “Cast Members Only.” We pushed through that as well, and were legitimately surprised to see that it opened into what looked like a themed hallway. Disney, even backstage, seemed to be paying attention to style, as this hall sported the purple “demon wallpaper” and wainscoting of the rooms above. It was even lit by candle sconces on the walls, the fake flickering bulbs coated with cobwebs and dust. Several detailed wooden doors lined the hall, with out-of-place white placards mounted to them. Each was marked as a Prop Room, with a corresponding number.

As we made our way up the hall, we tried each door we came to and found them all locked. The first door, Prop Room 1, shook a bit but wouldn’t budge. Same with 2 and 3. Mike chuckled and said he wondered if we would find Walt Disney’s frozen head down here, but I could hear a nervous waver in his laugh. Even I was feeling some sense of dread with each door we tried, something hard to place but nagging. At Door 4, I put my ear to the edge of it and thought I heard what sounded like rushing water or faint TV static from the other side, and at 5 I noticed that the faux candles flanking it were flickering more sporadically than the rest, like they were faulty. Door 6, to left and near another plain utility door that marked the hall’s end, was the only one that yielded to us, and I was the one who turned the cold handle and opened it for the first time.

It’s difficult for me to describe what I saw in there without shuddering, because even now my telling makes it sound fairly normal… That is, as normal as a room hidden under a theme park attraction can possibly be. It wasn’t very big, almost like a large storage shed. Unlike the hall, this one was the bland utility black, and lit by a single fluorescent light in the ceiling, albeit a dim one. The walls were lined with metal cabinets, and there was some sort of large, archaic gadget shoved into one corner, not unlike the old computer banks from the 60s. But what caught my attention right away was the grinning figure near the far wall, across from the door – a dummy or animatronic of some sort, lifeless and unmoving but standing on its base.

The discovery was fascinating to all of us, and without thinking we all edged into the room and immediately approached the figure. It was clearly meant to be one of the ghosts in the ride, a specter in a top hat with a skull-like face, cartoony bulging eyes and a leering smile; one of the teeth was even painted gold. He stood in a bow-legged stance, one gnarled hand holding a cane and the other a hatbox. None of us had ever seen this particular character on the ride before, though Karen said its face looked a lot like the tall, skinny hitchhiking ghost from the end of the ride.

I was just turning away from the figure to look at the cabinets when there was a combustion roar from the hall outside, like the sound of a passing motorcycle, followed by a loud, bassy boom that made the floor shake. The door to the room swung shut, and the fluorescent light sputtered and went out, leaving us in total darkness. Mike gasped and Karen screamed, and I was just reaching out for them in the dark when I heard a peculiar whirring sound. Another light came on, this one a concentrated green light above the hatbox ghost, showing its skeleton smile for a moment before that light faded and another faded on, illuminating the hatbox. I could see through the material of the hatbox now, and saw the ghost’s head grinning at me from inside. The pattern repeated itself rhythmically, making it seem like the ghost’s head was disappearing from his shoulders and appearing in the hatbox. It wasn’t a terribly convincing effect, but in the dark and with the strange things going on around me, it genuinely scared me.

I turned and stumbled through the room, ready to get out of there, feeling around for the door. Now even the light on the ghost shut off, and I heard Karen and Mike’s feet behind me, a crash, and the sound of something solid tapping the concrete floor. I tried pushing the door open, but it wouldn’t budge, and somebody slammed into my back in the dark and caused me to hit it hard. I was dazed but unhurt, and another scream from Karen fueled my adrenaline even more. I instead gave the door a tug and it opened.

I was out in the hall without a second thought, without even looking back. I started running, sprinting back the way I had come, gasping for air. I was never a very athletic kid, but panic kept me going. I heard sounds behind me – footsteps, Mike and Karen yelling in terror as they followed, and what seemed like rapid knocking and banging on the doors around me – but I refused to look over my shoulder. Up the stairs and back into the Doombuggy corridor in what felt like a matter of seconds. The Doombuggies were moving now, endlessly traveling through the shadows. I knew it was risky to jump into one in this narrow corridor, and for a moment I stopped, trying to figure out what to do.

I finally looked back, back down the stairway I had come from. I thought Mike and Karen had been right behind me, but they were gone. I called out their names, my voice echoing down the stairs, but there was no reply. Not until I heard something tapping the metal stairs, coming up toward the door, and saw an unfamiliar vague shadow on the wall that I flung the door closed and dove into the nearest buggy, which carried me down the corridor a little ways before finally emerging into the limbo-like loading room.

All of the effects were still running here, including the eerie music and sounds, but there was still no one else around. I yelled for help, but no one appeared. As soon as I could I jumped out of the Doombuggy and ran back up the line, into the Hall of Morphing Portraits. Ahead was the door to the elevator, the Stretching Gallery, but I remembered that this area had a more immediate chicken exit, meant for those too scared to ride the ride and wanted to head back up to the park. The door was marked with an obvious exit sign, sitting between two shuttered windows that made it look like it led outside to a stormy night, and without hesitating I pushed through that as well.

Beyond was another corridor, on either side of me flashing lights pointed at the windows to simulate lightning, flickering with each thunderclap that boomed through the hall, disorienting me even further. Turning left, I followed the hall as the floor inclined gently up, my throat tight and a stitch in my side.

And then my throat closed altogether as I turned a corner almost ran into the hatbox ghost.

It was standing smack-dab in the middle of the hall, between me and the door that led outside. I scrambled backward instinctively, but the figure didn’t move. It was a static prop, grinning its cadaver grin, back-lit by a ceiling light further down the hall. The light also broke the illusion of the hatbox, and I could see vaguely the shape of the disembodied head through the scrim.

I was convinced – thoroughly convinced at that moment – that thing was going to suddenly jerk to life and come after me, but it didn’t. I had no idea how it had gotten there from down in the sub-level, or how it had so quickly. Maybe the one I’d seen below wasn’t the only figure; maybe Mike and Karen were pulling a fast one on me, and had dragged the figure up with them. I was frozen, trying to figure out where to go next, not wanting to go anywhere near the ghost but not wanting to backtrack either, because I still felt like there was something sinister behind me. Nervously, I croaked out the names of my lost friends, but there was no reply. Noises from the ride seemed to come floating down the hall, muted but ever-present.

Then I heard the groan.

It could have been a human groan, or something mechanical, but I definitely heard it. It didn’t sound like any of the standard audio, and it came from a point somewhere near or past the hatbox ghost, maybe even from further down the corridor past the exit. As if this were a trigger, I realized that either my eyes had adjusted to the dark or the lighting had somehow changed, because I looked again at the hatbox and saw the thing inside through the scrim.

There was still a head in there, but I know it wasn’t the ghost’s head. It wasn’t even a cartoon caricature of a head. It wasn’t Mike, or Karen.

It’s at this point the details allude me. I know that what I saw shook me to my very core, and that’s part of the reason its taken me so long to recount this. I remember seeing the thing in the box, seeing that it was indeed a human head – a man’s face, a face I didn’t recognize, seemingly looking back out at me with shocked, pleading eyes – but after that there’s a blur of sheer terror and snatches of frightening images: gnarled hands; tombstones; pneumatic hissing; the stretching room going in reverse, shrinking, shrinking too fast, the ceiling rushing toward me, the corpse hanging in the rafters descending on me…

I try not to dwell on them too much, because now I’m no longer sure which really happened and which were the results of the nightmares I’d have for years after.

The next thing I can remember clearly after that is being on my hands and knees just outside the fence of the Haunted Mansion, vomiting onto the pavement, while around me crowds of people stood. Most of them weren’t paying me any mind, there was lots of whispered talk and a few were crying. There were red-and-blue lights, police cars parked nearby, but I couldn’t tell why. I just sat there gulping and sobbing until a cast member finally noticed me and led me to a first aid station.

Karen was there when I arrived, and she jumped up and hugged me tight when she saw me. I don’t think either of us made much sense, we were both at our wit’s end, but it was such a relief to see her after all that that any questions I had fell by the wayside. I’ll never forget how haunted she looked, wide-eyed and pale, barely able to form a sentence without tearing up.

Mike never turned up.

—

That fateful night has never left me, and in the years since then I’ve slowly begun to piece together the details, trying to (vainly) make sense of what happened. It became sort of a private obsession, something to do in the background as I moved on with my life.

First, it didn’t take long for Karen and I to learn why the police cars were there, and they weren’t for us. According to the reports we heard later, an 18-year-old guy from New Mexico had died while we were in the Haunted Mansion. He and a friend had snuck into a backstage area on Tom Sawyer’s Island and stole a rubber emergency boat to go for a joyride around the Rivers of America. Apparently this guy was pretty drunk and it wasn’t long before he hit a rock, throwing he and his friend from the boat. His friend went for help, but he drowned before they could find him. His body was discovered an hour later.

I wonder now if that’s why there was no one around when we crept backstage. I managed to track down a few cast members who were working that night, and though most of them claim that they were told by management to not cause alarm and keep to their posts, several admitted they had gone to check out the grim spectacle… especially those CMs that were on attractions near the river, like the Haunted Mansion. Was the timing such that everyone turned a blind eye while we stumbled into something hideous?

Mike’s disappearance was something me and Karen both felt deeply, and we tried for years to get something from anyone about it. His parents told us later that he’d shown up again a day or so later, behaving erratically, barely registering them, deeply disturbed by something. Mike had planned on moving out beforehand, but that night after lashing out at his folks, he grabbed very few personally belongings, took the family car and drove off to points unknown. After that, he dropped off the face of the earth.

Karen and I eventually drifted, probably because we blamed each other for what happened. She never expressed to me what she experienced after we got separated, either because she wanted me to feel guilty for leaving them behind (oh Karen, you have no idea) or that she, like me, can only recall so much. We were both too shaken to recount to each other. But time and distance make things easier, and with the advent of the internet there was suddenly a wealth of new information. I’ve since begun to piece together clues.

Almost immediately I found our Hatbox Ghost. Plugging that into any search engine will turn up multitudes of pictures of that bow-legged, grinning figure that has often floated through my mind’s eye in the dark. It was apparently part of the attraction when it first opened in 1969, and much of the promotional material of the ride at the time featured this character and his ubiquitous hatbox. He originally stood in the attic scene, right across from the ghostly bride with the beating heart, but was quietly removed from the ride after only a week; apparently, the effect of his disappearing head never worked properly, or so the official account goes.

In recent years the Hatbox Ghost has gained a fanbase, groups of Haunted Mansion fans that want to see him restored to the ride. It’s wishful thinking, I’m sure, because that figure had to have been stored downstairs for a reason.

It took longer to find out about the backstage area where the Doombuggies go, that empty corridor not originally meant to be seen by guests; disabled guests, however, travel that route all the time. Wheelchair access to the ride is done through the Limbo-like loading room, and guests travel back around to this room to reclaim their wheelchairs and head back out. I’ve posted about it and posed queries for details about that area, but no one has given me a description that sounds anything like what I went through. It’s been described as short, bland, and with some sort of catwalk going over the track, but no mysterious alcove or obvious doorway. It takes less than 30 seconds for the Doombuggies to go through, and then you’re back in the loading room. I suspect Disney might have changed that area since ht 80s, but why?

Most recently though, I’ve come across an odd factoid that seems more like a morbid curiosity than anything else, unless one’s been through what I have. It’s not about the Haunted Mansion, however, but its nearby E-ticket neighbor, Pirates of the Caribbean. According to the story – and this has been published in various Disney-owned books, so its no vague rumor – the Imagineers who built the ride felt that the faux skeletons of the time weren’t convincing enough for the underground grotto scenes. So they borrowed real human remains from the UCLA Medical Center, dressed them up as pirates, and put them in the caves. Let that sink in for a moment: millions of people went by on boats and had no idea they were looking at real skeletons, all propped up in pirate garb. Eventually, a later team of Imagineers would replace these with more convincing facsimiles, and supposedly the bones were returned to their countries of origin and given proper burial.

But whose to say they were? What if something was left behind in that basement when the bones were taken? And what if Pirates wasn’t the only ride that did this? The show building of the Haunted Mansion was built along with the rest of New Orleans Square in 1963, but it took another six years for the actual attraction to open. Why the delay? It couldn’t have just been the gridlock from the 1964 World’s Fair and Walt Disney’s death in ’66, could it?

All of this is speculation, a string of understanding that raises more questions for me than it does answers. I want to get to the truth of what happened that night, but everything I’ve found doesn’t add up to a concrete explanation; perhaps there isn’t one, though I desperately want there to be. And I can’t go back – I won’t – not after the things I saw and felt. I haven’t set foot in Disneyland since that night.

Maybe, though… Maybe its time I tried again.

Karen, if you’re out there and you’re reading this, I’m sorry about everything. I’m trying to make it right, trying to put some meaning to this. Contact me if you can. I need to know what happened to you and Mike – maybe you have the key to the mystery in your memories. I can’t do it alone, but together we might get to the bottom of this.

For everyone else, let this stand as a testament: some things are backstage for a reason, and a company like Disney must have a multitude of skeletons in its closets. Think twice before you pull some stupid stunt like I did, because it might not be security that finds you.

koolgirl34,15,20,1qufp4,26,"For those that don't know, Canadian woods can get a bit... creepy during winter months.  
Anyway, my grandparents own a farm outside of a *very* small town. We only had some horses and ducks, but my 9-year-old self thought it was pretty cool. There was a field, with the main house in it, a driveway up a small hill, leading to my grandpa's garage. Just beside the driveway, many meters, is the barn, the barnyard, and the 2 fields behind them down the other side of the small hill. The rest of the property is woods that me and my cousins used to explore.  
Now onto the story in question, it was the middle of the night, and I was having trouble sleeping. Which was odd, because I normally slept well especially at their house. The guest room door was just open a crack, to let the hallway light illuminate the room just a tad. I was never afraid of the dark, however I was terrified of the idea of someone watching me sleep without my knowledge. The bed was parallel to the window, so I could see the stars when the blind was down. I sat there, telling myself to sleep, and eventually I did, but I just couldn't force myself to, at the moment. I have a sudden urge to look out the window into the field, even though I could already see the outside sky. I sit up, leaving the warmth and comfort of the blankets. A light snow is falling, and the beautiful Milky Way lights up the field almost like day. I admire the beauty of the snowy field and woods, until I notice a shadowy figure crossing the field towards the road, staying along the treeline. At first, I dismissed it as a animal, we saw animals a **lot**, then I noticed the way it walked. It was eerily *human*.  
It may only be a hunter, I told myself, as we've had hunters trespassing on our property before, and I could see tracks behind it that *looked* human, but something was different. It was almost like it sucked the light out of the air. It looked like it *was* a shadow. Thats when it turns, but I can't see if its towards or away from me. The hallway light flickers and goes out. Leaving only the ominous Milky Way looming over the earth to light the room, I lay down  and decide I'm imagining it. The hallway light can wait until morning, plus I don't think my grandparents would be very happy if I woke them up at 1 a.m. to change a silly light bulb.  
As I finally feel myself slipping from the hands of reality, I feel a breath on my face, a small ""shhhh"" and hands locking around my neck, and I fall into the void of unconsciousness.  
I woke up with bruises on my neck. To this day I don't sleep with the blinds open.  
I also have many other stories involving that property, that I may post in the near future.  

Edit: I remember a whisper. That may have been my imagination though.   
Edit 2: The tracks. There was tracks behind it but they were gone by morning from the snowfall.

sgtatarms123,1,13,1r20rb,29,"I have been getting singular phantom door bell rings at my house, that only i am able to hear, my mum and dad don't hear anything.

The first instance was about 5 months ago, i heard a singular door bell ring at 7am, it woke me up, and i didn't think much of it. Later that day i asked my mother if she heard anything and she said no you're dreaming.

Now im not a crazy person, i am probably the most sane person you would ever meet, in addition i don't do drugs, or drink

So i don't think much about it, thinking my parents their old im young, young people have better hearing than old people.

But this keeps happening around the same time 7am, and im thinking who the heck is this, is this some joke is this the delivery man?

No it wouldn't be a delivery this early ever

Whenever im home alone i have the habbit of whenever the door bell rings i don't answer it, so it was about 4pm one day and a singular door bell ring happens, i tip toe and peek out the front window, i wasn't very fast so i saw nothing, and it never rung again.

A month later, its about 6pm, singular door bell ring, im there in 20seconds, nothing, front gate not moving, again me alone in the house.

Am i imagining all this? there is no way i am not crazy

Coincidence or not, a few days later my mum is in the house, the door rings, my mum answers, its my elderly neighbour.

So i think to myself so it was her all along, all those times i never answered the door it was her, even the times at 7am, shes old ok old people wake up early... ok case closed right.

Today

4:53am singular door bell ring, wakes me up from my sleep, i am not freaking crazy, you know how a door bell sounds, its long it lasts about 3 seconds, i am awake and i can hear the second half of the ring all around my house

I go back to sleep because i was tired, then it rings again at 7am... i tell my mum when i wake up says she didn't hear anything

Heres the good part my dad thinks im crazy too so bought some cctv security cameras and has installed one at our front porch

Today I rewinded the tape to 6:45am, 

I see two lumps laying vertically on our front porch, it is two people in sleeping bags

Skip forward to 6:55am

They get up, I see two men one wears a long brown coat and a black hat, he is big and fat but i couldn't see his face, the other guy is thin and small, he was wearing grey sweat pants and a grey sweater...

Him i saw, his face was skinny and pale almost half skeleton he has yellow rotten teeth

7:00am

I see him ringing our door bell then go back to sleep in his sleeping bag same with big fat guy, they zip themselves up before you could see their heads but here they zip themselves all the way up, and inch away like caterpillars, out of camera view (this took 3mins)

WTF - was this their sick way of saying thankyou for your hospitality 

(I rewinded the tape further they came at 3:09am and started sleeping on our front porch)

I think the ring at 4:53am meant the time they showed, i might have been in deep sleep the other times idk. I also think they hop our fence, I told my dad to put a camera there too, called cops shown them this, there's a patrol car outside our house right now. 

Nobody thinks im crazy now",Phantom Door Bell,42
slivr33,9,11,1qtewa,28,"a little groggy from the beer a few hours earlier, a little stoned, no worse for wear though.  In any condition I was good to drive.  I didn't even remember the woman's name who's apartment I had just slinked out of at 4:30am.  It didn't matter anyways, I just wanted to sleep in my own bed.  I pulled up the drive as I had any other night, parked the car in the same spot as any other night.  Something *felt* different this night though.  Maybe cause I hadn't smoked or gotten laid in a while, maybe cause my guard was down just a little bit more than usual. 

I stepped up to the door, reached into my pocket for the keys. I thought I heard something as the keys made a light clatter while coming out of my pocket.  You know, one of those faint sounds where you're probably just hearing things, where it's probably just the wind going throw some tree branches or something like that.  It was dark and I was feeling lucky so I picked one of the four keys and tried it and as I did I heard it again.. was it calling my name? I fumbled as I hesitated while attempting to grab another key and I heard it this time.. it sounded like it was coming from inside ^^""help!"" it was distant but it was urgent.  I thought it could be my roommate, it sounded like his voice, ""Mike?!"" I said as I fumbled through my keys then hastily decided the moonlight wasn't bright enough. I had to use the light from my phone.  ^^""Hello? ^^Helpp,"" once again was called out but I couldn't tell if it was from afar or from within my house, or even if it was Mike saying it.  The voice was so unusually muffled.  

I was still shuffling through the keys, finally under the light of my phone as I urgently said ""Hang on! I'm coming."" I finally grabbed the house key as I heard it again, this time it was incomprehensible, yet still, I could not pin where it was coming from.  I unlocked the door and barged in, and immediately called out to Mike, beckoning for a response; ""Mike? Hello? Mike?!""  No answer.  I stood there waiting, for what I don't know, anything.  Silence.

Distraught, I went back outside to see if the voice was actually coming from out there. My phone is dying, 4%.. whatever I'm at my house anyways, I can use it to see in the dark if I need it.  I called out ""Hello?"" loud enough so that it could be heard, but not too loud to wake up the neighbors at 4:45am.  Nothing.  A chill of realization goes up my spine as I discern that it has to be be one of two things, I'm crazy and hearing things, or there's something there.  Maybe it was the wind, maybe I was just zoning out and imagining things.  My pride wouldn't let me believe it, no, I thought, I just made a scene in the middle of the night, I *heard something*.    I irrationally recalled how I had joked with Mike about our house being haunted after watching The Amityville Horror with him a few nights prior.  ""Stop scaring yourself,"" I thought, ""that has nothing to do with anything.""

I walked as slowly and quietly as I could throughout the house first.  I didn't dare flip the light-switches for reasons unbeknownst to me.  So I used my phone as a flashlight, in hindsight this wasn't a bright idea.  I didn't realize I still had my keys gripped tightly in my hand until I got to the den.  ^""Mike?"" I whispered with doubt in my voice.  No response.  There was but a ember or two glinting in the fireplace, and his car was in the driveway, so he must've gone to bed a little over an hour ago.  I didn't bother checking his room, I now knew the voice wasn't his. He was asleep and I didn't want to wake him.

It *had* to have been from outside.  I felt as if I was going crazy, but I **needed** to find out what had happened.  3%, fuckin battery always dies when I need it.  I shined the light into Mike's car half-expecting to see something that I don't wanna see.  The muffled voice, it would only make sense.  To my relief and dismay, nothing was in there other than the ordinary debris.  I walked around to one side house, Mike's bathroom light is on, this is ordinary though so I trudged back the way I came.  1%?! C'mon, it's been like 2 minutes. I called out one last time with hope in my voice-a little louder too, ""Hello?!"" Fuck the neighbors, I wanna know what's going on.  I walked around the other side of the house shining my phone left and right methodically at an almost frantic pace.  

I stopped.  There I stood, looking into the darkness of my house through the window, my phone pointed at the ground.  I'm genuinely scared to bring the light to it, I don't know why.. it was just like any other night.  As I raised my phone to peer inside seemingly irrational fear struck me like a ton of fucking bats flying within my chest trying to get out.  I slowly raised the phone... from the ground up.. I saw nothing until... until I got to eye level.  There they were, staring right back at me, then GONE in an instant.  I shined my phone around, ""what the fuck was that?! Did that just happen?"" I thought out loud.  Then and there, right at that very moment, my phone died.","So there I was, driving home from a night out",39
lifecmcs,2,14,1qynx5,24,"When I was 9 years old, we moved into a new apartment. It was a great deal for my parents and I could remember them being so excited to move there. It was across Torrance, CA in a Redondo Beach, next to the ocean, though we still had to go 4 or 5 miles to get to the beach and couldn't see it from the apartment. It was me, my younger sister (4 years younger), my dad, and my mom. The apartment was also very big, with a stairs (important detail) leading up directly from the front door. The only thing that was a bit off was the fact that we were allowed to get the house for almost a 75% discount. I was later to find out that the previous owners had left 'all of a sudden' and only told the owners of the apartment to lease the place. Nothing really happened for a few days, only the anxiety of going to a new school, living in a new house, etc.

Prior to that move, I had had no cable tv. For some reason, my parents decided to get a plasma flatscreen and I became instantly hooked. I was watching Spongebob Squarepants, Jimmy Neutron, etc. I was a TV addict. Plus the fact that I had almost no friends at school at the time contributed to me watching TV more. Then, one day, I met Jacob. Jacob told me that he loved Star Wars and, as much as two fourth grader could, we became best friends. We would hang out all the time, play-acting star wars. Then, one day, he asked me if I was Christian. It was out of the blue. I told him that I went to church, but I wasn't too convinced. Then he told me his dad had told him that God would die. Then, he gave a 'prayer' to 'Lucifer' who I didn't know. Then that was when the wierd shit hit the fan.

My mother miscarried my younger sibling. Even now the though that I would have a younger brother/sister is still haunting to me. Then, she would have bouts of nightmares where she would scream in the middle of the night, scaring me and my little sister. Then, my dad started having nightmares as well. He told me that he heard a horse galloping outside, the hooves of the horse hitting the pavement. The thing is, the last times that had happened, his father and grandmother had died. This happened three times in a row. Turns out, one of our aunts in Korea had just passed away.

Meanwhile, nothing was really happening to me. Then, one Friday night, I was at home watching TV. There was 'Church Service' that day but I was at home watching TV. Now, the thing is, the living room is right next to the front door. So, if you enter the house, you immediately see a staircase and, to your right, you would see the living room. i was in the living room watching TV, facing the side of the staircase, next to the door. 

I saw my basketball roll down and bounce down the stairs. I ran to get it, looked up and saw my sister standing at the head of the stairs. I yelled at her for playing with my ball, then threw it back at her. Then I went back to the couch and watched Drake and Josh. However, because my mind was so addled with the hilariousness of Nickleodeon Comedy, I failed to realize that my sister was with my parents at church, and there was someone else upstairs. When I realized this, I ran out of the apartment as fast as my legs could carry me. But then I locked myself out and got sick cause it was cold and was grounded for a week. But, still, to this day, I don't know who the fuck or what the fuck that girl was.",Happened to Me.,38
BumpinRapTapes,10,7,1r0hla,26,"So I got a call from a telemarketer, nothing weird about that really.  But before I hung up the automated voice started spitting out stuff like my address, age, stuff like that.  And then my social security number.  Then a list of my room mates.  And then I was concerned.  I waited until the machine stopped, expecting some numbers to press for more info or whatever so I could find out what's up and get myself off their call list.  All the lady robot said though was ""The Intermed company thanks you.""

Reasonably concerned I started doing some research, after ignoring a bunch of message board sites  I finally found what I think was the Intermed site (in like the fifth page of results).  This is all it said:

""Intermed is at the forefront of the organ trade market and thought processing innovations.  All our services are backed with industry leading research and proven by numerous customer testimonials.  Many of our customers are satisfied to the point of frequent return, and we pride ourselves in maintaining our client pool.  Products and services offered by our company are backed with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime maintenance, all available with a phone call.  Hereditary conditions of the mind and body are often the only thing holding you back from reaching your full potential.

Never again will the flaws of your fathers keep you from the life you deserve.  Even the best and brightest are far from perfect, and we strive everyday to make you, the perfect human being.""

Nothing else.  White page, black text.  That's it.  I decided to backtrack to the message boards to see what I could find.  This led me to some random sites and eventually I found a few message threads of people sharing stories similar to mine.  A weird robot caller with way too much information.  One guy got the call in the wee hours of the morning and totally laid a boner kill on a sweaty night with his lady.  They all seemed to be on the same hunt I was, except for one username that I saw pop up on a few of the sites, he called himself ASimpleCipher.  All this dude did was sing Intermed's praises, how he and his friends had used their ""products and services to tremendous avail"" and ""would recommend to anyone!""  All very cheesy and all seemingly marketing plants.  Since that was my best lead I decided to make an account on one of the thread sites and try and get in contact with him.

I sent him a rather aggressive message, which may've been a mistake looking back.  But regardless, and unsurprisingly, I got no response.  I decided if worse came to worse I'd just deal with it when it came up.  I put the whole thing in the back of my mind.  For a few months.

Then ASimpleCipher responded.  Here's a copy and paste of our correspondence:

[Me]  Hey man it's really obvious you work for intermed, you're not fooling anyone.  I want to know who you are, what intermed is and how you got so much of my information.  And I want MY private information deleted from your database, and I want off your call list.  Immediately.  I will not hesitate to get a lawyer involved if this goes any further.

[ASimpleCipher]   I appreciate your interest in my company, Ben!  As always, customer care is a top goal at Intermed.  My representatives tell me that based on market research, you would be a prime candidate for our products and services.  As a courtesy, we like to know as much as we can about potential customers, so as to provide the best quality care possible.  Like you, I once felt a terrible weight in my life, one that rendered me incapable of reaching my full potential as a human being.  When doctors could not help me mend the flaws given to me by generations past, I took matters into my own hands.  As it came to pass, that effort is what gave way to this current business venture.  You may hesitate at terminology like ""Thought Processing"" and ""Organ Trade"", but let me assure you the danger begins and ends at the television screen.  So, if I may, I'd like to draw some common ground between yourself and I.  We do share many similarities.  As a young man, I was plagued with severe asthma (like yourself) from my mother's side of the family, leaving me unable to compete physically with my peers.  This lead me to more intellectual endeavors as I began to mature into an adult.  Cruel as fate is however, I soon discovered I'd inherited a more severe form of my grandfathers autism.  His genes riddled me with social anxiety, and I was thus outcast from much of any community I was ever a member of.  In spite of my flawed genetics I was only more driven to clear the blemishes of my being.  Nothing, I vowed, would hinder my quest for perfection... of the perfect human being.  Given to me from my lineage, however, was the savvy and cunning of generations of businessmen.  

Years, centuries it seems, passed while I honed my craft and built my empire.  Once one is outcast from society, one develops a strong callous to sympathy.  Under a mutual agreement of confidentiality between you and I, I will admit to using almost every associate of mine as merely a means to my own end.  Well, that end is Intermed.  Intermed is my true brainchild, as it were.  I will also admit to misleading you a bit, giving the facade of a full staff under my employ.  Let me assure you I am fully capable of operating this venture on my own.  Let me also assure you your personal information is safe and sound, as I said, I only aim to ensure the best service possible.  Never miss a detail is a creed I operate under.

Enough business however!  Even a jaded outcast such as me has need for camaraderie!  During my time working in the shipping industry I found myself in Northern California in the early 1960's.  My business associate at the time was a rather unstable man.  Every bit of his free time, it seemed he would study the art of coded language, ciphers, cryptograms... whatever one may call them.  Strangely, he got me very interested in the art and it has since become a favorite hobby of mine.  Of course his were much more complex than anything I cared to attempt, he was also versed in astrology and loved to incorporate knowledge of the stars into his little puzzles (This earned him quite the sinister reputation after we parted ways).  On the other hand, I preferred to leave little clues here and there, woven into my business dealings.  Now imagine what fun it would be if someone figured out my little puzzles!  All that work of building a persona of mystery!  Unravelled by a thread I'd left loose for some cunning soul to pull!  Really, I thought someone would've found it by now.  Even after everyone I've tried to sell Intermed's services and products to it is you, cunning lad, who has finally made contact.  Very clever, indeed.  Of course you saw my companies website.  I admit it is a bit sparse, a work in progress.  Reducing my mission for Intermed to a single paragraph however, I did put in a bit of extra effort.

I have been rambling though, I do apologize!  Thank you for inquiring about my company, I hope my response has eased any concerns you may have.

-Intermed-

I really don't know what to make of this guy.  It really can't be some prank, the guy knew I had asthma as a kid.  How?  I have to say that I've never experienced such an air of creepiness from pure text.  Something about the way he composed his message was off.  I don't know.  I can't make a lot of sense out of any of this.  I stopped my investigation there, being as I have seen too many horror movies and don't like the idea of rabbit holes.  It's been a few months since and I haven't heard anything from Intermed or ASimpleCipher.  I check the thread site every now and then.  I did go back and check out the Intermed website again.  I'm really not one for puzzles, I can't make anything out of it.  So I'm submitting it here to see if someone is more ""cunning"" than me.  I hope so.  Anyway that about wraps it up, sorry for the length, I've been staying in lately as my asthma has been returning so I've kind of been alone with my thoughts.",A Simple Cipher,33

hits it differently. If you hold the eye up and turn it around, the tendons holding onto the 
eye, when pulled, will slowly rip away and create the sweet sound of ripping flesh as the 
eye tears from the tendon. if you follow the tendon, it will eventually lead to the brain. 
But there’s about something the eyes that excites me. I can’t help myself but to collect 
them. Many eyes, blue, green and brown; sometimes, if I get lucky I’ll find a amber one. 
those are my favorite. The last eyes I got were a marvelous bright blue. The woman I 
got them from, was just as beautiful. She had blonde hair and a starfish tattoo on her 
shoulder. Her screams, they were like a symphony of nails on a chalkboard. Her 
gorgeous eyes flicked from side to side, she was terrified. Soon she would be with me 
forever. She screamed and clawed at me when I cut her face, the blood dripping from 
the wound and pooling at the hollow of her neck. They never like me taking their eyes. 
In fact, they don’t like me at all. I ignore them and keep my collection, after all their

unforgiving_cake,3,14,1qx58h,23,"My best friend's older sister is pretty Instafamous.

Caroline has always been fashion-forward and very self-aware. Ever since I've known my best friend we've either admired or resented her sister, with little middle ground. Any time my friend would have sleepovers we'd all listen with our ears pressed against the wall to all of Caroline's multiple hours-long phone calls and listen to her flirting and giggling. This was when she was in *Jr. High*. We hardly ever saw Caroline when she was in high school because she'd always be off with one of her many suitors, or all her friends at some underage club.

Now that Instagram has become a ""thing"" Caroline has bested us all at that, as well. She does the weekday themes, and hashtag-this and hashtag-that. Caroline was big on the leggy shots in a bathtub, or holding a beer up next to her giant sunglasses by a pool, or snapping a quick photo of her half-eaten salad - #*sofull*.

Instagram has become an epidemic. It's everywhere with its shitty filters and the paragraphs of tags. Caroline was no exception to this (truthfully, neither was I, but I'm not as fond of my face as she is), and now she has nearly 5k followers, the majority of them people she's never met, all liking photos of her bellybutton ring and the new bikini she bought.

This past August Caroline moved to New York for an internship. She never calls home, so my friend's family has hardly heard anything from her. If they want to reach Caroline they just log onto Facebook or her Instagram and make sure she's alive. Eventually she'll respond to their missed calls with a short text: call u l8r! xo

Then, sometime in the middle of October, my friend got a call from Caroline early in the morning. It was sometime around 3 AM, she told me, and Caroline sounded frightened. She was telling my friend all about this guy, just some guy she'd met at a book signing she'd gone to, and how he hadn't left her alone for days.

When my best friend called Caroline back the next afternoon she didn't answer, but a few hours later insisted everything was fine through texts, and that she and this guy were going out for dinner that night.

Rolling her eyes, my friend turned her phone to me that night and showed me Caroline's Instagram. It was a photo of two plates and candles in between, and two glasses of red wine - #*classybitch* #*wino* #*Woody*

We both assumed Woody was this creep she'd been referring to. My friend joked he must have had enough cash to sway Caroline's decision and over the next few days there were more photos and more hashtags to come.

Caroline hadn't called my friend back, and, not unsually, she wasn't returning any of their mother's phone calls, either. Still, her Instagram was active with pictures of two pairs of feet propped up on Caroline's coffee table with #*cozy* #*Woody*. Another, the next day, was a picture of a cabin with a long porch surrounded by woods. Caroline's car was parked next to the cabin and it was tagged #*cabininthewoods* #*vacay* #*Woody*.

Nothing was too unusual until my friend and I were browsing at the mall and she showed me a picture of Caroline lying on a mattress. Her hand was propped under her head, her eyes closed, and she was wearing a plain white dress that was strangely out of season for Caroline. #*sweetdreams* #*Woody*

""It's so fucking weird,"" my best friend had said. ""It's like she's going to marry this guy, or something. And how sleazy is that, to just snap a picture of her and put it on *her* Instagram?""

At first I'd assumed my friend was jealous. We were both jealous of Caroline a lot of the time. I mean, she'd gotten to go to NYC, she was gorgeous, and my best friend's parents were practically paying for her to live in her apartment.

The following week there were countless calls being made to Caroline's phone. My friend had pointed out how odd Caroline's new guy was and her mom went into full-panic mode. This time, however, Caroline didn't even reply in texts. It was like this guy was brainwashing her. Maybe he'd convinced her to cut ties with her family? She hadn't updated her Facebook in a while, either.

A couple of days went by without any word when there was another picture. This time it was of wooden beams, a concrete wall, and stacked boxes. #*Woody*

""Is she moving in with him?"" My friend wondered.

Then another the same day. This time the picture was of the same mattress as before, but it was in a corner on the floor. Next to the mattress was an iron spike that had been lodged into the cement, and around it was latched a thick chain. The chain was pulled taut out of the picture. #*Woody*

This sort of out-of-the-ordinary situation, when reading it in this context, seems like a cause for alarm. At the time, it was definitely alarming, but didn't seem like enough to report to my friend's mom. People were still liking these photos. That last one had at least 300-something likes before my friend even showed me.

Over the next few days the pictures continued, but nothing stuck out until the one of a stove with a pan that had two eggs frying in it, and two mugs of coffee on the counter next to it. Behind the cups there was a bottle of chloroform. #*Woody*

We told Caroline's mom and then the police. There was a huge debacle and the cops telling them there was nothing they could do about it. These photos didn't prove a single thing. They were obscure, and more than likely a ploy for attention. Besides, the office said, 700 people *liked* it.

My friends family packed up a few bags and bought plane tickets. If anything, Caroline would have a big surprise when she got home that evening.

That day I kept up with Caroline's Instagram account. The final photo before I got a call from my friend was of two pairs of feet side-by-side. One pair was shackled at the ankles, the other in shiny brown loafers. The shackled feet were bare and pale and bruised, and the toenails were painted a hot pink. #*cozy* #*love* #*Woody*

The call that night was unsettling. My friend was tearful and told me that Caroline's apartment was unlocked when they got there. The inside was trashed and there was spoiling food in the garbage with flies everywhere and dishes piled. She said it was like Caroline hadn't been home in weeks.

Their family went to the police in NYC and filed a missing person's report a week ago. Their father got himself a hotel room and both my friend and her mom came back. I haven't seen either of them, and the whole family has been trying to deal with this privately, but all of Caroline's friends on Facebook have been leaving concerned messages, and everyday there's a new photo, with new likes and always signed #*Woody*.

yurglar,6,11,1r6zsn,22,"Under the Bed

I’m writing this because I simply cannot sleep and there’s something I really need to tell someone, and I find this reddit to be a good place to do so. It is something that is not what you’d consider in the domain of classical horror stories, like zombies or ghosts. It is not, because it was, and I’m afraid still is, real. 

It is so real that it happened 11 years ago, when I was only 7, on a cold morning of December. As you can see, not the night of 31st October. Just the placid, boring morning of 7th December. I was in bed, and I knew my parents were already out, they liked going on morning jogs together. It was a Sunday and my head was throbbing. I have frequent migraines and that 7th December migraine was particularly bad. So there I was, feeling shitty and thinking about lunch, when I moved and my bed creaked. The house was old, like proper old, and we had just moved in (in this regard that part of my life did sound like the beginning of a cliché horror story). I thought it was just temporary anyway, once dad left his job we would leave to California.

When I was a kid I had this habit of putting a pillow over my face when I had a migraine, normally one of those useless small pillows always hanging around. They were always cold, and the cold felt good on my forehead and cheeks. It might sound a bit stupid to you, but to me, it felt good for a few seconds. On 7th December I did this and suddenly, I could not remove the pillow.

I tried to remove it with all my strength, and whoever, whatever, was pushing down, gave in. It was more or less the strength of a skinny teenager. I started panicking, scared, my legs twisting and my heartbeat shooting through the roof. I didn’t even wonder what was happening. I managed to catch a breath and then it happened, all of a sudden. I heard the light switch of my room go out, and the blinds closing violently, and the pressure on the pillow suddenly increased. Twice, then tenfold. It was no longer the strength of a human being but something else. I felt my mind slowdown from the lack of oxygen and I stopped fighting. I felt a strange calm wash over me. Whatever was killing me was impossible to fight, it was like there was a ton of stone over that pillow. I saw a light, my vision going white and then tunneling, and I heard whispers. I was dying. I felt scared then. I put my hands over the pillow, but there was nothing there, and I only felt the hairs of my arms standing up. My hands were not smashed as I expected. My young brain could not make sense of it, but I remember 
being scared, really scared. That’s when I heard a bark.

My dog, Thor, had heard me twist and struggle in bed and had come, to my lucky rescue. The pressure immediately disappeared, the blinds opened and the light turned on and that’s when I felt it, sliding over my right arm, like a hand caressing it, but a dead hand, callous and cold hand, and I felt it, whatever it was, turning and hiding under the bed, like a snake hiding under a rock. Thor kept barking madly, teeth showing and ears back. He was a German shepherd, huge for the standards. Then he neared my bed, looked under my bed, growling and then stopped. He sniffed once, then twice, looked again under the bed, and then climbed on top of the bed and licked my face, where I laid, regaining my breath and control over my limbs, which had gone a bit numb. I remember hugging Thor and almost crying.

I told it to my parents but they did not believe me, they thought it was the migraines and started talking about a psychologist or psychiatrist and bad grades at school. I remember being angry with their reaction, but over time it faded. It took some time for me to sleep again and Thor always slept in my room, sometimes even with me, but there were never any more issues. I never even remembered it from time to time, it was just a scary, traumatic memory my brain just erased. For 11 years, I slept over that memory, over whatever was under my bed.

We moved out a month ago, after 11 years, to a new modern house in California, where my bed doesn’t even have space under it and I love it. My dad sold the house to this young couple who were his friends, who didn’t have much money, but loved the retro feeling of the house. Back then, I didn’t even remember that scary event 11 years ago.

That’s when, as I was laying on my new bed yesterday, I remembered, along with all my morning nightmare details 11 years ago, my dad complaining the other day at dinner table how John and Mary, the young couple, haven’t phoned or said anything about the house since they started living there.

I went to get Thor in my bedroom. I can’t stop thinking about it and I hope they are alright.

SwordOfCielmor,1,7,1qv4w6,22,"As a kid, I wasn't allowed any video games. My parents were firmly of the 'they'll rot your brain and make you a serial killer!' camp, and nothing could convince them otherwise. We had a computer, though, and I was allowed more or less unlimited internet use. I quickly became hooked on browser games-- you know the kind, amateur games made in Flash or Java. I'd scour various sites for them, quickly building a large collection of favorites.

I can't remember the name of the site I found Sword of Cielmor on. The main page had a light purple background and there were two columns with descriptions and thumbnails of the most popular games. Basically, it was every Flash game site ever. Most of the games were pretty generic-- there were Tetris and Snake clones, and a few platformers and rhythm games. My favorite section of the site, though, was its collection of pseudo-RPGs. Most were fairly simple and extremely short-- each game was one 'chapter,' and despite promises of updates, I never saw any series go higher than four of these chapters.

I'd played through all the games in that section and was about to move onto a new site when I checked on a whim to see if any new games had been added. I didn't really expect to find anything; updates were rare, but it was my lucky day-- three new games had been added. One was a puzzle game similar to Minesweeper, one was a trivia game with only twenty or so questions, and the last was Sword of Cielmor.

It was a fairly typical turn-based RPG set in a fantasy world. You could choose from several characters-- I can't remember all of them, but I do recall a knight, a mage, and a healer. I picked the knight, like I always did, and began my adventure to obtain the mythical Sword of Cielmor and rescue the princess, who had been kidnapped by an evil overlord who had previously usurped the throne.

My adventure started uneventfully. I traveled through a cave and then a labyrinth-like forest, killing various monsters before night fell. That was an interesting mechanic the game had-- after a certain amount of time passed, day would turn to night, and your character would pull out a tent and go to sleep. The screen would go black, and white text would give a recap of what you'd done that day. It was a neat feature, but a little annoying because the days weren't all that long, and I had no problem remembering what I'd done.

The following day, I emerged from the forest and began traveling across a field that was said to lead to my next location, a town. After killing a few more monsters, a soldier employed by the evil overlord appeared. It wasn't an especially difficult battle. The soldier was defeated, his sprite vanished, and I continued to go on my way until night fell.

This time, instead of the typical 'You made it through the forest/defeated ten monsters' text, the game began to tell me about the soldier I'd killed. Apparently he had two children, and a wife. He hadn't wanted to become a soldier, but there weren't many opportunities in the small village he'd come from. He was scared every day he was sent out to patrol, and he had no clue that the king was evil. In his last moments before I'd skewered him with my sword, he'd thought about how it had all been pointless-- that his children would grow up without a father-- that there would be no money to pay for food, or rent--

And then the text shifted to the wife and children, and how they would eventually be left on the streets. The mother would die first, of an unexplained sickness. It would come quickly for her, but the starvation of the children would be long, slow, drawn out-- their last moments would be spent wondering *why*--

There was a quick flicker, and I saw the sprite of the soldier, a few pixels of red on his chest representing blood, alongside a female sprite and two smaller ones flash across the screen before fading into nothingness.

And then, suddenly, it was day again, and I was back on the field.

I remember being disturbed, but not disturbed enough to stop playing. Honestly, but I was a little impressed. These games had never been known for their stirring stories or sense of realism, and the fact that the game's creator had gone the extra mile to make it a little more... well, for lack of a better word, meaningful, made me want to keep playing, even if I did think perhaps he'd laid it on a bit thick.

The game continued. I reached the town, stocked up on magical potions and equipment, and headed west, toward the castle where the princess (and the mythical Sword of Cielmor) was being held. On my way, I came across two more soldiers, and defeated both of them. When night fell once more, I was a bit apprehensive, but morbidly curious at what the game would have to tell me about their lives.

This time the game went into even more detail-- it's been years, but I still remember it vividly. It told me how one of the soldiers had cried when he realized he was dying, that he realized he'd accomplished nothing to be proud of in his life-- that he wouldn't be remembered at all. I remember reading that his father never forgave himself for being the one to push him to become a soldier, that for every day of the rest of his life he walked across the field his son had died on, wondering if there was an afterlife, wishing it had been him instead.

Once more, the image of the fallen soldiers flickered across the screen, but this time the graphics were slightly better-- not at all realistic, but less blocky and amateurish than the previous sprites.

By this point I didn't want to keep playing, but... well, I wasn't about to stop. I needed to know what would happen-- I couldn't look away. Several more days passed as my journey continued, and the stories of the soldiers, of the rogue bandits, of the mercenaries I killed grew longer and longer. I read a description of a daughter growing up without her father, and how one day she saw a man in a crowd that looked so much like him that for a moment--

She'd gone home and simply cried, wishing she could turn back time, wishing she had known in advance, wishing she could have changed things.

The graphics were getting better and better, but only during these sequences, only when I was learning about the people I'd killed, and their loved ones. I wasn't only seeing their corpses now. I was seeing quick glimpses of their lives before they died. I saw the soldier with his father, the father beaming with pride at his newly adult child. I saw the children who would later go hungry running through the back alleyways of a town, playing tag. I saw the daughter who would later long for her father taking him for granted, too busy thinking of her own future--

There were witches who'd spent their final moments in a numb state of disbelief that this was it, that it was over. There were warriors who prayed for the first time since they were young. And there were families left behind, or in some cases no one-- no one who would ever remember they'd even existed.

Their faces, which had originally been nothing but flesh colored pixels, were becoming more and more detailed. Rudimentary facial features appeared, and as the graphics improved, they became more and more lifelike. Each person had their own traits, quirks-- one mage had a slightly lopsided grin; a soldier had a mole just below his left eye that vanished when he smiled. And before they vanished into the darkness, it was always the same-- their eyes would widen slightly, and they'd realize what was about to happen. Then the screen would cut to their corpses, each time more real than the last, and a new day would begin.

I found the Sword of Cielmor. I rescued the princess. I completed the journey. 8-bit victory music played as the sprite of a princess kissed my hero's cheek and thanked him for his bravery. The music swelled to its peak, the screen faded to black, and the game ended-- or, at least I thought it did. As I moved the mouse over the back button, the game faded back in to the hero, sitting in a chair in an empty room, completely alone. The princess was nowhere to be seen. It was just the hero, the Sword of Cielmor at his feet, silent, unmoving. The music stopped, and after nearly a minute passed I was certain that the game had frozen.

But no, it was fading to the people I'd killed and their families one last time-- only this time it looked so real that I could have sworn I was looking at photographs of dismembered men and women. There was an image of a man bent over another, staring at his mutilated body, both faces blank and uncomprehending. The two children who would later starve to death sat side by side on the street, their bodies emaciated, the younger one confused while the older one tried her hardest to protect her little brother, clearly frightened herself. It all looked so real-- to this day I'm not sure if I was looking at actual photographs. I don't want to believe they were.

I closed the browser window and left the room. I went outside. I tried to forget what I'd seen. Over the next few days I managed to half convince myself that it had been a dream, or a hallucination, until finally I couldn't take it anymore and went back to the site. Nothing had changed. It was the same website with the same light purple background and the same two columns of games. But now there were only two new games instead of three-- the Minesweeper clone and the trivia game remained, but Sword of Cielmor was gone.

Over the years I've tried to find it again, but no one has ever heard of it. Maybe I did hallucinate it. But either way, I can't stop thinking about the people of the game-- and of the photographs. I keep trying to tell myself that it was someone with a sick sense of humor's idea of playing a joke. I keep trying to tell myself the the photographs were fake, or staged. I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't kill anyone. All I did was play a simple, poorly made browser game.

And yet... I still feel guilty.",Sword of Cielmor,29
Chenigin,7,9,1r6b7r,20,"When I was ten my parents divorced. Soon after I moved into an old house in Orange County CA with my mother and stepfather. This house had a nice floor plan but needed major work. With all the remodeling being done to the house it was not uncommon for my step father to walk around at night to check up on and see how the house was holding up. One night I was laying in bed when I heard heavy footsteps outside my bedroom window. My room was located at the side of the house. Me being young and naïve I automatically thought it was my step dad. I heard the footsteps walk into the garage and enter the house via the garage door. I knew this was the time to go to the restroom because well.. their was an adult and he could protect me from my fears of the dark. When I heard the footsteps walk past my door I slowly opened my door and called out my step fathers name. At the same time I stuck my head out my door and saw the back of a boot I never saw before turn the hallway corner. This made me reconsider how safe it was to go take a leak. I heard a sound in the kitchen.. the distinct sound of the drawers opening and a hand shuffling through its contents. After what seemed like an eternity I decided to call out to my stepfather again, this time slowly creeping out of my room so I can get to the corner of the hallway. As soon as I started to edge forward I heard the heavy footsteps make a b line straight for the front door.. I started to pick up my pace so I could get a good view of who it could be. When I got to where I could get a good view of the door I saw something I would never forget. The door slammed shut and the lock turn to the lock position. As if someone had the key and was locking it from the outside. By then my fight or flight instinct kicked in and I ran to the door to see if I could see who was in our house. When I opened the door I saw nothing... No sight of someone running away.. no evidence of anyone ever being there in the first place.. Just 10 year old me.. standing in the dark.. Suddenly the fight or flight instinct kicked in again.. but instead its the opposite instinct.. fuck! I'm ten.. I am by myself in the dark.. someone just broke into the house! I slammed the door shut and ran into my mothers room. My stepfather right away called the cops and propped a chair to the front door and the garage door so even if someone had the key they could not open it. The cops showed up and didn't find a single thing. No footprints nothing.. My mother turned on me and said it was just my childish imagination making up things.. I started to doubt myself after the years... Chucking it as what my mom said.. my youthful imagination.. I am 24 now.. I don't sleep walk nor have I ever. If it was a dream... I never had one like that ever since. If anyone has any ideas on what I might of experienced please.. I am all ears. I always wondered what other people would have to say about this. Glad to have found Reddit that's for sure. ",Still think about this all the time,29
sinbysilence,9,0,1r49de,23,"Okay. You have to believe me. And what I'm about to say is going to make you not believe me. But please, be patient with me.

You're not real. At least, the you who is reading this isn't real. You only exist because my mind tells you to exist. Regardless of how unbelievable that sounds, I know it to be true. You're helping me cope. You're helping my brain stay active.  And, I believe, to some degree, you're helping keep me alive.

Since there's no better place to start,  I'll just start at the beginning. Back before I knew you existed. Back when you had the possibility of being real.

Back when my normal life got catapulted into this current situation.  I lead a very mediocre life. Living paycheck to paycheck, small group of friends, and no one in my life worth falling in love with. I was on my way to work, just like every other day. Stopped to get coffee. Lit my cigarette as I left the gas station. I began my morning commute.  It was all very routine. Until the car pulled out in front of me.  I stood up on my brakes, but still hit him at an abrupt 45 miles an hour. I ran the red light.  My seatbelt burned my chest.  My head  was blasted by the air bag. My femur protested against the impact until it snapped. The pain was dizzying.  Disorienting. I dug for the phone that flew out of my hand. Mom was still  on the line, crying. She heard what had happened and was over an hour away. But her and dad where on their way.

Now this is what I believe may have happened next. I think I remember getting out of the car and being put on the stretcher. I remember the god awful pain of having my leg reset on the side of the road. That had to be real, right?  It hurt so badly. It was the most earth shattering pain I've ever felt. Once I got to the hospital I was drugged and put to sleep to prep for surgery.

I faded in and out all week. After four nights, I woke to a conversation with my mom. I woke up suddenly in the middle of the night and, considering the drugs in my system, I was very much alert. My mom snapped to attention when she felt me stir. I look at her as though she was a stranger. I'll never forget the confusion I felt as I asked her...""who are you? ""

""It's me, Em. It's mom.""

""Where am I?"" I cried, tugging at the IV on my hand. 

""You're in the hospital,  sweetie.  You were in an accident. ""

""Was it bad?"" I begged for an answer. ""Was it bad?"" I was more hysterical the second time.

I never got an answer. Even when I woke up the next morning she acted as though the conversation never took place. And here's why: I never woke up. Instead,  my brain started to build my new percieved reality. Looking back on it, I think that conversation we had was the last real one I had. Because the accident WAS bad. Because I am still suffering from it, to some extent.

Suffering may not be the best way to put it. Sure, the first two months were brutal. I had to relearn to walk. I had to have help getting in an out of the shower. I had headaches. I got dizzy and sick often. I couldn't work. But it had to seem real.

Now,  life is amazing. I've met the person who made me believe in soulmates. I'm back at work - they even transferred me closer to home and gave me a raise when I came back. Remember how I was the one who ran the red light?  The guy I hit doesn't want to sue me. My life couldn't be anymore perfect if I wrote it myself. Because I have wrote it myself. My brain has created a life to make everything seem normal. I would have never questioned it if it weren't for the other night when I caught a glimpse of reality.

""Nurse...nurse...I think she's waking!"" 

Mom?

Opening my eyes felt like I was fighting a week without sleep.

""Where am I?"" I mumbled.  I hurt. It made no sense.

""You're in the hospital,  baby. You were in an accident, but it's okay. You're going to be okay. I'm so glad to see your eyes.""

Accident? I don't remember anything in my recent history that would have landed me in the hospital. I've been overly precautious these past five months. I voiced my confusion out loud.   ""What accident? I've not been in an accident since June."" 

I saw mom's face fall from optimism to sadness. I asked again, ""what accident?  Was it bad?"" I was scared. Scared because I didn't remember an accident. Scared because of how badly I hurt and didn't know why.

""Sweetie, you've been here since June.""

And then I understood. Why she was so happy to see my eyes. They had been shut since June. 

""Is it bad?"" But before she had a chance to answer, I was drifting again. And the next thing I knew,  I woke up in my bed with my boyfriend at my side.

Since that night, I occasionally catch bursts of their conversation inside my hospital room. Remember how I said I think you're helping to stay alive? 

""She's showing good brain activity. That's a good thing. Unfortunately,  it was a nasty bump to her head. But we've seen people wake up from comas after months, years even. So long as her brain remains healthy, there's no reason not to hope for the best.""

Sounds optimistic,  right? So why am I scared?

I've built an amazing life inside my head. I'm afraid I'll have to leave it. I'm afraid that I may soon wake up.

theunlockeddoor,2,9,1r1j47,19,"I work at a public library and I really need to write about this.  Yeah, boring. Librarians=Blah. I know.  This is probably going to be tl:dr and dull.  I know I'm super-new to reddit, but I really need to get this out of my system and I'd feel weird posting about this anywhere else.  So, mock me for my noobness, but I really need to talk.

And aside from 'sexy librarian' sterotypes, you ought to know that the people checking books out from behind the desk have to deal with all sorts of people.  People checking out books about livestock and winking and grinning at you too much, and women, teary-eyed, avoiding your gaze, checking out books about abuse or divorce.  We're sort of like bartenders, but without the convenience of bouncers.  So, when I tell you that meeting this one particular guy kept me up at night, you ought to know that it's not because I have a simple, dusty job. 

This is a story about  person I met through my job.  It's also a story told to me by that person.  

When I came in to work one morning my boss was wandering around the workroom looking disgusted.  She kept going between the bathroom and her desk- trying to work but getting nauseous every so often.  Apparently, when she'd rolled up in the parking lot that morning, she'd found something on the pavement.

A wet set of dentures.

We all laughed at how weird that was, and set the things gingerly on a pad of paper towels in the backroom.  No way were we putting a pair of raw dentures in the lost and found tub.  We forgot about them before lunch.

Later that day, though, this guy came in.  I ended up knowing him as ""Irma's Nephew"".

He limped in and asked if we had any books about dentistry.  I told him I didn't know where to find them off the top of my head and proceeded to do a search on the computer.  As I typed things in and scanned our holdings, he kept staring at me.  His eyes seemed too large and white, popping out against his skin.  He kept chewing his lips and the sides of his cheeks.  It was so fierce, so intense and obsessive, it looked painful.

Then he said: ""Teeth.  C'mon, gimme anything about teeth.  How they grow....""  And trailed off.

I was rattled but I managed to scribble a number down on a scrap of paper and gesture towards the nonfiction section.  He hobbled off.

Twenty minutes or so later, it was the top of the hour, and my turn to do a ""walkabout"".  ""Walkabouts"" are a thing our library system made up to make sure nobody is being harassed or molested out in the stacks.  We're supposed to check all the blind spots in the building every half hour.

So, I was doing my walkabout when I spotted Irma's Nephew sitting on the floor between two rows of books.  He glanced up at me, stood, and as I was moving away, caught me.  His hand on my wrist made me nervous, but I looked back at the circ desk and saw Vikki watching us like a hawk.  Somehow this made me brave.  He told me he needed my help, that these books weren't helping.  So I asked him what else I might look up for him.

""No,"" he said, ""I need to talk to you, to someone, to someone, to anyone.  My aunt, she...""  And he trailed off, eyes bugging.

Sadly, money doesn't reach super-far in the library world, and I hadn't been trained on how to properly treat a mentally ill patron.  As a fail safe, I went with gentleness, since he had a hard grip on my wrist.

So, I asked him to talk to me (looking back over my shoulder at Vikki).

This is the best version I can write of the garbled story he told me.  I could just say: ""And then he told me a spooky story"", but that wouldn't explain why I'm jumpy. I apologize that this is long, but I'm trying to get this out in an accurate way.

""I’ve got an Aunt, named Irma, and she pretty much raised me.  She’s like my mother, but she’s been gettin’ on, gettin' on, you know, and recently she’s been forgetting things.  I need these books for her.  She’s got a problem.  A real….. strange thing goin’ on.
	
“Last summer she got all her teeth pulled.  Got dentures instead.  And she hated them, said they always felt funny in her mouth, and I TOLD HER! we’d go get them refit, recast, but she’d still hate them.  She’d just spit them right out onto the carpet and glare at me with her mouth-skin all sunk-in and puckered up.  I’m the only one of the family that visited her anymore.  So that meant she blamed me.  I was the only one around to be hateful to.  Fuck.

""In June, she started doin’ this thing where she’d say she lost her dentures.  Whenever I went over to see her, she’d ‘lost’ them and I’d scold her because dentures are damn expensive.  Pardon me.  But she’d say it’s no problem and grin big.  I’d look all over- turn the house upside down, and not be able to find them.  She’d say “They’ll turn up in no-time” and wave her hand at me like this.  

""The weird thing is that they would.  I’d come over again and she’d have them back in.  Clack them at me and laugh.  Everytime.  Clack, clack, clack.  And laugh.  Clack, clack.
	
""She, uh, she just kept losing them.  I tried talking to her neighbor down the stairs, Lucy, to try and help her out.  Lucy is a nice woman and said she’d check on her when she got the chance.  And she did good.  When I hadn’t been able to visit in a few days, I’d get a text or call from Lucy lettin’ me know everything’s alright with Miss Irma.  
	“Only I got into a car wreck.  Was laid up in the hospital doped out of my brain on pain killers for who-knows-how-long.  Doctor said I’d broken my thigh-bone.  I didn’t see Miss Irma for a long time.  I think I got a call from Lucy at some point but it’s a foggy.  I remember answering and Lucy just murmuring, murmuring something I couldn’t understand.  It must have been the drugs.  It must have been.

So, eventually, I’m better, and I go over there.  I try knocking on Miss Irma’s door.  She never gave me a key, but she always bustled up and let me in.  I knocked and knocked and she didn’t come, so I got nervous, you know?  I went over to Lucy’s then, to see if she had a back-up key, or could call the building manager.  But I when I knock on her door it just kinda…whoosh…opens.
	
I call her name, but nothin’.  So of course I go in, cuz maybe they both in trouble.  But Lucy is nowhere.  Her apartment is just… empty.  Except, just as I’m leaving, I see something pink on the floor.
	
{Here, the guy paused, licking his lips again.  It seemed to me he was winding up his courage, or working past something particularly horrible.}

""It was teeth, ma’am.  Dentures.  A top and a bottom, both.  The top was kinda falling off the bottom, was at an angle.  Like they’d just been dropped and left.  
	
“I knew Lucy didn’t wear dentures, so this scared me a lot, because Miss Irma might be wandering around lost with her dementia.  She’d started forgetting my name.  She could be anywhere, doing anything if she was spitting her teeth out again.
	
“So I run.  Run and find the janitor that sometimes cleaned up the stairwells and he looks at me like I’m crazy.  He says “I thought your gramma moved out last month.” I say “No, sir, you are mistaken.  She can’t have gone nowhere.”  And he says “Well, I ain’t seen you nor her in that time.”  And I argue with him but eventually he comes with me and unlocks the door.   
	
“Inside Miss Irma’s the tv was on, but, she wasn’t in her chair where she’d sit for hours and watch tv.  I mean, she’d sat there so much it had left an impression, her shape.  But that wasn’t all she left.  She also left her teeth. {He was giggling a bit hysterically at this point}
	
“No, not the ones in Lucy’s place.  These were different.  These were more.  These were MORE.  All over.  Pairs and pairs of false teeth were lying all over Miss Irma’s apartment.  They were on bookshelves and on the kitchen table.  The biggest pile was around her chair.  I was confused at first.  There was no way she could have collected all these teeth by herself.  I certainly only bought her the two pairs.  She didn’t have no friends to bring her sets of teeth, teeth, teeth, teeth, teeth.
  
""And they were different, too.  As in, some were little.  Like, tiny white baby teeth, just little gappy chips.  And others were big and wide and long.  And some of the sets, I don’t know how they could fit in a person’s mouth.  they were full of fangs and tusks and.

“And it makes no sense.  I can only come up with one idea.  She was on her own for a month, except for Lucy.  I know Lucy didn’t bring her all those teeth.  The only thing I can think is that she was growing them back herself.  That, every time she had ‘lost’ and found her dentures before, she’d just thrown them away and grown a new pair in her mouth.  Then that set would fall out and she’d grow more.  And then they must have started growing strange in her mouth.  And she's gone off somewhere wandering wandering, I can't find her. I don't..  I need help for her.""

I peeled his hand off and somehow got out of there.  I went back and handed him some paper I think had a number for psychiatric help on it.  Really, I went back to the staff bathroom and sat against the wall for a while, breathing and feeling really strange in my stomach.

When I left work, I had to pass the set of dentures my boss found in the parking lot that morning.  I found myself staring at them.

thelesone,13,19,1qs29p,21,"I am dating a wonderful woman with an ex, who is...crazy? He has been known to do things out of the ordinary and it really bugs me. Let me start from the beginning though (female here).

I did not really know about this ex, let's call him Brad. All my girlfriend Sam told me was that he had been to jail for sexual assault and he had attempted to rape her when they were together. She exused this behavior with saying he had a fucked up childhood. She said his parents made him wear diapers until he was 14 and that he got beat a lot and encouraged to steal. By the time he was 17 he got kicked out of his house and was living on the streets. Apparently he also has some disability mentally which doesn' fucking surprise me, the creeper. 

I met him for the first time oer two years ago. He was walking around town and it was pretty late, my girl and I were coming back from the store when we saw him. He ran up, and he called her ""sister"" and started talking about his sex life...it was weird, he didn't aknowledge I was there for much of his talking, until about 5 minutes in when he looke at me and just smiled this bone chilling smile. I was frozen to the spot, after he smiled at me he said my name (which at this point I hadn't told him...and Sam says she hadn't either) I just looked at him and was like... ""What?"" He just smiled at me, and than walked past us, down the fucking street. I just stood there creeped the fuck out. He's really tall and bigger than me (as a 100lb girl) so...I was freaked out, especially knowing his history. 

After that we didn't run into him a lot. I kinda forgot about it and was concerned with other things... But one day at the bus station by myself (No car) I was waiting for the bus when suddenly someone grabbed me from behind and picked me up off the bench. I went into panic mode and screamed loudly, no one fucking cared who was waiting... and it was dark out so of course I'm fucking scared. Suddenly the arms let me go and I turn around to see Brad smiling down at me and he says, ""Hey Beck..what's up?"" as if he hadn't just grabbed me from behind. I didn't want to be rude, but I did't want to talk to him so I just tried to say mundane things. 

A little while later, like months later we found out he was actually with out  home and he calle Sam sobbing to her, he needed money. He needed it because he had no food. I remember telling her I didn't want him in our house, but she let him in ""He has a disability, he doesn't know any better."" Fuck that shit, it's not our problem. 

I hate to sound so heartless but he was creepy...he had this aura (and I know how fucking fake this sounds, cheesy too an aura...) and I just hated this man. However Sam let him in and made him a sandwich. He watched me as he hate, he ate so gross...

But he ended up leaving after Sam said he couldn't stay, because of her parents who live on the other side of the apartment. We live in a duplex. He said that was fine and left. I remember he said good bye to me and like tried to hug me but I ducked and Sam told him to back off politely. So I woke up as I always do at 4 in the morning and went pee. The bathroom door was open because we are the only ones on that side and I didn't think to close it being so groggy. I didn't notice anything weird when I went pee, and went back up to bed. Sam woke up at 8 to go get some breakfast, and... BRAD WAS ON THE FUCKING KITCHEN FLOOR SLEEPING. 

I was so pissed, I remember standing there as Sam asked, ""When did you come in?""

""Last night a little before 4."" Brad answered, he looked at me when he said that with this sick grin.... I went pee at four...and he snuck in at four...I don't know to this day what he saw, but his grin tells me that the little fucker saw me take a piss.

""You can't do that."" Sam lectured him and he did leave. 

""I think he watched me pee this morning."" I said to Sam, she said that I was overreacting. She always does. Well later that day, I was getting ready to leave my room when I opened the door and there he was. Just standing there. I finally flipped out, I screamed at him and he just turned and walked away. Sam came home and I told her, she called him and told him to stay the fuck away from our house. 

That was months ago. I know he went back to jail for harrassing a girl again. He got out pretty damn quick though according to he rumors. The thing is, latey at night I've been seeing a figure in my street. Like walking by slowly... I bet it's nothing because we live across from a park and in a college town. But when I go to check the doors at night, it's been unlocked a few times...

I know this isn't that scary but Brad is creepy...and I

BiohazardTyrant,3,8,1r4rao,20,"So to begin, I was eleven years old I believe...

My father had brought me to a friend of his' house. Or rather farm.

I was excited because I had befriended the son of my fathers friend, for stories sake I will call him James. James had a older brother who was a year and a half older, so I was eleven, James was twelve and his brother thirteen. We had all played around the barn and fields plenty of times before. This time though it was a celebration of some sort, I wish I could remember why but anyway, they had been in this house on this farm for about half a year. Tonight was the big party, as in the most vivid thing I remember about that night. The cut off pigs head. Literally just cut right off, and sitting on a support beam about shoulder high to the adults. The body was dangling from a chain for a while, until they skewered it onto a metal pole and roasted it whole over a fire.

I really wish I could remember why they were doing that but sadly I cannot. In any case, me James and his brother were just running around like we always did like idiots. They had all of the farm as a playground and plenty of space to play. We began by walking over to the stalls where they kept the horses and cattle. The sheds were HUGE, and seemed to be endless to a younger kid as myself. 

After about a half an hour of walking through corridors left and right in the dark we started hearing noises, but not normal ones... Like chains being hit on metal and slammed into the ground, then grunts. We all took off running following James' brother who quickly let out out to the closest exit. None of us knew what the sounds were because of the fact the farm had been out of commission for about thirty years. Nothing alive should have been in there. 

We quickly made out way back to the farm house, the big one where all the adults were partying and tried to talk to them about it but of course they had all had a drink or three and ignored us laughing it off as childish imagination. 

For some reason. Some stupid god forsaken reason, James said we should go back out and just play in the field where there was a little light away from the adults and we listened. Once the three of us were out there it turned into a ""I dare you to go out in the field"" game.

We each took turns going farther and farther out into the night. Finally we all ended up ignoring the occurrences from earlier and started playing hide and seek. Bad idea. Very bad.

James and I were hiding in the tall grass near the side end of the barn and his brother came running out faster than I have ever seen anyone run, screaming bloody murder, to get away as fast as we could, get to the adults! James and I ran to him, and stopped dead in our tracks, quickly seeing why he had been fleeing. 

There we were, James, his brother and I all standing still, like sacks of meat staring to the treeline where we saw it. There were three if I remember correctly faces. All white and elongated, just weirdly shaped about six feet off the ground, and then came the true horror, the glint off the blades they were holding. 

We all ran.

Faster and faster we ran.

I turned around two times and I regret it to this day for the fact they were even closer than I thought blades outstretched trying to mince us up and drag us back into those hellish woods. 

We finally made it to the adults. The only thing I remember after that was that damn pig head, cut off, and just sitting there, I could see the spine, and every last vein... we tried telling the adults but they just laughed. None of us left the main barn after that for the rest of night.




About a week later my friend Chris came over, and had the worst part to share with me. He had been having these night terrors of these creatures tearing at him and chasing him through his own new home.

Then he told me his family had left the farm, and moved to the city.

Then he told me why. He was attacked.

Then he showed me, and lifted his shirt up, showing me a scar which I know he did not have before because we used to swim together all the time. He never had a mark there a week before. But now, across his stomach he had a fully healed scar of about ten inches going from left to right, like he had been gutted. But the scariest fact like I said was that it had not been there one night, then he woke up with that kind of scar. 

His family moved because of that, that day. And never returned to that farm.

I have long since lost touch with him, he became very paranoid after that and I just cant forget that.

Figured I would share it with the community, I do hope if any of you take anything away from this, if you see a creature, with a white face, long arms, and a huge blade by a treeline. Run, just run. And try to forget about it.","A tale of a Farm, and three young kids.",28
buffalowing1,6,9,1r337b,19,"I probably can't tell a great story but I can tell you what I saw last fall. I was outside admiring my garden that runs along the side of the house. I froze as soon as I looked towards the front of the house. I saw something short, maybe 2-3 feet walking on two legs. It was walking in the direction of my porch or front of the house. I thought it was kinda strange since I live out in the suburbs and something like this would easily be noticed by any of my neighbors. The funny part is we both made eye contact, it noticed that I was looking straight at it. As soon as it did it ran away, and I ran after it. When I turned the corner there was nothing. I ran around the whole house just in case it was running circles around my house. Nada. So yeah I saw that once. No biggie since I havent seen it again or it hasnt messed with my garden. Here is a small image of the scenario and what I saw.

BensonHedges1,2,10,1r60t4,20,"I'm writing this from my phone, I needed to get out of the house. I'm sitting at Panera Bread and my boyfriend thinks I'm nuts. In the time I posted my last update to now, Things got worse.

 It was so bizarre - my boyfriend got home around 5pm yesterday and went to take a nap. He worked a detail after his shift, so I was home alone for the most part. I did my best to stay away from the room. My cat just growled.  
There was a good hour of him sitting at the doorway...growling. For anyone that knows him, he's has the most amazing temperment...he never hisses or growls. The entire time my boyfriend was in the room napping, NOTHING. He thinks I'm crazy because I begged him not to sleep in that room...he went to work at 10pm last night, and I slept on the couch. Remember that wind? I have no fucking clue what it was, but I was on a conference call and heard a small rumble from the room. I ignored. Apparently whatever is happening - ignoring makes it worse. A couple minutes later, another rumble, and a smell. I lied when I said the worst smell ever was burnt coffee. This smell was like death. Not the death that a cat drags in by the tail. And then another rumble. As soon as my call was over, I rushed into the room, febreeze in hand. I can't explain it exactly, but as I opened the door to the bedroom, all of that windows made a loud thud like they were closing, but they were open. I sure as hell didn't open them. Is it even possible for them to thud OPEN? What the hell. Against my better judgment I went into the room. It's day time, what can happen, right? There was a stain on the floor - just a big dark stain... I don't want to say blood because it's not mine and fuck this supernatural shit. It got bigger though, like water expanding. I could see it growing, but I couldn't tell if my mind was playing tricks on me. 
I ran.
Fucking ran.

What the hell is my cat seeing? I wonder if this is just my mind playing tricks on me. 

I've had some trouble posting this today - but I haven't been home, and I'm returning tonight. My intention is to sleep in that room. I want to know what's going on, and why it's getting so cold. I'm getting the chills thinking about the chills.

gabsgirl,11,5,1qtkjz,20,"I was walking around at 3am one morning, because I do that type of thing... I was walking and listening to music on my mp3 player and zoned out. I had just been dumped by my girl and was feeling like shit. But I was finally on the street, heading home. 

I was walking and felt strange, a sense of pure fucking dread entered my stomach and made me stop dead in my tracks, directly under a street light. The headphones were still in my ear, and the music was blasting, but it seemed like complete silence. The street I live on is off of Main street and not a lot of traffic goes on it during the day, it's a little hidden. I was standing by the bridge on this street. If I took my headphones out I might have had a warning. 

I felt a tap on my shoulder, I turned around to see this girl who looked about my age (I was 17 at the time) and she was looking down. She had light brown hair and was a little taller than me. She wore a red hoodie and a pair of blue jeans, so it was nothing out of the ordinary, and I instantly felt a little calmer, even though the dread still settled in my stomach. She was dressed like me, not identical, but like me. So I figured maybe someone had scared her or something, with the way she was looking down, with her hands in her pockets. 

""Can I come home with you? I need to use the phone and call my mother. She needs to know where I am..."" that's what she said to me, and her voice was strong, and clear. It was weird because she said she needed to use the phone, and didn't have one of her own.

""You don't have a cell phone?"" I asked, she shook her head and said it didn't hold a charge very well and she had discovered it was dead. ""I can't really let you in my house. My dad is sleeping and I kind of sleep in the living room right now."" I said to her. 

This is when I freaked the fuck out, she looked up at me and I couldn't even see her eyes. It was just black, black pupils. I stood there frozen, eyes locked with hers, and finally I turned to run. I hate to say it but I just ran. I tried to run all the way home but suddenly I felt something hit me on the side of my head, and it stunned me and the person was able to pull me to the ground. The weight on me wasn't that heavy, and the hands were grabbing at my pockets. I screamed at the top of my lungs and jumped up, I turned to see a shorter man staring at me, with normal eyes. I just stood there stunned and than I screamed, ""GET OUT OF HERE!"" he turned and ran and I followed him, because I could still see the girl in the distance. He ran by her with me screaming at her to run and still chasing the man and she jumped out of the way with a terrified screech at the top of her lungs.

I ran to her, thinking nothing of the black eyes or the feeling of dread and helped her up, she had fallen. She looked at me and her eyes were normal... She looked a little dazed and said, ""I need to go."" It was still in a clear, and somewhat angry voice. I let her go. 

""Are you okay?"" I asked, I started to help brush her off, but still felt fearful. She looked at me and her eyes looked black again. I instantly let go of her and stepped back.

""Thanks for the help, I need to go now."" she said in that clear, and scary tone. I backed up a little more and felt fear over take me but the thing is she wasn't even looking at me now. ""We'll remember this."" is all she said. She walked away and I just stood there stupidly and watched her fucking leave. 

I walked back home that night, my head reeling. I don't know what happened to the man who had tackled me, and I never saw that girl again. I did do some research though and found that there is something called ""black eyed children"" the only thing that doesn't match up is this girl's eyes went from normal to black it looked like. I had just hit my head so maybe I was seeing things. She did ask to come to my house, but the feeling of dread was a little more calm after that dude tried to mug me. I don't know what happened that night.

Sometimes I look outside at night and see children walking down the street, which is odd for this time of night and year... Sometimes they look at the house and I have to reassure myself I didn't see black eyes... But I don't feel dread so that's a good thing? I don't know, maybe they just watch, maybe I'll let them in if they knock..and they are those black eyed children. The girl didn't attack me or anything. She just walked away. 



",I have no idea what this was.,25
cmd102,4,5,1r2xzg,18," unexplainable experiences are not completely abnormal for me. Every house or apartment that I've lived in, I've seen or heard something that would make a lot of people hide under a blanket or leave the house all together. The man at my window was one story of mine that never fails to make whoever I tell shudder, so I figured I'd share it here.

It began when I was 7 or 8 years old. We lived in an older house, but not one that would instantly stand out as ""creepy"" or ""unusual"". We didn't live in the middle of nowhere, but rather on a street lined with houses on both sides of the road. It was a fairly quiet neighborhood, the kind where the rare car that came down the street would often break up a game of football or hockey that was being played by the kids that inhabited almost every house. It wasn't perfect, but it was great. I was a very happy child. 

One night, I was plagued by a very odd, yet equally terrifying nightmare. I dreamt that I was in my bed, in the room that I shared with my older sister. I sat up and looked out of the window that was next to my bed, which sat in the one corner of my bedroom flush against the wall. The window overlooked the back yard, and in that yard stood a man. He wore a long black coat, a wide-brimmed black hat that hid his face from me, and a black suit. On his shoulder, there sat a very large black bird with red eyes. I stared at him for what seemed like forever, before he looked up at my window. The only features of his face that I could see were his eyes, which were a deep red, just like the bird's. Just as he made eye contact with me, the bird left his shoulder and flew straight at my window. When the bird got to the point where it would have inevitably smashed through the window and probably eaten me, I woke up. I was on my side, facing my sister's bed that was situated in the exact same position as mine, but on the opposite side of the room. I stared at her as she slept soundly, terrified and unable to go back to sleep. I decided that the only way I would get any rest was by looking out my window and proving to myself that the man wasn't really there, so I rolled over and sat up. My curtains were already pulled to the sides of the window, since my bedroom was on the second floor of a house in a decent neighborhood,  we didn't really worry about anyone trying to peep on my sister and me. The second I looked at the window, he was there. Even though he was impossibly directly outside my window,  close enough that he should have left fog with his breath, I still couldn't see any features of the man's face except his blood red eyes. I did what many children would do, I laid back down and threw my blankets over my head. I eventually fell back asleep, despite being scared out of my mind.

The man visited me several times a month for several years after that, always just staring at me through my window during the darkest parts of the night. When my sister moved out, I started sleeping in her bed,  across the room and away from the window. I didn't see the man anymore. 

One day, I was cleaning my room in preparation for my friend to sleep over that night. I knelt on my old bed, still there for when we had guests,  to clean the window. I pulled the curtain aside (as a teenager now, I valued my privacy), and saw a handprint on the glass. It was bigger than my own, but I didn't think anything of it. I had assumed one of my friends had left it there. I sprayed the cleaner and wiped it away with the paper towel, but the handprint remained. A little grossed out, I went over it again, a little harder to scrub the print away. It was still there. That was when I realized that, despite not seeing him anymore, I still received visits from the man with the red eyes. The hand print was on the outside of the window.",the man at my window,23
quietgrl,5,7,1qvoaz,17,"I have been experiencing some strange things for a while, including some kind of “phantom” that haunted my shower. I'm happy to report that I haven't been awaken by the sounds of running water or a man whistling in the bathroom, the past few nights. Maybe I was just imagining it, or dreaming it, like my friends and family have been suggesting.

However, I get this deep anxious feeling in the pit of my stomach that whatever is happening to me,  it's not really over and only escalating. It feels like things are just getting started, in some kind of twisted cosmic joke, set at my expense. Ever since my last post, I had this feeling that the other shoe was about to fall, and my instincts seem to be right...

Last night, I was leaving from my job at the local shopping center and heading for my car in the parking lot, when I noticed a man standing by another vehicle two rows away. It's not uncommon to see a few late-night shoppers around this time, heading home with their last minute items, but something about this guy was “off”. 

He was kind of attractive, tall with bronze skin and long dark curly hair, not overly thin nor tall. Honestly, I wouldn't have noticed him if he was within a crowd. but the thing that stood out about him was the smile that he gave me. His initial response to my eye contact with him was that of a little confusion, but then he smiled very brightly, a lot satisfied that I had noticed him standing there.

It would have been an innocent kind of situation, except his smiled seemed a lot creepy and a bit unnatural. The corners of his lips seemed to stretch a little too wide than it should for a human smile, his teeth were a lot too white and bright under the dull lighting of the street lamp nearby. His huge brown eyes were unblinking, still and lifeless, and it reminded me of the eyes of a dead fish within a market's display. He said nothing to me at all, just stared and smiled.

I didn't want to be rude, so I nodded his way in acknowledgment of his smile, and then quickly got into my car. I didn't make eye contact with him again, quickly started my car, sped out of the parking lot and on my way home. Somehow, the whole encounter caused me to feel frighten, and I wondered if I was just losing my mind or becoming paranoid.

While driving and switching to the local music station, my heart began to slowly return back to its normal pace. I had laughed at myself for being so jittery lately and vowed to cut back on my coffee intake from now on.

After ten minutes of driving, I pulled my car into the driveway of the house, which I am currently staying with my sister and mutual friend. I had a few bags within the trunk, items that I had bought at the shopping center, on my lunch break. It wasn't anything special, just a few new towels and a couple of boxes of cereal. Besides the freaky unexplained happenings, I pretty much live a boring and uneventful life.

I grabbed the two small bags from the trunk of my car, slammed it shut, then took a moment to glance towards the house across from the one I'm staying. I was hoping to get a glimpse of the handsome neighbor who I sometimes speak with, his name is Charlie. He wasn't on his front deck, as he sometimes was, and I could see no lights within the windows of his home. Maybe Charlie was still at work or possibly asleep? I would have to wait until some other time to chat with him.

As I was having this usual and mundane thought, I felt as if something was watching me from behind. I have a hard time explaining this feeling well, so please be patient with me, but it was like I felt some kind of presence or heat behind me. It was like I could feel a breath on the back of my neck or feel someone moving behind me, although my rational mind was pointing out the fact that I didn't hear footsteps on pavement. 

I turned around and gave a startled yelp, as I saw the same man from the parking lot, standing a few steps away from me. He was staring and smiling at me.

I gulped in a quick and shallow breath, regaining my composure, and replied to him lightly, “I'm sorry... you scared me, I didn't hear you walking up behind me.” The man didn't say anything, didn't blink, didn't seem to breath. He just stood there staring and smiling at me. I felt a lot uncomfortable and uneasy about this, as the air around us seemed to be a lot too still, as if we were standing within some kind of unseen bubble that locked the rest of the world out.

“Sir,” I said, trying my best to keep my voice from wavering, “May I help you? Is there something that you want?” The man didn't reply, standing there like an unmoving mannequin, staring and smiling. “Do you live here?” I asked, trying to get some kind of human response, “In this neighborhood, I mean? Are you lost?” He said nothing, his cold and lifeless dead eyes locked into a stare that seemed to be looking straight through me.  And his smile...it was stretched too far for it to be real, it almost looked like some kind of creepy Halloween mask. 

My skin crawled and I gave up on being polite. I turned without another word and promptly sprinted towards the door of my house. It's a good thing that my sister never feels the need to lock the doors in this part of town, because I didn't have to fumble with the keys in the door, as if I was within some kind of bad horror movie. I simply pushed open the door and ran inside quickly, slamming the door behind me. Once I was on the other side of the door, I did lock it, dropping my bags on the first stair of the short staircase that lead to the living room above.

I don't know why, but curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to take a look through the side window of the door. Cold... dead.... and fish-like brown eyes stared back at me. That unnatural smile stretched even more in a silent chuckle, as the man pressed his face just inches away from the glass! I screamed and fell backwards, falling on my backside with an audible thump on the floor. 

My sister overhead and came running, “What happened?” “There's a creepy man outside!” I shrieked, scrambling away from the window, “He followed me from the parking lot! He's out there and peering into the window!” My sister rushed to take a look and I reached up, tugging at her shirt sleeve, “No! Don't do that! Just call the police!” However, she ignored me and looked out there anyway. After a short pause, she smirked, “There's no one out there.”

I couldn't believe it, as I scrambled on all fours towards the window, looking out to find that the man wasn't there anymore. “But...” my voice wavered, as I shook uncontrollably, “He was there... he was right there in the window. I saw him! I'm not crazy and I'm not making it up!” “Maybe he left,” she shrugged, her tone unconvinced, “Maybe he heard us screaming inside and decided to leave before we called the cops.” “Maybe...” I said, unable to stop myself from staring out into the empty pathway for a while.

I don't know who that man was or what he wanted. I'm very scared that he may return and what he may do to me. I will no longer take night shifts at work, if I can help it. And if I have to, I will ask my sister to come drive me home from work, just in case the man with the creepy smile does return. I will also make sure that the doors and windows of the house are locked, before I sleep at night. Maybe I am going crazy...",The Man With The Creepy Smile,24
meltedroad,3,12,1qssb7,20,"This happened well over a decade ago, when I was still in junior high.  My family had moved into a new neighborhood just north of the city.  My parents chose that bungalow primarily because of the large lot.  Before we moved into the house, I recall my parents making remarks about how they wanted my brother and I to be able to have a proper backyard.

We moved in on the first of September, I was very excited about the move.  Since I could remember, my brother and I always shared a bedroom, with the new house, we would finally each get our own space.  My parents chose early September to move so the academics of my brother and I wouldn't be affected - especially for my brother as he was just entering high school.  

At first it was great, our backyard was large enough for me to practice my pitching for the upcoming little league season, and my brother and I finally got along well.  However, not long after that, I started feeling very uneasy about the house.  I would hear noises and creaks.  When I first expressed my feelings, my parents assured me that there was nothing wrong with the house, that it was just the house settling, and that I had simply been watching too many scary movies.  The kid in me though, would not believe my parents and knew something was not right. 

My parents and brother's bedroom were on one side of the hallway; my room, a converted den, was located on the other side.  I felt alone being on the other side of the house by myself, and slept in my brother's room the week after telling my parents about the noises.  My brother was annoyed, but accepted me into his room.  After that week though, I moved back into my room, and everything was fine again.  Until one night in October when I was woken up by footsteps, I could hear the old hardwood floor creaking as the footsteps got closer to my room before finally stopping.  I bolted sitting up and stared at the crack under my door.  I looked at that door for minutes even though I couldn't see anything under the door.  I felt an intense relief when I heard the creaking start again, moving away from my door.  I am not sure how, it must've been because of how young I was, but I managed to almost instantly fall back asleep.

I mentioned the incident to my brother as we started getting along better than we ever had.  He said he's heard the occasional sounds, but just like my parents insisted, it was just the house settling.  He advised me not to bring it up to our parents as my father was getting increasingly agitated with my interest in the paranormal.

I accepted my brother's recommendation to not tell my parents - but I started believing the house was haunted.  I avoided leaving my bedroom after I already turned in, I would keep a bottle of water on my nightstand in case I got thirsty, but tried my best to not use the bathroom that was down the hall.  One particular night on early December, I woke up in the middle of the night, and knew there was no avoiding the bathroom if I wanted to fall back asleep.

I had not heard any strange noises recently, so I felt brave enough to cross the hallway to the main bathroom.  On my way back, I saw something on the corner of my eye.  Imagine seeing a shadow of your hand cast against a wall, but the wall is far away, not quite a distinct shadow, but more of a subtle shade.  We had a night light in the kitchen to make it easier to use the bathroom at night - that light was what was causing the shadow.  It wasn't a clearly defined shadow of anything, but I knew it was moving because after a few seconds of staring at it, it was no longer there.  I ran back to my room, and hid under the covers until the next morning.

The next day after school, I headed to a church down the street.  My family is Christian, but we were not practicing at the time.  I asked the priest there for a vail of holy water.  Being that I was barely eleven years old, the priest was more than suspicious.  I lied and said my mother had asked for it.  I don't think he believed me, but I sprinkled the holy water everywhere - in the living room, basement, kitchen and all the bedrooms.  I read verses from the Bible as I was doing this.  I am not sure if what I was doing would work, but to my eleven year old mind, it was putting me at ease.

For a time, the noises stopped.  Then a few days before Christmas they started again.  The creaking noises originated from the other side of the hallway and continued into the living room and all over the house before finally stopping.  I was still scared of the noises but managed to fall asleep.

The next morning my parents asked me what I did with my present that was under the Christmas tree.  I had no idea what they were talking about.  They attempted to make me confess.

""Are you telling us that you didn't take the Game Boy Color that was under the tree?""  They inquired.

I didn't know they were getting me this even though I had asked numerous times.  My little mind started connecting the dots; my brother had express interest in a Game Boy for some time.  It was my older brother who was creeping around the house late at night, it was him this entire time!  There was nothing paranormal going on - my brother took my present.  

When he woke up later that day, I confronted him and tried to fight him, but he was four years older than me, and easily subdued me.  He denied everything I accused him off, and when my parents searched his room and found nothing, they reluctantly believed him.  I was grounded for the next few days until Christmas for starting the fight.

The relationship with my brother deteriorated back to where they were before we moved into the house.  My parents never gave me a replacement present, and I blamed my brother for stealing my present.  By late January I had stopped being afraid of any noises that came from the house.  As soon as I heard any creaks, I would think of my brother and got upset.  Eventually when I heard them, I just rolled over and went back to sleep.  

In the last week of January, a flu was going around my school and I eventually caught it.  I tried to shrug it off, but on Thursday, I was sent home at lunch and told not to come back until I was properly rested.  My brother and I walked to and from school together everyday, so I had to drop by my brother's highschool, they called him out of his class, and I let him know I was going home early and not to wait for me after class.

When I got home, I realized that my brother hadn't locked the door.  I took a mental note of this - anything to get my brother in trouble.  I went to the kitchen, threw my bag on the counter and started to pour myself a glass of milk.  Looking around the kitchen, I noticed it looked different.  There was a dirty plate in the sink, as well deli meats on the counter.  My brother and I were the last to leave the house in the morning.  We did not leave it like this.  None of my parents cars were in the driveway.

Suspecting the worst, I took the cordless phone, dialed 911, and ran out my home.  I reported a burglar in the house, and within a few minutes three cruisers were at my house.  The officers searched the bungalow and called my parents.  The police then locked down the neighborhood - searching everyone going in or out.  

Around 9 pm, we were finally allowed back into the house.  The police explained to us what happened.  Someone had been living in our house for the last few months.  They were hiding themselves in the crawlspace under the basement stairs.  In the crawlspace they found several magazines, packaged food, and my missing Game Boy.  The police speculate that the individual knew our daily activities and left the house when he thought we were gone.  He must have been doing this for a while as he was brazen enough to just leave a mess while he went out.  He didn't have a key, so the door was left unlocked for him to return later.  

The police say I was very lucky to not be harmed.  If the individual had returned while I was still in the house, who knows what could've happened.  I remember my mother hugging me for a very long time, my brother even hugged me too.  The creaking of the house never returned, but we never felt comfortable again in the house and moved out a year later.",Why I Can't Be Left Alone Anymore,32

You've probably heard millions of versions of stories where the protagonist has the feeling of being watched. In fact, you may have experienced it yourself. And maybe you, like me, brushed those stories and feelings off. I mean, get real. This is a world of math science and cold hard logic. If you were ever watched, it was probably a pervert, call the cops, he'll get arrested soon enough. Yet the saying that “In every story there is a grain of truth” persists, and because this is a logical world, there must be some reason for this. So maybe you, like me, got to digging. And by the time you get to that infinitesimal spec, you'll wish you had listened to the other saying. You know, that one.

Ignorance is bliss. 

Oh, and lest I forget, the other, other saying.

Curiosity killed the cat.

Now, everyone has their own methods of research, but mine began with asking questions to an all powerful entity: google. I began with myths and legends, but I soon progressed to eyewitness accounts. There were many fascinating reads, but nothing that convinced me. Still, some of the stories struck a chord within me. Tales of “the Midnight man”, “Bloody mary”, and “she found her way into my home” stirred something in me, but I forged onward, crushing those feelings of trepidation. Sadly, those stories were as good as it got for me. Soon, I lost interest and moved on with my life, namely college work. Engineering majors aren't easy. 

Yesterday, my friend came over to my dorm room to work on a programming assignment. Of course, we ended up procrastinating. It began with him showing me a series of youtube videos about creepypasta. He insisted on lights off to maximize the impact. This of course prompted a brief relapse in which I shared some of my research with him. And just like before, I soon got bored, and so did he. I decided to get started on the assignment, but he was still not in the mood, so he started fiddling with my phone. I was finally starting to make some headway in the assignment when he suddenly punches me in the arm and says, “Hey, you've got to see this. It's hilarious!” Naturally, I looked over, and my friend started cycling through my pictures.

“I don't get it,” I told him. 

“Damn it, you really are pretty oblivious huh? You've got a secret admirer! You know how in high school you would just 'happen to show up' where your crush was? Well, look here,” he replied, scrolling back to one of the earlier pictures and pointing to an obscure figure with his or her back turned in the background. 

“Jack.... that is possibly the most retarded thing that has ever come out of your mouth. 'Oh look some random person in the background of your picture! She must like you!'” I mimicked him in falsetto, as I moved to swipe my phone back, “Come on, get your act together, we need to get some work done.”

“No seriously! Look!” Jack scrolled through several more pictures in my phone, and in each one, he pointed out the same obscure figure in the background. As he progressed, I noticed more and more details. Black dress, long black hair, painted black nails, several red tattoos? And then it hit me:

“jack... does it look like she's getting closer in every picture, or is that just me?”

“Uhm... yeah, you're right! It's not much, but she's definitely getting closer! And hey, I think she's starting to turn around too! Weird huh? I guess she's just shy?” jack said, laughing. But I wasnt amused. Not in the least bit. A chill ran down my spine. No need to jump to conclusions, I told myself, there is a reasonable explanation for this.

I swiped the phone from jack and started going through the rest of the pictures as jack looked over my shoulder. And to my horror, in each picture, whoever she was was getting closer, and turning more and more of her body to face the camera. 

“Dude, I guess she most have lost interest. Sorry man,” jack said, patting me on the shoulder. 

“What in the flying fuck are you talking about?! jack, don't fuck with me, I'm not in the mood. Don't fucking fuck with me!”

“Jesus! Relax man! Are you okay? What the fuck. Did you know her or something? Have a crush on her too? I'm sorry, but I mean, she's not in the pictures later on.”

“She's right there, rightthere!” I scream at him, jabbing my finger at her location on the picture. And of course, the stupid touchscreen takes that as a “Oh hey, lets move on to the next picture”. Jacks staring at the picture in confusion, wondering if I'm high, just as I calm down. Maybe calm down isn't the right phrase. It's more like my brain just shut down. Information overload. I've gone deathly silent. Because in that next picture, I finally see a part of her face...  I can see nothing but a glimpse of teeth through her hair … but why the fuck does her smile almostreach her fucking ears?! 

“Are you really okayman?” jack asks, genuine concern in his voice as he waves his hand in front of my face, breaking my trance. “There's nothing there. Nothing. Look again, there's nothing there.”

And he was right. There was nothing there. Nothing at all. I felt relieved, more relievedthan I hadever felt in my life, so relieved that I wanted to cry. 

“Alright, I think we've stayed up too late. You're tired, I'm tired, lets get some sleep,” jack says, as he climbs off of my loft bed and into the adjacent one, recentlyvacated by my room mate who decided to live off campus. 

“Yeah, you're right,” I say, as I climb out of bed and head to my room's private bathroom. I push the door open, feeling for the light switch, when I see a pair of eyes staring at me. “Holy fucking shit!” I scream, backpedalingand crashing intosomething- or someone.

“Jesus man! What the fuck?!” It was just jack. Apparently he had comedown to take a piss too. Those eyes were his, reflected from the mirror inside. 

“Sorry jack, I must stillbe tired and seeing things,” I sayas Iget to my feetand help him up.

“Yeah, yeah, just get on with it,will you? Use the damnbathroom so I can go too and then we can sleep.” So I do. I go about my business, and he goes about his. And miraculously, probably because I really was tired as hell, I fell asleep. 

And awake an hour later to a bright light. My phone. I groggily get up and check it. Huh, no message, no call. Weird. I'm about to put it back and go back to sleep when I notice a glow from under the bathroom door. Was jack in there? I glance to my left. And swallow, one of those dry swallows where all you swallow is air and your throat is even drier than it was before. jack was still in bed. So who was inthe bathroom? No, there's noone in the bathroom, jack probably forgot to turnoff the lights before. With that thought in mind, I put my head down on my pillow and close myeyes. And I immediately hear the creaking of a door. I'm scared shitless. If I had any bodily fluids left in me, they would have all come out. But I'm guess my DNA is more similar to a cat than I thought, so I take a peek, and there she is, standing there, only thing visible id a form, two eyes, and that smile too wide for her face. 

I try to scream for jack to wake up but it comes out as a sort of strangled whisper. So I go to my last resort, something I havent done since I was a child – I ducked underthe covers. Now here I am typing away on my phone, telling you all my story in the calmst most coherent way possible, because please please please please god someonehelp me out! Anyone! Doesn't anyoneknow anything about my case?! Pleasehelpme thefuck out! I swear to god I will never ask for anything again. Please. God why thefuck amI so stupid? I just realized... no light means no reflection... so it couldn't have been jacks reflection inteh mirror. I should have known I should have known. Please, anybody out therehelp me. Please. Why am I so coherent? How am I making sense right now? Do I make sense? Someone, please help. Please.

JordanThirstExile,6,13,1r857m,18,"  It started with the roses. Ever since I was a little girl I loved them. I loved the scent of them, and the colors they came in. I loved them so much that my mother had planted a few rose bushes outside our house so when it bloomed I could sit and stare at those beautiful roses. They bloomed in shades of white, and pink, but my favorite rose was red like satin. It reminded me of my mother and the way she always drew roses on her letters. 
                                                                                                                                                         Fast forward to the time I was 14 years old. I was never a popular girl, by far, but I wasn’t unknown either. I didn’t have long blonde hair or blue eyes, but I had talent, a slim body, and an obsession for roses. All my friends knew how much I loved them. They’d buy me perfume in a rose-shaped bottle, or a dress with red roses on them for my birthday.  I made the best out of what I could in high school being a short, brown haired, green-eyed girl. 
     It was the day before homecoming when the boy I’d secretly been in love with asked me to the dance with a white rose. I swooned and he took me to the dance the next night. (I, of course, in a rose dress and him in matching colors.) He had brought me a white rose corsage to match my dress. We danced all night, and we continued to date until high school ended. After our senior year we went our separate ways and stopped talking. But this didn’t bother me, I hadn’t time to waste when I was busy with my roses.
        In college I had been taking Art classes in my third semester when I got a call one evening informing me that my mother had pasted away in the hospital. 
The following Tuesday we attended her funeral. My father had picked out the colors. We buried my loving mother in pink roses, because she was a former cancer survivor, and we were blessed to have her as long as we did.
For the months following my mother’s death I became deeply depressed. The only thing that eased the pain from losing my mother, were the roses. When they bloomed in the spring my sprits suddenly lifted. The roses were my life, and I don’t know what I’d do without them. 
         2 years go by and I ended up meeting a nice guy who joined my ecology class. His name was Dylan and we immediately hit it off. He gave me everything a girl could’ve ever wanted and treated me like a princess. I loved him more than anything in the world. We talked about moving in together and buying a house after college. We talked about getting married and having a daughter named Rose for my love of roses. His handsome blonde hair and chiseled feature would make a beautiful baby.
         We went through college and eventually graduated together and got married. We lived in a small townhouse in Vermont for a long time after that. After trying many times to have the baby I so desperately wanted, the doctor came to tell that I was infertile. Dylan tried to tell me we could always adopt, always have a child if I wanted, but I didn’t. It wasn’t fair! If I couldn’t have a child that was my own flesh blood, how would she share the love of roses like my mother did with me? 
         Again for a long time I became mute. I could not eat or sleep. Dylan became very distant and we hardly spoke. Everything we had was gone. Nothing made me happy anymore. Nothing would until I had a baby rose. I would look out at our garden and wait for them to bloom, but even then the roses did not make me happy. 
It was the next winter before I found out. I knew something had gone wrong because all of the roses had turned over black instead of falling off and dying. Dylan had come home late that night and seemed very stressed. I decided that night while he slept I’d go through his phone. 
         He had 3 missed calls and a text from a girl named “Lisa”. The text read:
“You HAVE to stay home tonight! She won’t stop crying unless you’re here! –Lisa”
         Who wouldn’t stop crying? Did someone care that much about my dear Dylan to cry when he’s not there? I remember him saying he worked at the office with a girl named Lisa, so I decided to send her a text replying, “Get her to stop crying, I can’t be that important.” 
         After that I waited for a reply for several minutes before I got a reply back.
“Of course you’re important to her love! You’re her daddy! And she needs you here! Just take off work this one night!”
WORK? SHE though HE was at WORK? He was supposed to be at work all day! And WHO’S daddy was she talking about? 
         I carefully went through his address book in his phone and found her home address. I silently walked downstairs, and out the door, grabbing a hoe from the garden before leaving in the car.
I knew the black roses meant something was wrong. 
         I returned a few hours later with his “baby” in our car. I left her there while I waited behind the house. About an hour later I see Dylan walk out the front door to leave, when he suddenly stops when he sees the child in the car with the windows up. 
He screams “ALLISON!” 
         Is THAT the things name? So it IS his! At this point I was furious! 
         As he went to unlock the door to retrieve the child, I pulled him backwards so he fell into the garden. I picked up the hoe and shouted “ALL I WANTED WERE THE RED ROSES!”
The hoe dug into his head once, and I felt all the love I’d ever had for him release, into the small, tiny bits of pieces that were once my loving husband. When I was all through I tossed his body into the cellar along with his companion’s. 
         At least now the black roses are blood red once again.
         A beautiful thing, the roses are. 
         Little rose lives with me now and she has just enrolled in preschool. She loves the roses as much as I do, but her favorite ones are the dead petals. 
“So pretty!” she said, “Even after they’re dead!” 
         I always agree with her on that. Sometimes she asks where daddy is and I must tell her, “Simple, Prim Rose, ask the petals!”

For several years now I've had this story inside me like lead shot in my gut. I've considered telling it hundreds of times over, but the sheer magnitude of it has always stopped me. With six months of therapy under my belt, I figure it's time. I know now that I won't be free of this thing until I write it out. Settle in, because I can't tell this story in ten thousand characters or less. I'll be lucky to get through it in twice or three times that. It's hard enough to sum up everyday life, and this story is anything but.

I had a recurring dream when I was really little. I would wake up in the dream, and standing beside my bed was the most beautiful lady I had ever seen. Long, straight hair and long, flowing gown, both of the purest silver like captured moonlight. She would smile at me so sincerely, so lovingly, as she sat down beside me and began to speak.

The words were comforting like a lullaby, but I couldn't understand them. Though she spoke quietly, her voice seemed to echo through the room, through the universe, backwards and forwards in time, begging to be understood by my adolescent brain.

I always tried to stay in the dream as long as I could, but eventually I would drift back off to sleep in the dream and wake up to my mom gently rousing me for breakfast.

My mom died when I was seven, and the dreams stopped. Well, I prefer to say she died. She was murdered. I hate that word. It's so cold; it falls off the tongue like shards of glass.

My mom was a health nut; protein shakes, weight lifting, yoga, the whole lot. Above all, she loved to jog. We had several acres of untamed land around the house. She always woke me up about an hour before dad went to work so she could go take a forty-minute run through the forest and along the creek; it befell dad to make me breakfast and get me ready for school.

They found her by the lake south of the house. And hanging from the old weeping willow in the middle of the pasture. And scattered across the countryside in a ten-mile radius around the house - but that was mostly after the funeral. All told, the casket had about two-thirds of a person inside when we finally buried her. They never found her head.

We used to be a close family - me, my sister, my mom and dad ... Losing mom, and losing her the way we did, splintered us. Dad lost himself in his advertising job. My sister turned inward, and fell into drugs and alcohol, when the kids our age figured out how to get ahold of it. Besides his job, dad's other mission was to keep his girls safe from all harm, and he took that one even more seriously. Leanna got it a little easier since she was four years older. I was taken out of school. Dad hired a tutor to homeschool me. I wasn't allowed out after dark. I wasn't allowed out without supervision. Unless I was being taken to town for some reason, I wasn't allowed to range out of eyesight or earshot of the house.

I started writing obsessively. Mom taught me how to keep a journal as soon as I could hold a crayon. I still have my very first one; the pages are filled with scribbles in different colors, and some pages are nearly colored solid. I guess I thought that good writing should fill as much of the page as possible. I remember how unabashedly delighted mom was to see every single entry. I guess writing is my way of honoring her memory.

I took mom's death hard, but it was a long while before I really understood what it meant that mom was killed. Dad told me that a very bad man had taken my mom from us, that she was dead, that she'd never come back. All things considered, he handled that conversation pretty well. Nothing could have softened the blow, though. My mommy was gone. I loved her and wanted her, but I'd never see her again. She was dead, and death meant people were gone forever. We weren't a religious household, so at that young age I was coming to grips with the fact that mom didn't exist anymore. There was a hole in my world. It was like that feeling when you go to grab something like a can of Coke without looking at it, and you end up swiping at the air because that can wasn't where you expected it to be.

I healed in time. For several years I was just chugging along, going through the motions, numb to the outside world. Closing myself off was easy; the outside world mainly consisted of our house and the clearing around it. My dad was mostly an authoritarian figure when he was home, always vigilant but never available. My sister babysat me when dad was gone, though she usually left me entirely to my own devices. She was homeschooled too, but she could drive; sometimes she would simply leave me at the house and go off to do Big People stuff. 

That Big People stuff, as I've written, consisted mainly of shooting up with her friends, or scoring more dope.

She had been chasing her high for ten years straight when I turned eighteen. Leanna had been living with her junkie boyfriend for a couple years. She was never able to hold down a job for very long, so she would spread her legs for a dealer until he let her move in. That was how she kept up her habit. When that didn't work out, she'd beg dad for more money and find another dealer to fuck.

It was a miserable, shady life for her, and she would have kept going until it killed her. And it did.

-------

My dad got the call at four in the morning on a Tuesday. I remember waking up, bleary-eyed, to see him looking like death warmed over. I had only seen that tortured look on his face once before, and I shot straight up, wide awake, when I saw it that night.

""Leanna,"" I said.

He nodded. My heart sank into my stomach and stopped beating. She was living in the city, a forty-minute drive away. A long, miserable forty-minute drive away. Neither dad nor I spoke a word. He sat stoically, knuckles white on the wheel, crying silently. I might as well have been dead myself. I stared at my lap, taking in nothing, thinking nothing, feeling nothing. Where my heart had been was a gaping hole.

Dad led me by the hand into the funeral home, and sat me down in a chair where I waited motionlessly as he went to identify the body. I heard his wracking sobs as he came back to get me some time later. I reflexively turned towards the sound. The funeral director and another man were practically holding him upright as he stumbled across the lobby. They took me up and walked us to a private area with a couple of couches, where we both collapsed.

I sat on the couch, mindlessly pulling at my hair, gazing at my father as he poured out his grief. He had always been a reserved man, but the dam had finally broken. We had no family but ourselves. Mom had grown up in a foster home, and had no love for the people she called her ""fake parents."" My biological grandma had a stroke and passed in her sleep. My grandpa followed not long after, as old widowers are wont to do. I never knew either of them. If we had any extended family, we never knew them.

I half-noticed the little hank of hair tangled around my hand. I hadn't felt it when I ripped it out.

Dad cried for a long time, eventually slumping sideways into his couch. When his voice was gone and his sobs came without tears, he stood up. He seemed to be carrying the weight of a thousand suns on his shoulders. At his slight nod in my direction, I stood up myself, and we walked together to the car. He pulled out a rumpled piece of paper and his phone, and dialed a number. We were at a motel fifteen minutes later. We went to sleep in our clothes.

The next few days were a blur. There were arrangements to be made, and that was dad's job. I went to town and bought us clothes and toiletries to keep us going while we stayed at the motel.

The funeral was a small affair back home. We laid her to rest in the plot next to mom's. Dad and I were the only mourners. A minister said some words, we each tossed a handful of dirt on the grave, and it was over. It was over.

-----

We stepped through the doorway and into our home. Quiet pervaded the empty space, the sort of quiet only found indoors. Clocks ticking, a gentle hum from our air conditioner, our breathing and the stecatto hitches as one or the other of us suppressed a sob.

We stood alone in an empty house, our bodies kept upright through some force of habit or instinct in the absence of warm blood flowing through our veins. My sister had imparted some vitality into this place, unbeknownst to us, even after our mother's murder. As our Leanna died, so died the house. I might have turned to see the land itself had withered, without so much as a shrug.

Dad pulled the door shut, and the click of its latch, impossibly loud against the quiet, signaled the start of our new life, or merely the end of the old.

I glanced at the clock: almost noon. The gears in my brain began turning, cast about for something to fill the time until bed, and found nothing. It then latched on to the only activity left, and my feet carried me to the stairs with sliding steps. They balked briefly, as if puzzled by a reason to lift off the ground more than half an inch, and then continued. A minute later, I fell backwards, collapsing onto my purple comforter. My toes brushed the carpet from time to time, but that didn't matter. Nothing did. Apathy sang me a lullaby, and the world faded away.

My staggered footsteps echoed through the tunnel, meshing with the steadfast crashing of many feet behind me. Searing hot agony blazed through my side. I had to keep running, I had to reach the end before -

I snapped upright, eyes unfocused, drenched in sweat. I bent forward reflexively and threw up bile into my lap. I sobbed, and choked on my own vomit. I coughed until my throat was raw, until the vessels in my eyes popped, and then collapsed sideways.

Good morning, world.

**DREAMESCAPE**


I was afraid - but for the first time since all this started I wasn’t afraid for myself.  Lexi was hanging from the tower, just like Kelly was two nights ago.  She was wearing the same black tank top and underwear she had on when I left her back in the pit, and I could tell from the mascara marks streaming down her cheeks she was crying.

.

“*David!  Help me!*” she screamed.  I got up from the bench and surveyed my surroundings.  It appeared to be just us – for the moment anyway.  I was also wearing the same clothes I had on in the pit, the same clothes I’d purposely gone to bed in.  I began to run as fast as I could towards her.  At first, I rapidly closed the gap – I was only about twenty yards away now and could see the panic on her face.  

.

However, with each step I took the gravel I was running thru seemed to get thicker and thicker.  My feet started sinking into the ground deeper and deeper.  Each time I stuck my foot in the gravel, it became harder and harder to pull out.  I began to feel drained; it felt like I’d been running all night.  Finally, about twenty feet from the tower I couldn’t take another step.  I collapsed to my hands and knee in complete exhaustion –my right leg still stuck in the earth.

.

“*David, help me!  I can’t move my arms!  I’m scared David!*” For the first time in the short time I’d known Lexi she sounded like a little girl.  Her tough facade was completely gone, replaced by the terrified little child in front of me now.  “I’m stuck, Lexi.  I can’t move!” I answered back.  She began openly crying.  “I’m scared, David.  You **have** to help me!” I was at a loss.  I wanted to help, I wanted to get up – but I’d never been so tired in my life.  I could barely keep my head up.  


.

Then, in the stillness of the night, the silence was broken.  Off to my right I became aware of a familiar sound, a sound that in that moment I couldn’t quite place.  A rhythmic, metallic squeaking noise that I *knew* I should recognize.  Lexi’s eyes met mine and without exchanging words we both knew things were about to get a lot worse.  As she turned her head to her left – her expression change from fearful dread, to sheer unadulterated horror.  I could feel her scream reverberate all over my body.  

.

I turned to look - it was Kelly.  She was sitting in the middle swing of the swing set about thirty feet away.  Both her arms were wrapped around the chains that connected to either side of the seat, with her hands resting in her lap.  The open wound from her chin to her waist was clearly visible and fresh blood covered the front of her body.  Her head rested against the chain to her right, blankly starring straight ahead.  There was such sadness in her eyes.  

.

The terrible image of Kelly momentarily blinded me from what was going on.  Kelly was moving backwards in the swing, back to something behind her - it was the little black-haired girl.  When Kelly swung to where she was, the little girl gently pushed her forward again, much like a mother would a really small child - carefully forward, as not to push the child out of the swing.  

.

Lexi was screaming and crying like a little baby now.  “*God no, please god no…*” she sobbed.  Turning back to me, “*Please help me David, I don’t want to die!  Oh my god, no… please no!*”

.

The helplessness I felt with Kelly washed all over me again.  Gathering all the strength I could muster, I tried again to pull my leg out of the gravel.  It barely moved an inch.  Looking back towards the swings again, the little girl had moved next Kelly.  Reaching out, she grabbed the chain of the swing, stopping it on the next pass.  The little girl, her hair covering most of her face, bent down next to Kelly.  She lovingly brushed Kelly’s hair off her face, and then kissed her on the forehead.   Kelly never even blinked.

.

Then, the little girl started to walk towards the tower.  Lexi screamed louder, “*No!  God no!  DAVID?!  Please help me!!*” Lexi was fighting now, her arms and legs kicking against the chains, the clatter almost drowning out her screams.   The little black-haired girl was almost there now, an evil smile noticeable thru the long strands of hair dangling in front of her face.  

.

As if accepting her fate, Lexi stopped kicking and screaming – I could only hear her faintly sobbing, shaking like someone stuck outside in a freezing rainstorm without a jacket.  My heart was breaking; I couldn’t believe this was going to happen again.  I’d failed miserably – and somebody else was going to suffer for my mistakes.  

.

The black-haired girl was directly in front of Lexi now, with her back to me.  When Lexi made eye contact with her, her eyes widened and she let out another scream as all the color drained from her face.  I don’t know what she saw.  I don’t *want* to know what she saw.

.

I couldn’t let this happen – I had to make it stop.  If this was a dream, I needed to wake up – and wake up now!  I started pinching the back of my hand as hard as I could.  Nothing.  I slapped my face, again nothing.  Dropping my head, I couldn’t bear to watch anymore.  Then I saw it, the outline of my pocket knife in my pants pocket.  As quick as humanly possible, I dug it out and opened the blade.  If this didn’t wake me up, I didn’t know what would.  Looking back at the tower I could see the pale arm of the little girl extending up towards Lexi.  If I was going to do this, it had to be now.  Taking the knife, I jabbed the blade into my thigh a couple inches above my knee.  When I did, the black-haired girl snapped her head back towards me.  Before I closed my eyes in pain I could see the anger in her face, her eyes glowing red.

.

The pain was immense - I let out a loud cry and jerked upright in bed.  I’d gone to sleep with the light on, so right away I could see the little pocket knife sticking up out of my leg.  “Holy Shit!” I said aloud.  Reflexes took over.  I instantly yanked the knife out and tossed it to the floor.  When I did, blood poured from the wound and down to my sheets.  I had to stop the bleeding I thought to myself, so I grabbed my leg and began to apply pressure with my palm.  Looking around I saw some dirty shirts lying on the floor.  Rolling out of bed, I grabbed the nearest one and clamped it down on the cut and limped my way towards the bathroom down the hall.  

.

My brother was already standing in the doorway of his room as I passed.  “Dude, what the hell did you do?” I ignored him as I continued.  In the bathroom I grabbed a hand towel from the rack, wet it and replaced the shirt I’d been using.  “Mom’s gonna be pissed dude, that’s one of the good ones” he said, referring to the flowered covered towel I was using to soak up the blood.  I gave him a “what do I care” look and proceeded to dig thru the cabinets looking for something to clean the wound.  

.

My mother, being the typical hypochondriac nurse, had plenty of choices available.  I grabbed something I couldn’t pronounce, and poured it on my leg.  That didn’t help the pain one bit.   

.

“Seriously David, what did you do?  That looks terrible.”  My mind was only now beginning the catch up with events; I had to come up with something quick.  “Um, I guess I fell asleep with my knife in my bed.  I must have rolled over on it…” Ok, that sounded lame even to me.  “Holy crap!  How far did it go in?!” he asked.  “I don’t know, half inch?  Maybe more” I replied.  

.

Looking at his watch, “It’s almost seven, Mom should be home any minute.  Dude, I think you’re gonna need stitches.”  Stitches.  I think if you asked any twelve year old kid what fear number one would be, that would be it.  Before this week I would’ve agreed.  


.

By the time my mother got home, most of the bleeding had stopped.  Unfortunately my brother was right and mom didn’t even get a chance to change clothes before heading with me right back to work.       

.

Lying on the hospital gurney in a curtained off section of the hospital ER, I was finally able to think about the situation.  Sure I was able to get myself out of the dream, but I still wasn’t certain how Lexi had fared.  Remembering how angry the little black-haired girl looked, my guess would be that it’d worked.  Hopefully I was right.  

.

*************

.

Most of the time at the ER was a blur.  I think I dosed off a couple times but I couldn’t be sure.  I only vaguely remember my mom’s lecture on knife safety while getting the stitches, but I distinctly remember the shot to deaden the pain - and the other one for tetanus I got before leaving.  That one hurt the most. 

.

Mom had to help me up the carport steps and onto the living room couch.  It was still late Saturday morning so she turned on cartoons, Bugs Bunny was just ending and Scooby Doo was coming on.  “They ruined that show when they added Scrappy” I thought to myself, but since this was before the days of remote controls and a hundred different choices I had to suffer thru it.  

.

If I’d have known Emma’s phone number I could have called and asked her how things were going.  I could have discreetly asked enough about Lexi to maybe figure out if she was ok.  But I didn’t know the number, and there was no way Mom was going to let me out of the house today.  I was stuck without an answer for now.

.

Mom sat in the chair across from me for about an hour.  She pretended to be watching TV, but I think she was just so tired she was zoning out.  Finally she got up.  “What do you want for lunch?” she asked heading for the Kitchen.  But before I could answer there was a light knock at the carport door.   “If that’s Greg you’re not going anywhere” I heard Mom say as she made her way to the door.  From where I sat in the living room I had no view of the carport entry, only the section of the kitchen furthest from that door.  Our house was pretty small though, so I could hear everything clearly.

.

 “Hello ma’am, you must be David’s mom.  How are you?”  It was a girl.  “Yes I am.  I’m fine, how are you?” my mother answered.  “I’m good ma’am, thank you.  I’m a friend of David’s, my name’s Lexi.  I was wondering if he was home.”  Relief overwhelmed me, she was ok.  As quick as the feeling of relief came, it was gone.  “Oh no…” I thought to myself.  Just the appearance of Lexi would get me grounded for the rest of the summer.  

.

“Yes, he’s home but he’s had a little accident.  I don’t think he’s up to coming outside today.”  Then, what she said next completely floored me.  “He’s inside watching TV, would you like to come in and say ‘hello’?”  She’s letting Lexi inside the house?!  Lexi?!  On her best day she looked like the spawn of Satan, I could only imagine what she looked like today.

.

“Thank you Mrs. Anderson, I’d love too!” then you could hear the screen door open and Lexi step into the house.  “Lexi you said?  You must be new to the neighborhood, I don’t recall seeing you around before.”  she replied, “Yes ma’am, we moved in just last weekend.  Is David ok?”  “Oh, sure.  He’s fine, I’ll let him tell you all about it” Mom said as they stepped into view.

.

I couldn’t believe my eyes.  The girl standing in the entryway to the living room was NOT the Lexi I knew.  She was wearing a pink and white tie-dyed t-shirt with jean shorts that were rolled up just over the knee.  The heavy mascara and black nail polish were gone, and her hair was pulled back into a single pony tail behind her head – she was even wearing a gold cross necklace around her neck.  But the biggest outward change to me wasn’t any of those things, it was her smile.  There was a genuine warmth behind her eyes that wasn’t there before.

.

“Hey David, what happened to you?” she asked.  My mother was behind her and couldn’t see her face when she shot me a quick knowing look before feigning ignorance.  “Oh, nothing really.  Pretty stupid actually, I guess I rolled over onto my pocket knife while I was sleeping last night” I said.  “Ouch!” Lexi replied, “That must have hurt like a… um, really, really bad.”  

.

“Please, have a seat and make yourself at home Lexi.  Anything I can get for you?” Mom asked.  “No thank you Mrs. Anderson, I’m ok” she answered heading for the chair across from me Mom had sat previously.  “Ok then, I’ll be in the kitchen if you change your mind” and with that left the room.

.

Knowing my mom could hear, Lexi continued on sounding as nonchalant as she could yet with an extremely serious look on her face, “Funny thing, when I turned the corner onto your street it looked like there was a police car in your driveway.  It kinda scared me a bit.”  “A police car?” my mother asked from the other room.  “Yes ma’am, but it turned out it was at your neighbor’s house, not here.”  

.

Mom was instantly in the entryway, Lexi swiftly changing her serious glare back to one of indifference.  “There’s a police car next door?” she asked again with a deep look of concern on her face.  “Yes ma’am, it’s still there right now” Lexi said.  “I’m sorry, you’ll have to excuse me.  David, I’ll get your lunch in a second – I need to check on Ms. Elliott.”  She still hadn’t had a chance to change out of her nurse uniform from the previous night, but was out the door in a matter of seconds.

.

When she was sure Mom was gone, Lexi stood up and walked over to the edge of the couch.  She just looked at me for a moment before dropping to her knees and wrapping her arms around my stomach, burying her face into my chest.  I laid there with my arms in the air, not exactly knowing what to do with them.  That was until I could feel her tears soak into my shirt.  She was crying.

.

I awkwardly put my arms around her shoulders and she stayed like that for at least a minute before she finally spoke.  “I thought you were dead.”  She paused, “I was so scared and crying so hard, all I could see was the flash of the knife when you stabbed yourself.  I couldn’t tell where… then, I was back in my room.”  Rising up, she quickly wiped the tears from her eyes without looking at me, and then rested her hands on her lap.  “Then when I saw the police car… I lost it.”

.

“I sat on the curb next to the school for, I don’t know, fifteen minutes maybe – just looking at that tower thing.  I couldn’t believe it.  I finally got up the nerve to come the rest of the way, I had to see what was going on.  When I figured out it was Kelly’s house, well… Well, you know.”  She paused again to wipe her face.  Still looking down she said “Thank you… nobody’s ever, well… just thanks…”

.

I was stunned.  “Let me get this right, you’re *thanking me*?” I asked.  “Lexi, this whole thing is MY fault!  If it wasn’t for me none of this would be happening.”  She hesitated for a second then continued, “I know, I get that – but, I’m not a very good person and I’ve been nothing but mean to you.  You didn’t have to do what you did, you didn’t have to stop it – you weren’t in any danger.  I can’t say I would have done the same thing for you if the situation was different.  That’s all…”

.

“Besides, it’s not all your fault” she continued.  “If I’d of left you alone from the beginning I wouldn’t be involved either.  You warned me but I wouldn’t listen.  I shouldn’t have been hell bent on messing with you, so it’s not ALL your fault.

.

I laid there for a moment just looking at her, she looked so different.  “Nice shirt” I said trying to lighten the mood.  I barely got the words out before she punched me in the shoulder.  “Ouch!” I snapped trying to act like it didn’t hurt as bad as it really did.  “Be nice” she said.  “I took these from Emma.  I heard you telling her about your mom that day at our house.  I was upstairs eavesdropping.  I knew I wouldn’t get passed the front door looking like I did… I did this for you so don’t give me shit about it.”  

.

I laughed.  “Well, you certainly pulled it off.  I like the necklace - nice touch.”  She laughed, “I stole it from Emma too, ironic, huh?”  


.

Lexi stopped smiling and got serious again.  “So, now what?”

.

Looking at Lexi, I didn’t have any answers.  “I don’t know” I said, “let’s talk about last night…”

dazvn,7,8,1qw47f,14,"He is back again, this is the 3rd night in a row, he won’t leave me alone.

He once again is just peering through my kitchen window, looking directly at me, waiting… watching? I don’t know who he is or what he wants, he has a weird mask on, this is the best image I can find http://imgur.com/ZVOvjqz, and is wearing a long black duffel coat.

I’m going to call the police this time, I am seriously scared, going back to the first night; I was just sitting here browsing Reddit when I suddenly started hearing tapping noises getting louder and louder, I made my way into the kitchen and nearly had a heart attack when I saw him standing there, tapping the beak thing of his mask against my window - I went to grab the phone to call the police and returned to the kitchen but he was gone. I thought it was just kids.

The second time I’m pretty sure I was dreaming, I woke up during the night, it was freezing so I had the covers over my head, I pulled them down and he was standing at the foot of my bed, by blood ran cold and I was frozen solid - I’ve never been so scared in all my life. It must have been a dream, I only remember waking up in the morning normally after this - I can’t call the police because I had a dream, right?

Anyway tonight he is back, again the at the kitchen window (at the back of the house, in the garden) I have no idea how he got in as I have a locked gate, I live alone and the next nearest house is down the street.

Oh crap! he has started banging the beak on the window again, it’s getting louder and louder, I’m pretty sure the window is going to break, I’m calling the police right now…

I’m speaking to an officer, she is saying she cannot make out what I’m saying, crap, I’ll hang up and redial, stupid old phone, thats when I hear a voice come on the line, it sounds gravely and deep “don’t”, “don’t what - who is this” I say? “don’t do that - I’m coming for you” *click*

I run into the kitchen, he is gone! I try and redial the police but there is no dial tone on the phone - maybe he cut the wires? I go and look at the window, it’s starting to shatter from the tapping of the beak, I look into the garden but it’s so dark I cannot see anything.

Suddenly my whole house plummets into darkness, has he cut the power too? I scramble to try and find a flashlight, crap the batteries are flat, thats when I hear what sounds like running upstairs, heavy running, like an adult, I run out of my back door and start heading for the house down the street, I turn around and see him looking from an upstairs window, just staring at me, and then I see it up ahead in the trees, another guy dressed the same with the bird mask… There are more of these guys? Bird men

What do I do guys? I’m standing here with my iPad an no weapons (I could bash him with the iPad I suppose?)

warasd,2,7,1qvhaq,15,"Those words still plague my brain. I would've never thought that something like this would happen so close to me. Jack was lying on the floor in a pool of his own blood, not quite dead, but close to it. I was the last one he saw. And I was the only one who heard those words slip out of his cold, bluish lips.

Lets go back to the start, it was a Friday night, me and my best buddy Jack decided to go have some fun and maybe pick up some ladies at our local bar. After we had a few drinks a cute girl with light blonde hair walked into the bar, me, being more interested in brunettes, decided to let Jack pick her up. So I said to Jack ""check your six o' clock"" so, Jack turned around and looked at the girl, then turned back to me and said ""how should we play this?"". Me and Jack liked to stretch the truth a bit when it came to picking up ladies, so I said to him ""We're business partners. We co-own a sports clothing company."". So Jack agreed, and we walked over towards the girl. Little did I know, that was the biggest mistake of my life. We started out by introducing ourselves, ya know, all the usual stuff. Her name was Rebecca, but she said people called her whisper, because she could hear spirits talking. We found this quite peculiar but went with it because she was a solid 10. It got pretty late, Jack and whisper seemed to be getting to know each other quite well, so he decided to take her home. We were all pretty drunk so I decided to crash at Jacks place because it was much closer to the bar, so the cab would cost less. Good thing I did, otherwise no one would've been there to witness what happened. The cab pulled up to Jacks place, and we all went inside, I fell asleep on the couch, while Jack and whisper retired to Jack's room. I woke up about 10 minutes later to a ungodly scream, and I brushed it off because who knows, maybe the girl gets loud during the act. HUGE mistake. 5 minutes later, I still hadn't fallen back asleep. I then heard another scream, followed by a huge crash. So, I rushed into Jack's room, and I kid you not, the bed was lifted about 2 fucking feet off of the ground. Jack was clinging to the headboard facing the end of the bed, and whisper was yelling into the air. She yelled ""Put the fucking bed down right now dad!"", as soon as she said that, the bed crashed back down to the ground. The air felt eerily quiet. Then whisper shouted ""we have to get out of here, now!"" so, we all ran at the door, which then slammed shut in my face, and jammed. It wouldn't open. I tried kicking it open, but that didn't work. We were trapped. Jack then got flung against the wall, and started grabbing at his neck as if he was being choked, he started spitting up blood, everywhere. He then fell to the ground, I ran over to him, and asked him if he was okay, he was on the edge of death. I heard something behind me so I briefly turned around to find that whisper was gone, it was just me and Jack in the room. He gestured for me to come closer, he them whispered those words. He said ""I can see my mom up there, she's smiling at me. Tell my dad she's doing fine, and that we'll be waiting for him."" 
Jack then died.

I will never forget those words. ",We're waiting.,22
Kaghiti,4,11,1qtux0,15,"My dreams have always been somewhat odd. I dream about death, distortion, and decisions. Maybe it's because my life just isn't going the way it was meant to or something odd like that, but enough of the explanation and onto my dreams. Last week, Tuesday I believe, I had a dream in which I was at school, everything was normal and nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary. That WAS true until the person I hated with a burning passion walked over to me and straight out punched me in the face. The world became static and blur mixed with the noise of my classmates declaring a fight by going ""ooooh"". After regaining my vision I was no longer in the classroom but somewhere else. The ground was rough and scratched my skin as I got up. ""Sand?"" I thought ""No that's too hard to be sand. I was a bit stupid thinking it was sand although in reality it was a cave, but the texture of the stone felt sandlike. I looked around but saw nothing, until I looked a bit farther in front of me. A red light, faint but noticeable from a distance. It seemed as if the dream was planned out for me and beckoning me to walk over to the light, I did so with caution. When I got about 5 or 7 feet within the light I saw something; no someone. Glowing a now bright red in the darkness was a person, no wrong again, it was a demon. Slowly turning its head towards me it said two simple words that woke me from my slumber: EAT THEM.",Dreams,26
The_Black_Apostle,2,7,1qzc5p,12,"Like many people growing up in rural Alabama, I was just above the poverity line, but that was fine because everyone else was the same way. Money was never an issue; if someone couldn't afford something, they worked for the owner until they'd made enough money to buy it. But, I suppose I'm rambling about sonething that has nothing to do with the story at hand.

Like every rural town, we had our fair share of legends, and when everyone knew everyone's business, those legends expanded every year. My experience with Black Warrior River, a murky creek that runs into the Alabama River, was woven into our towns tapestry only a few years ago. It was winter, mid-December and in the prime of hunting season, when I decided to take a brief vacation along Black Warrior's muddy banks.

The Indians who lived there told stories like you'd expect, the sort with man-eating fish and vengeful spirits, but I never paid any mind to them. Winter was a nice enough time, and Black Warrior was a nice enough creek, so I felt reasonably safe sleeping in a tent, miles from the nearest house. Still, like any hunter, I was packing, and made sure to have enough orange clothing to avoid an unfortunate accident.

It was the third morning that Rocky walked into my little campsite, and I would be lying if I said I didn't welcome the company. Rocky was some kind of mongrel dog, an attractive sort of mutt that was the favorite dog of many a country boy, and unlike most of his kind, he had a collar denoting his name. ""Yo, dawg,"" I said when I first saw him, in my usual greeting to stray dogs. I didn't expect an answer, and didn't receive one, but that suited me just fine.

He was a good boy, the sort to follow any human who felt like leading him around, the sort who was owned by neighborhoods instead of families. ""Let's go see what trouble we can stir up, boy,"" I said, uncasing my rifle as I did every morning, because I'd always been told cold air could warp a scope's settings. Rocky just cocked his head and barked, but followed like I'd spoken his language.

We hiked for what must have been three hours, by the sun, which meant it should have been about seven in the morning, given that we'd left with the sunrise. I wasn't surprised to hear a couple gunshots around me, most of which were the sort of caliber hunters liked to use. Rocky didn't mind, so I suppose I didn't, either. Hunters were normal for December, so were bloodstains and bulletholes in trees. Leaving slaughtered deer lying around wasn't, and God help me, but seeing what soemone did to that poor animal stirred more than anger in me.

I'm not exactly averse to blood and gore, but something about the way this deer was strung up irked me, and I'm not too proud to admit that I was a little scared. It was a buck, easily over two hundred pounds, and hung from a water oak by its own innards, not that much of it was in the tree. Fur, meat, and bits of bone were scattered in a twenty-yard radius from the tree, which grew alone in a clearign slightly larger than the gore field. I didn't like it, and neither did Rocky, who had raised the scruff of his neck and growled at the corpse. ""Let's move on, boy.""

So we walked, and noticed the only sound around us was our footsteps, which wasn't unusual for winter, but there should have been a gunshot here and there. Instead, we had dead silence, and I distincly remember thinking those very words. Bears, maybe mountain lions, weren't unheard of, but they weren't exactly common, so I was hesitant to believe one of them did the poor buck in. Despite the cold, I held my 30-30 with a steadiness I more expected from a statue, and looked around fast enoguh to cover everything Rocky couldn't.

We found a local landmark, a house carved into a cliff, built by the federal government for a surveyor during the eighteen hundreds, and decided to stop for a brief rest, it being about noon then. To this day, I regret going in there, maybe more than I regret anything I've ever done before or since, but my gut said everything was okay, so I didn't pay Rocky's nervousness any mind. As I stepped inside, because the house lacked doors and windows, by which I mean added structures, as it obviously had to have the holes for them to qualify as a house in my book, I noticed a few chunks were broken off the doorway, coming from the inside, and I could only tell by looking at the breakage.

I was spooked, I'll admit, but I was also tired, cold, and hungry enough to not care. In case you didn't know, December in Alabama can get pretty cold, especially on the ass-end of the mountains like Black Warrior was. I didn't smell it until I was right on it, but I suspect Rocky knew while we were still outside, and I nearly slipped on a dark puddle, half-frozen in the morning chill. Like many men of the rural persuasion, I recognized blood when I saw it.

A tangled mess of meat rested at the back of the house, at the beginning of the blood trail. At first, I didn't know what it was, but the torn bits of cloth and scattered brass casings told me it was another person, one who had been attacked by... something. A Glock rested next to the body, which I assume was male, but there wasn't much to go on at the time. Scared, backed away, and tripped on a little composition notebook.

It was a cheap thing, probably bought from Walmart, and had a few scattered words here and there, but it was mostly full of drawings. Figuring there was no sense in leaving, and possibly running into whatever had caught this guy, I sat my ass down and flipped through, and don't think my cell phone had any reception, or I would have had the game warden down there faster than I could shit myself.

Apparently, Clark, the dead guy, was studying Native American culture at UAB, and found out about my town's legends from a friend of his who'd once lived in the area. I say once, because I knew the man in general had been the local pastor, and had died four years prior. Black Warrior was apparently the site of a massacre when Jackson was president, where soldiers had killed the indegenous people when they refused to relocate.

The legend goes that they guarded the people of the valley from He Who Hungers, a spirit that supposedly drove men to killed their families and friends, before fleeing into the woods and becoming a monster that was neither man nor animal. Personally, I figured the guy was mistaken, because it sounded like a wendigo, and we were a ways away from any Inuit tribes, to put it lightly.

Rocky had gone outside to piss, or whatever it is dogs do when they  leave humans alone. I heard him yelp, then nothing. I looked outside and realized I'd been reading for the better part of an hours, so I decided to forget about getting back to camp, and get to my truck near the road. ""Rocky!"" I yelled, hoping to get him to follow me, if only to spare him the fate that befell the buck and Clark. There was a rustling that soundign like something running to me, but it stopped just beyond the scrub about thirty feet ahead of me.

I pointed my rifle at the bush and called for him again. Whatever it was, it was a bit bigger than Rocky, and a bit bigger than me, so I did the only sensible thing, and shot it. It howled like something out of a nightmare and bolted away, shrieking at the top of its lungs. I sprinted as fast as I could, and I couldn't care less about where I went, as long as it wasn't where that thing went.

I ran for, hell, I don't kniw how long, but I finally reached the highway. I barely had time to jump in truck before that thing came back, and ran across the road on two legs. It yelled at me again, something like what I imagine hell sounds like, the screaming of a thousand tortured souls. I drove off then, and didn't stop until I was at a gas station a few miles from my house, too scared to go home i case that thing followed me, but I was being silly then,  i know.

If you're looking for resolution, don't. I went to the police and reported it, but they never found any evidence of Clark or the dead deer. I checked with a relative of mine who works at UAB and found put Clark was indeed a real person who attended UAB and went missing a few months before. I still live in the area, but haven't gone hunting in years. Rocky is still around, but he's on three legs these days. Things haven't changed much, but every now and then, I flip through Clark's notebook when Rocky stops by for a visit, and read.

TheCreepyPastafarian,34,7,1r0hdg,13,"As you can tell from my screen name I read a lot of CreepyPasta.  I may have read something I shouldn't have.  Some weird things have been happening the past few nights and if I could get a quick response in case ""something happens"" that keeps me from coming back, that'd be nice.

This might have been a bad idea, but I read about Astral Projection and started trying to practice it but I've had no luck.  But since then, I've been hearing things before I sleep and when I wake up.

A few weeks ago I started hearing the sound of boiling water coming from my kitchen in the middle of the night; after that it was quiet conversation; and after that it was the sound of a light switch being turned on and off.

In the mornings I hear scratching, and speaking and I can't pinpoint where it could be coming from.

What happened last night is what made me scared enough to write about this.  My eyes were shut as I was trying to fall asleep, and out of nowhere I heard typing on my keyboard, which is only a few feet from my bed.  I was too scared to open my eyes and look, so I acted like I was asleep.  This morning I saw a new icon on my desktop, it was a jpg, eventually I opened it and it was just black.  

I deleted it off my computer completely.  I've chugged a few Monsters (Energy Drinks) so I don't have to sleep tonight.

Please, if anyone knows what is going on I would appreciate some help.",Please Tell Me This Has Happened To Someone,20

__________________

*July 22nd: At two a.m. the home security system at 319 Dallas Street went mad; the shrill beeps of the smoke detector, the piercing wail of the burglar alarm and flat chirp of the carbon dioxide alert rising up at once in a mad chorus. The noise sent Bobby Dooley tumbling out of bed, his head aching and his heart trying to tear its way from his chest. Not a good way for a man his age and weight to be awoken. He blundered around in the dark, trying to find the wall pad that would disable the noise but just as he got his bearings in the darkened room the television blared to life. Blinded he misstepped and cracked his toe on the corner of his dresser. The sound of his agonized cursing set the dog barking downstairs.*

*And that was a real problem because Bobby Dooley didn't have a dog.*

*He grabbed the phone with one hand and a golf club with the other. When he dialed 911 he got a message that the number was not in service. The barking was getting louder. Long-nailed paws clicked on the stairs. How was there a dog in the house? Had one of the doors been left open and some stray wandered inside? Had some pet-loving thug decided to bring Rover along while doing a home invasion?*

*The barks dwindled to a long, ugly growl. A low canine shadow stretched across the floor. Bobby dropped the phone and gripped the five iron with both hands. The dog entered the room.*

*The animal was like something out of a veterinarian’s nightmare. Long-bodied but short-legged with eyes the color of milk and teeth the color of rotten wood. It had no fur, just leprous, exposed skin that crawled with bloated parasites. When it saw Bobby its growl took on a leering quality. Its tail began to wag and with each wag it sprayed rivulets of shit along the walls. The ID tag on its collar was large and instead of a name it had an engraving of a cruel-looking owl.*

*I can't be sure but I like to imagine Bobby thought something along the lines of No Fucking Way before he brought the golf club down hard onto the dog, splitting it's skull with a sound that reminded him of an overfull garbage bag splitting open.*

*Once he was sure the animal was dead Bobby ran past it and headed for the stairs. Whatever was happening around here he'd feel safer dealing with it from a distance. All his family pictures had been turned upside down. Now he was panicked and sad, this was a five bedroom house but he lived here alone. The Marines had taught Bobby Dooley that respect was more important than love but his wife and children never quite understood the lesson.*

*Things were even louder on the first floor, the blender was running, the microwave was beeping, the dishwasher door was open and water was gurgling out. He grabbed his car keys and turned to go but then he saw the TV was on in the parlor. The sight of it stopped Bobby in his tracks because somehow his copy of the Kim Kardashian sex tape was playing but impossibly at the same time so was the Barney the Dinosaur DVD he kept on hand for when his grandkids came to visit. Old Barney was really giving it to Kim, thrust after joyful purple-hued thrust.*

*A growl startled Bobby. The dog came bounding down the stairs, brains and loose teeth spilling from its head. Bobby screamed and ran, slamming the door closed behind him. His heart was pounding in his chest, his vision was marked with white dots.*

*Bobby got into his sports car. The dog came crashing through the front window of the house. (Just like I would weeks later.) Bobby gunned the engine and screeched out of his driveway.*

*The dog gave chase but quickly began to lag behind.*

*The neighborhood of Tate’s Corners was quiet and dark, Bobby hoped someone would see him and do something but everyone was probably in bed. He glanced into his rearview mirror to see that he had lost his pursuer.*

*He must have wondered if he was going crazy, he had to think that the strain of the Homeowner’s Association, the constant arguments and court orders, had driven him mad. He’d let dealing with Tom Palmer consume his time and money, was his sanity next? He decided to keep driving until he got to his ex-wife’s house. What would he say then? He didn’t know.*

*The sports car turned onto the ramp that led to the overpass that connected with the Northway. The hammering in his chest started to fade.*

*That was when the dog in the back seat started barking. Bobby Dooley swerved in panic and went right off the side of the overpass.*

*You might dismiss the fact that a trailer towing a heavy duty construction shredder had stalled out directly below the overpass as mere coincidence. You might even suggest the way the shredder turned itself on at the moment Bobby Dooley’s sports car landed in it as a mechanical failure. But how dear reader, how would you explain the dog collar the police found mixed in with the tatters of metal and flesh?*


**[THE NIGHT BLOGGER: A Season In Hell Episode Thirteen ‘The Devil's Platform’](http://albruno3.blogspot.com/2013/11/the-night-blogger-stories-are.html)**

...I know what you're thinking. You're thinking *Foster how could you know all that?* What you just read was a combination of witness interviews, traffic camera images, police and accident reports, footage stolen from Brian Dooley's own security system and in, some cases, complete and utter bullshit.

The thing is Brian Dooley's death wasn't the only one in Tate’s Corners, there had been all kinds of crazy deaths, all accidents, all gruesome and in every case a dog collar was found near the body. A dog collar with an owl engraved on it. There was one more coincidence tying all these deaths together, all the victims had been members of the local Homeowners Association.

How could I resist a story like that?

It didn't take much digging for me to find out that the five fatalities of Tate Corners had all come into conflict with one man; Tom Palmer. More research led to some even more troubling conclusions, apparently Mr. Palmer had been seen in the company of one Ashley Fowler, she of the red hair and men's suits. I only know Ms. Fowler by reputation, and the reputation is that she's beautiful, rich and she thinks she's the Devil.

Around 7:30 at night I was sitting in my car about a block from the Palmer residence; I was eating a kind of trail mix that had far too much candy in it to pass for healthy, and waiting for Jasper Moradi to show up. I know getting him involved breaks my number one rule of preternatural investigation but he asks all the damn time and truthfully I still feel guilty about punching him in the mouth. Yes, it was years ago and yes he had tried to kiss me but that's no excuse.

So, anyway I sent Jasper to Hobby Lobby to pick up some insurance for tonight but he was either taking his time or my debit card was maxed out. 

It was around about the time I was debating wasting gas and battery power so I could listen to the radio when a knock at the window startled me.

Tom Palmer was there, dressed in sweats and smiling pleasantly. He wore glasses and his hair was pulled back into an anemic looking ponytail. “Mr. Foster?” he said through the window, “I think we should talk.”

Sheepishly I got out of my car and followed him. What else could I do?

His house was a generic two story job with a big picture window in the front; the colors were tasteful and subdued, the landscaping was meticulous. It was the kind of place I was sure I would ever be able to afford. As he opened the door to lead me inside I saw he had something in his right hand. It was an empty dog collar.

“Did your pooch get away?” I asked.

He smiled thinly, “Please do come in.”

The inside of his house was as tasteful as the outside. Tom Palmer had no wife or kids, that meant the place was quiet. That also meant no witnesses if things got out of hand. He gave me a full tour of the place showing me every room and every toy he had. Then he brought me into his study; it had lots of books, a kick-ass sound system and autographed pictures of celebrities hanging on every wall. He threw the collar aside and sat down behind his wide oak desk. He gestured for me to sit down in the comfortable looking seat in front of it. We looked at each other for a moment, then I started talking, “I guess you know I'm something of a freelance reporter.”

“I know what you are,” he replied.

“*Metroland* has asked me to do an article on the pros and cons of Homeowners Associations,” I explained “and yours has been in the news a lot these days...”

“Those incidents have been blown out of proportion by a scandal hungry media,” he said.

“Are you saying you didn't fine Bobby Dooley multiple times for having a Marine Corps sticker on his car?”

He bristled, “That wasn't an ordinary sticker. It took up the entire rear window and as per the HOA bylaws it constituted an advertisement.”

I shrugged, “That seems kind of nitpicky.”

“What’s the point of rules if they’re not enforced?”

“Then of course there was the incident with Amanda Ward...”

“Her lawn statuary was in violation of the bylaws,” he threw up his hands, “I don’t see what’s so difficult to understand about this.”

I replied, “According to her she was singled out because her statuary was of a religious nature.”

“She ‘had’ a martyr complex,” Tom Palmer seemed to enjoy putting a particular emphasis on the word had. They were still trying to find out how she got caught in the gears of the pin reset machine of the Playdium Bowling Center.

“You couldn’t have been happy that she and Bobby Dooley were trying to unseat you from your position as leader of the HOA.”

“I would have abided by the vote of the committee, but it didn’t come to that did it?” He smirked.

I smirked back, “There are... Or should I say were, people that accused you of pushing an agenda.”

“My only interest is in making Tate’s Corners a thriving progressive community.”

“I thought the only thing Homeowners Associations were for was keeping the property values up.”

“I think the two go hand in hand and I am of the belief that glorifying post-modern Dominionist attitudes and the military industrial complex encourage attitudes and behaviors that attract the wrong elements. Even a lowly homeowner’s association can be a platform for change.” He stood up and crossed the room. There was a tall oak armoire against the left wall, “But enough chit chat, lets talk about you Mr. Foster. Let’s talk about your future.”

“According to my High School guidance councilor I don’t have much of one.”

He opened the doors of the armoire to reveal a little altar the centerpiece of which was a bronze statue of a cruel looking owl. “This,” he began, “is Molech.”

“OK,” I got to my feet, already making calculations about my chances to make a run for the door, “I guess that answers some suspicions of mine.”

“And we shall carry Molech our king,” he picked a dagger up off the altar, cut his palms and let the blood drip, “scorned by Solomon, bringer of the fortune and wisdom. Sacred Molech. Amen. Amen. Amen.”

“Why...” I paused, letting all this sink in, “Why are you doing all this for control of a local Homeowners Association?”

“If I change the reactionary attitudes of a single neighborhood I might in turn change the world,” he held up his bloodied hands, “Molech is a means to and end for me. A means for a better, more progressive community.”

“Aren’t you worried about Hell?” Crimson wetness was beading up on the carpet, “Damnation?”

“I don’t believe in all that claptrap,” he said, “I’m an atheist.”

“Then how can you reconcile any of this with your beliefs?”

“Molech is just another kind of life form, an alien intellect communicating and influencing humanity from afar,” Tom Palmer smiled, “he’s not some devil out of a children’s story.”

Now I was almost feeling sorry for him, “How can you be sure?”

“Because Molech told me so.”

Suddenly I didn’t feel sorry for him anymore.

“Do you believe in anything Mr. Foster?” He said, “Are you willing to forgo the joys of the here and now on the off chance there might be an afterlife?”

All I could do was shrug, “I’m not sure what I believe these days.”

“Ever since I learned you were poking around I did some investigations of my own.”

“Oh?”

“The vorvolaka has marked you. It’s only a matter of time now. I can help you,” he gestured to the altar splattering more blood, “we can help you.”

*Vorvolaka.* You can’t imagine how much I hate that ridiculous and terrible word. I felt a momentary twinge of temptation and let it pass, “Can I think about it?”

Tom Palmer sighed heavily, “I can tell you’ve already thought about it. Do you know what you are Mr. Foster?”

What I was, was out of there. I went barreling down the hallway. I wasn’t surprised to find the scurvy-ridden ruin of a dog waiting for me in the foyer. Old texts like *the Constantinople Document* called these things barghests. It was blocking my way to the door so I ran into the parlor. It snapped at me tearing at the back of my jacket. I threw myself out the picture window.

I hit the ground hard, broken glass landing all around me on the meticulous lawn. As I tried to raise myself up I heard Jasper Moradi shouting my name.

The barghest leapt out the gaping window. He would have landed right on me if not for Jasper pulling me roughly out of the way. I felt some part of my arm come loose with a pop but didn’t care. All I cared about was him getting me behind the line of statues before the monster could get me.

Yes, statues. Lawn statues to be precise. All the while I had been inside Tom Palmer’s house Jasper had been placing over three dozen statues of Jesus and the Virgin Mary in a circle around it in a display I’m sure the late Amanda Ward would have approved of.

And now I was outside that circle and the barghest was inside it. The creature paced back and forth on the front lawn but kept well away from the cheap plaster effigies.

“It’s real.” Jasper said with a kind of wonder, “It’s really real.”

I replied, “I think you really dislocated my shoulder.”

Then Tom Palmer was striding out the front door, the dagger was in his hand and there was no doubt in my mind that he meant to use it, “Oh you have got to be kidding me! Is this what you believe? That God and the angels are going to come down protect you?”

Jasper started manhandling me into the street where his car was double parked but he shouldn’t have bothered.

It all came down to a paving stone, just a single loose paving stone. Tom Palmer’s toe caught the edge of it and he landed right on his face.

And his knife.

“Karma’s a bitch.” I said to no one in particular, “That’s what I believe”...

+

*...there you have it. The Police found no sign of the Devil dog, just an empty leash. The crazy deaths stopped with Tom Palmer and the Tate’s Corners Homeowner’s Association voted to disband shortly afterwards.* 

*Did Tom Palmer find oblivion or Hell waiting for him when he died? Your guess is as good as mine all I can say is that in this humble blogger’s opinion he sold his soul very cheaply.*

*Hopefully, if and when the vorvolaka comes, I won’t make the same mistake.*

Pretending_To_Care,2,8,1r6wgf,14,"It was around 1am, when Steve and I stumbled upon the railroad tracks that lead out of our small village. 

""You know, about two miles down the track, there's an old church that's been abandoned. I hear it's a place for Devil worship."" Steve was grabbing a branch just off to the side of the track. 

""Fuck that."" I snapped. 

""Chicken shit?"" Steve smiled. 

""No! I just don't think it's a good idea. Rick said he'd been there during the day with Alan, and there was blood all over the place and a stick that had been used to stab something.""

""How would he know that?""

""There was blood on it.""

""Well look, I've got a stick! How's about I stab anyone if they get near. Or you, for being a pussy."" Steve began jabbing towards me like some sort of fencing opponent. 

""Fine, we can go, but you lead the way, big man."" I agreed. 

We hiked down the tracks for about an hour and a half, maybe longer if you count the couple times we stopped so Steve could smoke from his pipe. The church was in sight. 

As we got closer, we notice a faint light pouring out of the broken door at the front of the church. When we were within twenty or so feet from the side of the church when we crouched behind some trees in the woods. 

""Do you hear that!?"" Steve gasped. 

""Hear what?""

""That chanting.""

We fell silent for a few seconds, but in turn were met with more silence. Nothing. 

""Look, let's creep around front and see if we can get a look inside."" Steve was already headed toward the front before I could object. 

It's a surprise that if anyone were inside, they didn't hear us. Steve was stepping on every stick his feet could've found.

As we placed our backs against the wall of the church, we could hear shuffling against its concrete floor, then silence again. 

Steve leaned over to me ""Right, on three, we both take a quick look... One, two... three.""

We probably should have booked it as soon as we saw what was inside, but shock had totally frozen us in place. 

Upon looking inside, we were met with the dead stare of about thirty fully cloaked people. They knew we were there, and they just stared at us. Behind them was a bloodied lamb, and beside it, a man holding a stick.

Now I'm no expert, but I thought sacrifices were conducted with a blade. NOT by gouging what must have been a couple dozen holes in the body of your sacrifice. 

""Jesu- Oh my God man, fucki- RUN!""

We ran as fast as we could for about ten minutes before I pleaded Steve to wait for me. I couldn't run any more. I had to catch my breath. 

""What... the FUCK was THAT!?"" Steve gasped. 

""I, don't know. You fucking idiot. I told you we shouldn't have gone anywhere near that fu-"" I stopped abruptly.

Behind us was a mob of people carrying flashlights.

""Get down!"" I gasped. 

We laid silently in the dark of the woods for what seemed like forever. We kept our heads down, trying not to breathe. The only indication about where they were was from the lights they carried, and then the worst possible thing that could've happened, did.

In succession, all the lights that were just on, went off. We were blanketed in darkness with this group of men, no more than thirty feet away. We only heard the crackling of branches and the shuffling of leaves for the next few seconds before we heard a voice nearby, grumble a faint ""We have seen you. Come out.""

I couldn't see Steve, but I knew what had happened. Steve bolted off further into the woods, snapping their attention right at us. I could hear him sulking as he ran harder and harder, but they were catching him. I remained silently on the ground as they disappeared. 

I must have laid there, not making a noise for fifteen minutes. What just happened? I was worried sick about Steve. They got him, I just had this feeling, they got him. 

Eventually, I crept my way back home and snuck into my room without waking my parents. I contemplated waking them up to tell them what happened for a while, before I broke down and did exactly that. Sort of. 

At this point, it was around 6am, and dad was getting ready for work. I told him that Steve and I were in the woods and we got spooked by an animal and lost each other running, so I just came home. I told him I was worried Steve might have gotten hurt and that we should call to see if he was okay. My dad is a sharp man, and knew something was up, but didn't question me. He just nodded his head and said ""Okay. ""

We contacted Steve's mother, who confirmed that, surprisingly, Steve was home. After a few more minutes, my dad concluded their phone conversation and reassured me Steve was okay. 

Around noon, I drove over to Steve's house to check in on him. When I got there, he signaled me to follow him up to his room. 

""They know who we are."" He said. ""As I was running, they yelled my name at me. These people, they know who we are.""

I froze.

""If they know who we are, then they live in our village.""

""Exactly, we-..."" Steve stopped himself. ""What do we do?"" He asked. 

""I don't know.""",The Church (Part 1),22
